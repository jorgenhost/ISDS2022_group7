Macco is mostly right on tax claim, but off base on how Evers sought to raise them
","Come Tax Day in April, Wisconsin GOP lawmakers were eager to remind their constituents what they’d done for them in the most recent state budget.  Several took to Twitter to praise the tax cut at the heart of the most recent Republican-written budget, including Rep. John Macco, R-Ledgeview.  But he did so with a twist.  ""In honor of #TaxDay, I remind you that Governor Evers wanted to increase your taxes by $1 billion just for heating your homes,"" he tweeted April 18, 2022. ""Instead, Republicans cut your taxes by more than $2 billion.""  We’ve rated a few similar iterations of this claim, and generally, they’ve checked out. But what does heating have to do with it?  Not a lot, it turns out.  Macco is correct that Evers, a Democrat, sought to raise taxes by $1 billion. A caveat: The governor proposed a net increase of about $1 billion with his plan that would have raised taxes on businesses and the wealthy while providing tax breaks to lower and middle classes.  Still, an increase is an increase. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated that claim True on April 6, 2021. He’s also right that Republicans were able to deliver a more than $2 billion tax cut — the largest in state history.  Another caveat there: Between the time when Evers released his budget plan and when the Republicans passed theirs, state officials found out Wisconsin would take in $4.4 billion more in additional tax collections than previously anticipated. That’s a lot of money that Evers didn’t have available to him when he wrote his budget proposal. And, important to note, Evers signed the budget, which was needed to put the cut in effect. But again, the Republican-written budget did deliver the tax cut.  In September 2021, we rated Mostly True this claim, from state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills: ""Evers wanted to raise your taxes by $1 billion in a pandemic. Republicans stopped him and delivered the largest tax CUT in state history."" So what does heating residents’ homes have to do with Evers’ plan to raise taxes?  We tried to reach Macco to ask him precisely what he was getting at, but his office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  In a scan of the governor’s proposed budget, it appears he may have been referring to Evers’ plan to increase the amount of revenue that utilities would contribute to the Focus on Energy program, bringing in an additional $100 million. Even so, Macco makes it sound like Evers’ entire plan for tax increases rested on that. In reality, the governor sought to increase taxes using other measures, like scaling back a law that allows manufacturers to avoid paying state income taxes and increasing taxes on capital gains for people who earn $400,000 a year or more.  That part of the claim clearly misses the mark.  Macco claimed that Evers wanted to increase Wisconsinites’ taxes by $1 billion ""just for heating your homes,"" but instead, Republicans delivered a more than $2 billion tax cut.  The general thrust of the claim is accurate, and similar to claims PolitiFact Wisconsin has rated in the past.  But his comment about heating homes doesn’t fit.  Our definition for Half True is a statement that is ""partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here. ",/factchecks/2022/may/06/john-macco/macco-mostly-right-tax-claim-base-how-evers-sought/

No credible reports indicate that Starlink was used in Russian ship attack
","The Starlink satellite-based internet service, from Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has made it possible for vital services in Ukraine to maintain connectivity in the midst of war. But a social media post cites information from a fake website to claim that the satellite service was part of an attack on the Moskva, a Russian ship that later sank. ""Space X’s Starlink internet constellation has angered Russia as it was reported that the Starlink satellite constellation was used to guide the fire on Moskva,"" the April 30 post on Facebook said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post links to a story on a site called BAP News — with a fabricated ""about us"" section and fake contact information. The ""about us"" section is in Latin (while the rest of the website is in English) and the contact information includes a phone number that is (123) 456-7890. That BAP News story says Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, ordered that Starlink be destroyed after the Moskva attack. News reports have detailed how the Starlink service is being deployed in Ukraine — including serving as a link to drones used by Ukraine for artillery strikes. But there are no credible government or media reports that the Starlink satellite service was used to facilitate the attack on the Russian ship Moskva. The few online reports that mention Starlink in connection with the ship attack and Medvedev’s ordering of the destruction of Starlink are not from credible sources. The claim about Medvedev originated on a fake website that falsely claimed to be the official site of United Russia, a Russian political party, according to reporting by IXBT, a Russian website that reports on the IT sector. The fake website now appears to have been disabled. Medvedev posted on Telegram on April 16 that the destruction of the satellites was ""a fresh idea, thanks."" He added, ""It is too early to fulfill, but if there is such a request, we will consider it,"" adding an emoji crying tears of joy. The Moskva was the flagship of the Russian fleet, and when it sank, Russia said it was because of an accidental fire that ignited ammunition onboard. But ""U.S. officials corroborated assertions by Ukraine’s military that the Moskva was taken down by two Ukrainian Neptune missiles,"" the New York Times reported. The Neptune missile ""is fitted with an active radar-seeker"" that guides it in flight, and the Ukrainian system for the missiles includes launch vehicles and associated search radar, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British research institute. The Starlink service, meanwhile, ""uses terminals that resemble TV dishes equipped with antennas and are usually mounted on roofs to access the Internet via satellite in rural or disconnected areas,"" the Washington Post reported. Starlink launched its internet service in Ukraine in late February, just six weeks before the Moskva was attacked. A Facebook post says, ""Space X’s Starlink internet constellation has angered Russia as it was reported that the Starlink satellite constellation was used to guide the fire"" on the Russian ship Moskva. But there are no credible government or media reports that indicate the Starlink service was involved in the attack on Moskva. The claim that a Russian official ordered the destruction of the Starlink satellite service originated on a fraudulent website.

JFK Jr. died over 20 years ago — he is not a QAnon leader
","Some conspiracy theorists have held the belief that John F. Kennedy, Jr., an attorney and the son of President John F. Kennedy, is alive and is working with the QAnon movement, which holds that Democrats and public figures are a part of a Satan-worshiping, pedophilic occult.  Baseless as it is, the theory is that Kennedy is undercover and acting as Q, the anonymous leader who for years posted cryptic messages to ""out"" Democrats and claimed to unveil a deep state plot against former President Donald Trump. But there are changing stories about who Kennedy supposedly disguises himself as. A May 3 Facebook post said he’s masquerading as Juan O. Savin, a prominent promoter of the QAnon movement. ""JOHN & JUAN,"" the post says before enumerating all the ways it claims the two men are similar: ""Both sit the same (cross legged). Same height. Same voice modality. Same age. Both publishers. Both aviators. Both masters of disguise. Both independently wealthy. Both well connected. Both know the LAW. John signed his name ‘Juan Kennedy’ when he was younger. HMMMMMM  ‘Quriouser & Quriouser.’"" Facebook flagged the post in an effort to combat misinformation on its platform. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In truth, it’s not that curious: Kennedy died more than 20 years ago.  He was flying a plane along with his wife and sister-in-law in 1999 when it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near Martha’s Vineyard. Kennedy, along with his wife Carolyn Bessette, were cremated and buried at sea. In November 2021, undeterred by Kennedy’s confirmed death, hundreds of QAnon supporters gathered in Dallas under the false belief that he would return before eventually trickling away when he did not. Some QAnon believers claim that Kennedy had similar facial features to Savin. Vice reported that a book published under Savin’s name disclosed that his real name is Wayne Willott. Savin made a rare public appearance at a QAnon conference called For God And Country Patriot Double Down, where he made claims of a globalist plan to depopulate the earth.   We’ve fact checked similar claims and found no evidence to support it.

Do Republicans want to throw doctors who break abortion laws in jail? Their plans say yes
","The day after the leak of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion reversing Roe v. Wade, the National Republican Senatorial Committee sent lawmakers and candidates suggested talking points on abortion. The May 3 guidance advised Republicans to show compassion for pregnant women, criticize Democratic positions, and emphasize ""the facts"" about Republican policies. One of those facts was: ""Republicans DO NOT want to throw doctors and women in jail. Mothers should be held harmless under the law."" We focused on the comittee’s statement about not wanting to throw doctors in jail because Republican-controlled states have included prison sentences for doctors in recently passed laws that restrict abortion. (The risk of prison for mothers is less clear.) In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill April 14 that, with some exceptions, bans abortions after 15 weeks. Doctors that violate the law are guilty of a third-degree felony. That carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. On April 12, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill that increased the penalties for abortion. The key section said, ""A person convicted of performing or attempting to perform an abortion shall be guilty of a felony punishable by a fine not to exceed $100,000, or by confinement in the custody of the Department of Corrections for a term not to exceed 10 years.""  On June 16, 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the Human Life Protection Act. It prohibits any abortion, except to save the life of the mother or prevent the ""substantial impairment of a major bodily function."" Under the new law, a person performing an abortion faces a minimum penalty of five years in prison. The maximum penalty is life. Alabama’s Gov. Kay Ivey signed a bill that banned abortion, with few exceptions, on May 15, 2019. A federal judge put the law on hold, but under it, a person performing an abortion faces at least 10 years and as many as 99 years in prison. In each state, Republicans control both legislative chambers, as well as the governor’s office. The list continues. Over a dozen states have ""trigger"" laws that would take effect if the court overturns Roe v. Wade. Additional states have penalties in their current abortion laws. To the four Republican-controlled states listed above, we can add Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming. In each state, a doctor found guilty of breaking the law faces a possible, or in some cases, a mandatory prison sentence. Sen. Rick Scott, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, himself co-sponsored a bill in Congress, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, that would impose a prison sentence of up to five years. The proposal was sponsored or  co-sponsored by 44 other Republican members of the U.S. Senate. When Scott was Florida governor, he signed a 2013 bill that imposed a maximum penalty of a year in jail for violating the state’s new abortion law. When asked for supporting information about the treatment of doctors in Republican states, the National Republican Senatorial Committee sent none. In a memo to Republican candidates and lawmakers, the National Republican Senatorial Committee said that Republicans do not want to throw doctors in jail for violating abortion laws. Many Republican-controlled states have penalties for people who perform illegal abortions that include prison sentences, including a maximum of life imprisonment. In the U.S. Senate, a proposal with a potential prison sentence was co-sponsored by nearly the entire Republican caucus.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

Pfizer did not ‘hide’ hiring of 2,400 people to handle expected increase of vaccine-related health
","An April 2021 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine document released by the Food and Drug Administration continues to be taken out of context. This time the focus is on employees the company hired to manage adverse events. ""Pfizer tries to hide 2.4K full-time hires handling vax injuries,"" says a video from One America News Network, a conservative cable news service. In the clip, Matt Staver, founder of religious legal organization Liberty Counsel, claims that ""Pfizer and FDA together hid the true scale of COVID vaccine injuries from the public."" The clip was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We have fact-checked false claims that Pfizer hid COVID-19 vaccine safety information from the public. This latest claim says Pfizer hid the number of employees they hired to deal with vaccine injuries. We’ll focus on how and when Pfizer’s hiring was reported, but first, the description of vaccine ""injuries"" is misleading. Pfizer staff had to respond to adverse event reports, which are not the same as verified vaccine injuries. Adverse events can be submitted by anyone without requiring proof that they were caused by the vaccine. While Pfizer did hire more employees to process adverse event reports, this was to meet the demands of processing an influx of unvetted reports expected from administering millions of vaccine doses around the world at roughly the same time. The Pfizer document mentioned in these claims is an April 30, 2021, analysis of adverse event reports related to the COVID-19 vaccine collected from Dec. 1, 2020, to Feb. 28, 2021. In November 2021, the FDA, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request about adverse event reports, released this document with redacted details of Pfizer’s activities. Those details included numbers on new hires and expected hires dealing with adverse events and the quantity of shipped doses. These numbers were originally redacted because they fell under a FOIA exemption for trade secrets and commercial or financial information that are considered privileged or confidential. The group that made the FOIA request was Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency, a collective that says its aim is to ""obtain and disseminate the data relied upon by the FDA to license COVID-19 vaccines."" Its members include a number of people known to have spread misinformation around COVID-19. In April 2022, the group posted an unredacted version of Pfizer’s activities that included the staffing numbers. When we asked the FDA when and why an unredacted document was later made available, a representative told us that they ""cannot comment on potential, pending, or ongoing litigation."" The group that shared the documents did not respond to our inquiries. Just because these documents were released by a FOIA request does not mean that Pfizer or the FDA were nefariously withholding important information from the public. The FDA is legally prohibited from disclosing the existence of new drug applications until approval. The FDA approved Pfizer’s vaccine for people ages 16 and older in August 2021. When we reached out to OANN for a response, they emailed a since-removed press release from Liberty Counsel titled ""Pfizer Tried To Hide the Hiring of 2,400 Employees To Handle Adverse Events."" They also forwarded a link to an interview with conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf reiterating similar claims about the Pfizer document. While OANN noted in their email that Wolf and her team submitted the original FOIA request, she is not listed as a member on the Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency website. Pfizer did not offer on-the-record comment for this fact-check. Adverse event case volumes for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole were already increasing prior to the pandemic, driven in part by greater public awareness of adverse event reporting systems like VAERS. A November 2020 white paper by pharmacovigilance solutions company MyMeds&Me anticipated a significant spike in adverse event report loads across the entire pharmaceutical industry due to COVID-19 vaccine campaigns. It cited increased public interest with the COVID-19 vaccines and the fact that large numbers of people will be vaccinated simultaneously. As noted by Pfizer's document, adverse event reports are manually reviewed after receipt. The document states that the company ""onboarded approximately 600 additional full-time employees"" with ""an expected total of more than 1,800 additional resources by the end of June 2021"" to meet the increased case processing load. The company had shipped more than 126 million doses of the vaccine worldwide between December 2020 and February 2021. Given that both patients and health care providers are encouraged to submit adverse event reports even if they aren't sure about causality, and that the COVID-19 vaccine had been under intense public scrutiny even before it was authorized for emergency use in adults, it follows that more employees would be needed to ensure that an influx of adverse event reports could be processed expeditiously. The CDC, American Medical Association, and American Academy of Pediatrics, among other major health care professional organizations, all recommend vaccines as safe and effective ways to protect against COVID-19 infection in both children and adults. A One America News Network clip claims that Pfizer tried ""to hide"" the hiring of 2,400 employees to play down the extent of injuries caused by the COVID-19 vaccine. The clip, however, takes these hiring numbers out of context and misconstrues the adverse event reporting process. Pfizer submitted a document containing hiring information to the FDA. The FDA released the document in response to a public records request. The first version redacted staffing numbers. A later version included the numbers. Staffing numbers can be treated as proprietary information under federal transparency rules. Onboarding more people to manage an influx of adverse event reports does not equate to an increase in verified injuries caused by the vaccine.

Yes, the Trump justices said Roe v. Wade was a precedent in confirmation hearings
","Rep. Don Beyer of Northern Virginia is among the many Democrats disappointed by a draft opinion showing the U.S. Supreme Court has tentatively voted to strike down its 49-year-old Roe v. Wade decision establishing a right to an abortion. ""Thinking about the many times Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett assured the Senate Judiciary Committee and the American people that Roe was ‘established precedent.’"" Beyer tweeted May 2. ""I didn’t believe them, but they said it under oath."" A fact-check shows that the three justices nominated by former President Donald Trump — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — did say in confirmation hearings that Roe is an important precedent.  Barrett and Gorsuch qualified their remarks, however. Barrett said she did not regard Roe as a ""superprecedent,"" a subjective term for ""constitutional decisions in which public institutions have heavily invested, repeatedly relied and supported over a significant period of time."" Gorsuch did not give a direct answer when asked whether he considered Roe a superprecedent.  Kavanaugh, during his hearing, was not asked whether he regarded Roe as a superprecedent. He did say, however, that he would be open to arguments that a precedent is wrong. Let’s take a look at the sworn testimony of the three justices at their confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Gorsuch, in 2017, declined to say whether he thought Roe had been correctly decided. ""I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court,"" he said. Gorsuch added that the high court ""reaffirmed"" the decision in 1992 with its Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling, which barred states from imposing an ""undue burden"" on getting an abortion. ""Casey is settled law,"" Gorsuch said while adding the qualification, ""in the sense that it is a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court."" Gorsuch didn’t say yes or no when asked if Roe is a superprecedent. ""It has been reaffirmed many times. I can say that,"" he said. Kavanaugh, in 2018, said Roe ""is settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, entitled the respect under principles of stare decisis. And one of the important things to keep in mind about Roe v. Wade is that it has been reaffirmed many times over the past 45 years, as you know, and most prominently, most importantly, reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992."" Kavanaugh called the Casey decision a ""precedent on precedent,"" a reaffirmed status he compared to that of Miranda rights. ""Even though [former] Chief Justice (William) Rehnquist, by the way, had been a fervent critic of Miranda throughout his career, he decided that it had been settled too long, had been precedent too long, and he reaffirmed it,"" Kavanaugh said. But under questioning from Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., Kavanaugh said precedent shouldn’t always be followed. ""I listen to all arguments. You have an open mind. You get the briefs and arguments, and some arguments are better than others. Precedent is critically important. It is the foundation of our system. But you listen to all arguments."" As a private citizen, Barrett signed a newspaper ad in 2006 saying it was ""time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.""  During her 2020 hearing, she declined to say whether she thought Roe had been properly decided. Barrett said she did not want to specifically comment on cases that might come before her. Barrett said, ""precedent is a principle that you’re not going to overrule something without good reason or roll up the law without justification for doing so."" She said she did not consider Roe to be a superprecedent. ""Roe does not fall within that category, but that does not mean that Roe should be overruled,"" Barrett said. ""Roe is a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled to respect under the doctrine of stare decisis."" Beyer said, ""Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett assured the Senate Judiciary Committee and the American people that Roe v. Wade was ‘established precedent.’"" Beyer’s statement about the judges — all of whom support a draft Supreme Court ruling that would overturn Roe — is correct, but comes with a caveat. While all three paid homage to precedence and described Roe as such during their confirmation hearings, none said precedents are untouchable or that Roe was cast in stone. When asked whether they considered Roe to be a ""superprecedent,"" Barrett said no and Gorsuch didn’t answer directly. Kavanaugh, under questioning from an anti-abortion senator, said he would be willing to hear arguments that a precedent is wrong.

Ron DeSantis exaggerates outstanding graduate student loan debt
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis opposes President Joe Biden's willingness to explore additional student debt forgiveness, saying that it would primarily benefit people who earned advanced degrees. ""The student debt that is out there, almost 60% of it is graduate school debt,"" DeSantis said at a press conference on April 29. ""Why would you make a truck driver, or a waitress, or a construction worker pay off the debt for somebody that did a Ph.D. program in gender studies?""

As a presidential candidate, Biden promised to forgive all undergraduate student debt for people earning up to $125,000. More recent discussions have involved providing up to $10,000 in student debt relief for people earning up to $125,000. Because the proposal is still very much up for debate, it’s unclear whether the debt relief would be tied to income.  We follow the facts and share what we learn so you can make your own decisions. Support our mission today.  Still, DeSantis’ claim that ""almost 60%"" of outstanding student debt comes from graduate school is overstated. DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw referenced an article from the Poynter Institute for Media Studies (which owns PolitiFact).  The article centered on how Biden could move to relieve student loan debt and cited the Brookings Institution, which said, ""56% of the outstanding student debt is owed by households that hold graduate degrees."" The key distinction is that the Brookings data focused on households with debt.  Many households have undergraduate debt even though someone in the household also has a graduate degree. It doesn’t mean that all the debt held was spent on graduate school.  ""Assuming that all student loans in a household are graduate school debt if anybody in the household has a graduate degree significantly overstates the amount of graduate school debt,"" Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert, told PolitiFact.  The Congressional Budget Office looked at the student debt picture in 2017. Of $1.4 trillion in total debt, CBO said, about 60% was spent during undergraduate school. The remaining 40% of outstanding student loan debt was spent during graduate school. So, DeSantis has it almost exactly backward. A majority of the federal student loan dollars disbursed during the 2020-21 school year were borrowed by undergraduate students, per a report from College Board, a nonprofit education group.  According to the College Board, 55% of bachelor’s degree recipients graduated with debt, holding an average debt level of more than $25,000. Though an undergraduate student, on average, borrows less money than their graduate school counterparts, the pool of people seeking a graduate education is far smaller. DeSantis said ""almost 60%"" of student loan debt ""is graduate school debt."" He’s got it backward. About 60% of the outstanding student loan debt came from undergraduate school, according to a 2017 analysis from the Congressional Budget Office. On average, graduate students borrow more money than their undergraduate counterparts, but more people pursue undergraduate degrees. DeSantis’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Abortion', 'Corrections and Updates', 'Supreme Court', 'Jeffrey Toobin']","
Sometimes SCOTUS leaks happen, but a leaked majority opinion draft is new
","A leaked 98-page draft of a Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that recognized the constitutional right to an abortion in 1973, shocked members of the public and seasoned Supreme Court watchers, alike.  Just an hour after Politico broke the story, CNN’s chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin stressed the seemingly unprecedented nature of the leak on the air.  ""I can’t emphasize enough, as someone who has covered this court for 30 years, who’s written two books on the court, there has never been a leak anything like this,"" he said. ""There’s never been a leak of a vote — much less an actual opinion, much less in a case of this significance.""  ""There has never been a leak of a vote, much less an actual opinion, much less in a case of this significance,"" @JeffreyToobin says. He calls it a ""shattering experience for the justices"" and says ""I really don't know how the institution is going to recover."" pic.twitter.com/ndkFO9vq0u The court has not issued a final decision that would overturn Roe, but Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed on May 3 that the draft opinion was authentic. In the same statement, he ordered the Supreme Court marshal to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.  Roberts described the leak as an ""egregious breach of trust"" and a ""betrayal of the confidences of the court"" in violation of court employees’ longstanding ""tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial process.""  Supreme Court leaks are rare, but not as wholly unprecedented as Toobin’s initial claim might suggest. A Supreme Court clerk, for example, leaked the original Roe ruling to a Time magazine reporter, resulting in an article about the decision hitting newsstands hours before the court officially announced its ruling. Still, Lucas Powe Jr., a Supreme Court historian and professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said that he could count the number of significant Supreme Court leaks ""probably without going to a second hand to get more fingers.""  He said he’d been wracking his brain for examples, but ""to the best of my knowledge, there’s never been a leak like this one.""  What sets the most recent leak apart is its timing, content and scope, experts said. The draft, which was dated February 2022, is prospective and the opinion isn’t expected to be officially released for more than a month, said Jonathan Peters, a media law professor at the University of Georgia who has studied and written about the history of Supreme Court leaks. ""Anything can happen in that intervening time,"" Peters said. Peters said he could only think of one other time in modern history that the draft of an opinion reached a member of the press before the opinion was released.  That happened in 1981, when UPI reporter Elizabeth Olson obtained a document that ""appeared to show, in advance, the outcome of a sex discrimination case,"" Peters said. Olson wrote a story about it, but UPI’s Washington bureau chief chose not to run it on grounds that the organization couldn’t confirm the document’s authenticity. ""When he (the bureau chief) was later asked about it, he characterized the document as eight pages, unsigned, undated and what appeared to be a dissenting opinion,"" Peters explained. ""He said it came into Olson’s possession accidentally and that it was attached, mistakenly, to other material that the court had distributed to Olson."" But even that scenario differed from the May 2 leak in the Mississippi abortion case: ""It was not a full draft of a majority opinion, and ultimately, it was not publicly released,"" Peters said.  In the early history of the court, intentional leaks were more common, Peters said. In the 19th century, justices seemed more actively interested in what the press had to say about decisions, he said.  ""The justices were also trying to shape news coverage of the court and public opinion of the court,"" Peters said. ""One of the ways that they occasionally did that was through opinion releases."" Today, when the Supreme Court releases a decision, the opinion is announced orally in the courtroom and simultaneously released by the public information office and on the Supreme Court website as a PDF. In the mid-1800s, decisions were read from the bench, but the full opinions were printed and released later. In 1857, when the court was handing down the Dred Scott v. Stanford decision that ruled people who had been enslaved could not be American citizens, the two dissenting justices released their dissenting opinions to the press before the court released its majority opinion, Peters said.  ""Then, in response to public reaction, the Chief Justice actually revised his opinion before he had it printed and released,"" Peters said. Neither of those examples mirrored exactly what happened with the most recent leak, so Peters said he thinks it is fair to say that the public release of a draft majority opinion is unprecedented. Powe, who said he’d been stunned by the leak since he heard the news, agreed: ""There’s just never been a leak of a full opinion.""  Peters added that there are ""numerous cases"" in the court’s history, particularly in the 1970s, where case outcomes were leaked to the press before the decisions were announced, but he emphasized that leaks are the exception, not the rule. (The original Roe ruling leak is one such example, but there are others.)  Then, Time magazine published a story about Roe v. Wade before the court announced it, reporting the outcome and the vote. Infuriated, Burger demanded a meeting with Time’s editors, chastising them for scooping the court. Retrospective leaks answering questions about the inside deliberations have happened as well. In 2012, for example, CBS reported that Chief Justice John Roberts had initially sided with the conservatives before switching his vote to side with the liberal justices to uphold the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.  More recently, CNN’s Joan Biskupic in 2020 produced a series of stories relying on unnamed sources that provided a ""deeply-reported account of how the justices decided the most controversial cases of that term,"" Peters said.  Toobin, for his part, told PolitiFact that, since he made his initial comments to CNN, he has modified how he characterizes the leak, not repeating the part about there not having been leaks of votes. ""There have been very occasional leaks of votes,"" Toobin said, and sometimes those leaks turned out to be incorrect. But he stood by the thrust of his observation that this one stands apart.  There has never been anything, he said, like ""the leak of a full opinion in a very major case, weeks in advance of the release of the actual decision."" Toobin said there has never been a Supreme Court leak ""anything like this. There’s never been a leak of a vote — much less an actual opinion, much less in a case of this significance.""

Elon Musk’s false claim that NBC News covered up Hunter Biden laptop story
","Billionaire Elon Musk, who says his offer to purchase Twitter is based on his desire to protect free speech, tweeted an unfounded accusation about NBC News’ coverage of Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s son. Musk tweeted on May 2 that NBC News ""covered up"" the story about Hunter Biden’s laptop. It was his response to remarks by Mehdi Hasan, an NBC News show host who called Musk a ""petulant & not-so-bright billionaire"" and said Musk would hand over Twitter to the far-right. The laptop saga began in October 2020, when the New York Post reported that a computer that appeared to belong to Hunter Biden had been dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in 2019 and was shared with Rudy Giuliani, at that time the personal attorney to then-President Donald Trump. When the New York Post story was published, other news outlets were unable to verify the laptop’s existence or contents. NBC News reported in October 2020 that the reason it wasn’t providing in-depth coverage of the laptop story was simple: ""Most mainstream news organizations, including NBC News, have not been granted access to the documents (from the laptop). NBC News asked by email, text, phone call and certified mail, and was ultimately denied."" At that time, NBC News said its reporters were not given the kind of access that would have allowed them to verify the authenticity of the documents from the laptop. In March 2022, the New York Times and Washington Post both reported that emails from the laptop had been authenticated. Following those stories, NBC News also reported on new developments in a federal investigation of Hunter Biden, which involves documents from his laptop. But Musk did not include any of that context when tweeting a response to the remarks from NBC’s Hasan. Hasan, in the clip that Musk reacted to, said that a pro-QAnon, pro-neo-Nazi faction of the Republican Party is ""poised to expand dramatically"" after the 2022 midterm elections, and Trump also potentially could be re-elected president in 2024. If those things happen, Hasan said, ""we may look back on this ... as a pivotal moment, when a petulant & not-so-bright billionaire casually bought one of the most influential messaging machines & just handed it to the far-right,"" referencing Musk’s purchase of Twitter. Musk initially replied, ""NBC basically saying Republicans are Nazis …"" He then added, ""Same org that covered up Hunter Biden laptop story, had Harvey Weinstein story early & killed it & built Matt Lauer his rape office. Lovely people."" But NBC News reported in October 2020 that it had ""sought to obtain the documents on the alleged Hunter Biden laptop, but (had) been rebuffed."" The story noted that Giuliani’s attorney allowed an NBC News correspondent to review some of the materials in person, but that without taking possession of the documents, the news outlet was unable to conduct ""the sort of forensic analysis that might help authenticate the emails and documents."" NBC News’ 2020 story also said that while the documents from the laptop were alleged to show that Hunter Biden used his father’s influence to get lucrative business deals in Ukraine and China, ""the Wall Street Journal and Fox News — among the only news organizations that have been given access to key documents — found that the emails and other records don’t make that case."" Musk tweeted that NBC News ""covered up"" the story about Hunter Biden’s laptop. NBC News reported in 2020 that its reporters attempted to cover the laptop story but were not given the kind of access that would have allowed them to verify the authenticity of the documents from the laptop. NBC News said it was not among the select few news organizations that had been given access to key documents. NBC News said its lack of in-depth reporting in 2020 on the laptop was due to people in Trump's circle trying to limit access to the information. That’s not the same as covering up the story. Musk’s tweet gives the impression that NBC News had all the relevant information and chose not to disclose it, and that’s not accurate.

Jeanine Pirro wrongly says there are 63 million abortions per year in the U.S.
","Abortion rates and the number of overall abortion procedures have been declining in the U.S. over the last decade, data show. But if you were watching a May 3 segment of Fox News’ The Five, you might have walked away with a much different impression as Judge Jeanine Pirro dramatically overstated how many abortions are performed each year. ""And my stats that I have,"" she said, ""are that there are 63 million abortions a year in this country. Those are the stats that I heard. That’s a little too much!"" Indeed, in a nation where the U.S. Census shows the population of women considered to be of estimated child-bearing age (15 to 44) is about 64.5 million, that would be rather surprising. The actual estimated number of abortions performed in the U.S. each year is much lower than what Pirro claimed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 629,898 abortions occurred in 2019. The CDC collects data from state health departments that volunteer the information. This 2019 total does not include data from California, Maryland or New Hampshire. Approximately 862,320 abortions were reported in 2017, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that promotes reproductive health and abortion access. Guttmacher’s 2017 report is the organization’s most recent analysis of abortion data collected from health care facilities that perform the operation. The number of abortions performed each year has been steadily declining over the last decade, according to the Guttmacher Institute. From 2011 to 2014, the number of abortions conducted dropped by 6%. From 2014 to 2017, the number of abortions decreased another 7%. When PolitiFact reached out to Fox News for comment, a spokesperson said Pirro was referencing a Fox News article that reported 63 million abortions have occurred in the U.S. since the Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion nationwide. That’s a significant distinction Pirro did not make on the show; she said there were 63 million abortions ""a year."" The Fox News article cited an analysis by the National Right to Life Committee as the source for the 63 million estimated abortions over the last 49 years. The NRLC says it made this estimation based on data from the Guttmacher Institute and the CDC. The Guttmacher Institute told PolitiFact that it has not compiled the total number of legal abortions performed since 1973, but it has estimated the pregnancy, birth and abortion rates for women aged 15-44 from 1973 to 2017. On a May 2 Fox News segment, Pirro said, ""there are 63 million abortions a year in this country."" This claim vastly overstates the number of abortions conducted in the U.S. each year. The Guttmacher Institute reported there were roughly 862,320 abortions in 2017. CDC puts the 2019 figure at around 629,898. Pirro appears to have inaccurately referenced an estimation made by the NRLC that 63 million abortions have been performed since the Roe v. Wade decision was handed down in 1973.

The article is written by editor Jim Hoft, who uses testimony from True the Vote, a national conservative poll-watching organization founded in 2010 that has spread misinformation in the past, to make his case.  According to Hoft, the group testified to members of the Wisconsin Assembly that 7% of ballots left in ballot drop boxes in Wisconsin were ""likely fraudulent."" However, True the Vote told Wisconsin lawmakers that they aren’t alleging that the ballots were illegal, but that the process was abused.  Hoft takes True the Vote’s disputed claims of an abused process and goes further, saying that 7% of the ballots shouldn’t be counted.  Hoft subtracts 7% of each state’s total number of mail-in and early returned ballots from Biden’s total votes to come to the conclusion that Trump won.  In two hours of testimony in front of the Wisconsin Assembly’s Committee on Campaigns and Elections on March 24, True the Vote explained why they think that 7% of mail-in ballots were ""trafficked"" in Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, or collected by paid operatives and placed in drop boxes. They also allege that there were inaccurate voter rolls and other problems.  The group came to this conclusion by looking at location data from cell phone users who made repeat visits to drop boxes and to the headquarters of nongovernmental organizations that were engaged in get-out-the-vote efforts, as well as video surveillance. When asked by lawmakers, the group refused to identify the nongovernmental organizations.  But the Wisconsin Elections Commission said that cell phone data showing that people are repeatedly near a ballot drop box, alone, is not evidence of a crime.  Kenneth Mayer, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Hoft’s conclusions are ""fundamentally dishonest."" Mayer said that ""ballot harvesting"" is a pejorative term and implies fraudulent activity where none has been found.  ""From beginning to end, it’s a dishonest foundation,"" Mayer said. ""There’s no truth to any of it.""  Ballot collection or ""ballot harvesting,"" involves the gathering of absentee ballots from voters, sometimes by paid operatives, and delivering them to drop boxes or voting locations. The practice was permitted in Wisconsin in the 2020 election, though whether it can continue is the subject of a court case expected to be decided in June.  Wisconsin’s vote totals have been affirmed in multiple investigations.  The Associated Press investigated every potential case of voter fraud in six battleground states, including Wisconsin, and found that the disputed ballots represented just .15% of Biden’s margin of victory in those states. The article published in December found that the disputed ballots did not indicate any intent to rig the election, and that in ""virtually every"" case, individuals were acting alone to cast additional ballots.  Hoft did not respond to a message sent through his website.  A Gateway Pundit headline claims ""A STOLEN ELECTION: State totals minus illegal ballot trafficking numbers give President Trump decisive victories in AZ, GA, MI, PA, and WI.""  The blog post’s assertions rest on the testimony of True the Vote, a conservative poll-watching organization.

Current White House doctor did not call for Biden’s resignation
","Misinformers frequently share video clips of President Joe Biden with his actions or comments taken out of context — implying that he shakes hands with thin air, or portraying him as confused. Now, a social media post falsely suggests someone with official access to Biden’s medical information is calling for him to resign. ""White House physician demands Biden’s immediate resignation following his ‘obvious’ cognitive decline,"" says an April 30 post on Facebook.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post, which does not cite or link to a source for its claim, mischaracterizes who has called for Biden’s resignation. The current White House physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said in November that Biden is fit to carry out his duties. O’Connor’s assessment followed a full medical evaluation. There is no evidence, such as news reports, that O’Connor has expressed concern about Biden’s cognitive abilities. However, U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson, who was the White House physician under former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump and is now a Republican representing Texas’ 13th Congressional District, has called for Biden’s resignation, saying he has declined cognitively. Jackson was the subject of a years-long investigation by the Department of Defense, which found that he ""made ‘sexual and denigrating’ comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy on drinking alcohol on a presidential trip and took prescription-strength sleeping medication that prompted worries from his colleagues about his ability to provide proper medical care,"" the Associated Press reported in March 2021.

One such video appeared in an April 23 Facebook post, with a text overlay that falsely proclaimed: ""Paying taxes is optional!!""

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Despite long-standing claims to the contrary, paying your taxes isn’t voluntary or optional.  It’s required by U.S. law — a fact the Internal Revenue Service makes clear on its website.  ""Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code clearly imposes a tax on the taxable income of individuals, estates, and trusts,"" reads the site. ""Failure to pay taxes could subject the non-complying individual to criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, as well as civil penalties."" The law is just as direct. It breaks down each type of taxpayer — married individuals filing joint returns, heads of households, unmarried individuals and others who must pay taxes — and lists the tax imposed on each person based on their income. A subsequent section of the code says people ""shall pay such tax"" to the IRS when it is due. Choosing not to pay the taxes you owe could result in fines, criminal charges or your property being seized, among other things.  Tax evasion is a felony. Very few people go to jail for tax crimes, but it has happened. In 1931, mobster Al Capone was famously sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for tax evasion and prohibition charges. The IRS has a response to the ""straw man"" conspiracy, too: It won’t get you out of paying your taxes. It’s an old argument that the agency has been dismissing for more than 15 years. Promoters of the straw man conspiracy believe that along with every birth certificate and social security number issued, the U.S. government sets up a fake identity or corporate trust in a newborn’s name. As a result, that person’s rights — and their obligations, including tax bills — are split between the physical person and the ones assigned to the baby’s fake identity or corporate shell account — also called a ""straw man,"" by the theory’s supporters. ""These people argue that they’re not subject to U.S. laws or taxes because their tax bill is made out to a legal entity with a well-funded bank account that shares their name but isn’t actually them,"" explained a History.com article. ""If you’re confused,"" the article said, ""that’s because conspiracy theories don’t usually make sense."" The IRS said in 2005 that taxpayers ""cannot avoid income tax on the erroneous theory that the government has created a separate and distinct entity or ‘straw man,’ in place of the taxpayer and that the taxpayer is not responsible for the tax obligations of the ‘straw man.’""  ""The argument has no merit and is frivolous,"" read the IRS bulletin.

Did study show that 70% of veterans who committed suicide had THC in their system?
","Texas lawmakers this year voted to broaden the state’s medical marijuana program to include more qualifying conditions than just intractable epilepsy. Under the bill, which was signed into law, patients with several more conditions, including terminal cancers, autism and multiple sclerosis, will now be eligible to participate in the program. During a debate in the Senate over the proposal, state Sen. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, argued against including post-traumatic stress disorder in the bill. The disorder was ultimately not included in the bill that passed. ""A study was done, a post-mortem, so a retrospective study done, looking at autopsies and drug levels, what drugs were in the blood of veterans that committed suicide, and 70 percent had THC,"" Campbell said. We decided to take a look at Campbell’s claim to see if a study of this nature existed and whether there’s a connection between veterans, marijuana use and suicide. No signs of Campbell’s study Campbell’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. We searched far and wide but could not find a study with results matching those described by Campbell.  Several experts and advocates contacted for this piece said they were unaware of a study that reflected the findings Campbell described. Several studies examine the relationship between cannabis use and suicidal thoughts. Others have cross-referenced registry data on deaths attributed to suicide with the timing of the legalization of medical marijuana in the states where the suicides took place. Dr. Arpana Agrawal, professor of psychiatry at the Washington University School of Medicine who authored a study on cannabis and suicidal thoughts and behavior, said these types of studies have produced mixed results.  In her study, which enlisted identical twins, one of whom used cannabis more frequently and the other who used it lightly or not at all did not use it all or lightly, found that the twins that used cannabis more often were more likely to report suicidal thoughts and depression. While the data suggests that the association is unrelated to shared genetics and early environment, it does not necessarily mean that the effects of cannabis were the cause, she said. It could have been another risk factor, such as trauma. A 2016 study by CDC scientists that used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that the rate of suicidal thinking was more than nine times higher for veterans with drug problems than those without, with the majority involving marijuana abuse. The study noted, however, that other factors, such as coping with post-traumatic stress, managing chronic pain conditions related to war injuries, or adjusting to civilian life, could confound the association between the two.  What makes this subject so hard to study? Agrawal said one reason is that suicide is such a complex behavior with many aspects — from contemplation, to attempts (with or without a plan) to actual deaths. ""(Researchers) might have asked only of individuals who report experiencing depression, although suicidal thoughts and behaviors are not just limited to depression,"" Agrawal said. ""In studies of completed suicide, little may be known about the substance use history over and above a toxicology report."" Cannabis use and veterans Research also is lacking on cannabis use and suicide among veterans specifically. A study conducted by Safe States Alliance, an injury and violence prevention national nonprofit, in March 2018 used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Violent Death Reporting System to analyze U.S. veteran and armed forces deaths from suicide. The group’s study found that 9 percent of victims had marijuana in their system. It did not show whether a victim had more than one substance in their system. Sharon Gilmartin, deputy director of Safe States Alliance, said she wasn’t aware of a statistic like the one Campbell cited. Gilmartin also cautioned against interpreting her organization’s studies or others that include toxicology data as definitively linking marijuana to suicide because of the nature of THC. ""It’s not quite like alcohol where you have a certain BAC (blood alcohol content), and that directly links to impairment, then it goes away and you’re kind of back to sobriety more or less,"" Gilmartin said. ""When you think about THC, it’s a different dose-response relationship, and it also has a different latency period, so it stays in your blood long after you’re impaired."" There are also limitations to what such data can tell us, Agrawal said, because of that age-old statistical standard that ""correlation does not imply causation."" ""While such studies show a correlation, it is difficult to know from data at one time point whether cannabis use is a causal factor,"" Agrawal said. ""Veterans are more likely to report cannabis use and are also at risk for suicide. But that doesn't answer the question as to how the two are related."" For example, she said, people who are vulnerable to suicide might use cannabis more often to self-medicate; or people who use cannabis more heavily may report more suicidal thoughts; or alternatively, some other factor might influence the use of both cannabis and risk for suicide, such as trauma exposure. Our ruling Campbell suggested that cannabis plays a role in suicide among veterans, claiming that a study showed 70 percent of veterans who committed suicide had THC in their body. But the study Campbell cited doesn’t seem to exist. Some research does exist on this topic, but experts questioned the validity of drawing a conclusion about the connection between marijuana use and suicide generally — let alone among veterans.

Fact-checking an attack on Joe Biden about immigration deportation, detention votes
","Joe Biden says that President Donald Trump has a ""morally bankrupt re-election strategy"" that relies on ""vilifying immigrants.""  ""Under Trump, there have been horrifying scenes at the border of kids being kept in cages, tear-gassing asylum seekers, ripping children from their mothers’ arms — actions that subvert American values and erode our ability to lead on the global stage,"" he said in a Miami Herald op-ed before the June debate. But a viral essay by a Sen. Bernie Sanders supporter portrays Biden’s own record as extraordinarily harsh on illegal immigration. Among other claims, the essay says Biden ""voted to expand deportations and indefinite detention for immigrants multiple times.""  The essay by writer Weston David Pagano drew more than 120,000 interactions on Facebook and has a long list of criticisms of Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris and Beto O’Rourke.  We found that the essay refers to votes Biden took in 1996 to expand detention and deportation of immigrants. What the essay omits is that Biden’s record of supporting border enforcement puts him in line with other Democrats during his tenure. It’s only recently that some Democrats have promoted more lenient border policies amid reports about conditions at detention sites, such as abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement or severely curbing deportation. Biden, along with the vast majority of the Senate, voted for bills to make it easier to detain, and then deport, more immigrants. But calling it ""indefinite detention"" lacks context because the goal was ultimately deportation, not to keep massive numbers of immigrants detained with no end in sight. ""It really was a watershed moment in the expansion of detention system,"" said Donald Kerwin, director of the Center for Migration Studies. ""It had more to do with mandatory detention than indefinite detention."" The bills in question represented a pendulum swing one decade after President Ronald Reagan legalized the status of 1.7 million people. In 1996, the Democratic Party took a harsher stance against illegal immigration amid a rapid increase in arrivals and public opinion polls showing the majority of Americans wanted immigration levels to decrease.  The Senate approved tough immigration measures by large bipartisan majorities as Bill Clinton was running for re-election.  ""We are still dealing with the consequences of the laws passed in 1996,"" said Rick Su, an immigration law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. ""And Democrats, from Clinton to Biden, are still dealing with the legacy of supporting these bills today from critics on the left. But at that time, with the right-wing ascendency and popular anger, I think Democrats felt they needed to move rightward and act on these issues."" As a senator, Biden voted in favor of two key bills: the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act  and what ultimately became the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRAIRA, or ""ira ira""). They passed by overwhelming margins with bipartisan support. The antiterrorism bill, which passed about one year after the Oklahoma City bombing, gave the federal government more tools to combat terrorism, to limit death-row appeals and to make it easier to deport immigrants who had committed crimes. The latter bill called for mandatory detention and deportation of immigrants who were subject to deportation due to a criminal conviction, even if the offense happened years ago. Andrew ""Art"" Arthur, a former Immigration and Naturalization Service official and immigration judge, said the measure created expedited deportation, limited ways for relief and expanded the aggravated felony definition. ""It largely took away the rights for aliens who entered illegally to see an immigration judge prior to being removed,"" said Arthur, who is now a fellow for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. Combined, the laws led to a massive increase in deportations, wrote Princeton immigration experts Douglas Massey and Karen Pren. ""Prior to the mid 1990s the annual number of deportations had not exceeded 50,000 for decades, but with the passage of the 1996 legislation, this threshold was breached, and by the turn of the century deportations were running at just under 200,000 annually,"" they wrote. Peter Margulies, a Roger Williams University law professor, said there is no question that the laws increased deportation and detention as part of their main purpose. We heard agreement from other immigration law experts on that same point. The ACLU said the number of immigrants in detention rose from 8,500 in 1996 to nearly 16,000 in 1998.  Su said that the language in the 1996 law seemed to assume that removal would eventually happen for immigrants detained. ""What they were focused on was expediting and ensuring removal. The impetus was not ‘we want to indefinitely detain people,’"" he said. ""Indefinite detention"" isn’t a technical legal term in the 1996 laws, but it is a term that has been used in court decisions and news articles since then. In 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Zadvydas vs. Davis that the government couldn’t indefinitely hold individuals beyond six months if it’s unlikely that ICE can actually deport them soon. Legal experts pointed to this ruling to argue that the 1996 law didn’t allow for indefinite detention. In the 2018 case Jennings vs. Rodriguez, the Supreme Court ruled that detained immigrants don’t have the right to periodic bond hearings during removal proceedings. In March, the court ruled in Nielsen vs. Preap  that the government can hold immigrants without bail even if the crimes they committed were years ago.  The Biden campaign pointed to measures that Biden supported that were intended to help immigrants, including the 1986 amnesty law, and then later a 2007 bill that included a path to citizenship. The Obama-Biden administration focused on both border enforcement and a call to change immigration laws to benefit some immigrants. He also announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to help some immigrants avoid deportation. The number of people removed reached an all-time high at 409,849 in 2012, less than Trump’s record, although later in Obama’s presidency he focused on deporting criminals. Biden has not released a detailed policy plan. Pagano said Biden ""voted to expand deportations and indefinite detention for immigrants multiple times."" Biden voted for bills in 1996 that gave the federal government more power to detain and deport immigrants. Biden wasn’t an outlier in the Senate; these measures passed with wide majorities with significant Democratic support and were signed by Clinton. ""Indefinite detention"" is a tricky term that obscures the goal of the legislation. It was meant to detain immigrants until they were deported — not to detain them with no end in sight. It would be more precise to refer to the legislation as requiring mandatory detention.

When did it become a crime to cross the U.S.-Mexico border?
","Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro sparred with fellow-Texan Beto O’Rourke during the first Democratic debate in June over whether to eliminate an immigration law that criminalizes crossing the border without authorization. Castro wants to repeal 8 U.S. Code Section 1325, which lays out legal consequences for people who enter the country between ports of entry, while O’Rourke has said the law should stay in place. In an interview on MSNBC after the debate, Castro discussed his immigration proposal and offered a brief history of the policy he wants to eliminate. ""It criminalizes the act of crossing the border,"" Castro said. ""This is a law that was put into place in 1929, by a segregationist by the way. From 1929 until 2004, it was mostly enforced as a civil violation.""  We’ve already looked at the second part of this statement from Castro, about changing enforcement of this policy under President George W. Bush. We rated the claim Mostly True — some immigrants were prosecuted for improper entry before Bush took office, but his administration created a program to prosecute most immigrants before deportation. This time we’re taking a look at the historical component of Castro’s claim. Is he right when he says the policy was enacted by a segregationist in 1929?  Castro’s campaign pointed to a Washington Post article about the senator, a white supremacist, who authored the first version of federal law criminalizing entering the country between ports of entry.  But this isn’t the law Castro wants to repeal. This early act was eliminated in 1952, when Congress approved a sweeping immigration reform package that put policies like Section 1325 in place. Let’s start from the beginning. Coleman Livingston Blease  Coleman Livingston Blease of South Carolina was a Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in 1925, after serving two terms as governor of South Carolina.  Kelly Lytle Hernández, a history professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who has researched this topic, told the Post that Blease was an ""unrepentant white supremacist."" In a speech delivered in 1911 after he was sworn in as governor, Blease described his vision for South Carolina, which included ""liberal appropriations for Confederate veterans"" and having ""white and colored convicts worked in different camps."" He also said he opposed taxing white people to cover the cost of education for black people. Blease was also a vocal supporter of lynching, and was quoted as saying, ""to hell with the Constitution,"" to the extent that it required people to be tried for crimes before a jury.  ""When the Constitution steps between me and the defense of the virtue of the white women of my state, I will resign my commission and tear it up and throw it to the breezes,"" Blease said in 1921, according to the Chicago Daily News. His stance on lynching was seen as fundamental to his re-election campaign to the Senate in 1930 (which he lost).  ""It looks, indeed, as if Mr. Blease is staking his hopes of reelection on the belief that there are more people in South Carolina who are in favor of lynch law than there are in favor of the prosecution and conviction of lynchers,"" reads an article in The Greenville News. While he was still in office, Blease became ""the first United States Senator to be presented with the flag of the Confederacy, and to have it placed in his office,"" according to a story in The Belleville Telescope in Kansas. After receiving the flag at a ceremony, he said: ""When I cease to praise and defend the southern soldiers and this emblem, this poor, lisping, stammering tongue will lie silent in the grave."" Blease policy enacted in 1929 In March 1929, Blease authored an immigration act that made it a misdemeanor to enter the country between ports of entry, punishable by up to one year in prison. It also made it a felony to unlawfully return to the country after being deported, punishable by up to two years in prison. Before this law was adopted, ""the United States essentially had open borders,"" but the 20th century saw a shift in ""thinking about illegal immigration as a problem stemming from Mexico rather than from Asia and Europe,"" according to a 2012 article in the Loyola University Chicago Law Journal . Julia Young, a history professor at the Catholic University of America who studies migration and Latin America, said Blease’s policy was the first to target migration at the nation’s southern border — although some people still would have faced criminal charges for crossing the border before his act was adopted.  ""For example, a Chinese migrant who crossed the southern border before 1929 would still be criminalized on the basis of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882,"" Young said in an email. But Blease’s policy targeted Mexican migrants in particular.  ""The idea was to force Mexican immigrants into an authorized and monitored stream that could be turned on and turned off at will at ports of entry,"" Hernández wrote in a 2017 article about the history of criminalizing crossing the border. ""Any immigrant who entered the United States outside the bounds of this stream would be a criminal subject to fines, imprisonment and ultimately deportation."" Modern language established in 1952 Blease’s act stayed on the books until 1952, when Congress approved the Immigration and Nationality Act, which repealed and reorganized portions of existing law and established new provisions — including the policy that would become Section 1325, which criminalized entry into the country between ports of entry. The policy was included in the 1952 act as Section 275 and it reduced penalties for unlawful entry from the levels dictated in the 1929 law. Unlawful entry was still a misdemeanor, but was punishable by up to six months in prison, rather than a year.  This decision meant that criminal cases based on illegal entry could be tried before federal magistrate judges ""without the right to trial by jury or grand jury indictment,"" according to a 2010 paper published in the Northwestern University Law Review by Ingrid Eagly, a law professor at UCLA. Blease’s act is not formally cited as the source of Section 1325, but it is considered the foundation of the policy.  A U.S. attorneys’ bulletin from the Department of Justice in July 2017 described Blease’s act as the ""first version"" of both the modern illegal entry and reentry statutes.  Brian Owsley — assistant law professor at the University of North Texas at Dallas and former U.S. magistrate judge in the Southern District of Texas — said that ""technically the language of 1325 begins in the 1952 act. However, one can see that the language from the 1929 act influenced the drafters of the 1952 act."" Eagly said in her 2010 paper that the ""law has remained fairly static over time"" on the criminal side. ""For example, the criminal illegal entry and reentry law passed in 1929 remains the core of the immigration crime law today,"" she wrote. Our ruling Castro said Section 1325 immigration policy, which makes it a crime to enter the country illegally, was ""put into place in 1929, by a segregationist."" Technically Blease — a white supremicist who advocated for segregationist policies and lynching —  was not the author of the statute on illegal entry into the United States as it exists in today’s immigration code.  But it was the first policy criminalizing all unlawful entry at the nation's southern border, and is considered the foundation of the 1952 policy that  evolved into today's Section 1325.  We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",/factchecks/2019/jul/12/julian-castro/when-did-it-become-crime-cross-us-mexico-border/

Are federal policies to blame for drop in student milk consumption?
","Representing the dairy state in Washington, D.C., U.S. Sen Ron Johnson is proposing a bill to allow schools to return to serving higher-fat milks. Making his case on Facebook, the Republican tied the drop in student milk consumption to the focus on low-fat milks. ""Schools have not been able to serve whole milk or 2% since Obama-era regulations went into place,"" Johnson wrote in a June 12, 2019, post. ""As a result, milk consumption has notably declined in schools across the country."" Is Johnson right to blame the federal policies for decreasing student interest in milk? Until eight years ago, schools served white milk at four fat levels (skim, 1%, 2% and whole) and flavored milk at three fat levels (skim, 1% and 2%).  That changed when the U.S. Department of Agriculture took the higher fat options off the table as part of an overall push to reduce fat intake in school lunches. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act passed by Congress in 2010 changed nutritional standards for school lunches. Policies implemented by the USDA by 2012 then banned whole and 2% white milk, as well as 1% and 2% flavored milk. That limited students’ milk options to flavored skim, white skim or white 1% until 2017. Those regulations have loosened the last few years. Congress allowed schools to offer 1% flavored milk if they could demonstrate ""operational hardship"" to their state agency in the 2017-’18 school year, and in 2018-’19 they were able to offer the 1% flavored milk without a waiver, according to the USDA.  Johnson’s Milk in Lunches for Kids (MILK) Act would allow schools to serve any form of milk.  Johnson’s main point is that the policy changes have caused a drop in student milk consumption. It’s a classic question of correlation vs. causation — did both things simply happen at the same time, or are they related? Milk consumption isn’t just a schools issue. It has steadily dropped nationwide (a key element of the crisis facing Wisconsin dairy farmers). Per-capita consumption of fluid milk (not counting cheese and other dairy products) dropped from 247 pounds in 1975 to 149 pounds in 2017, according to the USDA. So we would expect schools — which account for about 8% of all milk consumption — to generally follow this trend. Indeed, from 2008 to 2018, the weekly milk consumption per student dropped from 4.03 bottles of milk (8 ounces each) to 3.39 bottles, according to an analysis by Prime Consulting Group on behalf of MilkPEP, a dairy industry group. But student milk consumption dropped much quicker after the higher fat milk options disappeared. The milk usage dropped an average of 0.03 milks per year from 2008 to 2012, then an average of 0.13 milks from 2013 to 2018. Doug Adams, president of the Prime Group, said the numbers are based on school enrollment and milk distribution data provided by milk processors. The firm gathers actual data for about 80% of schools nationwide and uses statistical methods to project the remaining portion. Adams said the reduced fat level is a factor in the lower student consumption, but just one of several. For instance, he said, a new requirement that every meal have a fruit or vegetable changed how often lunch staffers added milk to students’ trays.  As students go through lunch lines, they are required to have taken three of five components (meat, vegetable, fruit, grain/bread and milk) to qualify for government-funded meals. In the past, milk was the long-standing default add-on for students who were one item short. Now, with fruits or veggies required, those who arrive at the end short an item are often sent back to get those. That leaves out milk. Meanwhile, the federal government also began requiring water be provided for free. Since water containers are sometimes displayed alongside milk in the lunch line, this increased the options available to students and therefore lowered milk consumption. The group also noted school lunch participation has dropped overall. And fewer lunches mean less milk. Johnson said the Obama-era removal of whole milk and 2% options led to a ""notable decline"" in school milk consumption. Milk consumption has notably declined in schools, but it has declined across all age groups nationwide. And the leading industry group studying this topic — which Johnson’s staff pointed to in defense of his claim — said the changes in milk availability are just one of several factors in the drop in student milk use.

Fact-checking claim about number of immigrants becoming citizens under Trump
","A top immigration official said that despite attacks against President Donald Trump and his administration claiming they ""don’t like immigrants,"" the numbers say otherwise. Ken Cuccinelli, recently named U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services acting director, spoke to host Dana Perino on the July 7 edition of Fox News Sunday about the naturalization process for immigrants and described the culminating ceremony as ""a very moving experience."" ""How many of those people per year is America letting in right now?"" Perino asked.  ""Well, last year, we were in the range of 850,000 and that was the most in five years. And this fiscal year we will pass that,"" Cuccinelli said. ""People who come after the president and this administration, say, ‘Oh you know, you don't like immigrants.’ Well, we are letting more people become citizens than has happened in years."" Perino said she didn’t think people realize that. ""No, they don’t,"" Cuccinelli responded. Is it true that more immigrants are becoming U.S. citizens than has happened in years? In total numbers, yes. But the approval rate isn’t the highest it’s been in recent years. And the number Cuccinelli mentioned is inflated. Generally, before becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, immigrants must pay a fee, pass a civics test and a background check, have lawful permanent residence for at least five years, and meet other criteria. The final step to becoming a U.S. citizen is taking an Oath of Allegiance to the United States at a naturalization ceremony. PolitiFact asked USCIS for data backing Cuccinelli’s claim about the Trump administration letting more people become citizens than has happened in years. In 2018, USCIS approved around 756,800 naturalization applications. That beat approval numbers in 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014. The last time naturalization approvals were higher than 2018 was 2013 — around 779,900. In the Fox News Sunday interview, when asked about how many people were naturalized, Cuccinelli said ""we were in the range of 850,000"" in 2018. But that number refers to applications completed — both approved and denied. Around 849,500 applications were completed in 2018, according to USCIS’s report.  Naturalization approvals in 2018 — 756,800 — weren’t that much higher than in 2016, the last full fiscal year of the Obama administration. In 2016, about 753,100 people were naturalized. That’s a less than 1% increase in absolute numbers of naturalizations from 2016 to 2018. The report USCIS sent PolitiFact had not just total numbers of people who became U.S. citizens, but also the approval rates. In both fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the approval rate was 89%. In 2016, 90%. So while the total number of people approved in 2018 is higher than in five years, the approval rate is not. Cuccinelli said, ""We are letting more people become citizens than has happened in years,"" and that it was 850,000 people last year. The 850,000 represents applications completed — both approved and denied. In fiscal year 2018, about 756,800 people became naturalized U.S. citizens. That’s the highest number since 2013, when it was about 779,900.  Of all naturalization applications completed in 2018, 89% were approved. It was the same percentage in 2017. In 2016, 90% of applications were approved. Cuccinelli’s statement is partially accurate.

Rick Scott overshoots on how much more insulin costs in the US than in Canada
","When it comes to brand name prescription drugs, Americans pay more than others. Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott took the story of a group of Minnesotans crossing to Canada to drive home the point. ""Americans are traveling to Canada to pay 12 times less for insulin than they would here in the US,"" Scott tweeted July 8. Americans are traveling to Canada to pay 12X less for insulin than they would here in the US. That's unacceptable.It’s time American families are treated fairly & pay a fair price for life-saving meds. That's why I'm fighting for a common-sense solution: https://t.co/rmiOuE8oLd https://t.co/E6iDISDKk2 We decided to explore whether Americans can get their insulin in Canada at one-twelfth  what they would pay in the United States. The cost is certainly less in Canada, but by how much is harder to pin down. Particularly in the United States, the gap between list and actual price is often huge. However, people without insurance are most exposed to the highest prices. Scott’s tweet drew on a Miami Herald article about a drug-buying trip organized by diabetes activist Quinn Nystrom. Nystrom declared the outing a success. ""Pure joy as we walk out of the pharmacy in Canada after buying insulin for 12X less than in the United States. Group insulin order in the U.S.: $23,789.24. In Canada: $1,924.10,"" Nystrom’s July 1 tweet said.  Pure joy as we walk out of the pharmacy in 🇨🇦 after buying insulin for 12x less then in the 🇺🇸. Group insulin order in 🇺🇸: $23,789.24In 🇨🇦: $1,924.10We have a problem! 1 in 4 Americans are rationing their insulin because they can’t afford it. #CaravantoCanada #insulin4all pic.twitter.com/niRyQ4Vg7e We asked Nystrom where the American number came from. She told us it was the price the trip members would have paid if they had no insurance and no rebates and paid the full list price. ""We did this because in Canada we were paying the cash retail price there,"" Nystrom said. ""It was the closest comparison we could make. As soon as insurance comes in, then it varies greatly in the United States."" Some in the group did have insurance. Others did not, and Nystrom herself faces hefty bills. ""I have a high-deductible plan, so in January, I paid out-of-pocket $600 for two vials of Novolog — retails for $680,"" she said. The bottom line is that the nearly $24,000 in Nystrom’s tweet is the highest possible price — many people would have paid less at their local pharmacy. ""The whole drug industry has seen a huge gap grow between list and actual discounted price over the years,"" said drug researcher Geoffrey Joyce at the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at the University of Southern California. ""Insulin is the poster child for that trend."" Joyce called Nystrom’s 12-fold difference ""misleading.""  ""It’s true in extreme cases, but it’s not a fair apples-to-apples comparison,"" he said. There are two main ways that Americans avoid paying full freight for prescription drugs.  People who have insurance benefit from the negotiated prices that keep the drug on an insurer's list of covered medicines. Or, if a person has no insurance, he or she might have a coupon from a drug maker that cuts the price. ""Pricing of drugs in general, and for insulin specifically, is very complex,"" a 2018 study from the American Diabetes Association said. ""With this system, there is no one agreed-upon price for any insulin formulation. The price ultimately paid by the person with diabetes at the point of sale results from the prices, rebates, and fees negotiated among the stakeholders."" That Byzantine system delivers prices that are higher than in Canada, but research is thin on what the actual gap is. One hurdle is that Canada has its own complexities. As we’ve reported before, the national health system doesn’t cover prescription drugs. A person’s experience varies according to the province he or she lives in and their employer plans. But at the same time, drug prices in Canada are overseen by the Patented Medicines Price Review Board. That government agency sets a ceiling on prices, based in part on what the same drug costs in other countries, and that keeps a lid on what Canadians pay. (President Donald Trump has floated an idea along these lines. Even with this approach, problems remain.) ""In Canada, you have the government negotiating on behalf of Canadian citizens,"" Joyce said. ""In the United States, it’s more market driven, and if the market doesn’t work so well, people pay more."" Joyce emphasized that in the United States, those with the least insurance, and the least ability to pay, face the highest prices. As our partners at Kaiser Health News have reported, one out of four people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes ration their insulin. That’s hundreds of thousands of people. And even if the price gap between the United States and Canada is on the smaller side, diabetics need insulin forever, and the higher U.S. prices add up. Scott said that Americans go to Canada to pay 12 times less for insulin than they would in the United States. The difference for most people would not be that great, and in reality, it was not that large even for the people Scott had read about. Nevertheless, insulin prices in Canada tend to be many times lower  than in the United States. Scott’s number points in the right direction, but it overshoots.

More arrests in the US for marijuana possession than violent crimes, 2020 hopeful Cory Booker says
","Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker likes to quote statistics, particularly when he’s indicting what he sees as unfair treatment of marijuana offenders as compared to those commit violent crimes. ""We have people that have criminal convictions for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing. And so, we have a justice system that is not equal justice under the law,"" the U.S. senator from New Jersey said in a Las Vegas TV interview.  ""We have people who can’t get jobs, can’t get business licenses because of nonviolent drug crimes. And especially at a time when we’re legalizing things like marijuana. In 2017, we had more marijuana possession arrests in our country than all other violent crimes combined. And so, I’m going to fight to end this."" The arrests claim is one Booker has made before; and national news media have reported a similar statistic.  What we found is that Booker is right for 2017  — and for 2016 and 2015, as well. As Booker indicated, legalizing marijuana is on the upswing. PolitiFact reported in 2018 that two in three Americans favor marijuana legalization, a record-high measure of public support, and a majority of states now permit legal use in some form. That’s despite the fact that, under federal law, pot is a Schedule I drug, with ""a high potential for abuse.""  As for Booker’s claim, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) database, law enforcement nationwide made an estimated 518,617 arrests for violent crimes in 2017. That includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. That figure is lower than the 599,282 arrests made for possession of marijuana. (In cases where a person is arrested for a violent crime and marijuana possession, it is recorded as a violent-crime arrest because that is the more serious offense, according to the UCR handbook.) An arrest means there was probable cause that a crime was committed. It doesn’t necessarily mean a criminal charge was filed, or that a person was convicted. Out of curiosity, we took a look back two more years of arrest numbers, as well:  The FBI hasn’t yet produced a full UCR report for 2018. Nearly 18,000 city, university and college, county, state, tribal and federal law enforcement agencies participate in UCR. But the FBI notes that the UCR figures are estimates, because not all law enforcement agencies participate in the program. As for why arrests for marijuana possession exceed those for violent crimes, we asked Michael Collins, director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, which works to change marijuana laws across the country. He told us it’s because ""it’s the easiest type of arrest to make; the evidence is already there.""  ""They say marijuana is a gateway drug,"" Collins added. ""Marijuana is a gateway to the criminal justice system."" Some police commanders say they have stepped up drug enforcement overall to tackle the opioid epidemic, and marijuana arrests are up accordingly, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Other commanders assert that as more jurisdictions such as Philadelphia have begun treating marijuana with leniency, people have become more flagrant in its use, leading to more arrests. Booker said, ""In 2017, we had more marijuana possession arrests in our country than all other violent crimes combined."" FBI figures show 599,282 arrests nationwide for possession of marijuana and 518,617 arrests for violent crimes, which include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

Biden’s claim that ACA was a ‘breakthrough’ for mental health parity highlights gaps
","In a sit-down interview with CNN, 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden touted the Obama administration’s passage of the Affordable Care Act, asserting that this law evened out the playing field when it came to insurance coverage of mental and physical health. ""We made parity between mental health and physical health,"" Biden told CNN’s Chris Cuomo. ""It was a fundamental breakthrough in how we thought about how things should work."" This gets at a health care issue that — as a federal appeals court weighs Obamacare’s constitutionality — is now particularly relevant. Did the ACA create equal coverage of mental and physical health? We decided to investigate. We contacted the Biden campaign and never heard back. But our own reporting shows that while Biden’s claim is mostly accurate concerning the health law’s provisions, implementation has fallen short of achieving the goal of parity. One problem, two laws The ACA, which became law in 2010, does include provisions meant to strengthen access to and insurance coverage of mental health care. But it wasn’t the first statute to take on this challenge. Two years earlier, before Barack Obama became president, Congress passed the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. It said that, if insurance offered by large employers — an organization employing more than 50 people — included mental health benefits, it had to structure those benefits, as well as associated copayments or caps on visits, equal to — ""at parity"" with —physical health benefits. A key thing to note, though, is that this 2008 law did not specifically mandate coverage of mental health services. Obamacare went further by requiring most plans to cover mental health and substance abuse. And it extended the parity requirement beyond large-employer-sponsored coverage to plans offered by small employers and those bought on the individual market. Health economists estimate that the ACA extended mental health benefits to 62 million people. ""It substantially expanded the reach of the parity law,"" said Sherry Glied, a health economist and dean at New York University. Both Glied and Richard Frank, a health economics professor at the Harvard Medical School, agreed that the first part of Biden’s claim checks out. The health law certainly brought in new standards for parity and expanded the rules already on the books. (Frank and Glied both served in the Obama administration.) But because  the law operates in tandem with the earlier legislation, one could also reasonably question whether it constitutes a ""fundamental breakthrough"" or represents the next step in a broader trajectory. Holes in the system Perhaps more important, though, is the current state of parity. To be sure, the ACA’s requirements created a clear set of parity standards. In some respects, though, these standards exist on paper but don’t always play out in practice. ""It’s huge that the guaranteed protections are there,"" said JoAnn Volk, a research professor at Georgetown University. ""The challenges remain in delivering on them."" That’s because some coverage inequities are easier to spot than others. If a health plan caps how many times you can see a psychiatrist but doesn’t do so for an allergist or oncologist, that’s a clear violation. If mental health care visits have higher coinsurance than do physical health visits, that’s also obviously illegal. Evidence suggests those quantitative barriers are less common now than they were before the passage of these two laws. Those changes, Glied said, have most clearly benefited people with severe psychiatric conditions. But other barriers remain — many of which are quite nuanced and therefore more difficult to spot and enforce. For instance, health plans aren’t supposed to require prior authorization for a psychiatrist visit unless they also do so for a ""comparable"" physical health service. The problem, of course, is how the word ""comparable"" is defined and interpreted. ""Even if you’re not trying to exploit the ambiguities but are trying to do a good job, you still might get into some controversial situations where folks might disagree, and disagree on a legit basis,"" Frank said. And, both Frank and Glied noted, there are cases in which insurance plans might try to take advantage of those ambiguities. Take, for instance, the question of ""medical necessity."" Insurance plans can argue that a mental health service isn’t required for someone’s well-being. Advocates argue that, even in the wake of the parity laws, that argument is used as an excuse to deny care, and that it is used more often for psychiatric cases than for, say, treating someone with diabetes or a hip injury. These barriers more often affect people with less severe mental health conditions, but who still require care, Glied said. States have amped up their enforcement, in part due to federal support, Volk said. But they often rely on reports from consumers who have experienced parity violations, which assumes people will realize their plan has broken the law. And issues exist beyond parity. Research suggests that insurance networks still fall short when it comes to including an adequate or even robust panel of behavioral health providers who accept their coverage. That’s in part because of distinctions in mental health care — whether someone specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy or talk therapy, for instance, or a psychiatrist’s age or gender or life experiences. Plus, many behavioral health specialists simply don’t take insurance. Those issues, Frank said, come in part because of the distinct complexity of mental health coverage. ""Mental health is not just one thing — it’s a whole bunch of illnesses. You want people to get the care they need,"" Frank said. That means that devising effective policy ""is a balancing act."" Our ruling Biden told CNN that the ACA ""made parity between mental health and physical health,"" describing that policy as a ""fundamental breakthrough."" It’s clear the 2010 law’s parity requirements had a major impact: 62 million people gaining coverage is nothing to sneeze at. But the ACA wasn’t the first piece of legislation to take this issue on. And major issues remain when it comes to making sure insurance treats mental health needs the same way it does physical health ones. Biden’s statement is accurate, but it would benefit from additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/jul/11/joe-biden/bidens-claim-aca-was-breakthrough-mental-health-pa/

In viral moment, Pete Buttigieg fumbles line on racial disparities in criminal justice
","A July 4 event featuring Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg went viral after Buttigieg clapped back at an audience member over race and criminal justice. At the event in Carroll, Iowa, a man in the audience addressed Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. He said, ""I have a solution for you and I'd like you to make a comment on my proposal: Just tell the black people of South Bend to stop committing crime and doing drugs."" Buttigieg took the man to task, saying, ""Sir, I don't think racism is going to get us out of this."" When the man countered that his comment had ""nothing to do with race,"" Buttigieg responded, ""The fact that a black person is four times as likely as a white person to be incarcerated for the exact same crime is evidence of systemic racism,"" Buttigieg said. Man booed at Pete Buttigieg event after racist comment.""Racism is not going to help us get out of this,"" Buttigieg tells him, to applause. ""Racism has no place in American politics or in American law enforcement. Next question."" https://t.co/NkJuIoh4fP pic.twitter.com/iBt6pwnr2H   This is a startling disparity, and a reader asked us if Buttigieg was correct. The Buttigieg campaign told us that he was referring to a 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, which said that ""a black person is 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person, even though blacks and whites use marijuana at similar rates. Such racial disparities in marijuana possession arrests exist in all regions of the country, in counties large and small, urban and rural, wealthy and poor, and with large and small Black populations."" The marijuana arrest finding is ""a widely cited figure, and accurate as far as I can tell,"" Sonja B. Starr, a University of Michigan law professor, told PolitiFact.  However, this study does not support what Buttigieg specifically said in Iowa. The ACLU finding refers to arrests, not incarceration, which is a much more serious event. In addition, this finding is specific to marijuana, not to all crimes. And the data is at least a decade old, meaning it measured a time before the wide-scale decriminalization fo marijuana; arrest patterns may have changed. Comparisons of this sort involving marijuana have some advantages, Starr said, because the data is more comprehensive than it is for other crimes. Still, she added, ""marijuana studies don't prove in and of themselves that similar disparities translate into other areas. And marijuana possession only accounts for quite a small percentage of those incarcerated in this country, so this figure doesn't give us a full picture at all."" We wondered whether other studies support what Buttigieg said in Iowa.  While we found voluminous evidence of racial disparities in the criminal justice system, we couldn’t locate any finding that specifically addressed what Buttigieg said. African Americans fare more poorly than whites in the United States’ criminal justice system -- a pattern that emerges at every stage of the process, including higher arrest rates, a higher likelihood of imprisonment as opposed to probation, and longer sentences for those who are incarcerated.  Here are some findings that support this conclusion but don’t address Buttigieg’s specific assertion: • ""Black men are six times as likely to be incarcerated as white men.""  Source: The Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for criminal justice reform. Why it’s not on point: This finding addresses incarceration for all crimes together, not ""for the same crime."" • ""Blacks receive sentences that are almost 10 percent longer than those of comparable whites arrested for the same crimes.""  Source: Paper by Sonja B. Starr, University of Michigan Law School, and M. Marit Rehavi, University of British Columbia and Canadian Institute for Advanced Research Why it’s not on point: This does address the same crimes, but it compares the length of sentence, not the likelihood of incarceration. Also, the study looked at only at sentencing in the federal system, which accounts for only a small fraction of criminal sentences. • ""Black men who commit the same crimes as white men receive federal prison sentences that are, on average, nearly 20 percent longer.""  Source: U.S. Sentencing Commission Why it’s not on point: It also does not compare the likelihood of incarceration, and only looked at the federal system. • ""African Americans are incarcerated in state prisons at a rate that is 5.1 times the imprisonment of whites."" Source: The Sentencing Project  Why it’s not on point: This finding addresses incarceration for all crimes together, not ""for the same crime."" • ""When white youth and minority youth were charged with the same offenses, African American youth with no prior admissions were six times more likely to be incarcerated in public facilities than white youth with the same background."" Source: National Council on Crime and Delinquency Why it’s not on point: This finding is specific to youth. In addition, the data was from 1993, when crime rates were far higher than they are today; the data has not been updated since then. • ""Among youth, African Americans are 4.1 times as likely to be committed to secure placements as whites."" Source: The Sentencing Project Why it’s not on point: This number is right, and compares confinement to non-confinement. But it refers to youth only, which Buttigieg didn’t specify. Because of the sweeping way he phrased it, proving or disproving the assertion Buttigieg made would be challenging, said William Rhodes, principal scientist at Abt Associates, a research firm. Even when looking at the ""same crime,"" there may be wide variations between the racial disparities that exist for, say, property crime and homicide. Buttigieg’s formulation also glosses over disparate arrest patterns for different crimes and even the disparities among victims in the reporting of different types of crimes. One often-underestimated factor concerns differences between different jurisdictions, said Candace McCoy, a professor with John Jay College’s doctoral program in criminal justice. Some areas put a great deal of effort into community relations or reducing disparities in arrests. Others don’t.  The racial disparity ""varies wildly among the 50 states and the federal system, too,"" McCoy said. ""So it is really hard to make one big overall statement such as the one Buttigieg did and be accurate."" Experts agreed that Buttigieg, in an attempt to make a reasonable argument, muffed his talking point. ""It's encouraging that Buttigieg is calling attention to this important issue, but he should be framing the research findings more accurately,"" said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project. Buttigieg said ""a black person is four times as likely as a white person to be incarcerated for the exact same crime."" There’s ample data documenting disparities between African Americans and whites in the criminal justice system, but neither we nor criminal justice experts could find evidence to support Buttigieg’s specific assertion.

This image of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein is doctored
","Financier Jeffrey Epstein is accused of running a sex-trafficking ring involving underage girls, and as the federal indictment revealed more about the sex crimes case against him on July 8, social media posts tied him to President Donald Trump.   One such post shows what looks like a photo of Epstein, Trump, and a girl, who Trump appears to be kissing on the head with his hands around her waist. ""Jeffrey Epstein and his buddy, fellow accused child rapist, Trump,"" wrote the account that published the image. ""Epstein smirks as Trump inappropriately touches a young girl."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because the photo is doctored, combining separate photos of the two men.  In 2016, an unnamed plaintiff filed a lawsuit claiming that she was repeatedly raped by Trump and Epstein in 1994, when she was 13. Trump vehemently denied the rape claims, Buzzfeed reported, and later that year the woman dropped the case. (PBS NewsHour collected information about that allegation among other assault allegations against Trump here.) In 2002, Trump told New York magazine that Epstein was a ""terrific guy.""  ""He’s a lot of fun to be with,"" Trump then said, ""It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."" But speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on July 9, the New York Times reported, Trump distanced himself from Epstein and said he had a falling out with him.  ""I haven’t spoken to him in 15 years,"" Trump said. ""I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you."" Epstein, who faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted, has pleaded not guilty. The charges against him mirror those in Florida that federal prosecutors there had prepared more than a decade ago, the New York Times reported. Epstein's lawyers and the U.S. attorney's office in Miami reached a deal in 2008 that granted him immunity from federal prosecution. Instead, he pleaded guilty to two prostitution charges, spent 13 months at a Palm Beach jail and registered as a sex offender. One New York Times article about the current case features a photo of Trump and Epstein in 1997 in Palm Beach.  But the purported photo of Trump and Epstein featured in the Facebook post is made up of two separate images. The one of Trump is from October 1993, when he was photographed with his daughter Ivanka — the girl mentioned in the Facebook post — at the grand opening of the Harley Davidson Cafe in New York City.  The photo of Epstein is from May 2005. He was attending the launch of RADAR MAGAZINE at Hotel QT, also in New York City. Trump is not in the picture.

A meme about migrant cell phone use at the U.S. border takes an AP photo out of context
","We’ve fact-checked a lot of misinformation about migrants on the U.S. southern border. And not all of it is new — or even completely made-up. On July 8, a Facebook page called The Rogue Patriot published a photo of people sitting on a curb looking at their cell phones. Text written over the image claims that the individuals pictured are migrants. ""The inescapable question is: How have all of you been able to pay your cell phone bills during your excruciating two month excursion across four separate countries?"" the post reads. The meme taps into the ongoing nationwide conversation about the surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Rogue Patriot’s post, which amassed more than 1,200 shares, doesn’t list a source either in the meme or caption. And nothing in the photo makes it immediately obvious that those pictured are actually migrants. PolitiFact reached out to The Rogue Patriot for more information regarding the source of the image, and it directed us to an Associated Press story published March 27, 2017. The photo in question appears embedded in the text with the following caption: ""Cubans check their cell phones inside the migrant shelter ‘Casa del Migrante’ in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas state, Mexico, Saturday, March 25, 2017, across the border from Laredo, Texas. The shelter limits migrants to one hour of cell phone usage, for security reasons."" The AP story addresses the so-called ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy, which former president Barack Obama ended Jan. 12, 2017. That policy, created by former president Bill Clinton in 1995, allowed most Cubans who reached U.S. soil to become legal permanent residents after one year. Once it ended, Cuban migrants were treated the same as those from other countries. According to the AP’s reporting, many migrants in the Casa del Migrante shelter were Cubans who had tried to travel to the United States under the assumption that they would be included in the ""privileged path"" laid out by the Clinton-era policy. Several had jobs in Mexico that required them to leave the shelter ""to work in restaurants or on construction sites."" That’s a different context than that in which The Rogue Patriot posted its meme. The AP interviewed one migrant who had crossed several borders to get to Mexico, but based on the photo alone, it’s unclear which people pictured actually made a ""two-month excursion across four separate countries."" Similar versions of this meme have cropped up during previous news stories about immigration.  In December, Snopes fact-checked a meme that used the same AP photo with a text overlay similar to The Rogue Patriot’s post. It found that the post was miscaptioned because it purported to show asylum seekers that were part of a caravan of Central American migrants headed to the U.S. border. Finally, we should note that it’s not unusual for poor people or even the homeless to possess cell phones, both in the United States and worldwide. The Gates Foundation, for example, has promoted the acquisition of mobile phones in Africa, Asia and Latin America in order to give low-income people in developing countries access to financial services through online banking.  Our ruling The Rogue Patriot claimed an image showed migrants are ""able to pay cell phone bills"" after a ""two-month excursion across four separate countries."" The photo was taken by the AP in 2017 for a story about Cuban immigrants who had been excluded from a Clinton-era amnesty policy. That context is different than that in which The Rogue Patriot posted its meme, and other fact-checkers have debunked similar claims in the past.

Are immigrant children free to leave shelters ‘at anytime’? Half True
","The treatment of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border has become a huge issue this summer, with members of Congress visiting Border Patrol facilities to see conditions for themselves.  A Republican congressman from Texas recently made the case that while resources are strained at facilities run by immigration authorities, children in the care of another government agency are being treated well. ""In the (Office of Refugee Resettlement) facilities...I've been to Casa Padre in Brownsville, Texas, yes it's a restored Walmart. You know what? There's not a lock on the door. Any child is free to leave at anytime, but they don't,"" said Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, during a June 24 MSNBC interview. ""You know why? Because they are well taken care of. And yes, at some point they’re going to live with family, generally not mother or father, but some family member, that’s a good thing."" Readers asked PolitiFact to look into Burgess’s claim about children being free to leave at any time from shelters but choosing to stay. We found that Burgess’s claim ignores critical facts and doesn’t capture the complexity of the issue. • Children are in shelters because they are under federal custody, waiting to be placed with a sponsor and for a decision on their immigration case. • Shelters are not detention centers, so their staff can’t forcibly restrain children if they walk out. • If a child leaves a shelter without permission, staff will call law enforcement and ask for the child’s return. Burgess’s press office sent PolitiFact a statement from the congressman. ""In my experience, all shelters I have visited are designed appropriately for the ages of the children who occupy them,"" Burgess said in the statement. ""If an older teen decides to leave on their own volition, they are neither detained nor restrained."" Immigrant children in federal custody range in age. For instance, as of May 31, around 11,500 were ages 13 to 17, about 1,400 were ages 6 to 12, and 432 were 5-years-old or younger. Children in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement are required to be placed in the least restrictive environment, as mandated by the Flores Settlement, HHS’s press office told PolitiFact via email. Because of that, the majority of children are placed in state-licensed residential facilities instead of locked detention centers (and state laws vary regarding locks at the residential facilities). ""If a child does leave without proper authorization, then local law enforcement and (the Department of Homeland Security) are notified. Just like if a child left a school without permission — the police would be called,"" HHS said. Organizations that advocate for migrants and help children obtain legal aid told PolitiFact that there are varying levels of security at different facilities, which can include shelters, foster care homes, and secure facilities, such as a juvenile detention center.  But overall, children are not free to leave the facilities without consent, experts said, while noting that it has happened. ""If they leave, it is considered running away,"" said Rachel Prandini, a staff attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which advocates for immigrant rights. Prandini pointed to a federal policy which says that a child may be placed in a ""staff secure facility"" solely because he or she poses an escape risk. In the more secure facilities that HHS operates, children are not free to leave, she said. PolitiFact sought information from the nonprofit Southwest Key, which operates the Casa Padre migrant children shelter in Brownsville, Texas. It sent us a link to a July 2018 post from The Texas Tribune, headlined: ""Can separated immigrant children just walk out of shelters? Technically, yes."" The Texas Tribune post said that under state and federal guidelines, staff at Casa Padre and other shelters ""are almost never allowed to forcibly stop a child"" from leaving. The Texas Tribune linked to a June 2018 New York Times article that quotes a spokesman for Southwest Key, after a 15-year-old migrant walked off from the Casa Padre shelter. The spokesman, identified by the New York Times as Jeff Eller, told the newspaper that a child could not be legally required to stay. ""We are not a detention center,"" Eller told the New York Times. ""We talk to them and try to get them to stay. If they leave the property, we call law enforcement."" The doors at Casa Padre (a former Walmart store) are not locked but they have alarms that would alert staff if a child is exiting (and in the back area where children play outside, there is a fence), said Michelle Brané, senior director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the nonprofit Women's Refugee Commission. Children are kept in enclosed facilities because they are undocumented and in immigration removal proceedings, and for child protection reasons, because the federal government is responsible for their care and custody, said Jennifer Podkul, senior director for policy at Kids in Need of Defense. The facilities are meant to be temporary places for children while they await placement with sponsors. A sponsor (commonly a parent or family member) is expected to care for the child while he or she gets a decision from an immigration judge. On average, children spend fewer than 45 days in shelters. In his statement to PolitiFact, Burgess also said that children could request to be returned to their home country. Experts told PolitiFact that while children can ask to be sent back, that’s not always granted because it’s at the discretion of an immigration judge. If a judge allows a child to go home through voluntary departure, or if the child is issued a removal order, the child would be transferred over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and that agency would ​facilitate the removal from the United States, Podkul said. Burgess said, ""In the (Office of Refugee Resettlement) facilities...I've been to Casa Padre in Brownsville, Texas, yes it's a restored Walmart. You know what? There's not a lock on the door. Any child is free to leave at anytime, but they don't. You know why? Because they are well taken care of."" There are varying levels of security at different facilities. We did not get a clear answer from HHS, the department in charge of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or from Casa Padre on whether there’s a lock on the door at Casa Padre. An expert told us that the doors at that facility are not locked but they have alarms to alert staff if a child is exiting. In 2018, a spokesman for the nonprofit that runs Casa Padre said that the facility was not a detention center and could not legally stop a child from leaving. But the facility calls the police if children leave without permission.  Children at these facilities are under federal custody, awaiting immigration proceedings, and placement with a sponsor in the United States. So children might stay for reasons other than ""because they are well taken care of."" While most children in federal custody are 13- to 17-years-old, hundreds of others are 12 or younger. Burgess’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
