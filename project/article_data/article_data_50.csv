Could counties be ""out of luck"" if sales tax passes?
","
The road to next year’s referendum on a new sales tax to fund transportation projects in the Atlanta region is getting treacherous for the idea’s supporters.

State lawmakers last month punted on a proposal to hold the referendum in November 2012, on the date of the presidential election -- when more Democrats are likely to be at the polls. Experts believe the referendum has more support among Democrats.

Political observers called the decision to stick with holding the referendum on the July 2012 primary date a victory for tea party supporters, who said the idea of moving the referendum was tantamount to voter shopping.

This month, one active tea party member raised another concern about the tax in an op-ed that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Eighty-five percent ""of the funds collected in each county will be redistributed elsewhere -- not spent in the county in which it is collected,"" Debbie Dooley wrote. ""That means if DeKalb County raises hundreds of millions of dollars over a decade and wants to spend it on filling potholes, synchronizing lights or providing turn lanes, it is out of luck. It has to send the money to the region for redistribution on an already-determined project list.""

Hmmm. Isn’t the reason that leaders in some metro Atlanta counties want the tax is to pay for transportation projects in their communities? The current project list shows nearly $150 million in projects solely for DeKalb County, which Dooley mentioned in her op-ed.

Norcross Mayor Bucky Johnson, chairman of the group of regional leaders tasked to come up with a list of projects, said Dooley’s statement doesn’t add up.

""If a jurisdiction wasn’t getting their part, you would hear them crying by now,"" Johnson told us.

Dooley cited state Transportation Department reports to back up her argument.

""Only 15 percent is guaranteed to stay local,"" she said.

""We don’t know what their [final] project list is going to be,"" Dooley said. ""They’ve got a lot of wiggle room. They can change [the list].""

Dooley correctly points out that 15 percent of the money collected in each county must go to that jurisdiction. The remaining 85 percent is put into a pot of money that will pay for various projects that are put on the list, which is supposed to be finalized on Oct. 15. The counties in the Atlanta region are Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale. If passed by voters, the 10-year, 1 percent sales tax is expected to raise about $6.1 billion for regional transportation projects.

Julie Ralston, communcations director for the Atlanta Regional Commission, said each county will get a minimum return of at least 77 percent on what it collects from the tax for those projects in their jurisdiction.

""Everyone is getting something beyond their 15 percent,"" Ralston said. ""[Dooley’s statement] is absolutely false.""

Dooley’s concerns about the tax are twofold. She thinks all the funds collected in a county should be spent in its jurisdiction. Her other problem with the tax is she thinks it is a ruse to expand MARTA, the bus and rail system that currently operates in DeKalb and Fulton counties.

""I think they’re using smoke and mirrors on this,"" she said.

Fayette County Commissioner Steve Brown, like Dooley, has his concerns about the tax. For example, he doesn’t think the current list allocates enough money for some projects. Case in point, planned improvements at I-85/ Ga. 74 interchange, which is heavily used by Fayette County residents. There is currently $22.5 million set aside for the project.

""To widen the on and off ramps will cost $22 million,"" he said. ""That’s not going to begin to do that project.""

Brown said he understood Dooley’s concern about the tax, but he doesn’t fully agree with her statement.

""Technically, you could have a county on the short end of the stick,"" he said. ""I don’t know if that is going to happen.""

Johnson said there’s a very small likelihood that Dooley’s concerns are accurate.

""I guess that’s a possibility. There could be some changes,"" he said. ""But the point of what we looked at is geographic equity. It is spread out reasonably throughout the district.""

Johnson added, ""Every county is getting at least 75 percent or 80 percent of what they’re putting in.""

Dooley believes it is the intention of local leaders to use a portion of the 85 percent of money from the tax, if approved, in each county. She is worried, however, that the list will be changed and leave a county without any of that 85 percent. Others closely involved in putting the list together say such a scenario is slim. Rockdale County has only three projects that are solely in its county on the current list.

There’s not much concrete at this point to support Dooley’s claim.

Rachel Maddow said Social Security is keeping older Americans out of poverty
","The most recent census numbers show poverty is on the rise. Median household incomes have fallen to their lowest level since the 1990s, prompting analysts to say we are in the midst of a ""lost decade."" Liberal talk show host Rachel Maddow reviewed the numbers on her prime-time show on MSNBC:

The news that the U.S. poverty rate is now the highest it has been since the early '90s, nearly one in six Americans now living in poverty. And the specifics are even worse: Child poverty rose from under 21 percent to 22 percent. Poverty among Hispanic Americans went from more than 25 percent to more than 26 percent. Poverty among African-Americans went from just under 26 percent to over 27 percent. Poverty among white people is much lower than those other groups but it is rising, too, and fast. It went up from 9.4 percent to 9.9 percent.

The only large segment of the American population that serves as any sort of silver lining in these poverty numbers is older Americans. Poverty among Americans 65 and over is statistically unchanged, even as it is getting so much worse for so many other groups of people. And that, of course, is because we have something in this country that keeps older Americans out of poverty. It's called Social Security.

And the fact that Social Security works, that it is keeping old people out of poverty in America, even as everybody else is slipping into it, the fact that it works means that in Republicanland, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination is someone who says that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and a failure.

We wondered if Maddow was right that Social Security is the main factor keeping older Americans out of poverty. We suspected the federal program likely played some role, but we also wondered what role traditional pensions played. So we decided to check it out.   A review of how Social Security works: Workers contribute to the program via payroll taxes. (Most people are required to participate, with a few exceptions, such as retirement programs for government employees like those in Galveston County, Texas.) When workers reach retirement age, they file for Social Security benefits. The government calculates their benefits according to a formula primarily based on average lifetime earnings, and sends them monthly checks. They'll get that amount, with small increases for inflation, until they die.    Social Security has become a political topic lately because officials project the program won't take in enough money to pay full benefits starting around 2036. Most people agree the program will have to be changed to make it more financially solid.   Getting back to our fact-check, Maddow is right that the poverty rate for Americans over age 65 is quite stable. For 2010, it was at 9 percent, up slightly from 8.9 percent in 2009, and lower than it was during the 1990s, when it reached a decade-high 12.9 percent in 1992.   Next, we wanted to know how much Social Security made a difference to seniors with relatively low incomes: Quite a bit, it turns out.   The Social Security Administration performs economic analysis and publishes research statistics for Americans over age 65. The latest research available is for 2008, but Melissa Favreault, an expert on Social Security with the Urban Institute, told us she didn't expect the percentages would be significantly different for 2010.   The Social Security Administration looks at taxpayers aged 65 and older, dividing them up by income into five groups, from the lowest earning group to the highest. (For you non-policy wonks out there, these five groups are known as quintiles.) The numbers show that the less income people have, the more they depend on Social Security. Meanwhile, people who get pensions tend to be in the higher earning groups.    Meanwhile, the Census Bureau stated in its recent report that Social Security was keeping millions of people out of poverty: ""In 2010, the number of people aged 65 and older in poverty would be higher by almost 14 million if Social Security payments were excluded from money income, quintupling the number of elderly people in poverty."" If you added 14 million additional seniors to those already in poverty in 2010, the poverty rate for American over age 65 would be 45 percent, not 9 percent.    We also found a 2008 report on Social Security from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that analyzed ways to improve the future financing of Social Security. The report starts: ""Social Security has significantly reduced elderly poverty.  The elderly poverty rate has fallen from 35% in 1959 to an all-time low of 9% in 2006, in large part because of Social Security.  If Social Security benefits did not exist, an estimated 44% of the elderly would be poor today assuming no changes in behavior.""   Still, there are a few other things to consider when evaluating Maddow's statement.    Some seniors get public assistance from federal, state and local programs, particularly if they are poor or disabled. Those programs also have a role in keeping low-income seniors out of poverty. (Going back to the Social Security statistics that analyze quintiles, about 8 percent of the lowest quintile receives 50 percent or more of its income from public assistance.) Health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid could also indirectly increase people's income by paying for health care costs that they might otherwise pay out of pocket.    Then there's the argument to be made that some Social Security beneficiaries would have saved the money on their own, in other more productive ways. We fact-checked Ed Schultz's statement on what poverty numbers might look like if Social Security had never existed, and looked in some detail at different scenarios.   Finally, Social Security is not specifically aimed at keeping people out of poverty; many middle and upper-class people benefit as well. Social Security payments are based on people's lifetime earnings, so the more people earned during their working years, the more they get from Social Security. However, Social Security is progressive in the sense that low earners get more back in benefits than they contribute via payroll taxes.   Andrew Biggs, an expert on Social Security with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that Social Security isn't particularly effective if looked at solely as an antipoverty program.   ""In 2010, Social Security spent over $575 billion on retirement and survivors benefits, which comes to $14,675 for each person over age 65 –- enough to give every person a benefit that's 50 percent above the poverty line,"" said Biggs. ""And yet we still have 10 percent of seniors in poverty. If reducing poverty was our only goal, we could do a lot more while spending a lot less than we do.""   In rating Maddow's statement, she's largely correct that Social Security keeps a significant number of older Americans out of poverty. But other programs also play a role. We rate her statement Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2011/sep/19/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-said-social-security-keeping-older-a/
"['Ohio', 'Health Care', 'Mary  Taylor']","
Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor says 'Obamacare' would require purchase of unnecessary insurance
","
Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor also heads the state Department of Insurance. She makes no secret of her dislike for what she derisively calls ""Obamacare,"" the law formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

In June, Taylor wrote a guest column for newspapers in which she said, ""I will do everything I can to protect Ohio’s citizens and job creators from this catastrophic law."" She followed it by giving a speech with a similar theme.

In another guest column for newspapers that was posted Sept. 8 to the Department of Insurance website, Taylor says the health care law will limit choice and increase cost for consumers.

""The law’s heavy-handed mandates force insurance companies to include coverage for many benefits and services you may not want,"" she wrote. ""Say for example, you do not have any children. Under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it.  

""Such mandates remove consumerism from the process and replace it with a one-size-fits-all approach.  By requiring consumers to buy services they do not want or need, costs will rise significantly.""

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. Would consumers really be forced to buy unnecessary coverage, like pediatric, maternity and newborn care for people with no children?

We asked Taylor's office for support.

We were referred to Section 1302 of the Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. ""It addresses the essential health benefits,"" a spokesman for Taylor said.

We read Section 1302, and it seemed to bear out Taylor's assertion. But we were frankly confused by the wording, and we turned for guidance to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source on health care issues.

""It is true that this (pediatric, maternity and newborn care) is covered as part of the essential benefits package,"" a spokesman told us. ""The law does mandate that insurance.""

But the spokesman added more: Current employer-provided insurance plans ""may include coverage you will never use or need, such as maternity care for a man or prostate cancer coverage for women.""

Wanting further explanation, we talked with Neera Tanden, who worked on the health care legislation as senior advisor for health reform at the Department of Health and Human Services. She is currently CEO of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

""Ninety percent of all plans cover everything described in the bill as 'essential health benefits package,"" she said. ""People are paying for all those benefits today. We all pay for things we never use. It is the nature of insurance.""

Individual policies are usually more expensive, offer fewer benefits and are less regulated than group plans, she said, noting that Section 1302 of the health care act says that the scope of the package should equal the scope of benefits ""under a typical employer plan.""

The act also bans exclusions for ""preexisting conditions"" that exclusively or primarily affect women and ends the practice of charging women higher premiums than men, she said.

""The thrust of (Taylor's) case is there should be no requirements on what insurance companies offer,"" Tanden said.

Wanting the perspective of an authority without a dog in the political fight, we turned to J.B. Silvers at Case Western Reserve University.

He is professor of health care finance and professor of banking and finance at the Weatherhead School of Management, faculty director of the Health Systems Management Center and holds a joint appointment in the School of Medicine. He also is former CEO of a health plan and insurance company.

Silvers said the health care plan ""makes the playing field level"" by setting a standard for benefit packages.

""It is true you could buy some sort of stripped-down policy,"" he said, but such plans are ""almost universally a bad deal"" with higher costs.

Normally, he said, a company negotiates coverage for employees, and ""wouldn't offer one plan for single males and another for people with families.""

What does that say about the accuracy of Taylor's statement?

""It's irrelevant,"" Silvers said. ""It's a silly argument, frankly. Insurance by definition includes things you don't think you need.""

What it means to us is that Taylor, the top official at the state department that oversees insurance, was accurate in describing provisions of what she calls Obamacare. But it is misleading to imply that health insurance policies are purchased a la carte, that such purchasing would reduce costs to consumers, and that the ""essential benefits package"" represents a departure from current group plans.

And when a statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, it rates Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter.",/factchecks/2011/sep/19/mary-taylor/lt-gov-mary-taylor-says-obamacare-would-require-pu/

Rev. Al Sharpton says Wisconsin Gov. Walker's budget cuts led school district to cut milk from school kids' snack time
","Schoolchildren in America’s Dairyland going without milk?

Blame Gov. Scott Walker, the Rev. Al Sharpton says.

Sharpton, a civil rights activist and former Democratic candidate for president, is a nationally syndicated radio talk show host and, since August 2011, permanent host of MSNBC’s ""Politics Nation.""

On Sept. 7, 2011, as part of a segment of ""calling out"" Republicans for acts of ""injustice,"" Sharpton attacked Wisconsin’s first-term governor.

""Governor Scott Walker’s budget cuts mean some kids are going without,"" Sharpton declared. ""One school district is so worried about losing state funding that it has stopped giving milk to elementary school kids during snack time.""

Walker has prided himself as a budget cutter; his 2011-2013 spending plan reduced state funding of schools by nearly $800 million.

But did mere fear of state budget cuts leave some Wisconsin schoolchildren without milk to go with their graham crackers?

We called and emailed MSNBC and the National Action Network, Sharpton’s Harlem-based civil rights organization, asking for evidence to back up Sharpton’s statement. Neither responded.

But we found that the day before Sharpton’s program aired, the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison carried an article about milk for schoolchildren in Baraboo, which is about an hour northwest of the state capital.

The newspaper article said the Baraboo School District ""decided to end its practice of providing milk with students' morning snack this year, citing concerns the state might eliminate subsidies for the program.""

Sharpton wasn’t the only one to jump on the news.

The article was posted on the website of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state’s largest teachers union. The liberal Daily Kos blog, which has a national following, carried an article of its own. And ""Fabulous Farm Babe"" Pam Jahnke, who does a daily agribusiness report on Wisconsin radio stations, posted a poll question about the issue on her website.  

To sort out whether Sharpton’s characterization of the situation was accurate, we interviewed Crystal Ritzenthaler, the school district’s superintendent; Kevin Vodak, the school board president; and Doug Mering, the board vice president.

All three said school administrators did eliminate milk during morning snack for elementary school students in the 2011-2012 school year.

But they said Walker’s state budget cuts had little, if anything, to do with the decision, which Ritzenthaler, the superintendent, said was made in spring 2011 while Walker’s budget was being debated.

The three Baraboo officials said that, for more than a year, the school district’s Wellness Committee had discussed milk being served during snack time and that the decision to eliminate the milk was recommended by the committee.

Ritzenthaler told us milk during snack was eliminated for a number of reasons: 1. Concern that children were consuming too much milk -- one half-pint carton during breakfast at school, another during morning snack and a third at lunch. There was a concern that the milk reduced the kids’ appetite for lunch, plus the school board wants to promote the drinking of water, which has been substituted for milk at snack time. 2. Concern about the amount of milk wasted because many children drank only a portion of the carton. 3. Administrative time needed to track how much milk was being consumed. Ritzenthaler said less important factors were the $10,400 the school district spent on milk for snack time in 2010-2011 -- and the fact that figure likely was to increase because Walker’s budget cut 10 percent from the state’s funding of the program.

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie confirmed the 10 percent cut.

The same set of reasons was cited in a May 25, 2011 email from Baraboo schools administrator and principal Molly Fitzgerald informing her fellow elementary school principals that milk at snack time would be eliminated. The email added that state funding for the program ""may be eliminated anyway in the state budget.""  

Vodak, the school board president, was emphatic that budgetary considerations played little or no role in the decision to stop serving milk during snack time. He said he believed administrators cited cost as one of the reasons to eliminate the program only ""as an afterthought"" in explaining the decision.

So, is that the final word on why Baraboo kids aren’t drinking milk at snack time? Not quite. Although the May 2011 email from Fitzgerald to principals emphasized non-budgetary reasons for eliminating milk at snack time, she gave a different response when interviewed by the local newspaper for an article Sept. 2. The program was eliminated ""due to concerns the state might eliminate"" its funding, the Baraboo News-Republic quoted Fitzgerald as saying. News of the decision in early September troubled the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, so Laura Wilford, director of the board’s Wisconsin Dairy Council, contacted Baraboo school officials. She said she was told cost was the major reason for eliminating the program and that school officials were concerned about the condition of the Baraboo schools budget as well as cuts in state funding. Ritzenthaler said the Baraboo paper didn’t accurately report Fitzgerald’s comments and that Fitzgerald has tried to clarify to the dairy council the non-budget reasons for eliminating milk at snack time.

We also asked Ritzenthaler for copies of minutes of recent meetings of the school district’s Wellness Committee, which Baraboo officials said had discussed the milk at snack program for a year or two. But she said the discussions aren’t reflected in the minutes.

OK, it’s almost break time.

In criticizing Walker, Sharpton said ""one school district is so worried about losing state funding that it has stopped giving milk to elementary school kids during snack time."" Baraboo school officials now say state budget cuts had little or nothing to do with the decision to stop providing milk at snack time, but previously some of them indicated that fear of state budget cuts was the main reason.

"['Georgia', 'Public Health', 'Chris  McCalla']","
 Tobacco group claims Ohio smoking ban led to major job losses
","
Debate over proposed government-enforced smoking bans generally follow a prescribed path.

Public health advocates tout the health benefits of reduced smoking while bar and restaurant owners complain about potential lost business. Often the debate ranks high on the rhetorical scale but is limited in hard facts.

So it got our attention when the International Premium Cigar & Pipe Retailers Association, based in Coumbus, Ga., released a statement last month by its legislative director, Chris McCalla, in opposition to an expansion of the DeKalb County smoking ban. McCalla claimed a similar ban in Ohio cost 5,400 jobs in one year to that state’s hospitality industry.

It turns out the claim of Ohio job losses is popular among opponents of smoking bans. We found the claim repeated in letters to the editor in Alabama, on numerous pro-smoking blogs and in news aggregators like Yahoo! News that picked up the association’s news release.

But where did that number come from? Naturally, the first place we looked was Ohio.

The figure of 5,400 jobs lost appears on the website of Opponents of Ohio Bans, a group opposed to the Ohio law approved by voters in 2006. Pam Parker, co-founder of the group, pointed back to the Georgia-based group as a possible source for the statistic.

""I believe that's a number that IPCPR has reported,"" Parker said in an email.

Parker also provided a link to a news release on unemployment figures from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services showing 5,900 hospitality jobs lost in the state over the past year as a possible source. But that report -- part of a larger report on all nonfarm employment -- was from November 2009. The Ohio smoking ban began in May 2007, so the time periods do not match up.

The association referred all questions back to McCalla, but he did not return messages seeking clarification of his statement. A representative from the public relations firm that sent out the news release for the association also did not return calls.

So is there any evidence that McCalla’s statement is correct?

The employment sector he claims coughed up so many jobs because of the smoking ban represents a wide-ranging group of industries that includes bars and restaurants but also takes in sports stadiums, hotels, museums and golf courses to name a few.

Benjamin Johnson, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, said the sector lost 2,200 jobs during the first year of the state’s smoking ban, less than half the claimed amount and a pretty small 0.4 percent decrease in overall employment.

By way of comparison, all nonfarm employment in the state declined by 39,400 during the same period, a decrease of about 0.7 percent, so it makes it tough to see the ban’s direct impact on employment.

Ohio State University public health professor Elizabeth Klein said the research on the economic impact of smoking bans is not even something researchers argue about because of the ""high degree of consistency"" in numerous academic studies. The bans just do not do measurable economic harm. The only downside is that it is hard to get new research published, she said.

""From the academic perspective, most of us are over this. It’s been well established,"" she said.

Despite the academic consensus, this month Klein and her Ohio State colleague Nancy Hood published a study of bars and restaurants in Ohio that found the smoking ban did not have an effect on sales. Klein said the findings mirror her earlier study on the economic impact of a similar ban in Michigan.

Taking a longer look, hospitality employment in Ohio has dropped 2.7 percent, but Klein said that is hardly surprising, given the recession.

""Ohio has had difficulty with employment in a number of areas,"" she said.

In fact, the hospitality industry has fared better than the overall economy in Ohio. Total nonfarm employment has dropped 6.3. percent since 2007, according to federal data.

Back in Georgia, the point is almost entirely academic. In a meeting last week, amid warnings of economic consequences from opponents, the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners voted 4-2 against expanding the county’s indoor smoking ban.

When the smoke cleared, we rated this lost-jobs claim as False.",/factchecks/2011/sep/19/chris-mccalla/tobacco-group-claims-ohio-smoking-ban-led-major-jo/

New Jersey Sierra Club claims New Jersey loses “50 football fields of open space to development every day”
","
A single football field is not an unusual sight, but try to imagine 50 of them being overrun with development -- every day.

That’s what the New Jersey Sierra Club says is happening daily in the Garden State. In a press release posted on its website Sept. 6, the environmental group tossed out that statistic when discussing the effects of development on flooding.

""We are losing 50 football fields of open space to development every day and the more we develop upstream the more flooding we have downstream,"" according to the press release. ""We need to not only limit development but we need to (make) development with less pavement and impervious cover.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that football may be alive and well, but developers in New Jersey aren’t seeing as much playing time as they used to. The environmental group is right that development increases the risk of flooding, but construction activity has declined nationwide.

First, let’s explain how ""50 football fields"" translates into acres, and where the Sierra Club received that figure.

New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel argued that the group’s statistic doesn’t count the two end zones. However, the National Football League identifies the ""field"" as including both end zones.

Based on the league’s measurements, a football field represents about 1.32 acres.

Tittel also told us the statistic was based on research done by Rutgers University’s Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis. The latest data on open space loss available from that center comes from a July 2010 report detailing land-use changes in New Jersey through 2007.

According to that report, an average of 16,061 new acres were developed in 2007, or about 44 acres per day. That level of development equates to about 33 football fields of development per day.

So, based on that data, the Sierra Club’s estimate is off by 17 football fields, or about one-third.

But here’s the larger mistake made by the Sierra Club: that estimate of 33 football fields refers to development as of four years ago.

""You can’t compare ‘07 to today,"" said Dominick Paragano, president of the New Jersey Builders Association. ""It’s a different economy.""

Updated statewide growth figures will be available later this fall, but data already shows a sizable decrease in development in Ocean County between 2007 and 2010, said Rutgers University professor Richard G. Lathrop, one of the authors of that land-use report. Ocean County was one of the faster-growing counties as of 2007.

Two other data sets also demonstrate the downturn in development activity in New Jersey: the number of housing units authorized by building permits, and the number of construction jobs, according to federal and state statistics.

Many developers aren’t even focused on the sprawl-like development targeted by the Sierra Club. More builders are looking at redevelopment opportunities in urban areas, said Kevin Tartaglione, senior vice president and chief operating officer of the development division at Somerset County-based Advance Realty.

Tittel argued that residential development may be down, but commercial development, highway-widening projects and infrastructure development are still under way.

But with fewer development options available to landowners, the Somerset County-based New Jersey Conservation Foundation has been able to preserve more land in recent years, according to executive director Michele Byers.

Whereas the New Jersey Conservation Foundation completed between 15 and 20 transactions annually in the early part of the decade, it completed about 40 in 2009 and then roughly 50 in 2010, she said.

But Byers said the point behind the Sierra Club’s statement is still legitimate, because the potential for development in New Jersey remains.

""We are really working hard to ramp up as much preservation as we can before we lose the opportunity,"" Byers said.

On the Sierra Club’s second point about flooding, the group is right. Two professors confirmed to us that development heightens the risk of flooding, because there are fewer areas to absorb the water.

""So that water has to go someplace,"" said Tulane University associate professor Stephen Nelson, who teaches a course on natural disasters.

Our ruling

The Sierra Club claimed ""50 football fields"" are developed in New Jersey every day, increasing the danger of flooding. Flooding can be a side effect of development, but the group’s statistic doesn’t reflect the steep decline in construction activity during the past four years.

Tittel argues his organization is using the most recent data available, but that still doesn’t make it right. We rate the statement Half True.

Left-leaning think tank writer says Green Bay Packers ""socialist organization""
","
An opinion article by a left-leaning think tank kicked off the National Football League season by positing a provocative theory about the defending Super Bowl champions.

The Sept. 10, 2011 column was written by Scott Keyes of ThinkProgress.org, a website of the Center for American Progress Action Fund. The fund, a Washington, D.C. think tank, is run by John Podesta, who served as chief of staff for President Bill Clinton.

Keyes argued that the NFL is strong partly because it employs what he described as seven progressive policies, such as revenue sharing and a salary cap.

He closed with a bolder statement, declaring:

""Last year’s Super Bowl champions, the Green Bay Packers, are a socialist organization.""

Wait a minute.

Curly Lambeau and Karl Marx kin?

We’ve never heard socialism discussed much by cheese head-wearing tailgaters or the ex-jocks on ESPN.

So, let’s examine the makeup of what some football fans regard as America’s Team and see if Keyes’ claim, which might seem like a Hail Mary pass, scores a touchdown.

Socialism -- at least some form of it -- has a significant history in Wisconsin. In 1910, Milwaukee elected the first Socialist mayor of a major U.S. city and the nation’s first Socialist congressman.

But socialism isn’t easily defined. Merriam-Webster says it advocates ""collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and the distribution of goods."" Encyclopedia Britannica says socialism ""calls for public rather than private ownership or control of property and natural resources.""

The definitions vary enough that, in August 2011, 29 percent of New Jersey registered voters polled by Rutgers University said President Barack Obama is a socialist.

As for what might make the Packers a socialist organization, Keyes asserted in his column that the team has three unique traits: It is community owned, nonprofit and has rules to prevent any individuals from taking control of it.

We asked the 24-year-old Stanford-educated reporter, who hails from Cincinnati Bengals territory, if he wanted to elaborate on his theory. He correctly noted that the Packers’ 112,158 shareholders receive no dividend on their original investment. But he wasn’t quite right when he said they have no voting rights -- they have limited rights, including voting for members of the team’s board of directors.

So, that’s the case made by Keyes.

We posed the question to Jason Wied, the Packers’ vice president of administration/general counsel. He said that, although the team is community owned in the sense that it is owned by shareholders, the shareholders cannot benefit financially in any manner from the team.

""In some way, I suppose we are a blend of the best of the various economic systems/theories -- our structure and system results in a self-sufficient, community-focused enterprise that can’t be bought, sold, or otherwise leveraged for personal gain,"" Wied said in an email. ""Instead, this is an organization whose only business is staying in business.  Any profits are reinvested in the organization or given to charity.""

So, Wied emphasized that while the Packers are community owned, Packers shareholders cannot benefit tangibly from the team.

That’s different from a socialist enterprise, in which owners or members would expect to receive a share of what that enterprise produces. Beyond the joy of Super Bowl victories and the agony of near-misses, Packers shareholders get little more than the opportunity to buy ""exclusive shareholder merchandise"" and tours of team facilities as part of the annual shareholder meeting.

Next, we consulted two experts.

University of Wisconsin-Madison sociologist Erik Olin Wright, who teaches about socialism and is president of the American Sociological Society, called Keyes’ claim a ""perfectly reasonable characterization."" Here are three points he made.

1. Community ownership kept the Packers in Green Bay. Had the team been privately owned in the 1940s and 1950s, when the franchise was in financial jeopardy, profit motive would have led a private owner to move the team to a larger market.

Perhaps. It’s certainly easier for an individual owner to move a franchise than it would be convincing shareholders to approve a move. But shared ownership is only one facet of a socialist organization.

2. Under the team’s bylaws, if the Packers were ever sold, proceeds would go not into someone’s pocket, but to support the Green Bay Packers Foundation, which distributes grants to organizations in Wisconsin.

(Shareholders voted to change the beneficiary -- which had been an American Legion Post in Green Bay -- in 1997. That was the same year they decided to hold the fourth and most recent stock sale in team history, although another is being considered.)

This Packers characteristic is somewhat socialistic -- members of the organization wouldn’t benefit from a sale of the team but, through the foundation, the community at large would.

3. The team is not a capitalist organization because ""it doesn’t maximize profits. It’s organized to support the sporting needs of the community.""

It’s true that, rather than making an owner more rich, Packer profits support ""the community"" in that they are reinvested in the team.

But the Packers, like for-profit NFL teams, take advantage of market-driven revenue options such as season ticket seat licenses and upgrading Lambeau Field to make it a year-round tourist destination. In 2011-2012, the Packers generated a franchise-record $282.6 million in revenue and made $12 million in profit from operations. Those gains weren’t made by pursuing socialist principles.

We also spoke to Marquette University law professor Matthew Parlow, whose specialties include sports law. He made three points in stating the Packers are not a socialist organization:

1. Reinvesting profits into the operation makes the Packers not a socialist organization, but simply a nonprofit one.

As we’ve established, the profits certainly are not shared with the shareholders, as they would be in a socialist organization. In that sense, the Packers are like most any nonprofit that seeks to maximize contributions and minimize expenses.

2. The owners of a socialist organization have a significant say in running the organization, but Packers shareholders have virtually none.

Indeed, when it comes to day-to-day operations, Packers shareholders have no say.

3. The members of a socialist enterprise draw benefits from the enterprise, but Packers shareholders can’t sell or otherwise derive benefits from their stock.

After our consultations, we checked back with Keyes.

He acknowledged that, although he’s a football fan, he’s not an expert on the Packers’ form of ownership. He admitted, for example, that he had wrongly assumed that season tickets came with being a shareholder. He said his main point was that the Packers, while ""not a perfectly or purely socialist"" organization, were far more socialistic than all of the other NFL teams, primarily because they are owned by 112,000 people, not controlled by a single owner.

So, Keyes is moving the goal posts a bit, now characterizing the Packers as more socialistic than other NFL teams, rather than stating flatly that the team is a socialist organization.

Well, did Keyes complete his Hail Mary pass?

The reporter for a left-leaning website said the Green Bay Packers ""are a socialist organization."" His argument gains some support from the team’s community ownership, nonprofit status and the fact that the team’s assets would go to a charitable foundation if the unthinkable ever happened.

Even a Packers executive acknowledged that the Packers organization is a blend of economic systems.

But the fact that the Packers are different than any other NFL team doesn’t make it a socialist organization. Although it pours profits back into the operation, the team is highly capitalistic in its pursuit of maximum revenue.

Moreover, if the Packers were a socialist organization, its shareholders would have a significant say in running the team and derive tangible benefits from it. But their say is small and the tangible benefits are token.

Upon further review, Keyes’ long pass was completed -- but for a first down, not a touchdown.

"['New Jersey', 'Retirement', 'State Budget', 'Hetty Rosenstein']","
Union leader Hetty Rosenstein claims average pensions are $23K for state workers, $14K for local government employees
","
Public employees in New Jersey have to contribute more toward their pensions, but according to union leader Hetty Rosenstein, the average worker isn’t receiving much money during retirement.

Rosenstein, state director of the Communication Workers of America, recently made that claim when hers and other unions filed a lawsuit challenging a new state law that demands workers pay more toward their pension and health benefits.

""New Jersey made a promise to its public workers: work hard, serve the people of New Jersey, and take a salary that is less than what you might earn in the private sector – and you can look forward to a secure and stable retirement,"" Rosenstein said in an Aug. 31 press release. ""It is not lavish: the average state pension, including managers, is $23,000 a year; and just $14,000 for local government workers.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Rosenstein’s pension estimates need some clarification. Depending on when workers retired and how long they served, some average pensions are higher than what she claimed.

Before we talk about payments, let’s briefly explain New Jersey’s pension system.

The state has five major pension funds covering various public workers. Rosenstein told us her figures refer to the Public Employees’ Retirement System, or PERS, the fund covering most CWA members.

Data on state workers from the New Jersey Department of the Treasury back up Rosenstein’s claim that her members mostly belong to PERS.

Pension amounts vary, depending on a worker’s salary and years of service. On top of pensions, most public workers also receive subsidized health benefits in retirement.

Now, let’s explain how Rosenstein arrived at her estimates.

Rosenstein referred us to the average payments made by the state under PERS in the year preceding July 1, 2009.

According to that data, which includes most retirement types, the state paid, on average, $22,034 to retired state workers or their beneficiaries. The average annual payment made on behalf of retired local workers was $14,028. More recent data show similar average payments.

Those figures support Rosenstein’s statement, but looking at state payments is just one way of measuring average pensions.

Another way is looking at the average annual benefits due to retirees when they retired. That measurement is different than what Rosenstein cited, because it reflects what workers would be paid on a full-year basis. The state payment data includes part-year payments made to new retirees.

When we consider the average annual benefits at the date of retirement, Rosenstein’s numbers fall short for new retirees.

As of July 1, 2010, the average annual pension among four types of retirement under PERS was $21,145 for all state retirees and $13,579 for all local retirees. Those figures exclude cost-of-living adjustments granted after retirement.

Those numbers are close to Rosenstein’s estimates, but the average annual pension for ""new retirees"" -- people who had retired within the previous year -- was $30,199 for state workers and $20,075 for local workers.

Still, average benefits can be weighted down by people with fewer years of service, said Bill Hallmark, an actuary with the American Academy of Actuaries. To judge the lavishness of a pension, one should consider benefits paid to full-career employees, he said.

In fact, Treasury data shows that nearly half of PERS retirees in the two largest retirement groups left their jobs after 25 or more years of service -- and some of those folks are taking home the largest pensions.

In the year preceding July 1, 2010, here’s the average annual pensions for new retirees with at least 25 years of service who opted for a special retirement: $39,551 for state workers and $33,828 for local workers.

It’s also worth noting that the average annual pension in two other funds covering a small number of CWA members in state government are higher than the estimates provided by Rosenstein.

Our ruling

Rosenstein claimed average pensions are $23,000 for state workers and $14,000 for local government workers. Her numbers are mostly accurate when you consider the average annual payments made by the state under PERS, and also when you look at the average annual benefits for all retirees at the date of retirement.

But new retirees in PERS are receiving larger pensions than what Rosenstein suggested. Also, some CWA members are members of other pension funds where average pensions are even higher.

We rate the statement Half True.

Cicilline says he opposed a measure on use of deadly force by military members because it didn’t change existing rules of engagement
","
In recent weeks, U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, D-R.I., has come under fire for voting against an amendment which a Florida lawmaker says would give U.S. troops in conflict areas the right to ""proactively defend themselves.""

Talk show host Helen Glover took Cicilline to task earlier this month for the vote on the amendment to the military’s ""rules of engagement."" She was joined on WHJJ’s ""Helen Glover Show""  by Michael Napolitano, spokesman for John Loughlin, who was Cicilline’s Republican opponent in 2010. Loughlin, an Army lieutenant colonel currently serving in Iraq, is one of two Republicans seeking to knock Cicilline from the seat in 2012.

Monique Chartier, a columnist for the conservative Anchor Rising blog, also took aim at Cicilline, challenging him in a blog posting to explain his vote ""without platitudes and with specificity.""

Cicilline responded in a letter addressed to Chartier. He said that he joined 141 other Democrats and 18 Republicans in voting against the amendment in May ""because it does nothing to change existing rules of engagement for American service members....""

Cicilline went on to say that ""our men and women in uniform already possess the right to bear arms whenever they are in harm’s way. Furthermore, when they are instructed on the rules of engagement, our troops are explicitly told that nothing prevents them from using deadly force to defend themselves.""

We wondered whether Cicilline was right when he said the amendment would do nothing to change existing rules.

U.S. Rep. John L. Mica, a Florida Republican, introduced the amendment to the 2012 Defense Reauthorization Act in response to conversations he’d had with troops in Afghanistan during a  congressional visit. He told The Wall Street Journal that when he asked the troops if there was anything he could do to help them do their job better, they told him they ""felt constrained"" by the current rules of engagement.

Gerry Lynam, Mica’s legislative assistant, explained Mica’s amendment this way:

The military’s counterinsurgency strategy requires a soldier to ""go through a whole checklist"" prior to taking any defensive action, Lynman said, and soldiers lose ""the ability to defend themselves.""

""The purpose of this amendment was to have the military give them (troops) a little more leeway to protect themselves.""

Mica’s amendment to the 2012 defense reauthorization act, passed in the House by a vote of 260 to 160. (Voting for the bill were 127 Republicans and 43 Democrats, including U.S. Rep. James Langevin, D-R.I. The amendment is now before a Senate committee.)  

The amendment reads: ""The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the rules of engagement applicable to members of the Armed Forces assigned to duty in any hostile fire area designated for purposes of section 310 or 351 (a) (1) of title 37, Unites States Code -- (1) fully protect the members’ right to bear arms; and (2) authorize the members to fully defend themselves from hostile actions.""

So, would change the current rules of engagement for troops in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq?

We asked three military experts. They all said no.

""The ROE (rules of engagement) never constrain a soldier’s right to self defense,"" said Gary D. Solis, an author, law professor and 26-year veteran of two combat tours in Vietnam. ""You can always defend yourself. Always.""

Solis has a Ph.D. in the law of war from the London School of Economics and formerly headed the Law War program at West Point. He now teaches several courses at George Washington University Law School and Georgetown University Law Center.

The ""rules of engagement,’’ Solis said, are specific directives  used by senior commanders to regulate the use of force in armed conflict. ""They tell a soldier, Marine or sailor when he or she may use deadly force,"" he said.

Anyone who understands the rules of engagement, he said, knows that the troops always have the right to defend themselves.

""This (Mica’s amendment) is not a matter of protecting soldiers,’’ Solis said. ""This is military ignorance combined with political opportunism.""

Victor Hansen, a professor at New England Law in Boston, described the language in Mica’s amendment -- ""to proactively defend"" -- as ""loaded"" and so broad that it was impossible to define for a practical purpose.

""I’m not sure I know what that means,"" Hansen said, ""nor am I sure that those who voted for the amendment could give a very clear definition of what it  means.""

If the amendment became law, we asked, would it have any effect on the troops in Afghanistan or Iraq?

""I doubt it,"" Hansen said. ""This is so vague it’s not providing any clear guidance. I can’t see as it would have any practical effect on the ground.""

We also talked to Francis J. ""Bing"" West, a former assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs during the Reagan administration and award-winning author who lives in Newport. His most recent book, ""The Wrong War: Grit, Strategy, and the Way Out of Afghanistan,’’ was published by Random House in February.

What did West think the amendment would do?

Nothing, he said, except to create years of ""arguments among lawyers"" over what it means.

To test the experts’ view that the amendment doesn’t change anything, we asked the U.S. Army press office: Do the current rules of engagement allow U.S. military personnel to proactively defend themselves from hostile actions?

""Yes,"" U.S. Major Jason Waggoner, an Army press spokesman, replied in an e-mail. ""U.S. Forces always retain the inherent right of self defense. Nothing in the current Rules of Engagement (ROE) limits this right.""

In summary, Cicilline said Mica’s amendment would do nothing to change existing rules of engagement for service members. The experts we consulted agreed.

"['Oregon', 'Voting Record', 'Ted Piccolo']","
Max Williams, Rob Patridge, Ben Westlund, Lynn Lundquist, Lane Shetterly: Which three Republicans later became Democrats?
","
The Oregon Republican Party recently voted to strip anti-gay language from its party platform, prompting one popular online blogger to muse that platforms aren’t super relevant. In a follow-up comment, Ted Piccolo, who posts as ""I am Coyote,"" wrote:

""You had folks like Ben Westlund, Rob Patridge, Max Williams, Lane Shetterly, Lynn Lundquist all get elected. All of them were opposed to the (social-conservative) portion of the ‘platform.' And guess what? They ended up folding like a lawn chair on the fiscal battles as well. Heck three of them ended up becoming Democrats later.""

PolitiFact Oregon knows Salem well enough to identify the late Ben Westlund as a former Republican turned independent turned Democrat. But the other four? We were pretty sure they were still firmly in the Republican camp -- and would rather be lawn chairs than give up their GOP affiliation. (OK, we’re not positive on that last part.)

Lundquist was Republican Speaker of the Oregon House in 1997. He ran a cattle and mint ranch outside of Powell Butte in Central Oregon. And as of Sept. 15, he was still registered Republican in Crook County.

The same goes for Patridge, who serves on the staff of Oregon’s only Republican U.S. representative and is running for district attorney in Jackson County; Williams, who oversees the state Department of Corrections; and Shetterly, a former director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development who now practices law. All three served in the Oregon House, as Republicans.

So, what gives? Piccolo owned up to using ""a little blog short hand."" (PolitiFact Oregon can’t resist pointing this out as a lesson in always checking what you read, especially on the Internet.) He said he is much more careful about language in official blog posts than comments -- but he stands by his assertion that Westlund, Williams and Shetterly are really Democrats.

""... Westlund left the party entirely to run as a Democrat, Williams and Shetterly caved so much that they were appointed by and went to work for a Democratic administration. Whether those two changed parties entirely I'm not sure. But the policies they began supporting after they moved on to their appointments in the State government were pretty much anathema to those of the party.""

Williams said through a spokeswoman that he has been a Republican for as long as he’s been registered to vote. Shetterly said he, too, has stayed one.

In any case, Piccolo is not alone in complaining about the GOP credibility of Shetterly, Williams and Patridge. In 2003, the trio defied House GOP leadership to push a revenue raising plan so hairy that legislators were lobbied day and night over the vote and threatened with tough primaries. Williams and Shetterly left to take state jobs offered by then Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat. Patridge decided against running for re-election.

(Lundquist went on to head the Oregon Business Association, which has been slammed by some conservatives for pushing more government spending.)

Piccolo was gracious enough to talk to us about a throwaway comment posted online. He acknowledged he could have explained what he meant more fully. Generally, we think people should be able to criticize elected officials and opine freely without worrying about the raters at PolitiFact.

But we have to call this one out, if only to set the party record straight. Shetterly and Williams may not be Republicans in Coyote’s eyes, but according to registration records, they remain Republican voters. He could have called them RINOs, Republican in name only, but he chose to call them Democrats -- for him a more derogatory term. We rate the claim False, knowing full well that others would rate this anywhere from True to a Pants on Fire, depending on their political views.",/factchecks/2011/sep/17/ted-piccolo/max-williams-rob-patridge-ben-westlund-lynn-lundqu/

Save Our Springs says water utility customers have used less water on peak day every year since 2001
","
Crediting conservation in Austin, the Save Our Springs Alliance said in an Aug. 16, 2011, entry in its online newsletter: ""Ten years ago the Austin Water Utility used a total of 240.3 million gallons. Every summer since then our peak day of water use has been lower.""

After noting that this year’s peak water use in a day was 217 million gallons, the entry continues: ""So raise a tall glass of ice water in honor of our success: water conservation gains have outpaced population growth for a decade. Add a ‘Salud!’ to another 10 years of flat or declining water use — easily achieved with cost-effective conservation measures and an emerging ‘culture of conservation,’ one that recognizes that we can thrive and be happy without oversized, overwatered New England-style turf grass lawns.""

We can’t check on the next decade, but we can check if peak water usage has been less every year than what it was in 2001.

Indeed, the Austin Water Utility sent us figures indicating that on the peak days of water consumption from 2002 through August 2011, customers used less water than the 240.3 million gallons used on Aug. 13, 2001, though that was barely so in one year.

The greatest peak use day since 2001 was Aug. 26, 2006, when usage was 240.17 million gallons — about 5/100ths of a percent shy of the amount gulped, flushed and otherwise used in 2001. The lowest peak-use amount in the 10 years after 2001 was 176.98 million gallons on Aug. 13, 2007.

Put another way, the average peak water use in a day in the period was about 214 million gallons, 11 percent off the 2001 peak.

The utility’s director, Greg Meszaros, told us in an interview that conservation helps explain the lower peak-use amounts, though he said consumption generally bounces around year to year partly due to variations in the weather — rainy summers reduce demand — and the economy.

Per-capita water consumption has been relatively flat, Meszaros said, since the utility instituted a conservation program in 2007 that, among features, encourages customers to use low-water appliances and limit lawn watering.

According to the utility, customers have used less water per person lately than individuals did in past years. Per-capita daily use has averaged 190 gallons or more four times since 1990, the last time being 2006. Average per-person consumption slid to 151 gallons in 2007, reached 170 gallons in 2008 and then dipped two straight years, reaching less than 140 gallons in 2010. Daryl Slusher, an assistant director for the utility, said the average will approach 160 gallons for the year that ends Sept. 30.

Save Our Springs maintains the area’s conservation successes demonstrate that a water treatment plant slated for Northwest Austin won’t be needed for many years.

Meszaros told us Austin needs the new plant because two current plants can’t be relied on indefinitely. Also, he said, the new project will include a vital water transmission main easing the delivery of water to the fast-growing northern third of the utility’s service area. ""We’re not doing (the new plant) just to meet a peak water demand,"" Meszaros said.

In an interview, Bill Bunch, SOS’s executive director, expressed skepticism about strains in the existing water delivery system. He also said there’s not sufficient water demand to justify the new one and forwarded an April 2002 recommendation from city staff about preliminary engineering for the new plant. The document states the plant would be needed by 2009 to meet increasing water demands, predicting too that the utility’s peak one-day demand in summer 2009 would be 281 million gallons; the peak amount that year turned out to be 228 million gallons.

Utility spokesman Kevin Buchman later told us by email that in 2002, the ""main reason for moving forward with the construction of a new plant was to meet the projected demands."" He said, though, the utility’s mid-decade focus on conservation allowed the city to postpone the plant’s completion by more than five years. ""Also,"" Buchman said, ""since 2002 we have had one of our (originally three) plants decommissioned and our other two water plants have been expanded as much as possible.""

Michele Bachmann says HPV vaccine can cause mental retardation
","
After criticizing Texas Gov. Rick Perry for mandating a vaccine for school girls, Rep. Michele Bachmann added some scary charges: She claimed to have just met a woman whose daughter suffered mental retardation from the vaccine, that it has ""very dangerous consequences"" and that it puts ""little children's lives at risk.""

In the CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa on Sept. 12, 2011, Bachmann blasted Perry for mandating a vaccine for school girls to guard against human papilloma virus, or HPV, which can cause cervical cancer. The vaccine can prevent the virus, but the virus is sexually transmitted, which makes the idea of requiring the inoculation of young girls controversial among some parents. 

Perry issued an executive order requiring the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating all girls entering sixth grade receive a vaccination against HPV. The order included an opt-out, allowing exemptions if parents objected for philosophical or religious reasons. (Read more on the history of the executive order.)

Critics raised two major objections to Perry's 2007 order -- that the state should not require vaccinations for sexually transmitted diseases, and that parents should be asked beforehand whether they wanted their children vaccinated. The Legislature overruled Perry's order, and during the presidential campaign, Perry has said he made a mistake by ordering the vaccinations without consent of the Legislature. 

During the debate, Bachmann suggested that the vaccine maker, Merck & Co., used political influence to get Perry's approval for the vaccine, Gardasil. She also suggested that the vaccine might be harmful to the young girls who received it, saying, ""Little girls who have a negative reaction to this potentially dangerous drug don't get a 'mulligan'"" -- that is, a do-over. 
Bachmann received applause for her attacks. 

But in subsequent interviews, Bachmann became more specific that the vaccine harmed children's health.

Here's what she said in an interview on Fox News: 
""There's a woman who came up crying to me tonight after the debate. She said her daughter was given that vaccine. She told me her daughter suffered mental retardation as a result of that vaccine. There are very dangerous consequences. It's not good enough to take, quote, 'a mulligan' where you want a do-over, not when you have little children's lives at risk."" 
And here's what she told NBC's ""Today Show"": 
""Well, I will tell you that I had a mother last night come up to me here in Tampa, Florida, after the debate,"" Bachmann said. ""She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter. It can have very dangerous side effects. The mother was crying what she came up to me last night. I didn't know who she was before the debate. This is a very real concern and people have to draw their own conclusions."" 
So while Bachmann hedged somewhat that people can ""draw their own conclusions,"" she still made a very clear suggestion that the vaccine can cause retardation and puts ""little children's lives at risk.""

When asked about the remark on Sept. 15, 2011, in San Rafael, Calif., Bachmann continued to hedge somewhat, saying, ""I didn't make any statements that would indicate I'm a doctor, I'm a scientist, or making any conclusions about the drug one way or the other."" She added that she was merely relaying the concerns of a woman who was ""very distraught."" But Bachmann turned down a chance to apologize for her earlier comments.

Soon after Bachmann made the claim, medical professionals raced to counter the notion that an HPV vaccination can cause mental retardation.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, which includes 60,000 primary care pediatricians, released the following statement: 
""The American Academy of Pediatrics would like to correct false statements made in the Republican presidential campaign that HPV vaccine is dangerous and can cause mental retardation. There is absolutely no scientific validity to this statement. Since the vaccine has been introduced, more than 35 million doses have been administered, and it has an excellent safety record. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Family Physicians all recommend that girls receive HPV vaccine around age 11 or 12. That’s because this is the age at which the vaccine produces the best immune response in the body, and because it’s important to protect girls well before the onset of sexual activity. In the U.S., about 6 million people, including teens, become infected with HPV each year, and 4,000 women die from cervical cancer. This is a life-saving vaccine that can protect girls from cervical cancer.""

Many in the medical community pointed to the vaccine's track record in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. This is a database co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration that tracks ""adverse"" health events following vaccinations, ranging from minor to serious. The database has limitations -- some adverse events may not be overlooked if VAERS isn't notified, and the agencies who run it caution that just because an adverse event happened, it doesn't mean that the vaccination was the cause.

However, VAERS is the largest such database available, and measured by its standards, the HPV vaccine in question has fared well in terms of possible side effects:

""As of June 22, 2011, approximately 35 million doses of Gardasil were distributed in the U.S. and VAERS received a total of 18,727 reports of adverse events following Gardasil vaccination. ... Of the total number of VAERS reports following Gardasil, 92 percent were considered to be non-serious, and 8 percent were considered serious. ... The vast majority (92 percent) of the adverse events reports following Gardasil vaccination have included fainting, pain, and swelling at the injection site (the arm), headache, nausea, and fever. Syncope (fainting) is common after injections and vaccinations, especially in adolescents. Falls after fainting may sometimes cause serious injuries, such as head injuries, which can be prevented by closely observing the person for 15 minutes after vaccination.""

The remaining 8 percent of adverse events included such serious ailments as Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a nervous system disorder, blood clots and even death. However, the official analysis of the VAERS data is that the incidence of Guillain-Barré did not exceed the level in the comparable population at large, that ""most"" of the people who experienced blood clots also had other risk factors for clots, and that analysis of the 32 confirmed deaths suggested that either the deaths had been attributed to other causes or that ""there was no unusual pattern or clustering to the deaths that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine.""

Notably absent is any mention of mental retardation. And the official conclusion based on the VAERS data is this: ""Based on all of the information we have today, CDC recommends HPV vaccination for the prevention of most types of cervical cancer.""

As our friends at FactCheck.org also noted, a blue ribbon panel convened by the Institute of Medicine has released a report in August about adverse events and vaccines, including HPV vaccines. The experts did find ""strong and generally suggestive"" evidence that a different condition -- a serious allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis -- may be caused by the HPV vaccine. It also found four published reports of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, a neurological condition that could impair mental capabilities. 

But Joseph Bocchini -- the chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (Shreveport) and a member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices -- told FactCheck.org that even if the symptoms of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis mirrored those seen by the woman who spoke to Bachmann, the number of cases was too small to assign any causal connection to the vaccine.

So, beyond anaphylaxis, the IOM panel did not find any causal evidence to link adverse events to the vaccine.

We checked with a couple experts in pediatric medicine for their view on Bachmann's claim. They said there was no scientific evidence to support it, and they added that the HPV vaccine has undergone the full complement of safety testing that all vaccines must undergo before going on the market. 

""I have no qualms about advising this is a safe vaccine,"" said Christopher Harrison, a doctor and the director of the infectious disease research laboratory at Children's Mercy Hospitals in Kansas City, Mo. ""The millions of doses that have been given make clinicians comfortable recommending and giving it.""

""I've given it to both my daughters,"" said Kenneth Alexander, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Chicago Medical Center. ""It's as safe or safer as any vaccine out there.""

""This is an anti-cancer vaccine. We should be going to the rooftops and shouting 'Huzzah!'"" said William Schaffner, chair of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.

Our ruling 
In several national television appearances, Bachmann said a woman reported her child had experienced mental retardation after receiving an HPV vaccination. We can't judge the specifics of that case -- neither the woman nor the daughter have been identified as far as we could find and skeptics have offered a reward if the victim can be found. But even if Bachmann's portrayal of what happened is accurate, it falls well short of the scientific standard for demonstrating causality between an inoculation and an adverse health event.

Democrats say two-thirds of New Hampshire residents do not support the tea party
","
The New Hampshire primary has many fine traditions:  house parties in cramped farmhouse parlors; town hall meetings with substantive questions from well-informed voters; and icy storms that punish Washington-based reporters who thought duck boots were a crime against fashion. 
Yet another tradition is sniping from state party officials who try to inflict a little collateral damage on the other team’s candidates, especially the front-runners. 
Such is the case with New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley, whose team of operatives has been especially focused on Republican Mitt Romney, who proved in his 2002 gubernatorial victory in Massachusetts that he can appeal to suburban, independent voters. 
When Romney earlier this month decided to attend a Tea Party Express event in Concord, Buckley issued a news release deriding ""Mitt Romney’s Official Tea Party Debut."" 
""The Tea Party does not represent the majority of Granite Staters,"" Buckley asserted. ""This is evidenced by the Tea Party-backed State House Republicans here, who in only nine months have amounted to one of the most unpopular legislatures in New Hampshire's history.

""Two-thirds of Granite Staters oppose the Tea Party and Romney’s Right to Work for Less agenda, and even more oppose the GOP plan to end Medicare as we know it.""

For this fact-check, we're examining Buckley's claim that two-thirds oppose the tea party and its support for a controversial ""right-to-work"" bill in Concord. Considering that tea party voters helped fuel a huge Republican victory in New Hampshire legislative races in 2010, Buckley’s statement, if true, would indicate a rather abrupt change of heart.

Asked for backup for Buckley’s claim, New Hampshire Democratic Party spokeswoman Holly Shulman cited a New Hampshire Tea Party website that strongly endorses legislation that would weaken unions’ clout by preventing them from collecting dues or fees from nonmembers covered by union contracts. She also cited polls by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center that show strong support for the right to collectively bargain.

There is no doubt that the New Hampshire Tea Party Coalition news release for a May 25, 2011, rally identifies the ""right to work"" bill as ""the most important piece of legislation for the future health of the New Hampshire economy that will be considered in this session or any other session.""

And Romney, does, indeed, support ""right-to-work"" laws, and has specifically spoken in favor of the GOP bill in Concord, which would end a practice allowing union contracts to include a clause requiring non-union workers to pay a share of collective bargaining costs.

New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, vetoed the bill, and supporters have been unable to muster an override.

But there are two major issues with Buckley’s claim: First, it suggests that two-thirds of New Hampshire voters oppose the tea party, not just its agenda on labor issues.  And secondly, it distorts what is known about public opinion on the union issue.

Polls show Buckley is correct in saying the tea party doesn’t represent ""the majority"" of Granite Staters, but to suggest that two-thirds oppose the group is a big stretch.

UNH Survey Center director Andrew Smith said his group’s most recent poll, in July 2011, showed that 27 percent of New Hampshire adults supported the tea party, 35 percent were opposed, and 38 percent were neutral or said they didn’t know.

""This has been pretty consistent for the past year,"" he said by e-mail.

Shulman also referred PolitiFact to a New York Times/CBS News poll on Aug. 5, 2011, and wrote, ""Recent national polls show the tea party is very unpopular."" That national poll, incidentally, found 20 percent of Americans with a favorable view of the tea party, 40 percent unfavorable, and 39 percent saying they were either undecided or hadn’t heard enough about the group.

But Smith told us that opinion on the tea party in New Hampshire tracks closely along political affiliation -- support among Republicans, opposition among Democrats, and mixed opinion among independents, with more than 50 percent of them neutral about the group.

""I can see what (the Democrats) are trying to do, but I don’t think that saying that two-thirds of people in New Hampshire oppose the tea party accurately reflects public opinion,"" Smith said.

He also takes some exception with how Buckley’s team is characterizing the polling data on unions. The UNH Survey Center poll in May, which Democrats cited, asked respondents whether public- and private-sector workers should have the right to form unions and negotiate pay and benefits.

And, indeed, there is support for unionization on that front in both sectors. Sixty-six percent of respondents said workers should have the right to unionize, with only 20 percent opposed, and the numbers for government workers, specifically, weren’t much different.

But Smith said his polling specifically avoided using ""right to work,"" which refers to laws outlawing compulsory dues paying.  

Using the phrase ""right to work,"" Smith said, ""doesn’t accurately reflect"" what his poll question asked.

Our ruling 
Buckley said ""Two-thirds of Granite Staters oppose the Tea Party"" and its agenda on labor unions. 
But UNH polls show the opposition to the tea party is about 35 percent, about half as much as Buckley says. 
And while New Hampshire voters support the right to form unions and negotiate, the polls Democrats cite don’t ask about the also contentious issue of compulsory union dues.

Suzanne Bonamici says she’s different from other Democrats in instances of business, consumer protection and free trade
","
The two major party candidates vying for a congressional seat in January’s 1st District special election both claim to be independent and bipartisan.

At a recent debate co-hosted by the Independent Party of Oregon, former Democratic state Sen. Suzanne Bonamici and Republican businessman Rob Cornilles were asked to provide hard evidence. John Schrag of The Forest Grove News-Times asked:
  
""...Can you provide three specific examples of where you differ from your party on matters of policy that are either now before Congress or we can expect to come before Congress in the next couple of years?"" 
We will consider Bonamici’s three examples, on business, consumer protection and free trade, with this question in mind: Did she, in fact, differ with her party on matters of policy?

Overall, Bonamici said she looks at policy on its merits, regardless of the forces behind it. 
""And that happened in the last session, when my party Democratic chair didn’t want to hear a bill that I thought was good for Oregon business. I convinced that chair to hear the bill, it passed and it’s helping an Oregon business right now,"" she said. 

House Bill 2095, now law, allows Oregon to join a multi-state compact that makes it easier for insurers to offer new products. It passed out of the Oregon House on a 48-10 vote and landed in the consumer protection committee of Sen. Chip Shields, D-Portland. He was afraid the compact would erode local oversight. Bonamici favored the bill and convinced him to allow a vote in committee.

""She bucked a Democratic chairman; no one would have had an opportunity (to vote) had she not taken on her Democratic chairman,"" said Carol Butler, Bonamici’s campaign manager.  

Still, the proposal cleared the Senate 28-2. While the no votes came from Democrats, most in her party supported the bill. We give her credit for changing Shields’ mind, but we rule this portion False.
  
Bonamici: ""Another place where I’ve differed -- in fact I’ve become a leader in my party -- and that’s on consumer protection issues: cracking down on mortgage fraud, making sure that people who are facing foreclosure have all the opportunities that they can to prevent losing their home, protecting seniors and middle class families from scams. I’ve been a leader and strengthened my party in that way."" 
That’s a sweet talking point. But consumer protection is an issue on which Democrats have long prided themselves. Oregon Senate Democrats highlighted the issue as an agenda item for the 2011 Legislature -- and proudly claimed success after the session.

Still, the director of Economic Fairness Oregon insists that many Democrats would have been happy approving watered-down legislation if not for Bonamici’s advocacy. ""The best example,"" said Angela Martin, ""is in her advocacy of consumer protection with teeth.""  

So let’s accept that Bonamici goaded skittish Democrats into supporting more consumer friendly legislation. That still doesn’t make up for the fact that siding with consumers is supposed to be a key part of the Democratic Party platform. To suggest otherwise is silly. We could rate this a Pants on Fire. 
Bonamici: ""And finally, during this campaign I could have taken the easy way in a primary campaign and said I wouldn’t support the free trade agreements that were pending before Congress. I took my time and did research and came to a reasoned conclusion about those, rather than just take a party line approach on those."" 

Congress approved agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, earlier this year. Generally, businesses like trade agreements as a way to get goods into other countries. Labor groups argue they will lose jobs.

In the special primary election, Bonamici’s main rivals came out against the trade agreements. Bonamici refused to take a position then, saying that she would need specifics in order to vote. Job creation in the district would be her main criterion.

But is being opposed to free trade the party-line approach?

Oregon’s Democratic delegation split on the proposals. Sen. Ron Wyden and Reps. Earl Blumenauer and Kurt Schrader came down on the free-trade side (although Blumenauer and Schrader did vote against the pact with Colombia, where there are particular concerns over the killing of unionists). Sen. Jeff Merkley and Rep. Peter DeFazio voted against all three.

Bonamici now says she would vote for the South Korean agreement, but against the other two.

We don’t see how her position differs with those in her party. Democrats in Congress split. But we’ll give her a Mostly False, because she was under pressure from her primary opponents.

We get what Bonamici is trying to say.

In the first case, she differed with Shields, a Democrat, who controlled the committee, but not from the rest of her caucus. In the second case, she differed with some Democrats who, according to one lobbyist, had to be coaxed into tougher legislation. In the third case, she differed with her primary opponents.

But that doesn’t mean she’s differed with Democrats on matters of policy. We combine the three mini-rulings to come up with a False.",/factchecks/2011/dec/10/suzanne-bonamici/suzanne-bonamici-says-shes-different-other-democra/

Does Suzanne Bonamici vote a partisan 98 percent of the time with her party?
","
Both major party candidates in the Jan. 31 election for the 1st Congressional District want voters to think they are independent, bipartisan, above party-line bickering.

So it’s no surprise that Republican Rob Cornilles and his supporters like to say that former Democratic state Sen. Suzanne Bonamici ""votes 98 percent of the time"" with her caucus. He said that the day after winning the special primary election. And he said it again at a recent debate.

""She has talked about separating herself from her party but the reality is she votes 98 percent of the time with the Democrats in Salem. I don’t know how that represents bipartisanship; that represents to me more of the same,"" he said. (And in a follow-up press release.)

Allen Alley, chairman of the Oregon Republican Party, repeated the sentiment in a Nov. 15 press release: ""Bonamici's narrow world and economic view explains why she's voted in the Oregon legislature with her party 98 percent of the time,"" he said.

Bonamici’s campaign pleaded with PolitiFact Oregon to provide context for the claim. After all, legislators take many votes that are routine, so Democrats and Republicans end up voting the same way more often than you’d think. Game on, we said.

Mary Anne Ostrom, Cornilles’ campaign manager, said the 98 percent figure comes from The Oregonian’s ""Your Government"" website. The O’s web designer and developer Mark Friesen set up the site so readers can see how legislators voted on a bill, and how often they voted with their party.

The 2011 Oregon Senate was split 16-14, with Democrats in the majority. The Senate took about 950 floor votes. It’s true that, according to our website, Bonamici voted with her party 98 percent of the time -- but voting with your party 98 percent of the time doesn’t mean you necessarily voted against the other party. 
We asked Friesen to check Bonamici’s votes against three Republicans in the Senate: Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli of John Day; Jackie Winters of Salem; and Bruce Starr of Hillsboro. Winters is a fierce advocate of social services and Starr is a leader on transportation issues. All three are considered solid Republicans.

Bonamici voted the same way as Winters 89.6 percent of the time; with Ferrioli, 76 percent; and with Starr, 73 percent. In other words, she and a Republican voted the same way anywhere from 73 percent to nearly 90 percent of the time. (During the 2010 special session, she voted with Winters 87 percent of the time and in 2009, 77 percent of the the time, for an overall average of 83 percent from 2009-11.)  

In our view, that makes Bonamici more than a ""button-pushing"" partisan.

We went a step further, just to see how she sides with Democrats on narrower votes. We took a database of 2011 session votes provided by Bonamici’s campaign and  winnowed the list down to 106 votes that were lopsided -- 20 votes out of 30 -- or where Bonamici voted no. Here’s what we found:

She voted with her party in roughly 91 instances where the issue fell along party lines. For example, she approved a bill to increase driver fees, and she joined other Democrats in voting against legislation favoring online charter schools. Bonamici also voted to change the kicker ""refund check"" into a kicker ""credit"" and she voted in favor of expanding Oregon’s Bottle Bill. Those are all positions taken by the majority of her party.

In some 15 instances, she was among the no votes, sometimes joining with other Democrats or with Democrats and Republicans. For example, she voted against compromise legislation creating a health exchange. But we don’t see her siding with Republicans against her party.

We need to add a crucial bit of information, since Cornilles brings up bipartisanship. Bonamici was chairwoman of the Senate Redistricting Committee and successfully helped negotiate a redistricting agreement with a split House. Lawmakers failed to do that in 2001 or in 1991; redistricting occurs every 10 years.  

Where does that leave us?

Well, we know that the methodology relied on by the Cornilles campaign is incomplete because it ignores votes that are unanimous or near unanimous. Also, Bonamici was one of the legislators charged with creating a bipartisan redistricting map, and by most accounts she did splendidly. So it’s not accurate to say she lacks bipartisanship skills. On the other hand, we find that she usually votes with her party on significant issues.

Based on the evidence, we rate the statement Half True because he ignores her bipartisan work and because he fails to acknowledge how often she votes with Republicans. The statement is partially accurate, but missing important details.

Rick Perry says kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school
","Saying President Barack Obama is waging war on religion, Texas Gov. Rick Perry adds in a TV ad his presidential campaign is airing in Iowa: ""I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian, but you don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military, but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.""

It’s widely known that Obama last year signed into law legislation permitting gay people to openly serve in the military. We wondered if kids can’t openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.

Based on checking the schoolhouse scene in Iowa and Texas and consulting an array of national experts, it’s clear that school officials are not permitted to organize prayers or focus on a single religion in connection with Christmas, but kids may pray and also celebrate the holiday on their own.

We started with the Hawkeye State, where voters caucus for president on Jan. 3.

Iowa schoolchildren may both pray and openly celebrate Christmas, according to Carol Greta, general counsel of the Iowa Department of Education.

In an interview, Greta said Iowa school children have never been prohibited from praying at school. ""As one wag said, as long as there’s been algebra, there’s been prayer in schools,"" Greta said.

But, she said, school employees may not coerce students into praying in keeping with the First Amendment, which bars Congress from making any law ""respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.""

In a landmark 1962 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that school-initiated prayer in the public schools violated the First Amendment. A year later, the court said students could not be made to read a Bible passage before class because the practice constituted government endorsement of a particular religion.

As for openly celebrating Christmas, Greta pointed us to a 2009 checklist of do’s and don’t’s for ""holiday celebrations"" posted by the education department for Iowa schools. The guidance opens: ""Public school officials need to be especially conscious at this time of year that the birth of the Christian savior is not recognized or celebrated by all students and families.""

Prohibited activities, the checklist says, include displays of religious symbols such as a crèche, an angel, a menorah or a banner with a religious message as well as a display of a Christmas tree bearing only Christian religious symbols, though the checklist says a Christmas tree itself is not prohibited. Also barred are school-wide prayer or Scripture readings, the guidance says, and musical concerts with exclusively religious music.

Schools are advised against holding a ""Christmas party"" in the classroom, the department says, though a ""holiday"" or ""end of semester"" or end-of-year party is permitted. The checklist says non-religious aspects of Christmas -- such as pictures of reindeer, bells and other non-religious symbols and sleigh rides -- are permitted. Caroling also is fine though songs that ""celebrate the birth of the Christ are more problematic,"" the checklist says: ""In an end-of-the-year music program open to the public, religious songs may be included as selections, as long as they are selected for their musicality and are not limited to Christian-themed songs.""

The checklist closes: ""The holidays are a time for exercising goodwill toward all. It is not a time for Scrooges or Grinches. Go forth and be merry with due consideration for all.""

And what’s the Texas situation?

Texas law provides an opportunity for students pray, if they choose, every school day, we learned from DeEtta Culbertson, spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency. The law states that each school board shall provide a minute of silence at each school during which ""each student may, as the student chooses, reflect, pray, meditate or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student.""

Also, a 1995 Texas law states: ""A public school student has an absolute right to individually, voluntarily, and silently pray or meditate in school in a manner that does not disrupt the instructional or other activities of the school. And a 2007 law requires each district to adopt a policy enabling student speakers at school events to voluntarily express a religious viewpoint with the policy stating that the student's speech ""does not reflect the endorsement, sponsorship, position, or expression of the district.""

The latter law came about after the Supreme Court agreed with lower courts that a Texas school district could not permit student prayers delivered before football games because the speeches were at a school-sponsored event, using school facilities, and would be taken by most observers as a school endorsement of the student prayers that were likely to be delivered.

Culbertson told us each Texas district is left to resolve how its individual schools handle Christmas.

In a Nov. 30, 2011, online post, Tim Carroll, president of the Texas School Public Relations  Association, advised school officials to read a publication by the Freedom Forum, a foundation that says it champions the First Amendment.

The publication, ""Religious Holidays in the Public Schools,"" notes that the Supreme Court has ruled that public schools may not sponsor religious practices but may teach about religion. ""While it has made no definitive ruling on religious holidays in the schools,"" the publication says, ""the Supreme Court has let stand a lower federal court decision stating that recognition of holidays may be constitutional if the purpose is to provide secular instruction about religious traditions rather than to promote the particular religion involved.""

The publication says it would be unrealistic to ban seasonal celebrations including references to Christmas. It continues: ""The resolution would seem to lie in devising holiday programs that serve an educational purpose for all students — programs that do not make students feel excluded or identified with a religion not their own.

In an interview, researcher David Masci of the Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion and Public Life told us that children may both pray and celebrate Christmas in school if their actions are self-directed -- not guided by teachers or administrators. Masci said that if Perry said school-directed prayer and Christmas celebrations are restricted, he’d be right.

Masci said: ""It’s one thing to acknowledge religion. Public institutions can do that. It’s another thing to promote religion.""

Some say, though, that schools often bow too much to constitutional concerns when it comes to Christmas. By e-mail, Hiram Sasser, director of litigation for the conservative Texas-based Liberty Institute, pointed out a sentence in the Freedom Forum publication that he said demonstrates Perry is on target about Christmas in school. The sentence: ""Teachers must be alert to the distinction between teaching about religious holidays, which is permissible, and celebrating religious holidays, which is not.""

News stories illuminate instances of schools balancing Christmas season events against the constitutional limit on promoting a religion.

In a Beaumont-area school this month, student singers replaced lyrics of ""The First Noel"" with ""The first snow fall"" and ""the Lord has come"" in ""Joy to the World"" with ""my shopping's done,"" the Beaumont Enterprise reported Dec. 7, 2011. The story quotes the students’ teacher saying the kids sang the real carols at a local tree-lighting ceremony.

According to a Dec. 1, 2011, news story in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the Fort Worth school district’s attorney recently sent a memo to staff stating that students should not be allowed to exchange gifts or ""distribute personal holiday messages"" during class. The story says the memo cites legal concerns associated with the distribution of personal holiday messages.

""For example, if students are allowed to exchange cards or small trinkets, the district would be required to allow a student to distribute a religious message with the gift or card,"" the memo says, according to the newspaper. ""In other words, the school district cannot prohibit the distribution of unsolicited religious material directly to students if it allows other personal messages to be distributed during school activities held during the school day.""

The paper quoted a district spokesman, Clint Bond, saying that students can, however, exchange gifts and cards before and after school and during lunch. Students can say ""merry Christmas"" to one another during the school day, Bond was quoted saying.

The Fort Worth district’s memo also says Santa Claus is not allowed to visit classes, the newspaper reported, though it says the memo also says that ""seasonal decorations are appropriate if they are not religious in nature"" and classroom parties are allowed if they ""serve an appropriate instructional purpose.""

On Dec. 2,2011, the district responded to news coverage of the memo by saying the district was not banning Santa Claus or Christmas celebrations from the schools--though Santa visits would be barred while teachers were teaching. Also, the district said, children would be permitted  to exchange presents and cards before and after class, in the hallway and at lunch. ""Fort Worth ISD loves Santa Claus and continues to support his universal message of generosity and kindness,"" the district said.

Sasser also urged us to consider a 2005 book, ""The War on Christmas,"" by John Gibson, a Fox News host. The book explores decisions by officials in a few school districts to curb religious references to Christmas. After one such move, Gibson writes, a district turned to Charles Haynes of the Freedom Forum’s First Amendment Institute to help draft a policy enabling students to learn about religious issues and Christmas without violating the First Amendment.

We called Haynes about Perry’s double-barreled ad claim.

""He’s using the language of the culture wars,"" Haynes speculated. ""What he’s trying to do, I’m afraid, is to mislead people into thinking kids can’t pray... What he’s hoping is that people will hear that God and Christmas have been kicked out of schools. That isn’t the case.""

Asked to elaborate on Perry’s statement, his campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said by email that court decisions in the ‘60’s ""banned prayer in schools."" She said too there are endless legal cases involving students, schools and prayer or religious expression--and noted a dispute years ago involving the Plano, Texas, district and a child prevented from passing out candy canes with a religious message. She also pointed us to the transcript of a June 8, 2004, Senate subcommittee hearing that touched on the Supreme Court’s ruling restricting prayers before football games

Our ruling

So, can kids pray and openly celebrate Christmas in school? Absolutely, we conclude, though public school officials are barred from advancing a religion or making children pray or celebrate solely the Christian aspects of Christmas.

The Supreme Court has not held that students can’t pray; Perry’s home state even has laws protecting that right. The highest court also hasn’t held that kids can’t openly celebrate Christmas at school.

"['National', 'Economy', 'New Hampshire 2012', 'Ron Paul']","
Did the Fed create $15 trillion during the bailout and send $5 trillion overseas?
","
For Texas congressman and Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, the causes of this country’s economic problems are both simple and profound. The government spends far too much, and the reason it can get away with this lies in the power of the Federal Reserve Bank to create more dollars out of thin air. As this argument goes, this drives down the value of the dollar, which creates an invisible tax paid by every business and household.

Paul often speaks of the recklessness of the Fed, and at a house party in Rochester, N.H., he backed up this point by saying, ""The Fed created 15 trillion dollars in the bailout process. Five of them were going overseas.""

We are checking both parts of that claim: that the Fed created that much money and about a third ended up outside our borders.

To back up both points, the Paul campaign cited a report from the Government Accountability Office from July 2011 that assessed a handful of emergency loan programs run by the Federal Reserve between 2008 and 2010. The campaign highlighted tables 8, 20 and 30 in that report. Table 8 is the most comprehensive and contains the biggest numbers.  

At first blush, it appears Paul understates the situation. Between December, 2007 and July, 2010, more than $16 trillion passed from the Fed to the biggest banks, both domestic banks and subsidiaries of foreign-owned institutions. Tally up the amounts that went to subsidiaries, and about $6 trillion went to banks such as Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland.

But Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, says that doesn’t mean that much money was created or left the country. ""Paul presents half the picture,"" Calabria said, ""And you could argue that it’s misleading."" This is a case, Calabria says, where you can be factually correct and, in his words, ""incoherent"".

Two big missing pieces put the accuracy of Paul’s statement on very shaky ground. It’s incorrect to say the Fed created $16 trillion because that’s a running total of lending, and the running total ignores a key reality. The dollars in those loan programs went out and came back in through a revolving door. Orice Williams Brown, managing director financial markets at the GAO, gives as an example a bank borrowing $10 billion at night, repaying it the next morning and then borrowing it again in the evening. The running tally would count that as $20 billion borrowed.  ""But if you look at it, it’s the same $10 billion dollars,"" Brown said.  

The GAO did figure out what the total would look like if you accounted for this churn of dollars.   That’s in Table 9, which the Paul campaign did not cite. The grand total there is about $1.1 trillion which is a lot of money but much less than $15 trillion.

The other missing piece is the current status of those loan programs. Also not cited by the Paul campaign, the GAO reported that after all that lending, the total amount still outstanding is $13 billion dollars. The money was created out of thin air, but when it was repaid, it no longer existed.  This is where the Federal Reserve is different from any other bank in the US.

""I think you’re creating money, because you’re certainly loaning it out,"" said Calabria. ""But I also think you’re extinguishing it later.""

Calabria says at the end of the day, those tables in the GAO report don’t tell you much about the creation of money in any enduring respect. For that, you would look at the money supply.  A common measure of the dollars in circulation is called the M2, and there’s no question it has gone up a lot.

According to data from the Federal Reserve, we now have $2.1 trillion more floating around than we did four years ago. If one is concerned about the value of the dollar, this is an important figure. It isn’t the $15 trillion Paul mentioned, and it has just about nothing to do with the GAO report, but it is a real issue for anyone who cares about diluting the power of the dollar.

In addition to the accuracy problems we just described, there’s another weakness in Paul’s assertion that $5 trillion went overseas. Whatever money was lent went to banks in the US that are owned by foreign banks, there is no way to know if any of those dollars went overseas, said John Makin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

""If it went to a New York branch, it hasn’t gone overseas,"" Makin said. ""Maybe it has, but it would be difficult to disentangle that.""

This is the consensus among economists. Dollars are fungible. A dollar in one account in New York might allow a dollar in another account in London to be put to use, but the reverse could also be true. If the banks had been doing a lot of lending -- that is, actually putting those dollars to work to rebuild the economy as the Fed intended -- one might be able to look at where those dollars ended up, Makin said.

But for the most part, the banks have been sitting on their cash, he said.

The GAO study tells us nothing definitive about where the money went. The only people who would know would be officials at the banks themselves. Not only is Paul’s number exaggerated, it isn't supported by the source his campaign cites.

Our Ruling

Apart from anything Paul said, it is true that the Fed has created about $2 trillion. But that's not what we're assessing.

When Paul says the Fed created $15 trillion, he is misstating the work of the GAO, and he fails to account for the special power of the Federal Reserve to destroy the dollars it creates. His assertion that a great deal of money went overseas might be true, but no one knows, and again, Paul misinterprets the source he used. For that reason, we rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/dec/09/ron-paul/did-fed-create-15-trillion-during-bailout-and-send/

Gingrich says IBM made Obama an offer to save billions on health care
","
During a discussion of health care costs at a Nov. 5, 2011, two-person GOP presidential debate outside Houston, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich made a dramatic claim about a White House visit.

Gingrich, who was debating then-candidate Herman Cain, said: ""The CEO of IBM went to the White House and said to (President) Barack Obama, you can pay for virtually all of Obamacare by simply taking existing IBM technology and applying it to stop paying crooks.""

By ""Obamacare,"" a term that some view as polarizing shorthand, Gingrich meant the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Democrat-led 2010 overhaul of health care laws. Obama affixed a price tag of $900 billion to the plan when he rolled out his version in September 2009. Subsequent cost estimates varied.   

So, Gingrich is suggesting a lot of fraud. But was he right that IBM presented the president with such a scheme?

By way of background, we note that Gingrich has long advocated using technology to help cut health-care costs. Until recently he led a for-profit consultancy called the Center for Health Transformations, which counted IBM among its clients.

We asked Gingrich’s campaign for the former House speaker’s basis in making the statement. Spokesman Joe DeSantis told us: ""All I can say is that he heard it from someone he trusts.  Sorry.""

But DeSantis directed us to video of a Sept. 14, 2010, Wall Street Journal interview of Sam Palmisano, IBM’s then-CEO and chairman.

Separately, IBM spokesman Ed Barbini also referred us to the Journal interview. He declined further comment.

The video opens with the Journal’s Alan Murray saying: ""When President Obama was elected, you started spending a fair amount of time at the White House.""

Palmisano: ""Yes, I did.""

Murray: ""What was that all about?""

""Well,"" Palmisano replied, ""part of it was the administration was reaching out to the business community. I mean, I was one of many, obviously ... around economic (issues)... So we were having lots of input, lots of exchange. That’s what we all were working on at the time.""

Asked how he thought the White House visits had turned out, Palmisano replied: ""We haven’t made any progress. It doesn’t mean there hasn’t been a lot of interaction.""

Murray: ""Well, what’s the point of interaction if it doesn’t lead to progress?""

Palmisano: ""You’d have to ask the people who aren’t progressing.""

He added, ""We’ve done tons of work, and for whatever sets of reasons, we haven’t been able to establish, be in sync with, the priorities.""

Palmisano offered an example: ""We -- and I’m fairly confident about this one because it required no legislative change -- we could have improved quality and reduced the costs of the health-care system by $900 billion... It was self-funding. You could have insured anybody you wanted to, illegal aliens, dogs, cats, ponies, whatever, right? And the stuff was simple. Did not require any big legislative change.""

About $400 billion of the reduced costs could be realized through negotiating discounts with drug companies, just as IBM negotiates its own discounts, he said. ""Buy a nationwide discount,"" he said. ""Just like pharmaceutical companies sell to us on a nationwide discount. It’s no different. I said, ‘Take the IBM discount! Take the IBM discount.’ ""

Another example of savings: ""Two hundred billion in fraud. That was a 3 percent improvement, by the way. This wasn’t transformational. ... There’s so much fraud in the system -- 3 percent and then Year 7 was 8 percent, Year 5 was 5 percent. It’s 200 billion.""

Murray: ""And why didn’t they do that? Is there a fraud --""

Palmisano: ""I said we would do it for free to prove that it works. They turned us down. You’ll have to ask them… Free. Free wasn’t good enough.""

Murray asks again: Why?

Palmisano replies, ""I think what it is, not to be judgmental about these things, I really do think what it is is that we weren't aligning with the priorities. ... the priority at the time, if I stay on my example of health care, was not to reduce costs and improve quality.  It was to provide insurance and coverage for more people.  That was our priority in the line.  All we said, if you did this you could fund the priority without increasing the deficit, taking taxes up.  And we couldn't sell the case.""

Let’s take a breath here. In the Journal interview, Palmisano insisted he gave the White House an offer to cover the $900 billion estimated cost of the health care plan -- with $200 billion coming from reduced fraud.

We were unable to find independent confirmation of such an offer -- and our search of news archives indicates the CEO’s comments to the Journal touched off only one follow-up news account. Nearly a month after the interview, on the Oct. 8, 2010, episode of a Fox News program, guest host Stuart Varney said that an IBM spokesman stood by Palmisano’s claims.

That program aired shortly after a more widely publicized event: On Oct. 6, 2010, Palmisano led a group of high-tech CEOs to the White House to present Obama with a proposal they said could save the government $1 trillion by 2020.

Among the plan’s seven initiatives: saving $500 billion by streamlining supply chains and pushing suppliers to reduce costs; and saving $200 billion by using technology to better detect ""improper payments"" -- payments that prove to be unnecessary or fraudulent. The proposal cites an Office of Management and Budget estimate that Medicare accounted for $54 billion of the government’s $98 billion in improper payments in 2009.

By email, White House spokesman Brandon Lepow did not provide information confirming or denying Palmisano’s claims to the Journal about presenting savings ideas. Lepow initially said companies including IBM had offered the administration help fighting fraud. He later told us he had learned his first statement was inaccurate. His follow-up statement said the administration and IBM had worked on ""possible projects"" but agreed not to ""move forward,"" although IBM is a partner in ""our work to fight fraud.""

Our ruling

Gingrich did not reveal the source of his claim or provide backup beyond the Journal interview. Meantime, the White House did not confirm or deny Palmisano’s claims. Contrary to Gingrich’s debate claim, though, the then-CEO said $200 billion in funding would come from cutting fraud -- not nearly enough to pay for the health-care overhaul.

"['Georgia', 'Voting Record', 'Club for Growth']","
Group attacks Barr on voting record
","
Former Georgia congressman Bob Barr -- considered a hard-line conservative in his days on Capitol Hill -- got socked last week with a pre-emptive strike from the right.

Four conservative-leaning groups urged Barr, who is thinking about a return to Congress, to butt out of a race against U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, a North Georgia Republican in his first full term in Congress.

One of those groups, the Club for Growth, made a claim against Barr that the others didn’t.

""Bob Barr’s record has significant flaws,"" said Club for Growth President Chris Chocola. ""Bob Barr voted for No Child Left Behind, to raise the debt limit and to raise his own pay.""

We were curious about whether Barr, who served four terms in the House of Representatives, voted to raise his own pay.

Longtime University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said it’s not surprising to see such charges as campaigns conduct more intensive opposition research. Bullock found the specific criticism about congressional raises interesting, since the claims are about something that happened about a decade ago. Still, Bullock said it could resonate with some Georgia voters as the state and nation suffer through high unemployment.

Bullock speculated some voters may conclude ""here’s a guy who is in a position to do more for himself and he does it.""

Congress gets an automatic cost-of-living increase each year unless it passes legislation stopping the raise the year before it takes effect. The increase is part of the Ethics Reform Act, which became law in 1992.

Barr served in Congress from 1995 to 2003. Congress received salary bumps five times during that time, in 1998 and from 2000 through 2003, according to the Congressional Research Service. The increases ranged from 2.3 percent to nearly 3.4 percent. Barr’s salary was $154,700 in his last year in Congress. Members of Congress currently make an annual salary of $174,000.

Congress passed legislation to stop the pay increases for the years of 1995, 1996 and 1997, according to the CRS.

In September 1997, Barr voted against a bill that would have helped Congress to get a raise. Barr said an increase was ""inappropriate at this time,"" according to a Rome News Tribune account. Later that month, Barr voted against an appropriations bill that had the increase provision intact, The Washington Post reported. The bill still passed.

In 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, Barr voted in favor of ""consideration"" motions in the House of Representatives that allowed legislation to move forward that included salary increases for Congress, congressional records show. Most members of the Georgia House delegation also voted in favor of those measures, records show. Those members included Republicans such as Johnny Isakson, now U.S. senator from Georgia, John Linder, Charlie Norwood and Nathan Deal, who is now Georgia’s governor.

Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller believes those measures are proof that Barr voted for an increase in his pay.

""It’s a motion on the previous question,"" Keller told us. ""He could have voted to prevent the pay raise.""

We reached out to Barr to talk about the Club for Growth’s claim and received a call back from Bill Crane, a veteran media strategist and political analyst in the area. Crane argued on Barr’s behalf that his vote for a motion should not be construed as support for any increase in pay. The New York Times noted in a July 2000 article that the appropriations bill does not have language specifying congressional cost-of-living increases. The funds are drawn from general reserves.

In those final appropriation bills, which included financing for much of the federal government’s operating budget, Barr was the only member of the Georgia delegation who voted against the legislation in each year, congressional records show.

Keller maintained his position.

""[Barr] knew what it was,"" he said, referring to the procedural measures. ""He could had voted no. He voted yes.""

And what about Barr’s vote in 1997 against the raise?

""That’s typical of a career politician to wave around a shiny object to distract voters from his record,"" Keller said. ""He’s not being honest with Georgia voters.""

Politicians sometimes defend their votes for some controversial measures by saying they had no choice because it was part of a larger piece of legislation that they were compelled to support. For that reason, it’s often difficult to decipher votes on precise items, especially when it comes to federal spending.

Barr did vote in favor of motions that allowed several bills to move forward that gave members of Congress a pay increase. However, these were bills that were part of much larger appropriations bills, and Barr voted against the final version of those bills.

The Club for Growth’s claim is technically accurate, but it needs more context that could give readers a full impression of this issue.

"['Abortion', 'Ohio', 'Ohio Right to Life']","
Ohio Right to Life says millions of federal aid went to the state's Planned Parenthood affiliates
","
Ohio and several other states across the country this year have passed laws to restrict abortion rights, including legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit organization that provides health care services, including abortions.

Ohio lawmakers, who already have passed a late-term abortion ban and other anti-abortion measures this year, have just begun hearings on Senate Bill 201, which is designed to defund Planned Parenthood and other family planning centers.

The day before the first Senate hearing on SB 201, Ohio Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, promoted the proposed law as a key component of its agenda.

""Ohio’s Planned Parenthood operations received millions of taxpayer dollars via federal grants in 2010 and 2011,"" a Dec. 5 news release from Ohio Right to Life said.

Ohio Right to Life went on to say that Planned Parenthood has performed more abortions annually as its federal funding has increased. It lauds the bill as one that will direct funding away from abortion providers and calls the hearings on the bill a step toward making 2012 a ""groundbreaking year for Ohio's pro-life movement.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine Ohio Right to Life’s claim about public funding of Planned Parenthood, in light of its underlying contention that the funding of the agency supports abortion.

We asked Michael Gonidakis, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, for specifics on the taxpayer money Planned Parenthood has received. Gonidakis said state agencies disbursed the federal grants, authorizing more than $1.6 million in 2010 to Planned Parenthood locations in Ohio and more than $1.7 million this year.

He also provided a memo the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission prepared detailing state agencies’ disbursement of federal grants to Planned Parenthood branches in Ohio. LSC compiled the information for Rep. Kristina Roegner, a Republican from Hudson who is a primary sponsor on companion legislation introduced in the House to defund Planned Parenthood. Roegner’s office confirmed the memo’s authenticity.

Tara Broderick, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio, said the organization does receive federal grant money. But none of that money pays for abortions, she said.

""A huge myth,"" Broderick said. ""Absolutely I can say taxpayer money is not used for abortion services,"" she said.

Planned Parenthood must sign an agreement affirming it will not use taxpayer money to provide, promote or refer abortion services, said a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Health, which distributes the bulk of federal grant money that Planned Parenthood receives. Additionally, an audit is performed to account for the organization’s use of government dollars, Broderick said.

According to Planned Parenthood, the vast majority of its clients receive health care services such as Pap tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. Less than 4 percent of Ohio Planned Parenthood clients received an abortion, the organization stated.

Nationally, Planned Parenthood performed 332,278 abortion procedures in 2009, the most recent year data was available. Those procedures made up 3 percent of the organization’s services, according to a Planned Parenthood fact sheet that was last updated in October.

Gonidakis, of Ohio Right to Life, acknowledged that the federal Hyde Amendment and state law prohibits tax dollars for paying for abortions.

""However, the significant public dollars Planned Parenthood does receive keeps them afloat and pays for pretty much their entire operations,"" he said in an e-mail.

Not true, said Broderick, of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio. She said the federal dollars make up 16 percent of the branch’s budget.

So where does that leave us?

Ohio Right to Life is correct to say that Planned Parenthood locations in Ohio have received millions in federal grants. But the connection between Planned Parenthood’s federal funding and its abortion services is not as direct as Ohio Right to Life’s news release implies.

Federal law bars Planned Parenthood from using taxpayer money for abortions, and the agency must certify to the state that it does not do so. The money that would be redirected by S.B. 201 is used to provide other health services.

Ohio Right to Life’s claim about funding for Planned Parenthood is accurate.

That the money cannot be used for abortions and that abortion procedures make up a small percentage of Planned Parenthood services are additional pieces of information that provide the full picture.

Comic Jon Stewart says Congress met most Christmas Days in its early years
","The Rhode Island controversy over Gov. Lincoln Chafee's decision to call the decorated spruce tree in the State House rotunda a ""holiday tree"" instead of a ""Christmas tree"" spilled over to Jon Stewart's ""The Daily Show"" program on Dec. 6.

During a segment on the ""Tree Fighting Ceremony"" that focused on Fox News' assertion that there is a culture war against Christmas, Stewart said, ""Perhaps you'd prefer to celebrate Christmas the way our Founding Fathers did.""

Then he cut to a video clip from a documentary from the History channel cable network that stated: ""On Dec. 25, 1789, the United States Congress sat in session and continued to stay open on Christmas Day for most of the next 67 years.""

""That's right,"" Steward added. ""When the country was founded, Congress had exactly the same attitude about the sanctity of Christmas celebrations that a 7-Eleven does today. 'Yeah. We're open.'""

We were intrigued by the idea that members of Congress in the early days would be on the job most Christmas Days, even if Dec. 25 fell on a weekend. So we started digging.

As the program made clear, Stewart was quoting a History channel program, ""Christmas Unwrapped - The History of Christmas.""

A Google search also brought us to an American Civil Liberties Union website on the ""Origins of Christmas."" It includes this quote: ""Congress met on Christmas Day every year from 1789 to 1855, with only three exceptions.""

It lists the source as a 2007 article from the journal Word and World called ""Christmas Was Not Always Like This: A Brief History"" by Bruce David Forbes. The ACLU web page also references the History channel website, which says that ""Christmas wasn't a holiday in early America—in fact Congress was in session on December 25, 1789, the country's first Christmas under the new constitution.""

We turned to Donald Ritchie, historian of the U.S. Senate. He had his doubts, saying that Congress typically took Christmas Day off. They didn't take a longer Christmas break, as they do now, because, in those days, traveling back to the home districts took too long.

From there, we dug into the records. Our first discovery: the claim that ""On Dec. 25, 1789, the United States Congress sat in session"" is flat-out wrong.

The web page ""Dates of Sessions of the Congress, 1789-present"" says that the last session of 1789 for both the House and the Senate was Sept. 29. By the time Christmas came around, Congress had been out of session for nearly three months. Both bodies reconvened on the first Monday in January 1790.

The web page also shows that there were three years from 1789 to 1857 when Congress had a formal recess that extended over Christmas Day. But that doesn't mean they were on the job on Dec. 25 during all the remaining years.

To find out, we went through the journals that were the predecessors of The Congressional Record.

So how many times did the House and Senate meet on Christmas Day during the first 68 years of Congress?

Once each.

The Senate assembled and immediately adjourned on Christmas Day in 1797; the House met on Christmas in 1802.

Our ruling

Jon Stewart, ridiculing Fox News' coverage of the ""War on Christmas,"" repeated a claim by the History channel that Congress met nearly every Christmas Day from 1789 to 1856. The ACLU makes the same claim, based on a magazine article.

But daily records show the complete opposite, with just one exception each for the House and Senate.

So the assertion that Congress met virtually every Christmas during that period is completely False. The idea that members would do so when there's a 1 in 7 chance that Dec. 25 would fall on a Sunday makes this idea ridiculous. So gather friends and family around the hearth as we give this Christmas claim by Stewart, the ACLU and the History channel a collective Pants On Fire!

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says that “some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent”
","
On Dec. 6, 2011, President Barack Obama gave a speech at Osawatomie High School in Osawatomie, Kan., the site of an address by Theodore Roosevelt just over a century earlier. In it, Obama sought to warn Americans about the perils of economic inequality. 
Here’s what he said: 
""Today, the wealthiest Americans are paying the lowest taxes in over half a century. This isn’t like in the early ‘50s, when the top tax rate was over 90 percent. This isn’t even like the early ‘80s, when the top tax rate was about 70 percent. Under President Clinton, the top rate was only about 39 percent,"" he said. ""Today, thanks to loopholes and shelters, a quarter of all millionaires now pay lower tax rates than millions of you, millions of middle-class families. Some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent. One percent."" 
Several readers urged us to check Obama’s claim that ""some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent."" 
Before we can begin answering this question, we’ll need to define ""billionaire."" It means someone whose wealth is worth $1 billion or more. In 2010, there were slightly more than 400 billionaires in the U.S., according to the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans. 
Fewer Americans have income of more than $1 billion. Every year, the Internal Revenue Service releases aggregated income and tax data on the 400 filers who had the highest incomes that year. In the most recently released data, covering 2008, to be included required an adjusted gross income of least $110 million. A back-of-the-envelope estimate suggests that somewhere between zero and 100 people had an income of at least $1 billion in 2008. 
So the first thing to point out is that we are talking about a very small pool of people. And one of the consequences of having a very small pool of people to study is that data is scarce. This is especially true given that privacy rules carefully shield income and tax data for individuals from public scrutiny. 
""I don't know of any data that address the question,"" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. 
But we gave it our best shot. 
When it comes to individuals with wealth of $1 billion or more, you really can’t draw any conclusions at all. Any estimate of how much a Forbes 400 member pays in taxes is pure speculation. And while there’s undoubtedly some overlap between the Forbes and IRS lists, they're not a match. 
So we’re left with the IRS list. (And we're assuming that the White House was not sifting through the IRS data behind the list, since doing so would be illegal.) But the list doesn't really back up Obama’s point. 
• As we indicated, inclusion on the IRS 400 list doesn’t mean you are a billionaire. It means you had an adjusted gross income of least $110 million. The actual number of billionaires on the list is unknowable. It's not possible to say with certainty even how many of them had income of $1 billion or more or how many might have incomes of less than $1 billion but wealth that would put them in the billionaires' club. 
• The IRS data hints at -- but doesn’t confirm -- that some of the 400 tax filers had effective tax rates of 1 percent. (An effective tax rate is not the official tax rate on the books but rather your tax bill measured as a percentage of your total income before deductions, exclusions, exemptions and credits.) 
The IRS offers a breakdown of what the 400 top earners paid in effective tax rates: 
0 percent to 10 percent: 30 filers
10 percent to 15 percent: 101 filers
15 percent to 20 percent: 112 filers
20 percent to 25 percent: 52 filers
25 percent to 30 percent: 46 filers
30 percent to 35 percent: 59 filers 
So 30 of the top 400 filers paid an effective tax rate of between zero and 10 percent. 
How many of those paid 1 percent? We have no way of knowing. If the percentages are distributed roughly equally across the range provided, it would mean three to five tax filers paid an effective tax rate of 1 percent or less. But it could easily be zero filers paying that little. We simply don’t know -- and we also have no idea whether these filers are actually billionaires. 
We also tried to extrapolate by looking at a different data set, from Williams’ group. The Tax Policy Center tracks which Americans have zero liability for the federal individual income tax. It found that of 433,000 tax filers with incomes of at least $1 million, 7,000 of those -- or 1.6 percent -- paid no federal income tax. 
But this data doesn’t help much, either. First, the cutoff is $1 million in income; the data are silent on how many of those people have $1 billion in wealth. And second, this only covers the federal income tax; the 7,000 people in question might be liable for enough other kinds of federal taxes to rise above a 1 percent effective tax rate. 
The Washington Post Fact Checker, Glenn Kessler, reported that the White House offered as backup ""a clip of a conversation on Bloomberg TV, in which correspondent Gigi Stone made this assertion during a discussion about the tax strategies that the very wealthy use to avoid paying taxes. The TV clip was promoted by the left-leaning website Think Progress. Stone quoted froma Bloomberg News article last month that reported on such tax strategies, which mostly involve complicated ways to defer paying capital gains taxes. But the article never made the 1 percent claim. It also noted that the IRS had gotten more hostile to such transactions in recent years."" 
We watched the clip and read the article and agree with the Fact Checker that the material isn’t strong enough to support Obama’s claim. 
Stone cited the now-famous example of billionaire Warren Buffett paying a lower effective tax rate, 17 percent, than his secretary. ""The real figure for billionaires,"" she continued, ""is often a lot smaller than that. Sometimes they even have a tax rate as low as 1 percent. That’s because they derive the bulk of their income from stock appreciation, and they use complicated strategies -- some of them -- to make sure that some of those gains don’t get classified as taxable income."" 
Stone cited the IRS 400 study in her report, and she has a point that tax rates for those very rich filers ""is often a lot smaller"" than Buffett’s 17 percent rate. At least 131 of the 400 had a lower rate than Buffett, according to the IRS. Her next comment -- ""sometimes they even have a tax rate as low as 1 percent"" -- is less certain. 
Finally, we were unable to get any additional backup from the White House for the figure Obama used. 
Our ruling 
Stone’s remark that ""sometimes (billionaires) even have a tax rate as low as 1 percent"" may be an acceptable shorthand for cable television chatter, but as a linchpin statistic in a major policy address by the president, the claim falls short. 
The best publicly available data, the IRS 400, suggests that it’s possible that some billionaires pay an effective tax rate of 1 percent or less. But this data doesn’t confirm it. In addition, the IRS 400 is made up primarily of people with less than $1 billion in annual income, and provides no information about whether a tax filer on the list has $1 billion in wealth. 
Despite this, Obama made it sound like a certainty  that ""some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent."" He would have been on safe ground if he’d noted that more than half the filers on the IRS 400 list had an effective tax rate of 20 percent or less. Obama did not have to gild the lily with a statistic this weak. If he wasn’t able to back it up with hard statistics, he shouldn't have said it. 
Because of that same uncertainty, we can't rule out that there isn't a billionaire out there who has a tax rate as low as 1 percent, but we haven't been able to find any evidence that there is. If the White House or anyone else produces evidence that it's true, we'd be open to changing our ruling, but based on what we know, we rule it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/dec/08/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-some-billionaires-have-tax-rate-/

Jon Huntsman says U.S. has more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil
","
The United States’ ""addiction"" to imported oil is a hot topic on many presidential candidates’ platforms.

During a November editorial board meeting with the Telegraph in New Hampshire, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman recycled some of that rhetoric when he discussed his push for energy independence in America.

""I want to take some steps toward energy independence, which is completely doable,"" said Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China during the Barack Obama administration before he resigned to run for the Republican nomination for president. ""We've talked about it under eight presidents. We've made very little in the way of positive forward momentum. We're still addicted to 60 percent imported oil, we have a transfer of wealth of 300 billion bucks a year to unfriendly transactional regimes in parts of the world. And I say, lets wake up to the fact that we have more natural gas in this country than Saudi Arabia has oil. And I say, how stupid are we?""

More natural gas than all the oil in one of the world’s largest oil exporting nations? Really? We decided to break down Huntman’s comparison to find out.

First, we contacted Huntsman’s campaign to get sources behind his energized claim, but the campaign didn’t return our calls or emails.

We turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration for a little guidance on what seemed like comparing apples to oranges.

Steven Grape, an EIA expert in the Office of Oil, Gas, and Coal Supply Statistics, said the issue is even more complicated than we thought. First, it involves comparing energy sources that are measured differently. Oil supplies are calculated in barrels, while natural gas supplies are calculated in cubic feet. And the two fuels have different energy content, which means it takes still more math to compare them.

Converting the energy content into the standard measure British thermal units, 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to 165 million barrels of crude oil, according to Grape.

On top of that, there are two different ways in which to look at how much of each type of energy is available. One way to look at it is as proved reserves, those that are likely to be developed under current economic and operating conditions. In other words, it's oil or natural gas that would be safe and profitable to produce now.

Another, more uncertain approach to defining energy supply is to look at technically recoverable resources. These are resources that could be developed using current exploration and production technology, without regard to cost.

Let's start with proved reserves. Saudi Arabia has 24 percent of the world’s proved reserves of crude oil, or about 264 billion barrels, Grape said. The U.S. proved reserves of natural gas are 284 trillion cubic feet. So the U.S. proved reserves are equal in energy content to about 46.8 billion barrels of oil -- considerably less than Saudi Arabia's proved reserves of oil.

The technically recoverable resource estimates for Saudi Arabia could be as high as 700 billion barrels of crude oil, and the technically recoverable resource estimate for the United States is about 2,500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which is equivalent to 412.5 billion barrels of oil. That's still less than the 700 billion barrel resource estimate for Saudi Arabia.

But Huntsman would be correct if he was speaking about production, Grape said. ""We don’t have more natural gas in this country than Saudi Arabia has oil, but we produce more natural gas in this country per year than Saudi Arabia produces oil.""

The U.S. produces the equivalent of 12.14 million barrels per day, compared with Saudi Arabia's 9.8 million barrels of oil per day, Grape said.

Our ruling

We don't know whether Huntsman meant ""proved"" resources, estimates of technically recoverable resources or production totals when comparing U.S. gas to Saudi oil. Using the first two measures, his numbers fall short. If he was talking about production, he is correct, although Huntsman used the word ""has,"" and not ""produces.""

Tim Kaine says debt grew by $16,000 every second of George Allen's senate term
","
Democrat Tim Kaine was not offering praise when he said Americans are indebted for Republican George Allen’s former service in the U.S. Senate.

The national debt increased ""by $16,000 every second of the six years he served,"" Kaine said in  a Dec. 7 debate with Allen. The two former governors are running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Jim Webb, D-Va., who will not seek reelection next year.

Allen served in the Senate from 2001 to 2007, narrowly losing a reelection bid to Webb. Kaine, during the debate, criticized Allen for consistently supporting Bush administration policies that Kaine said began the federal debt crisis.

We were curious if the national debt really did increase by $16,000 every second Allen was in the Senate. So we unsheathed our calculators and went to work.

Allen served 2,193 days in the Senate -- from Jan. 3, 2001 to Jan. 4, 2007. That’s 189,475,200 seconds.

We visited a U.S. Department of Treasury website to determine the national debt on each date. Rounding off, it started at $5.72 trillion and ended at $8.67 trillion.

That’s a $2.95 trillion increase during Allen’s term. The exact figure, if you’re interested, is $2,947,358,803,409.45.

That means the national debt rose an average $15,555.38 each second Allen was in the Senate. You can reach Kaine’s $16,000 estimate by rounding up.

There’s an issue, however, in holding Allen accountable for every appropriation from the day he entered the Senate to the day he left. The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30. The first spending votes Allen cast in the Senate were for the budget that began Oct. 1, 2001 -- some nine months after he entered office. And the last ones Allen cast were for the budget that ended Sept. 30, 2007 -- almost nine months after he left office.

So, the real period of influence Allen had on federal spending ran from Oct. 1, 2001 to Sept. 30, 2007. The national debt rose by $3.202 billion during that span and, as we pointed out in a Truth-O-Meter earlier this year, Allen voted for each of about four dozen appropriation bills that came to the Senate floor during his term.

In other words, Allen voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 every second he was in the Senate. That’s slightly higher than Kaine’s estimate.

But before you get angry at Allen, consider this: The debt has increased by $48,994.13 a second since Barack Obama became president. And Kaine, who served as Obama’s hand-picked chairman of the Democratic National Committee for two years before resigning in April, is a staunch defender of the president.

Our conclusion:

Kaine says the national debt increased by $16,000 every second Allen served in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2007.

The actual number, from the day Allen entered the Senate to the day he left, is $15,555.38 per second. Kaine reasonably rounded up.

Allen voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 a second.

George Allen says U.S. leads the world in fossil fuel resources
","
Republican George Allen says the United States has plenty of fossil fuel resources and that the president should allow more exploration and excavation of them.

""We are blessed to be number one in the world in energy resources; Russia is number two,"" Allen, a Republican, said during a Dec. 7 debate with Democrat Tim Kaine. The two former governors are running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Jim Webb, D-Va., who will not seek reelection next year.

When it comes to coal, oil and natural gas, are we really No. 1 here in the United States?

Allen bases his statement on reports by the Congressional Research Service, the non-partisan research arm of the legislative branch. The CRS study, and our own research, relied on the Energy Information Administration. The EIA, a unit of the Department of Energy, is a clearinghouse for information on energy production and consumption.

The CRS converts the different types of fossil fuels into a ""barrels of oil equivalent."" Since each fuel produces a different amount of energy when burned, the conversion allows an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison. Natural gas reserves, for example, are reported per trillion cubic feet. About 5.64 trillion cubic feet of natural gas produce the same amount of energy as one billion barrels of oil.  Coal reserves are reported in tons. One billion tons of coal produces as much energy as 3.45 billion barrels of oil.

According to this year’s CRS report, the United States has the highest amount of proven fossil fuel reserves, the equivalent of 973.1 billion barrels of oil. Russia is second at the equivalent of 954.9 billion barrels of oil, followed by China with 474.8 billion barrels. Iran and Saudi Arabia are fourth and fifth, at 328.1 billion barrels and 309.1 billion barrels, respectively.

The CRS also attempts to project the quantity of undiscovered reserves in each nation. When those are included, the U.S. and Russia retain the first two spots and Saudi Arabia moves into third place because of its vast oil endowment.

Uncle Sam is the undisputed king of coal, holding more than 27 percent of the world’s reserves. The U.S. ranks fourth in natural gas reserves, behind Russia, Iran and Qatar. We are a distant 11th when it comes to oil reserves, behind several Middle Eastern countries, Canada, Venezuela, Russia and Nigeria.

When it comes to newer technologies like biofuels or wind power, there is little uniform data on their global potential.  

Before we issue a ruling, there are a few caveats worth considering. A key issue is that world reserves of fossil fuels are always evolving. New fields are discovered, estimates for existing fields are altered, and resources are extracted or burned. Essentially, experts who estimate reserves are aiming at a moving target.

And as former Energy Department official Alan Hegberg pointed out to us earlier this year, some reserves may stay untapped in the current economic climate, given the cost or difficulty of extraction. But advances in technology or changes in weather could change the equation in the future. One example, he said, is the Arctic Ocean.

""People think there is a ton of gas in the Arctic,"" he said.

Arctic natural gas is now considered inaccessible, but a receding ice pack and longer summers could make those resources easier to reach. The next issue will be who owns the gas under the ice pack. Russia has tried to stake some claims, but Canada, the United States and Denmark -- which controls Greenland -- will also want a say.

Our conclusion:

Allen said the U.S. has the most plentiful energy resources in the world, followed by Russia.

According to the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. has the largest proven reserve of fossil fuel resources and Russia is No. 2. 

Data from the Energy Information Agency show that Russia has the largest volume of the three fossil fuels. But the American lead in coal, which produces very high amounts of energy when burned, means the United States narrowly edges Russia in the CRS report.

Gov. Scott Walker says recall organizers began effort even before he took office
","
CNBC’s Becky Quick put a question to Gov. Scott Walker after recall organizers claimed that after just 12 days they had more than half the signatures needed to force an election.

How are you feeling about this?

Walker conceded the drive probably would succeed, putting a recall election on the ballot in 2012. But he downplayed the significance, saying if the effort got the required 540,000 valid signatures it would equal just 25 percent of the voters in the 2010 governor’s race he won.

""A minority of voters will get to force a new election in Wisconsin,"" he said in the Nov. 30, 2011 appearance.

Walker also argued against the idea it was a fast start by opponents, saying that while the drive officially kicked off in mid-November, those behind the recall actually got going well before he even took office in January 2011.

""The recall organizers -- who by the way started their website last November, they didn’t just start organically earlier this year – they’ve been planning this for some time.""

He made a similar to a claim National Public Radio two weeks earlier.

To be sure, Walker inspired anger and protests even before assuming office, based on his rejection of high-speed rail funds, talk of a showdown with state employee unions, and other issues.

But was a recall effort already under way?

When asked to support the claim, Walker’s office referred us to the state Republican Party, which is helping with his campaign. They told us Walker was referring to recallscottwalker.com, a website that -- as its name suggests -- advocates for Walker’s ouster.

The domain name was registered more than a year ago, in November 2010, according to the registration record and a post on the site by its manager, Ben Paulson, a Milwaukee-area resident.

State GOP spokesman Ben Sparks said the party views Paulson as one of several liberal activists who got the recall push rolling in the fall of 2010.

""The recall began because the Democrats are sore losers,"" Sparks said.

The state Democratic Party is behind the recall drive, in concert with the group United Wisconsin and labor organizations.

Based on publicly available information, United Wisconsin began operating in late February, signing up supporters and getting 200,000 unofficial ""pledges"" to recall Walker. That was shortly after Walker unveiled the union limits that drew massive protests at the Capitol and sent Senate Democrats fleeing to Illinois to block a quorum for weeks.

But Walker’s statement puts Paulson at the center of the effort -- and gives it a three-month earlier start.

Paulson is a virtual unknown among major players on both sides, both personally and politically, based on our interviews with both parties, recall activists and union officials involved in the effort.

In fact, Paulson and his site have attracted little attention, even in the liberal blogosphere. We couldn’t find a single interview with Paulson and only a few scattered Internet references to his website.

At least initially, Paulson’s site was viewed suspiciously by some liberals as a possible GOP front aimed at locking up a good domain name. A story on the Wisconsin Reporter, a conservative online site, described recallscottwalker.com as ""the purported creation of Ben Paulson.""

As for Paulson himself, even the Republicans know nothing about him and say he’s ""elusive.""

""We have not been able to connect him in any official way"" to the recall organizers, said Sparks of the state party.

So, that undermines the group’s main point -- and the statement from Walker himself.

On his website, Paulson describes himself as a moderate Democrat ""who believes in fiscal and social responsibility.""

""As many of you, I have been horrified with what has been transpiring in this state since January 3, 2011,"" Paulson wrote in an undated introductory post. ""Let’s see where this takes us and maybe ... just maybe ... we can change people’s minds and get a change in the governor’s mansion before too much damage is done in Wisconsin.""

Notably, Paulson did not post on the site until Feb. 19, 2011 -- eight days after Walker announced his curbs on unions.

That post was a link to the recall statute. In fact, the site functions mainly as a repository of news and commentary on the recall.

That’s a sharp contrast to the United Wisconsin and Democratic Party recall machine, which run interactive websites and detailed county-by-county organizing efforts.

As for the recall effort itself, United Wisconsin launched its ""pledge"" drive on Feb. 18, 2011, and registered a political action committee March 1. It joined forces on the petition drive in the fall of 2011 with the Democratic Party, prompting skepticism on the right about its independence.

Paulson’s website does link to the United Wisconsin and Democratic Party of Wisconsin sites.

But so do many other blogs and websites on the left.

We reached Paulson, and he scoffed at the notion he somehow spawned the current recall drive.

""I was talking and joking with a co-worker about how Gov. Walker would end up being recalled just as he had won election as the Milwaukee County Executive via recall,"" he wrote in an email. ""I checked, the domain was free, and I registered it, not to think about it again until everything erupted in February.""

He added: ""I am not an organizer of the recall nor have I initiated any recall activities. The current recall does not trace back to me in any way.""

Paulson, who works as an engineer with a manufacturing company, said he has had no contact with the United Wisconsin recall group or the Democratic Party.

Indeed, United Wisconsin officials said he was not among the 200,000 people who signed the ""pledges"" to recall Walker.

Our conclusion

In a CNBC interview, Walker traced the current recall drive and organization to November 2010, arguing that recall leaders were gearing up even before he took office.

But the founder of the website is not a recall organizer; he’s a fringe player at best who took no steps to actually organize the petition drive. Even Republican officials can cite no evidence to the contrary.

While his recall-advocacy website was registered back then, the site was dormant until Walker’s controversial bill was introduced. The real ""recall organizers’"" website, that of United Wisconsin, kicked into operation only after Walker proposed his controversial budget bill in February 2011.

"['Animals', 'New Jersey', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Bear Education and Resource Group']","
Black bear advocacy group claims 99 percent of New Jersey voters don’t support hunting
","
One of the animal rights groups that took the state to court in a failed bid to stop this year’s bear hunt claims it has a powerful force on its side: New Jersey voters.

A six-day season that ends Saturday opens the woods of northwestern New Jersey to black bear hunters. On its website, the Bear Education and Resource Group accuses the state Division of Fish and Wildlife of ""promoting recreational trophy hunting against public opinion.""

When PolitiFact New Jersey viewed the website on Dec. 6, it read ""99% of NJ voters do NOT support hunting. And over 70% of comments submitted to F&W’s public hearing on their Black Bear Management Policy were AGAINST bear hunting. But they were ignored in favor of the 1% of residents who enjoy killing for fun.""

Can that many New Jerseyans -- 99 percent of residents in the Garden State -- agree on anything?

If bear hunting is an example, probably not.

Before last year’s bear hunt, Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind Poll conducted a survey of New Jersey voters that asked two questions.

The first asked whether residents agreed or disagreed with allowing bear hunting in New Jersey ""if wildlife scientists conclude that bears are exceeding their recommended habitat limits and are destroying private property?""

Fifty-three percent of respondents agreed, 36 percent disagreed and 11 percent said they were unsure.

The other question asked voters if they approved or disapproved of ""allowing a bear hunting season in New Jersey.""

For that question, 49 percent of respondents said they approved, 33 percent disapproved and 18 percent said they were unsure.

The results from either question had a margin of error of five percentage points.

""In general, people think [hunting]’s more benign than not. But you certainly find currents of sympathy running in different directions,""  said Peter Woolley, the director of Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind Poll, noting differences in opinion between men and women, as well as urban and nonurban areas.

The Humane Society of the United States, which opposes bear hunts, commissioned a poll before last year’s bear hunt that was conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research, Inc. One of the poll questions asked New Jersey voters: ""The state of New Jersey has protected black bears since 1970 with only two trophy hunts permitted in the past forty years. The state is now considering allowing hunters to kill up to 400 black bears. Do you support or oppose the hunting of black bears in New Jersey?""

That poll found 45 percent of respondents opposed the hunting of black bears, 35 percent supported it and 20 percent were unsure. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percent.

Although the polls results differ, both show that opposition to bear hunting in New Jersey does not begin to approach the black bear advocacy group’s claim of 99 percent. Larry Ragonese, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said, ""99 percent is absurd.""

Dale Jones, vice president of merchandise for the Bear Education and Resource Group, said ""the statement is wrong,"" noting that it meant to say ""99 percent of New Jersey voters don’t hunt.""

State data generally supports that claim, but the group’s website says 99 percent of New Jersey voters do not support hunting -- not that they don’t hunt. That’s a significant difference.

Our ruling

A black bear advocacy group claimed on its website that 99 percent of New Jersey voters oppose hunting.

That number is way off. The organization acknowledges it’s wrong, but late in the afternoon on Dec. 7, more than a day after PolitiFact New Jersey initially contacted the group, the statement was still on the website -- even after Jones said a webmaster would be notified to change it.* 
The statement drops to the ridiculous level for that reason, earning a Pants on Fire!

Newt Gingrich blasts 1990s ethics investigation of him, calling it partisan
","During a Dec. 6, 2011, interview on Fox News, Greta Van Susteren asked Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich for his view about a comment House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had made a few days earlier.

On Dec. 5, the liberal website Talking Points Memo published an exchange with Pelosi, who, like Gingrich, has previously served as House speaker. In an article headlined, ""Democrats Gleeful At Prospect Of Running Against Gingrich,"" Talking Points Memo quoted Pelosi saying of the fast-rising Republican presidential hopeful, ""One of these days we’ll have a conversation about Newt Gingrich. I know a lot about him. I served on the investigative committee that investigated him, four of us locked in a room in an undisclosed location for a year. A thousand pages of his stuff.""

Pelosi added -- jokingly, according to the website -- that she would elaborate ""when the time’s right.""

Later, Gingrich responded by calling the taunt from Pelosi -- who’s as much a bogeyman for Republicans as Gingrich is for Democrats -- ""an early Christmas gift. It tells you how capriciously political (the House ethics) committee was that she was on it. It tells you how tainted the outcome was that she was on it.""

Gingrich elaborated during his Fox News interview.

Van Susteren brought it up by asking him whether, ""in sort of seriousness, this could be rather punishing in a race when someone comes up and says something like, I have secret information about the person.""

Gingrich responded that he doubted Pelosi had any secret information to release, since the case had been thoroughly aired in public and because it would likely be illegal to disclose anything that had been purposely kept secret at the time. But Gingrich took the opportunity to link Pelosi to the investigation and cite it as evidence of how the process had been biased in a partisan way.

The back-and-forth with Pelosi ""reminds people who probably didn't know that she was on the ethics committee, that it was a very partisan political committee and that the way I was dealt with related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics. And I think in that sense, it actually helps me in getting people to understand, this was a Nancy Pelosi-driven effort. They filed 85 charges and 84 were dismissed. The only one was a conflicting lawyer's letter. And then the Democrats just held out for partisan reasons.""

For this item, we’re focusing on the claim that the ethics investigation against Gingrich was conducted by ""a very partisan political committee"" in a way that ""related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics.""

Gingrich has a long history with the congressional ethics process, both as an accuser (most famously against Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright, who resigned amid ethics charges Gingrich promoted in 1989) and as the accused.

The case primarily involved a course at Kennesaw State College that Gingrich taught while in Congress. The organizers of the course solicited financial support from ""individuals, corporations and foundations,"" promising that the project qualified for tax-exempt status. But the ethics committee concluded that the course was ""actually a coordinated effort"" to ""help in achieving a partisan, political goal"" -- something that would run afoul of its tax exempt status. A further problem for Gingrich was that during the investigation, he submitted letters from his lawyers for which ""the subcommittee was unable to find any factual basis."" Gingrich ""should have known"" that the information in the letters ""was inaccurate, incomplete, and unreliable."" The allegations were largely ajudicated by January 1997, with Gingrich agreeing to pay a sum of $300,000 and admitting that he had ""engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives."" He became the first speaker to be sanctioned in this fashion by the House. (Here’s a time line of the case.)

As we’ve noted before, Gingrich’s intensely partisan style and his heavy use of the congressional ethics process ramped up the level of partisan warfare during his investigation. Few observers would disagree that Democrats were gleeful at the prospect of seeing the first Republican House speaker in four decades brought down by ethics charges analagous to those Gingrich himself had used to topple Wright.

But in the interview with Van Susteren, Gingrich did more than just say that partisan warriors leveraged his investigation for their own ends. He said that the investigation against him was itself conducted by ""a very partisan political committee"" in a way that ""related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics.""

In essence, Gingrich is alleging that the investigation of his actions was biased by partisanship and, by extension, that the penalty he agreed to was tainted.

To understand whether Gingrich’s assertion is correct requires a look at the venue for the investigation -- the House ethics committee, which was then known officially as the Standards of Official Conduct Committee.

The ethics panel is the only House committee with an even number of Republicans and Democrats. By longstanding tradition, the committee does not proceed with a formal investigation unless it has majority support. This means that every ethics case that moves forward -- including Gingrich’s -- required the vote of at least least one member from the same party as the lawmaker facing allegations.

In Gingrich’s case, an investigative subcommittee was convened and looked into the case for several months. Like the full committee, it included an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, and it hired a special counsel, James M. Cole, to lead the investigation. (Cole was later appointed deputy attorney general by President Barack Obama, but at the time of his appointment in the Gingrich case, Cole had worked as a Justice Department attorney in administrations of both parties.) Gingrich had legal representation during the ethics process.

On Dec. 21, 1996, the subcommittee forwarded its findings to the full committee for consideration, recommending ""a reprimand and the payment of $300,000 toward the cost of the preliminary inquiry.""

On Jan. 17, 1997, the full committee held nearly six hours of televised hearings before voting 7 to 1 to accept the subcommittee’s recommendation. Voting to accept it were three Republicans -- Chairwoman Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, Steve Schiff of New Mexico and Porter Goss of Florida.

""We are bringing to the floor a very tough penalty, an appropriate one,"" Johnson said in an interview on NBC’s Today show on Jan. 21, 1997, the day the ethics recommendation went to the House floor. ""And we're bringing it to the floor as a bipartisan committee.""

The full House went on to pass the ethics report 395 to 28, with 196 Republicans voting for it and just 26 voting against it.

""This is a tough penalty,"" Johnson said after the vote, according to the Washington Post. ""I believe it is an appropriate penalty. It demonstrates that nobody is above the rules.""

Schiff added in a press conference the same day that ""being bipartisan doesn't mean you always agree on everything. It means you reach a consensus.""

This hardly seems like a Democratic kangaroo court to us. And experts we checked with felt the same.

""The process had plenty of partisan tension, because he was the speaker,"" said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the American Enterprise Institute. But Cole, the special counsel, ""was terrific and thoroughly objective,"" Ornstein said. To Ornstein, Gingrich ""is sanitizing the process and outcome. To be sure, the charges were not so explosive that he merited a ‘death penalty’ (of resignation), but the charges were not wildly different or less significant than those he had brought against Jim Wright, who did resign.""

Kenneth A. Gross, the head of the political law practice at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, was one of several experts we spoke to who agreed.

""I saw that committee at work behind closed doors during that era, and it was certainly divided and partisan, but it is the only committee of Congress that has an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, and for anything to move forward, it would require a bipartisan vote.""

We should add that Gingrich accepted what amounted to a negotiated plea bargain. He agreed to admit one count of wrongdoing and pay $300,000, which was the estimated cost of the investigation. If he didn’t believe in the fairness of the process, he could have refused to admit wrongdoing and taken his chances on the House floor, where he led a sizable majority.

According to the Post coverage at the time,"" J. Randolph Evans, Gingrich’s attorney, said his client ""has apologized to the subcommittee, to the House and to the American people."" Evans did not respond to an inquiry for this story.

Our ruling

While it’s true that the Gingrich case became a vicious battlefield between the two parties, contemporary accounts and experts familiar with the proceedings agree that it was not ajudicated by ""a very partisan political committee"" in a way that ""related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics."" The ethics panel’s case only moved forward with the express consent of Republicans, including the committee’s chairwoman, and it was led by a special counsel who was not a Democratic partisan and who focused on substantive legal matters.

Most notably, when it became time to vote, the House -- including nearly 90 percent of voting Republicans -- voted to support the committee’s recommendation.

Newt Gingrich claims he 'never favored cap and trade'
","Three years ago, Newt Gingrich went on television, cozied up to Nancy Pelosi and preached the need to respond to global warming. ""We do agree our country must take action to address climate change,"" Gingrich said from a couch, which was oddly positioned in front of the U.S. Capitol. What seemed like genuine, bipartisan PR in 2008 now looks like conservative heresy by the current frontrunner in the Republican presidential race. Gingrich now calls that TV ad the ""dumbest single thing"" he’s ever done and insists his policy stance on the environment passes all conservative muster. ""If you notice, I never favored cap and trade,"" he said in a candidate forum in New York City on Dec. 3, 2011. Really? Never? We did a little digging and it didn't take long to find that Gingrich has been inconsistent and has at times advocated cap and trade legislation when combined with other approaches. Origins of cap and trade Cap and trade legislation seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their cap are then allowed to sell their emission credits to other companies that need them. Supporters say the approach provides economic incentives to reduce pollution and innovate. Critics deride it as an energy tax and say it increases costs for everyone. The approach was originally employed to curb the pollutants that cause acid rain in the early 1990s. President George H.W. Bush championed it, with the support of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress -- including, yes, Newt Gingrich. The idea was to provide incentives to reduce acid rain through a marketplace approach. As scientists found more evidence of climate change, cap and trade became a popular solution. ""It embodied freedom from the command and control regulation that can be so confining. It was seen as a real step in the right direction for that reason by a lot of Republicans,"" said Eric Pooley, a former journalist and author of the 2010 book The Climate War who is now a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund. In 2008, it was one of the few areas of common ground for Barack Obama and John McCain. Both acknowledged climate change and favored carbon caps. But then several factors combined to change the dynamic, Pooley said. The recession made it hard to talk about any solution that had a price tag attached, and Republicans dug in against Obama's main initiatives. Plus, Pooley said, the rise of the tea party movement put pressure on moderate Republicans, especially those in the House who voted in favor of a cap and trade bill in 2009 that demanded major emissions cuts. The bill died in the Senate. Today, most Republicans in Congress are staunchly against cap and trade. Gingrich praises cap and trade  But contrary to his claim this week, Gingrich has not been consistent on the issue. Four years ago, he was singing the praises of cap and trade -- as long as tax incentives were included in new laws. On Feb. 15, 2007, Gingrich went on the PBS show Frontline and championed cap and trade. Asked if he supported George W. Bush’s campaign pledge in 2000 to set mandatory carbon caps, Gingrich responded: ""I think if you have mandatory carbon caps combined with a trading system, much like we did with sulfur, and if you have a tax-incentive program for investing in the solutions, that there's a package there that's very, very good. And frankly, it's something I would strongly support."" he said. He then went on to criticize Bush for backing off the pledge. ""If he had instituted a regime that combined three things I just said -- mandatory caps, a trading system inside the caps, as we have with clean air, and a tax incentive to be able to invest in the new technology and to be able to produce the new technology -- I think we would be much better off than we are in the current situation,"" Gingrich said. Two months later, Gingrich took part in a debate with Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts about environmental matters. Gingrich was slightly less gung-ho about cap and trade than he had been on PBS, but his message of ""urgent need for action"" on environmental dangers was clear. ""We should address it and we should address it very actively,"" he said in the debate, citing a UN report documenting the earth’s rising temperatures. ""The … consensus is that humans have contributed to that. I don't think there's any consensus that we are the only contribution, but there is a clear agreement that human activity has helped increase the level of warmness."" On cap and trade, Gingrich said he doubted whether the approach would be as effective with carbon dioxide emissions as it had been with sulfur pollution, which in his view is easier to measure. ""And cap-and-trade, by the way, for sulfuric acid and acid rain -- which I voted for and helped pass as the Republican whip -- was a very definable number of plants. A carbon cap in trade, if it's universal, is enormously complicated and transfers an amazing amount of power to a Washington bureaucracy and will create, inevitably, winners and losers and will become politicized overnight."" He said he favored tax incentives to reduce carbon emissions but added, ""I'm not automatically saying that coercion and bureaucracy isn't an answer. I just don't think it's as positive and as creative an answer as market incentives in terms of getting the kind of change we want."" Then, a bigger shift By 2008, Gingrich was firmly against cap and trade. Pooley called it Gingrich’s ""signature reading of the American political moment."" He started talking not about addressing climate change but about increasing oil drilling domestically. In April of 2009, Gingrich took his cap and trade opposition to a House committee hearing, testifying against the bill that would have set carbon emission caps. Said Gingrich: ""An energy tax punishes senior citizens. It punishes rural Americans. If you use electricity it punishes you; if you use heating oil it punishes you; if you use gasoline it punishes you. This bill will increase your cost of living and may kill your job.""   In that same hearing, however, he left the door open to a law that would apply cap and trade, combined with tax incentives and regulatory changes, to the biggest polluting sites.   ""Now, if you want to write a bill that covers the 2,000 most polluting places and say, fine, those 2,000 are part of cap and trade, I'd be glad to look at it,"" he told the House committee. At the 2011 candidate forum, Gingrich cited this testimony in his opposition to cap and trade. A section of Gingrich’s campaign website devoted to ""setting the record straight"" has this to say on the controversy: Gingrich ""absolutely opposes ‘cap and trade’ as well as any system of taxing carbon emissions"" and on global warming itself and humanity’s responsibility, the website says ""Newt has noted there is no settled scientific conclusion."" Our ruling Gingrich, as a presidential candidate in 2011, declared, ""I never favored cap and trade."" But we found solid evidence he did, with the condition that carbon caps be combined with tax incentives to encourage energy companies to innovate. He told Frontline a cap and trade system combined with tax incentives is ""something I would strongly support,"" and even took a hindsight-is-20/20 stance, saying the country ""would be much better off"" if cap and trade had been instituted.

The phrase ""little Band-Aids"" caught our eye. Did Mitt Romney really use that phrase to describe tax cuts for the middle-class?

We asked Florida Democratic Party spokeswoman Brannon Jordan, who issued the Dec. 1, 2011, release, contacted the Romney campaign and searched for the phrase ourselves.

What emerged wasn't quite what Democrats had claimed.

What Romney said

Romney did use the phrase ""little Band-Aids"" in an Oct. 11 presidential debate, in his answer to a question about Obama's effort to extend his payroll tax cut. Here's how the exchange with Bloomberg TV White House correspondent Juliana Goldman unfolded: 
Democrats seized on the conversation as evidence that Romney opposed extending payroll tax cuts, which the Obama administration says save a typical family $1,000 a year. Within days, the Democratic National Committee rolled out ""Operation Band-Aids,"" including a Web video, conference calls and events.

""By opposing the extension of middle-class tax cuts, (Romney) is supporting a tax increase on middle-income families and small businesses,"" POLITICO quoted DNC communications director Brad Woodhouse as saying.

Romney's tax plan

Of course, a closer reading of the debate shows Romney opposed the tax cuts, not on their merits or because of whom they would benefit but rather as temporary cuts rather than long-term changes.

The right course, he said, was ""to make permanent changes to the tax code."" He criticized ""a temporary change to the payroll tax,"" calling it ""a temporary shift in a tax stimulus"" before he concluded he didn't like ""temporary little Band-Aids.""

His opposition to temporary tax code fixes wasn't a new point.

Page 39 of his economic plan, released in early September, says, ""President Obama’s proclivity for fostering uncertainty about the long-term shape of the tax code is particularly troublesome. He has embraced one temporary solution after the next while rejecting permanent adjustments that would bring some predictability and stability to investment decision-making.""

That's the essence of his Oct. 11 debate answer. And it's scarcely a blanket opposition to ""middle-class tax cuts,"" as Democrats characterized it.

In fact, he had previously exempted the payroll tax cut extension from his criticism.

On Page 47, he mentioned some short-term measures he would support — and a ""lower payroll tax"" is among them. 
So the Democrats were right to seize on Romney's debate answer in one sense: It differed from his on-the-record support for ""a lower payroll tax"" as distinct from other ""counterproductive"" short-term measures. In the debate, he instead grouped Obama's proposed tax cut extension into his criticism of short-term fixes.

That departure didn't last long. Days after Florida Democrats' news release, Romney returned to the talking points of his published economic plan in an appearance on Michael Medved's conservative radio talk show:

""I would like to see the payroll tax cut extended just because I know that working families are really feeling the pinch right now — middle-class Americans are having a hard time,"" he said on the Dec. 5 show, as reported by the New York Times and others.

Meanwhile, the details of his economic plan, while too vague for a complete analysis, appear to support lower taxes for the middle class, according to Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. The center maintains a summary of Republican candidates' tax proposals.

""He wants lower rates in the future for taxes,"" Williams said. ""... I would say it's not fair to say he doesn't care about the little guys.""

Romney would maintain President George W. Bush's tax cuts, which include cuts for the middle class (though also, of course, for the rich). He wants to reduce to zero investment taxes for low- and middle-income families to boost their retirement savings — something he doesn't offer to do for those with adjusted gross incomes over $200,000. In the long-term, he wants to broaden the tax base and reduce and flatten tax rates, which would likely favor the wealthy more than anyone else, Williams said, but he would keep exemptions, deductions, credits, and other tax preferences in the short-term, many of which benefit lower- and middle-income taxpayers. He wants lower rates across the board. And, as we said, his published plan says he supports a temporary reduction in the payroll tax ""if properly structured."" 

Our ruling

Florida Democrats used Romney as an example of a Republican ""willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans just to pay for more tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires."" They accused him of ""belittling middle-class tax cuts as nothing more than 'little Band-Aids.'""

But the context of his Oct. 11 debate performance shows he decries not ""middle-class tax cuts,"" but ""a temporary change to the payroll tax"" as part of a stimulus bill. He argued, essentially, for permanently lower tax rates, including for the middle class.

Meanwhile, the debate performance stands as an exception to Romney's published support for lowering payroll taxes.

Democrats get some credit for accurately pointing out that in the debate, Romney didn't support Obama's effort to extend his payroll tax cut. He did indeed call temporary tax changes ""little Band-Aids."" But they ignore critical context from the debate and Romney's published tax proposals when they declare he belittled ""middle-class tax cuts,"" creating the impression he opposes middle class-tax breaks.
