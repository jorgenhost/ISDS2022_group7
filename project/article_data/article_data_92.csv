Elizabeth Ames Jones says she balanced $10 billion shortfall without raising taxes
","
In an online video, Texas Senate hopeful Elizabeth Ames Jones says voters can count on her to oppose higher taxes.

Jones, a former Texas railroad commissioner and legislator who’s among challengers to Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in the May 2012 Republican primary, opens her video: ""Texans need a new state senator -- one who’s 100 percent committed to tackling our budget problems without raising your taxes -- and that’s what I’ve done.""

The ad’s narrator later says: ""She was a leader, balancing a $10 billion budget shortfall in the Texas House -- $10 billion -- and she did it without raising your taxes.""

Wait: The House has 150 members -- and can’t pass a budget into law without the Senate and governor also signing off.

That in mind, we inquired into how Jones balanced the budget referenced in her ad. 
Jones campaign spokesman Patrick Isenberg told us in a telephone interview that the claim ties to Jones voting in 2003 to balance the 2004-05 state budget in the face of a $10 billion revenue shortfall -- without raising taxes. At the time, too, Jones was a member of the budget-drafting House Appropriations Committee.

Isenberg also passed along newspaper stories including an excerpt of a Jan. 12, 2003, San Antonio Express-News news article quoting Jones saying that legislators should balance the budget without new taxes. ""When an economy is slow, it's not really the time to initiate new taxes,"" the story quotes her as saying.

As we noted in a May 2010 check of a shortfall-related claim by Gov. Rick Perry, the $10 billion figure reflects then-State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn’s grim forecast as the 2003 Legislature convened that state revenues for the 2004-2005 budget period would fall short of estimated expenditures by $7.4 billion. Add looming expenses — a health plan for local school district employees plus projected health and human services needs — and the state was facing a $9.9 billion state revenue shortfall, Strayhorn said.

To cover the projected shortfall in the months remaining in the 2003 fiscal year, the Legislature trimmed $1.4 billion in budgeted state spending, while spending $450 million from the rainy day fund. But lawmakers also passed a 2004-2005 budget that appropriated $1.8 billion less in state funds than had been spent during 2002-03, according to the Fiscal Size-up published by the advisory Legislative Budget Board. They added $811 million from the rainy day fund. And they used $1.3 billion in federal aid, part of fiscal relief made available to states in response to economic difficulties in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001.
   
Other steps: Members voted to extend a tax on telephone customers originally levied to pay for technology in schools and hospitals, raise fees for certain state services and use creative accounting to defer state payments to the next budget period..

So, the Legislature closed the $10 billion shortfall in 2003 via various mechanisms, none of them a tax increase.

And Jones voted for the version of the budget advanced by the appropriations committee on April 7, 2003, according to an April 8, 2003 Express-News article poined out by Isenberg. That story quoted her as noting that the committee salvaged a slimmed-down Children's Health Insurance Program after a subcommittee recommended its abolition. Jones, describing the budget as frugal ""belt tightening,"" was also quoted saying: ""This is not a tea party.""

On April 17, 2003, Jones was among House members to vote for its version of the budget, House Bill 1, which went to the Senate by a 100-45 margin, the House Journal says. On June 1, 2003, she voted for the ultimate House-Senate compromise version, which went to Gov. Rick Perry by 105-41, according to the journal entry for that day, 
We asked an Austin consultant to Jones, Todd Olsen, to elaborate on how Jones led the state to the balanced budget without a tax increase. Olsen underscored her membership on the appropriations committee, where he said she heard hours of testimony. As to budget-related roles played by other lawmakers, the Senate and governor, Olsen said: ""I think voters know there are 150 members in the House, and that there’s a governor and that there are three branches of government."" He said too that Jones was the first woman elected to a leadership post in the House Republican Caucus. According to a Feb. 6, 2003, Austin American-Statesman news article, Jones was elected vice chair of the House Republican Caucus in the 2003 session. 
Finally, Isenberg forwarded the script of what he described as a radio ad on the theme of the web video, which he said was also airing as a TV ad. In the radio ad, according to the script, Jones says she was a House member when she was a leader in balancing the budget without a tax increase.

Our ruling

Jones was among a select group of House members to draft the first version of the budget that she touts and ultimately voted, like most House colleagues, to send to the governor.

Her video could easily have specified that Jones fought in the House for no new taxes and worked to make up a $10 billion shortfall. In contrast, it leaves the misimpression that ""she did it,"" all of it, as if by herself. All told, her claim has a clear-cut element of truth, but ignores critical facts putting her role in perspective.

Republican Governors Association says Mayor Tom Barrett’s policies drove up unemployment 27 percent in Milwaukee
","
When PolitiFact Wisconsin Googled ""Tom Barrett"" the other day, top results included:

A WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) story about Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s bid to take on Scott Walker in the 2012 recall race.

A post on an education technology blog by a guy named Tom Barrett in Nottingham, England with 20,000 Twitter followers.

Mayor Tom Barrett’s Wikipedia entry; his newly minted gubernatorial campaign website; and his official City Hall site (he was re-elected mayor on April 3, 2012).

That’s in real life.

In a campaign TV ad released March 29, 2012 by an arm of the Republican Governors Association, less neutral results appear as a woman searches on ""Tom Barrett.""

In the ad, the woman gets these search hints: ""Politician. Increase spending. High unemployment. Candidate for governor."" As she ""finds"" some Barrett material online, she offers a running commentary.

""Tom Barrett increased spending in Milwaukee by $300 million? Huh. ""Raised taxes every year but one. Uh oh.""

""And what did his taxes and spending do to the economy? Unemployment up 27 percent. Under Barrett, Milwaukee’s one of America’s 10 worst cities for unemployment.""

She concludes: ""Spending -- up. Taxes -- up. Unemployment -- up. Governor Tom Barrett? I don’t think so.""

The RGA ad claims on taxing and spending are not in dispute.

But did unemployment jump 27 percent during Barrett’s first two terms, spanning 2004 to 2012? And was Milwaukee one of the toughest places in the United States for employment? We decided to investigate both -- and the ad’s claim Barrett’s policies were responsible.

Unemployment rates are reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and state agencies such as the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development.

We found a 26 percent  increase in the number of unemployed from April 2004, when Barrett took office, to January 2012, according to the latest figures reported on the BLS site.

The number is 27 percent if you do the math on the unemployment rates for those years (8.1 percent and 10.3 percent), though such comparisons are usually expressed as percentage point changes. In other words, you would typically say unemployment went up 2.2 percentage points under Barrett.

But either way the RGA is pretty much on target on that piece.

On the second part of the RGA claim, a top-10-worst ranking,
the group’s spokesman pointed to 2005 -2007, when Milwaukee was sixth-highest for unemployment rate among large cities and to 2009, when the city was 10th.

The RGA uses the nation’s 50 largest cities as a pool of comparison.

If you expand to municipalities of any size, Milwaukee improves hundreds of places in the rankings. But it seems reasonable to compare Milwaukee, which is near the middle of the 50 largest cities, to its peer group.

So it’s clear the city was in the top 10 for highest unemployment in four of Barrett’s first five full years in office.

But what about 2008, and the most recent two years, 2010 and 2011?

Milwaukee improved to 16th in 2008, and ranked 11th in 2010, when six California cities were among the worst. (The annual average for 2011 was not available as of early April 2012.)

So the city’s ranking has edged out of the top 10 worst in three recent years under Barrett.

One note: the TV ad subtly makes two different claims on the ""top 10"" ranking. The on-screen graphic says Milwaukee ""was"" one of the worst 10, while the narrator says that ""Milwaukee’s one of America’s worst"" -- a line that suggests the top-10 ranking is current.

But either way the claim of a top-10 ranking is accurate or very close in five of the seven full years under Barrett.

But the claim is about more than numbers. It places the blame squarely on Barrett and his policies (""what did his taxes and spending do to the economy?"" asks the ad).

Mayors clearly have a policy role on job creation, but state and national trends drive much of the employment picture at the local level.

By the RGA’s logic, Scott Walker, as much as Barrett, could be accused of causing unemployment to soar when he was the elected executive of Milwaukee County, which includes the city of Milwaukee.

Why? Because both Barrett’s and Walker’s eighth budgets included spending that was more than 30 percent higher than the budgets they inherited. (We used eight budgets for an apples-to-apples comparison; Barrett has submitted eight budgets; Walker did nine.)

Separately, property taxes went up 20 percent over Walker’s first eight years, compared with 25 percent under Barrett. (Note: Walker never proposed a tax hike but used County Board levy increases as his base the following year).

Our conclusion

The Republican Governors Association, which backs Scott Walker, was basically accurate on its claims, but overstates the influence of a mayor on taming unemployment.

"['New Jersey', 'Energy', 'Robert Menendez']","
Robert Menendez claims U.S. fuel exports surpassed imports in 2011 for the first time since 1949
","
Drill it in the United States, keep it in the United States.

U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez made that argument during his ""Twitter Town Hall"" on March 28, while noting how the United States exported more fuel products than it imported last year for the first time in more than six decades.

""In fact, you know, according to the Energy Department though, the United States – this is something that I found out, I found it pretty amazing – actually exports more gasoline, diesel and other fuels than it imported in 2011 for the first time since, I think, 1949,"" he said.

The Democratic senator later added, ""If we keep that here, we can create downward pressures on the prices of gas and diesel, and in doing so, of course help all of our families and help our economy. So I believe drill it in the U.S, keep it in the U.S., and that’s not something that’s happening right now.""

PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that the senator’s claim is backed up by findings released last month by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistical and analytical agency within the U.S. Department of Energy.

According to a March 7 article on the agency’s website, ""The United States in 2011 exported more petroleum products, on an annual basis, than it imported for the first time since 1949.""

Last year, the United States exported nearly 2.9 million barrels per day, surpassing imports by about 440,000 barrels per day, according to the agency.

Now, let’s explain what’s fueling this increase in exports.

The biggest contributing factor was the increase in foreign purchases of distillate fuel, which includes diesel fuel and heating oil, the agency said. 
U.S. exports of distillate fuel have been on the rise during the past decade, driven by a global increase in diesel consumption, according to the agency. Between 2006 and 2011, exports of distillate fuel increased by about 297 percent, according to agency data.

The growth in distillate fuel exports has been mainly driven by deliveries to the Netherlands -- where many products are later directed to other countries -- as well as to Mexico and Central and South America, the agency has said. 
The Netherlands was the largest importer in 2011 at 145,000 barrels per day, followed by Mexico with 102,000 barrels per day, according to agency data.

The proximity of Mexico, and Central and South America to oil refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast has contributed to the export growth, according to the agency. Also, Europe requires a certain type of diesel fuel that cannot be produced in many refineries outside the United States, according to the agency.

""The primary factor behind the change in Europe has been the switch by light-duty vehicle consumers from gasoline-powered vehicles to diesel-powered vehicles,"" according to an October 2010 report by federal officials. ""The move has been driven by European tax incentives on both vehicles and fuel to encourage the use of more energy-efficient diesel-fueled vehicles.""

Our ruling

During his Twitter Town Hall, Menendez claimed the United States ""actually exports more gasoline, diesel and other fuels than it imported in 2011 for the first time since, I think, 1949.""

Based on findings released last month by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, that statistic is accurate. Driven by demand for distillate fuel -- which includes diesel fuel and heating oil -- exports of petroleum products in 2011 exceeded imports by about 440,000 barrels per day, according to the agency.

We rate the statement True.

Isakson: Keystone pipeline to employ 20,000
","Backers of a massive oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico are telling voters that it will flood the U.S. with jobs.

President Barack Obama denied a permit to build the 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline in January amid bitter debate over whether it would damage environmentally sensitive lands. The pipeline may still win approval, however, and some lawmakers are trying to push it forward.

One of them is U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. In a Feb. 23 speech at Dalton State College, Isakson said the pipeline could employ enough people to populate Decatur.

""From Day One, this project [the Keystone pipeline] would employ 20,000 people in the United States,"" Isakson said.  

This jobs figure is a well-worn talking point for pipeline supporters. Georgia U.S. Reps. Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey used it. U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and House Republican Leader Eric Cantor said it as well.

We decided to take a closer look.

We reviewed news accounts, read analyses of the company’s job creation figures, interviewed a spokesman for TransCanada, the firm hoping to build the pipeline, and consulted critics.

We found that while the TransCanada estimate does say that 20,000 ""Americans"" will be directly employed by the project, that’s not what the company’s chief executive has said.

Furthermore, TransCanada’s numbers clash with lower estimates from critics and the U.S. Department of State.

TransCanada has said in a press release that those 20,000 jobs include 13,000 for constructing the pipeline and 7,000 to manufacture steel pipes and other equipment. It predicts it will take two years to complete.

But TransCanada’s estimate does not mean they expect 20,000 people to work on the project, a spokesman told us.

The spokesman provided little clarification. Fortunately, a Washington Post interview with TransCanada’s chief executive and an email interview with the economist who helped produce the company’s job creation estimates shed some light on the figure.

Each ""job"" represents one ""job year"" or one job lasting for one year, they said.  

This means that if a single person works on the project for both years, his or her stint is counted as two ""jobs.""

This could place the number of actual people employed by the pipeline closer to 10,000, or some 6,500 workers in construction and 3,500 in manufacturing. Not 20,000.

These construction jobs are not permanent, and for the most part, they aren’t local. The positions will disappear when the pipeline is complete. The U.S. Department of State, which is in charge of evaluating the project, estimates that only 10 to 15 percent of these jobs can be filled with workers from communities in the pipeline’s path.

News accounts and independent analyses have explored other shortcomings of TransCanada’s figures. A study released September 2011 by Cornell University’s Global Labor Institute determined that the 20,000 jobs figure is ""not substantiated.""  

About 50 percent of the pipe will come from an Arkansas plant owned by Welspun, a company based in India, according to a press release issued by TransCanada. The rest will come from Canada, Italy and India.

In 2009, company officials said that for an earlier phase of the pipeline, it imported bare pipe manufactured overseas. It’s not clear how much finish work the pipe will need once it arrives in the U.S.

We asked TransCanada whether its manufacturing jobs estimates might include foreign workers, but a spokesman did not provide a response.

Other analyses have called into question TransCanada’s jobs figure. A December 2011 report by Bloomberg said the company's estimate that the project would need six or seven construction workers for every mile of the pipeline is higher than the four to five worker average for earlier phases.

An August 2011 estimate published by the State Department said that the project will employ ""approximately 5,000 to 6,000 workers"" in construction jobs.

An independent analysis of TransCanada’s jobs estimates also produced lower numbers.

Using Cornell’s research, William Wade, president of a consulting economics firm, found that the pipeline would create an average of about 16,100 jobs for each of the two years of construction, or 32,200 ""job years.""

Wade’s figure includes more than the jobs for those who build the pipeline. People such as factory workers and checkout clerks also get jobs when project funds are spent on construction materials and wages.

If Keystone were to create 20,000 job years worth of work in construction alone, then those jobs combined with spinoffs should be much higher than 32,200 job years, Wade said.

""The 20,000 jobs number seems like a mistake. It seems like an overestimate,"" Wade said.

Our ruling:

Isakson said that Keystone ""would employ 20,000 people in the United States."" While any construction project creates jobs, the number Isakson uses seems misleadingly high.

Those 20,000 don’t represent actual people, but one job lasting for one year of a two-year project. The number of construction and manufacturing workers may be closer to 10,000, if you accept TransCanada’s estimate.

And there’s strong evidence from credible sources that it may be lower. Finally, it’s an open question how many of the jobs would be in America.

We give Isakson a False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C226500>],/factchecks/2012/apr/11/johnny-isakson/isakson-keystone-pipeline-employ-20000/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Charlie Gonzalez']","
U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez says that in Arizona, Mitt Romney said the state’s SB 1070 law should be model for nation
","
Ahead of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s fundraising visit to Texas last month, U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, a San Antonio Democrat, criticized the former Massachusetts governor’s immigration positions. 
In a March 27, 2012, conference call organized by the Democratic National Committee, Gonzalez said that while in Arizona, Romney said he believes that the state’s much-debated immigration-enforcement law — which originated in 2010 as Senate Bill 1070 — should be the template for federal immigration laws, a stance that Gonzalez described as disturbing. 
We wondered whether Gonzalez accurately characterized Romney’s declaration. 
Gonzalez’s comment to reporters: ""Gov. Romney has actually (said) — while he was in Arizona, of course, and I understand that he was basically maybe playing up to the Arizona crowd — he felt that SB 1070, which has made its way up to the Supreme Court of the United States and will be argued in April, he believes that it should be the template, it should be the model for United States immigration law, not comprehensive immigration reform as the more responsible individuals in Congress have been espousing for a number of years, but an extreme version of an anti-immigrant law passed by the Arizona Legislature."" 
To back up Gonzalez’s statement, DNC spokesman Ricardo Ramirez pointed to an answer Romney gave during the Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Arizona. 
Romney did not say in the debate that Arizona's 2010 law should be adopted by Congress in lieu of comprehensive immigration reform; his reply to a question focused instead on a different, older Arizona statute. That said, we see how his reply could be misread. 
As John King of CNN framed his question to Romney, crowd members applauded mention of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona’s Maricopa County, shown in attendance, who is known for his advocacy of tough immigration policies. Then King said to Romney: ""You've talked, governor, about self-deportation, if businesses do their job, asking for the right documents, the people will leave. But what about arresting? Should there be aggressive, seek them out, find them and arrest them as Sheriff Arpaio advocates?"" 
""You know, I think you see a model here in Arizona,"" Romney answered. ""They passed a law here that says, that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on E-Verify. This E-Verify system allows employers in Arizona to know who's here legally and who's not here legally. And as a result of E-Verify being put in place, the number of people in Arizona that are here illegally has dropped by some 14 percent, where the national average has only gone down 7 percent."" 
E-Verify is a federal, Internet-based system that employers can use to verify whether someone is authorized to work in the United States. Participation is voluntary for most U.S. businesses; there is no federal mandate. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s website says that more than 280,000 employers across the country are using the system. 
Since the Arizona debate, many reporters, opinion columnists, Democrats and liberal groups have interpreted that statement by Romney as him saying that SB 1070 as a whole should be a model, either for the nation or for other states. 
However, Dan Nowicki, the Arizona Republic’s national political reporter, questioned those interpretations in a March 3, 2012, news article, pointing out that Arizona’s requirement that businesses use E-Verify is not contained in SB 1070 but in an earlier state law, the Legal Arizona Workers Act. 
""It's clear from the (debate) transcript that Romney was describing part of the state's 2007 employer-sanctions law, which has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Nowicki wrote. ""That Arizona law requires employers to use a federal electronic system to verify whether new hires are eligible to work in the United States and provides punishment for companies that hire undocumented immigrants."" 
According to Nowicki’s article, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told the Republic that in the Arizona debate, Romney was referring to the E-Verify requirement as the model and not SB 1070. Williams reiterated that statement to us in an email. 
Ramirez, of the DNC, also pointed to the rest of Romney’s debate response in the Feb. 22 debate as backup for Gonzalez’s claim. 
The remainder of Romney’s answer: ""So going back to the question that was asked, the right course for America is to drop these lawsuits against Arizona and other states that are trying to do the job Barack Obama isn't doing. And I will drop those lawsuits on day one. I'll also complete the fence. I'll make sure we have enough Border Patrol agents to secure the fence. And I will make sure we have an E-Verify system and require employers to check the documents of workers, and to check E-Verify. And if an employer hires someone that has not gone through E- Verify, they're going to get sanctioned just like they do for not paying their taxes. You do that, and just as Arizona is finding out, you can stop illegal immigration. It's time we finally did it."" 
So, after praising Arizona’s E-Verify requirement, Romney said that ""the right course for America"" is to drop the lawsuit against Arizona — presumably the Obama administration’s challenge to SB 1070, now before the U.S. Supreme Court. In a telephone interview, Ramirez argued that Romney was indicating that if state laws like Arizona’s SB 1070 became widespread, then he ""would be just fine with that."" 
Williams later told us as much in his email: ""Gov. Romney supports the right of states to craft laws that assist the federal government in enforcing immigration laws, particularly when the federal government has failed in its duty to enforce those laws. As president, Gov. Romney will use federal resources to stop illegal immigration, not to sue states that are seeking to help the federal government enforce the law."" 
Of course, saying he wouldn’t sue states that adopt SB 1070-style laws isn’t the same as saying that Arizona’s law should be the model for federal immigration laws. 
On the other hand, Nowicki noted that even if Romney wasn’t referring to SB 1070 in his ""model"" comment during the Arizona debate, he hadn’t exactly distanced himself from the law, which was designed to spur a crackdown on illegal immigration by Arizona’s state and local law enforcement agencies. 
(Before the law could go into effect, the Obama administration sued, asking a federal judge to block the measure. The judge put on hold several provisions, leaving in place others. That decision, upheld by an appeals court, is scheduled to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on April 25, 2012.) 
In addition to opposing the federal challenge to the law, Romney has touted the endorsement of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped draft SB 1070 — a fact that the Romney campaign noted in its Jan. 11, 2012, press release announcing the endorsement. In the release, Romney said: ""Kris has been a true leader on securing our borders and stopping the flow of illegal immigration into this country. ... With Kris on the team, I look forward to working with him to take forceful steps to curtail illegal immigration and to support states like South Carolina and Arizona that are stepping forward to address this problem."" 
Kobach, who served as an adviser to Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign, has told news organizations, including The Associated Press, that he is serving as an unpaid adviser on immigration issues to Romney's 2012 campaign. 
In an interview with KNXV-TV in Phoenix for a Jan. 31, 2012, report, Kobach said: ""I’m providing advice on the best approach to immigration enforcement and immigration law generally, and I have encouraged the Romney campaign to take a stand of attrition through enforcement, which is what Arizona’s SB 1070 is all about."" 
As The New York Times wrote in a Jan. 24, 2012, blog entry, Romney showed his support for the concept of ""attrition through enforcement"" when he plugged ""self-deportation"" as a solution to illegal immigration during a Republican presidential debate a day earlier. The Times blog post says the strategy of inducing illegal immigrants to leave voluntarily arose from a recognition by groups that oppose illegal immigration that the federal government was not going to deport the millions of illegal immigrants living in the United States. ""Instead, the idea is to make it so difficult for illegal immigrants to live in this country — by denying them work, driver’s licenses and any public benefits and by stepping up enforcement — that they will give up and go home,"" the post said. 
So, Romney in the debate saluted the E-Verify element of a 5-year-old Arizona law — which was not part of the 2010 immigration-enforcement law that Gonzalez says Romney called a model for the nation. 
That’s quite a difference. 
Then again, Romney also said he would end the federal challenge to the 2010 law on his first day as president. 
Finally, we turned to NumbersUSA, an Arlington-Va.-based nonprofit group that opposes illegal immigration and advocates for limits on legal immigration, because it tracks what the presidential candidates say about immigration. The group’s president, Roy Beck, told us that Romney has expressed support for enacting ""attrition by enforcement"" policies on a national level such as requiring that businesses use E-Verify. Beck said Romney has not said specific provisions of SB 1070 should be taken as a model for federal immigration laws. 
Our ruling 
Gonzalez could legitimately have targeted Romney’s vow to immediately drop the federal challenge to Arizona’s immigration-enforcement law as president. Instead, the Democrat’s statement to reporters mischaracterizes Romney’s salute to Arizona’s 2007 mandate that employers electronically verify the legal status of employees. That E-Verify requirement was not in the 2010 Arizona law.

"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'State Budget', 'John Kasich']","
Gov. John Kasich says the rainy day fund has grown from 89 cents to $240 million
","
Gov. John Kasich has had both setbacks and victories since taking office in January 2011, but a Fox News interview on April 2 gave him the chance to focus on success.

""We were the number one job creator in America in February,"" he told anchor Neal Cavuto, ""and we are now the number four job creator in the last year"" -- claims that PolitiFact Ohio checked and rated as True.

Kasich went on to tout the state's fiscal progress, saying, ""Our rainy day fund has gone from 89 cents to $240 million.""

That's quite a swing. We wondered about the numbers, and especially about that bargain-basement figure of 89 cents. We asked Kasich's office for verification.

Spokesman Rob Nichols referred us first to the Office of Budget and Management. Lest we search and not find, it promptly corrected us that it's not really the ""Rainy Day Fund"" but the less colorful ""Budget Stabilization Fund."" (Bob Dylan didn't write ""Budget Stabilization Women #12 & 35."")

OBM issued a statement last July saying that $246.9 million had been transferred from general revenue into the Budget Stabilization Fund, giving it a balance of $246.9 million.

We did the arithmetic with the exact numbers and found the starting balance was $1.78. It's the opening balance for the current fiscal year, according to OBM's summary of fund activity.

Kasich's number of 89 cents is half of that. The governor explained the difference near the end of his State of the State address in February:

""When I came in,"" he said, ""we had a rainy day fund that had 89 cents, and I'm told that budget guru over there, Brian Perera, sent an 89-cent check to double the amount of money we had in the rainy day fund.""

Perera is budget director of the Senate Republican caucus and an acknowledged expert on state finances. The same story about him appeared almost a year ago in the blog Ohio Budget Watch.

It was true, he told us.

The rainy day fund, which was drained by the recession after topping a billion dollars, was left in April 2011 with a balance of 89 cents.

Romney campaign says women were hit hard by job losses under Obama
","
Editor’s note: After this item was published on April 11, 2012, we received an email from the Romney campaign raising several issues about our analysis and asking that we review our work and retract the ruling. Lanhee J. Chen, Romney’s policy director, wrote that our analysis contradicted another ruling written by our partners at PolitiFact Georgia. Chen also criticized us for citing the opinions of two economists with ties to the Obama administration.

We considered the complaint and interviewed four other economists, none of whom have formal or financial ties to any campaigns. Our additional reporting found no reason to change our ruling, which remains at Mostly False. Here is our fact-check, with an addendum at the bottom reflecting our new research and reporting. 
Mitt Romney's campaign wants you to know that the same president who argues for contraceptive coverage and suggests that a Congress with more female members would get more accomplished has also presided over disproportionate job losses among women.
   
On April 6, 2012, Romney’s press secretary Andrea Saul tweeted, ""FACT: Women account for 92.3% of the jobs lost under @BarackObama, a claim also made on Romney's website.
   
She followed it up a few hours later with this: ""@BarackObama touts policies for women & 92.3% jobs lost under him r women's. He's even more clueless than we thought.""
   
When we asked for backup for the claim, the campaign cited national employment figures spanning four years. We found that though the numbers are accurate, their reading of them isn’t.
   
‘Total nonfarm payroll jobs’
   
Romney’s campaign pointed to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics employment figures from January 2009, when Obama took office, and March 2012, for all employees and for female employees.
   
Here they are:
   
* Total Nonfarm Payroll Jobs:
   
January 2009: 133,561,000
       
March 2012: 132,821,000
   
Net loss: 740,000 jobs.
   
* Total Female Nonfarm Payroll Jobs
   
January 2009: 66,122,000
   
March 2012: 65,439,000
   
Net loss: 683,000 jobs.
   
They then divided the net loss among women by the total net loss and came up with 92.3 percent.
   
Beyond the numbers
   
The first problem we find with Saul’s tweet is that it begins counting job losses the first month Obama was in office. We have taken points off previous claims for blaming officeholders for situations that existed at the beginning of their administrations, before their policies have had time to take effect. One could reasonably argue that January 2009 employment figures are more a result of President George W. Bush’s policies, at least as far as any president can be blamed or credited for private-sector hiring.
   
We reached out to Gary Steinberg, spokesman for the BLS, for his take on the claim. He pointed out that women’s job losses are high for that period of time because millions of men had already lost their jobs. Women were next.
   
""Between January 2009 and March 2012 men lost 57,000 jobs, while women lost 683,000 jobs. This is the reverse of the recession period of December 2007-June 2009 (with an overlap of six months) which saw men lose 5,355,000 jobs and women lose 2,124,000 jobs,"" Steinberg told us in an email.

So timing was important. And if you count all those jobs lost beginning in 2007, women account for just 39.7 percent of the total.

Gary Burtless, a labor market expert with the Brookings Institution, explained the gender disparity.
   
""I think males were disproportionately hurt by employment losses in manufacturing and especially construction, which is particularly male-dominated. A lot of job losses in those two industries had already occurred before Obama took office,"" he said. ""Industries where women are more likely to be employed – education, health, the government – fared better in terms of job loss. In fact, health and education employment continued to grow in the recession and in the subsequent recovery.  Government employment only began to fall after the private economy (and private employment) began growing again.""

(Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

Betsey Stevenson, a business and public policy professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and visiting economics professor at Princeton University, who previously served as chief economist for Obama’s labor secretary, also pointed out that ""in every recession men’s job loss occurs first and most, with unemployment rates for men being more cyclical than those of women’s.""

She added that many of women's job losses have been government jobs -- teachers and civil servants -- which have been slower to come back because they require greater government spending.

So have Obama's policies been especially bad for women?

Said Stevenson: ""I don’t think you could point to a single piece of evidence that the pattern of job loss: men first then women, is due to the president’s policies. It’s a historical pattern that has held in previous recessions.""
   
Our ruling
   
Romney's website said that women account for 92.3 percent of jobs lost under Obama.
   
By comparing job figures with January 2009 and March 2012 and weighing them against women’s job figures from the same periods, Saul came up with 92.3 percent. The numbers are accurate but quite misleading. First, Obama cannot be held entirely accountable for the employment picture on the day he took office, just as he could not be given credit if times had been booming. Second, by choosing figures from January 2009, months into the recession, the statement ignored the millions of jobs lost before then, when most of the job loss fell on men. In every recession, men are the first to take the hit, followed by women. It's a historical pattern, Stevenson told us, not an effect of Obama's policies.
   
There is a small amount of truth to the claim, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Addendum

We considered the Romney campaign's complaints but do not see any evidence that warrants changing our ruling.

The other economists agreed the statement was misleading and, for the most part, said it wrongly blamed Obama for broad trends that were part of a long, deep recession.

Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said much of the decline for women was in the public sector.

""To the extent there have been excessive job losses among women, a lot of it has to do with the fact that there has been an enormous reduction in state and local government employment,"" Bartlett said. ""The decline ... has been especially pronounced in this recession as opposed to other recessions.""

This chart from the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed group, bears that out. In earlier recessions, public-sector jobs began increasing again as the economy stabilized. After the most recent recession, they have continued to disappear. Again, these are jobs heavily held by women.

Bartlett added that many of those government jobs were eliminated in states controlled by Republican governors and legislatures.

This story in the Atlantic cited a study by the liberal Roosevelt Institute finding that the 11 states that went Republican in 2010 accounted for 40.5 percent of all state and local government job losses.

Jeff Hayes is a senior research analyst with the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, an organization affiliated with George Washington University’s public policy graduate program that receives contributions from groups including the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Hayes added that ""there’s a lag before the lost tax revenue catches up and government jobs are lost.

""If you break out the 683,000 jobs women lost between January 2009 and March 2012, 64 percent were in government and only 36 percent in the private sector.""

That leads us to a point made by Eileen Appelbaum with the left-leaning Center on Economic and Policy Research. She noted that after the first wave of money in the president’s stimulus bill had run out, Obama asked for another $23 billion in ""emergency aid"" for state and local governments. The money was sought to avert the layoffs of as many as 300,000 public school teachers, but House Republican leaders stripped it.

""You could hardly blame Obama for that,"" Appelbaum said.

As for the comparison with the PolitiFact Georgia item, such direct comparisons are tricky. In this case, the Georgia ruling was on the simpler question of the job creation under President Ronald Reagan, while the Romney claim omitted the critical detail of the loss of jobs for men before Obama took office.

Other fact-checking organizations have examined Romney's claim and come to similar conclusions.

The Associated Press said using the 92.3 percent figure as a measure of Obama’s record on women was ""dubious at best.""

First Read, a politics blog by NBC News, had this to say: ""Does anyone believe, with a straight face, that nine in 10 job losses over the past three years have been women workers?""

And the New York Times disputed the emphasis on the job losses occurring ""under Obama.""

""Presidents get too much credit or blame for changes in the business cycle. Contrary to what seems to be popular opinion, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Obama had or have the unilateral ability to steer the country into good or bad job markets. Neither would a President Romney,"" Times economics writer Catherine Rampell wrote in the Economix blog.

We’ll conclude with this point: Experts agree that the economic recovery has not helped women as much as men. Howard Wall, an economics professor at Lindenwood University, said it’s fair to fault Obama for that. But he took issue with the timeframe of the Romney campaign’s claim -- starting in January 2009 while the recession was still on.

""I think you have to kind of divide the timeline. Call it the Bush recession and the Obama recovery,"" Wall said. ""I don’t give them (the Obama administration) credit for stopping the fall or causing the fall. They had nothing to do with that. But they own the recovery.""

Does all this mean that Obama’s policies have brought hard times to women?

Said Bartlett, the conservative: ""There’s no reason to think so.""",[<zip object at 0x00000280972A6040>],/factchecks/2012/apr/10/mitt-romney/romney-campaign-says-women-were-hit-hard-job-losse/

How many Americans make less than $250,000 a year?
","
How many Americans make less than $250,000 a year? According to tax statistics, it’s a pretty overwhelming number.

President Barack Obama has been making the most of that statistic as he promotes what he calls the ""Buffett Rule.""

""Florida, I've told you where I stand,"" Obama said at a campaign stop in Boca Raton on April 10, 2012. ""So now it's time for members of Congress to tell you where they stand. In the next few weeks we're going to vote on something we call the Buffet Rule.""

Obama’s proposal is that people who have income of $1 million or more per year should be required to pay a minimum tax rate of 30 percent.

""And if we do that, then it makes it affordable for us to be able to say for those people who make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families do, then your taxes don't go up,"" Obama said.

Under current law, many high earners pay significantly less than 30 percent if their income comes from investments instead of earnings.

Critics of the Buffett Rule note that it won’t bring in enough income to significantly dent the budget deficit. Obama spokesman Jay Carney said the president wanted the rule to support the principle of tax fairness but conceded getting the rule passed would be an uphill battle in Congress.

Here, we wanted to fact-check Obama’s statement that ""98 percent of American families"" make less than $250,000 a year.

The White House’s prepared materials on the Buffett Rule included statistics released annually by the Internal Revenue Service that supported the point.

Using statistics from the IRS website, we found that 137,988,219 tax returns out of 140,494,127 -- or 98.2 percent -- reported adjusted gross income of less than $250,000 a year in 2009, the most recent data available.

We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A4DC00>],/factchecks/2012/apr/10/barack-obama/how-many-americans-make-less-250000-year/
"['National', 'Corrections and Updates', 'Federal Budget', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan says Barack Obama 'has doubled the size of government since he took office'
","
On his congressional website, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., makes a striking claim that President Obama has doubled the size of goverment.

Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, is perhaps the leading Republican voice for a fiscally conservative approach to taxing, spending and reducing the federal debt.

So when a reader recently pointed out the doubling-government claim on a web page devoted to Ryan’s views on tax policy, we thought it was worth a look.

Here’s an excerpt from the Web page:

""At a time when Wisconsinites are facing economic uncertainty, a high unemployment rate and a rise in the costs of living, the last thing our country needs are tax increases. President Obama, however, has proposed $1.6 trillion in new taxes on families, small businesses and job creators and tripling the debt since he was elected. At the same time, the president has doubled the size of government since he took office. Instead of chasing higher spending with ever-higher taxes, Congress needs to make our tax code fair, competitive and simple. Unfortunately, our current tax system fails on these three elements.""

Further down the page, Ryan adds a bit more detail about his doubling-government claim.

""Strong leadership is needed in the White House, but despite repeated acknowledgments of the gravity of the federal government’s fiscal outlook, the president seems to have ignored the warnings of his own experts and punted on the (fiscal year) 2012 budget. The budget proposal he submitted to Congress last year continues down the same unsustainable path: doubling the size of government since the President took office, imposing $1.6 trillion in new taxes on families, small businesses and job creators and tripling the debt since the President was elected. This crushing burden of debt is holding back economic growth. President Obama’s budget was defeated by a vote of 0 to 97 in the Senate. We have tried to borrow, spend,and tax our way to prosperity, and it hasn’t worked. The President is expected to put forward his budget proposal for (fiscal year) 2013 in the near future. I remain hopeful that he will work with Congress to address these important challenges facing our country.""

According to the second passage above, Ryan is referring to Obama’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal -- the one released in early 2011, rather than the current one, which was released in early 2012. So we’ll focus on Obama’s fiscal year 2012 proposal.

We didn’t hear back from Ryan’s office, but we think the most obvious way to interpret his statement is by measuring the size of federal outlays -- that is, the money spent by the federal government. Ryan is, after all, talking about budget figures.

First, let’s look at the amount of federal outlays when Obama ""took office."" According to the Office of Management and Budget, federal outlays for fiscal year 2009 -- the fiscal year that was underway when Obama was inaugurated -- totaled $3.5 trillion.

To look at federal outlays for subsequent years, we turned to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. The numbers are broadly similar to OMB’s, but since CBO is an independent agency, rather than part of the Obama administration, budget experts suggested that we use CBO’s numbers instead.

CBO concluded that by fiscal year 2012 -- the current fiscal year -- the president’s budget proposal would increase federal outlays to $3.7 trillion. That’s a 6 percent increase -- a far cry from doubling.

If you take a longer time horizon, the outlays come closer to doubling, but still not close. By fiscal year 2021 -- the final year for which CBO provided its analysis and long after Obama will have left office -- federal outlays would reach $5.8 trillion. That’s an increase of 66 percent, which is still not double.

However, even if that figure truly represented a doubling, using the 2021 figure is misleading. When Ryan said that Obama ""has doubled the size of government since he took office,"" it sounds like he’s saying Obama has already doubled the size of government -- not that his spending blueprint will lead to doubled federal outlays at a point five years after Obama’s theoretical second term in office will have come to an end.

""I think it is pretty clear"" that Ryan’s claim ""in a straight budget sense is false, because it implies it has already happened,"" said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.

Just to be sure, we also looked at the figures for federal outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product. These numbers actually decline from 25.0 percent in fiscal 2009 to 23.6 percent in fiscal 2012, and then moves within a narrow range, ending up at 24.2 percent in fiscal 2021. No doubling here, either.

Finally, there’s the question of whether Obama would be to blame even if the doubling claim was true. Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who specializes in budget issues, is skeptical

""Were all the increased outlays because of Obama's actions? Of course not,"" Meyers said. ""Many of them were the result of ‘mandatory’ policies in place before he took office, and those policies responded to unfavorable economic conditions -- deposit insurance, food stamps, Medicaid, unemployment insurance and so on.""

Indeed, discretionary spending -- the line items that Obama had the most control over when he assembled his budget -- represented between 25 and 40 percent of federal outlays during most of the 10 year period that CBO studied. The rest -- a clear majority -- consists of mandatory spending and net interest on the federal debt. 
Finally, while we doubted this is what Ryan meant, we also looked at whether the number of federal employees had doubled under Obama. Federal employment has never risen by more than 10 percent above its January 2009 level, excluding temporary Census jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And there is no reliable statistical way to measure changes in the federal government's regulatory burden, said Stan Collender, a former staff member of the House and Senate Budget Committees, who is a partner at Qorvis, a public relations firm.

Our ruling

Even Ryan’s out-of-date budget data offers no support for the notion that Obama ""has doubled the size of government since he took office.""

As the House's budget leader and a key spokesman for his party’s budgetary proposals, Ryan should have known better. We rate his statement Pants on Fire. 
UPDATE: After our story appeared, Ryan’s office got back to us. They said that they had been using fiscal year 2008 as their base year, rather than fiscal year 2009. Using the 2008 figures, federal outlays do roughly double between 2008 and 2021 under Obama’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal. However, we think it’s inaccurate to use fiscal 2008 as the base year, since that year ended about four months before Obama took office. In any case, our previous concerns -- using figures for 2021, when Obama will have been out of office for either five or nine years, and ignoring the role of mandatory spending in expanding federal outlays -- still stand, and we’re keeping the rating at Pants on Fire. In addition, Ryan’s office removed the sentence we checked after our story appeared. It has been replaced by a sentence that reads, ""At the same time, the president will double the national debt and his plan ensures it will triple in the next eight years.""",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CF1080>],/factchecks/2012/apr/10/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-barack-obama-has-doubled-size-government/

Does Oregon spend more on tax breaks than on public safety, health care and education combined?
","
Jefferson Smith has his sights set on the Portland mayor’s office, but state issues seem to pop up in his campaign. Little wonder, given that he’s represented Portland in the Oregon House since 2009.

One fact he’s taken to repeating -- first during a candidates’ forum hosted by Family Forward Oregon and Mother PAC and later during a Rotary Club meeting -- is that ""at the state level we're spending more on tax expenditures than we are on public safety, health care and education combined.""

Tax expenditures is government-speak for what most of us call tax breaks. ""I think we should think about money beyond tax breaks,"" he said, just before making his claim. ""That is a handy tool. But it is a tool we've been using for years and years and years and years.""

Sure, tax breaks come in lots of different shapes and sizes -- seniors can deduct medical expenses, businesses can get breaks for green building improvements -- but could they really outweigh the amount the state spends on some of its core programs?

We got to checking.

Smith’s campaign wasn’t very helpful -- staffers had no source for his claim and his spokeswoman, Stacey Dycus, told us the idea was ""a random remark he made when explaining something.""

We were on our own. Thankfully, we know our way around the state budget.

Our first stop was the state’s 2011-2013 tax expenditure report. The report pretty clearly lays out the amount of tax expenditures -- or breaks -- for the current biennium. All told, the state gives about $12 billion in income tax breaks, $19 billion in property tax breaks and just over $100 million in others, for a grand total of $31.3 billion in forgone revenues.

Getting those figures was the easy part -- the hard part was figuring out what to compare them to. See, the state’s budget can be diced and parsed in dozens of ways. Generally, though, we talk about the state’s general fund and lottery budget -- this budget deals with the money that the state has the most discretionary power over -- and the total funds budget -- the money that includes cash we get from the feds for, say, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as food assistance programs.

Let’s start with the all funds budget. The current budget accounts for nearly $59 billion in total spending -- this is without the tax breaks. Of that, $13.5 billion goes to education and $3.6 billion goes to public safety. The health care figure is a little harder to come by. The best estimate we could dig up is the total funds budget for the Oregon Health Authority -- the executive bureaucracy that does the majority of the state’s health care work. That budget is just over $12 billion.

If you add those three budget areas, you get $29.1 billion, about $2.2 billion short of the tax breaks the state gives. By this measurement, Smith is right.

Now, the other way to do this would be to look at the general and lottery funds budget. This way might be somewhat fairer, given that so much of the total funds budget is made up of federal dollars. All told, the current general and lottery funds budget includes about $11.7 billion for health care, education and public safety. Obviously, that’s quite a bit less than the $31.3 billion in state tax breaks.

The problem here is, you can’t directly compare those two figures. See, we said earlier that there’s a report that pretty clearly lays out the various tax giveaway, but what it doesn’t do is explain exactly how that money would be rerouted if it were being collected by the state. For instance, $19 billion of those giveaways are for property taxes. Most of that money would go to municipalities if it were collected -- not the state. There is an argument to be made that about 40 percent of the property tax revenue would go to local schools -- relieving a burden on the state and freeing up cash, but that’s all indirect.

That said, about $12 billion of those giveaways -- the part that comes by way of income taxes -- would wind up in the state’s general fund budget. Again, that’s slightly more than the $11.7 billion the state pays on those three program areas.

We wanted to add a little bit of context to all of this because tax policy is never so simple, so we made calls to folks in the state’s legislative fiscal and revenue offices and to the state’s chief economist. Paul Warner from the revenue office explained it the most clearly.

Smith is ""technically correct,"" he said, that there’s about $31 billion in lost revenue. But, he cautioned ""there would be a lot of steps to try and collect those dollars.""

The revenue document itself gets at this, too. It notes that the dollar impact listed for tax breaks is not the amount of revenue you could gain if you wanted to repeal all of them. It gets very technical and somewhat boring here, so we’ll give you just one example: Federal land, which Oregon has a lot of, is exempt from property taxes. And, Warner notes, ""there's federal law that prohibits us from taxing federal land.""

Certainly some of these tax breaks are up for grabs if the Legislature decided to mine a few of them for increased revenues. On the books are laws for home mortgage deductions along with tax cuts for green energy, and property tax exemptions for private aircraft.  

Smith knows that. Last year, he pushed for a package of bills that would have tamped down on some of these credits, including one that would put a sunset date on all income tax credits, subtractions and exemptions. Indeed, the Legislature has since instituted a six-year cycle in which all credits will get reviewed before being renewed. That’s a little beyond the point, though.

As for our ruling, Smith’s claim is accurate. The state does spend more on tax breaks than it does on public safety, health care and education. This holds true whether you look at the larger all funds budget, or the smaller general and lottery funds budget. But there is some important context here, including the fact that many of those tax breaks are off limits to state lawmakers.

We rate this claim Mostly True -- accurate but it requires some clarification.

Chain email says media ignored recent 'raid on the Arizona border'
","The photos tell a story.

But is it the one a chain email says they tell?

A screed popping into in-boxes in April 2012 says it depicts a raid on the U.S.-Mexico border, where U.S. border patrol, Mexican patrol, Arizona SWAT teams and ""sheriff’s undercover agents"" seized an impressive cache of assault weapons, ammunition, grenades and launchers.

More than two dozen photos support the narrative: Tarps covered with weapons. Men in military garb sorting clips loaded with bullets. Unmarked SUVs. Recovered uniforms.

Several images still carry Spanish-language captions.

""Why was there no news coverage of this raid on the Arizona border?"" the email says. ""Seizure was just five days ago. Right on the Arizona border!""

The message text includes a date: March 2, 2012.

A reader sent us the message, saying she had received it from at least three people in recent days.

We had to know: Did a significant raid take place in early March along the Arizona border that mainstream media failed to report?

‘WE MUST PROTECT OUR BORDERS!!!!!’

The email begins:
  This is terrifying that we are seeing NONE of this on the news!!! WE MUST PROTECT OUR BORDERS!!!!! This is the 2nd raid this year - this one took place on 3/2/12 at 3 am - Border Patrol, Mexican Patrol, AZ swat teams and sheriff's undercover agents. I worked with one of the agent's dad for 25+ years and he sent these pictures this afternoon. 3-7-2012 Our country is in BIG trouble....Why was there no news coverage of this raid on the Arizona border? Definitely NOT Jose wishing to come pick lettuce! This is exactly why we MUST support ARIZONA. This seizure was just five days ago. Right on the Arizona border! This is but one seizure that has taken place along the border over the past year. There have been many more like this (but you won't hear about it on major media news). Not a mention on ABC - CBS - NBC - MSNBC - or CNN news- - even on FOX. These photos and reports come from a Spanish language news source. Thank God for the border patrol and that they did not allow this to get in. Huge stash of assault rifles (grenade launchers in center!). 
So, was there an Arizona border raid?

Um, no.

The first clues are in the Spanish-language photo captions. They refer just to an operation by ""the military,"" near the municipality of Higueras. One says the raid happened at 10 a.m. about a third of a mile from the Marin-Higueras highway. Another says at least 25 offenders escaped to the mountains.

Any reference to the United States? No. Arizona? No. March 2012? No.

A quick Web search for roads identified in the photo captions turns up another false note: a YouTube video posted not last month, but in May 2010. It includes the same images repeated in the email message.

The Mexican town of Higueras, it turns out, is about 800 miles from the Arizona border. It’s more than 130 miles from Nuevo Laredo, Texas. (Or, by another measure, about 70 miles from the U.S. border.)

Snopes debunked a version of this chain email in August 2010.

A Newsweek article on May 17, 2010, says the Mexican military discovered a major training camp run by the Zetas drug cartel. Maybe you heard about the raid — back when it actually happened.

Our ruling

A chain email in April 2012 recycles images from a raid that happened nowhere near Arizona, and certainly not on March 2, 2012. ""Why was there no news coverage of this raid on the Arizona border?"" it says. ""Seizure was just five days ago. Right on the Arizona border!""

David Dewhurst says poverty ranks up by 6.4 million under Obama
","
In an online video suggesting that President Barack Obama plays golf while Americans suffer, U.S. Senate candidate David Dewhurst highlights the increase in the number of people living in poverty since Obama took office. 
The ad from the Texas lieutenant governor shows video of Obama golfing or riding a golf cart along with snippets of others speaking about the nation’s economic troubles. The video culminates with these claims, which appear in red letters: ""6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama"" and ""over 90 rounds of golf."" 
We’ve already checked the sporty part of that claim, rating as True the statement that Obama has played more than 90 rounds of golf since he became president. Here, we’ll focus on Dewhurst’s claim that the ranks of the poor have grown by 6.4 million. 
As backup, Dewhurst’s campaign sent us a January 2012 editorial from the conservative Washington Examiner that says ""there are 6.4 million more Americans in poverty today than when Obama took office."" 
Dewhurst’s campaign also pointed us to a page from the website of the Senate Republican Conference, which consists of Republican members of the U.S. Senate. The page — dated April 2, 2012, and titled ""He’s Made it Worse: The Obama Economic Record"" — is presented as a comparison of conditions when Obama became president and ""today"" according to statistics such as the unemployment rate and the size of the federal debt. 
Under ""Americans in Poverty,"" the page says there were 39.8 million on Obama’s inauguration day (Jan. 20, 2009) and are 46.2 million ""today."" The difference: 6.4 million people. 
The page does not give a source for the poverty numbers, so we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the official federal source of poverty statistics. The bureau uses a measure of poverty called the ""poverty thresholds"" to help determine the number of U.S. residents living in poverty. If a family has an income below the relevant threshold, then the members of that family are considered to be living in poverty. 
The bureau’s thresholds, which are adjusted annually for inflation, vary by family size. For example, the preliminary figures for 2011, which are the most recent thresholds, show that a family of four people would be considered to be living in poverty if it earned less than $23,018 through the year. Alternatively, the 2011 threshold for single people younger than 65 is $11,702. 
The bureau’s thresholds are different from the poverty guidelines overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which are used to determine if applicants are eligible for government assistance programs. 
Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us that the bureau estimates the number of U.S. residents living in poverty on an annual basis. The figure is based on a survey of a scientifically selected sample of about 100,000 households that takes place between February and April each year. 
The survey asks respondents their income for the previous year. And from the survey results, the bureau extrapolates the number of U.S. residents that were living in poverty that year. 
The 2010 poverty statistics were released in September 2011. The next estimate of the number of U.S. residents living in poverty, for 2011, is scheduled for release in September 2012. 
We should note that there have long been concerns about the bureau’s measure, which determines a person or family’s poverty status based on before-tax cash income. One of the primary identified weaknesses with this method is that it does not take into account government policies or benefits that can shrink a family’s income (such as payroll taxes) or enhance it (such as food stamps). Another criticism: The thresholds are not adjusted to account for variations in the cost of living in different places. 
We checked the bureau’s poverty figures to compare with the Senate Republican Conference’s data and found that the group was comparing the number of Americans in poverty in 2008 to the number in 2010. In other words, the Senate group used the bureau’s 2008 statistic — 39.8 million — for the number of people in poverty on Obama’s inauguration day in January 2009. And it used the 2010 statistic — 46.2 million, the most recent — for its count of poor Americans in April 2012. 
The bureau data show that the estimated number of U.S. residents in poverty in 2010, Obama’s second year in office, was greater by 6.4 million than it was in 2008, George W. Bush’s final full year in office. The largest increase came in 2009, Obama’s first year in office, when the poverty total was 3.8 million higher than the year before. In 2010, the number was 2.6 million greater than the 2009 level. 
The 46.2 million residents in poverty in 2010 amounted to the greatest number of Americans in the low-income category since the government started tracking the statistic in 1959. 
But the recent increase did not start on Obama’s watch. The number of Americans living in poverty, by the bureau’s measure, first creeped up in 2007, when 800,000 more people were in poverty than the year before. The subsequent 2008 increase: 2.5 million people. 
In fact, during Bush’s eight years as president, the estimated number of Americans in poverty rose every year but two. We applied the Dewhurst campaign’s methodology to the Bush years, comparing the number of people in poverty the year before Bush took office (2000) with the number during his last full year in office (2008). We found an increase of 8.2 million people. 
In making such comparisons, though, there is another, better way to judge change. 
As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact-check, because of population growth, it’s important to notice shifts in the share of all residents in poverty. And during the years Dewhurst focused on, the portion of U.S. residents in poverty increased, although like the estimated number of people in poverty, the climb began in 2007. The figures: 
** 2006: 12.3 percent
** 2007: 12.5 percent (0.2 percentage point increase)
** 2008: 13.2 percent (0.7 percentage point increase)
** 2009: 14.3 percent (1.1 percentage point increase)
** 2010: 15.1 percent (0.8 percentage point increase) 
The 2010 poverty rate of 15.1 percent was higher than that of every year for more than four decades, save two — 1983, when the rate was 15.2 percent, and 1993, when it was the same as the 2010 figure, 15.1 percent. 
A September 2011 New York Times news article about the 2010 poverty statistics said economists pointed to joblessness associated with the 2008 financial collapse and subsequent recession as the main factor pushing more Americans into poverty. 
A final note: Dewhurst implies that Obama is to blame for the rising number of people in poverty. 
But our sense is that it’s unfair to place all the responsibility in the president’s lap. The economic downturn began before Obama took office. Also, poverty experts such as Sheldon Danziger, director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan, say that more Americans would have been forced into poverty without the 2009 federal stimulus plan, championed by Obama, which included billions of dollars for programs that help low-income Americans such as Medicaid and unemployment insurance. More broadly, no single official controls the number of Americans living in poverty. 
Our ruling 
Dewhurst’s figures draw from a reliable source on Americans in poverty in 2010 — which, of course, is not 2012 — compared with 2008, the year before Obama became president. 
A better understanding of the extent of U.S. poverty lies in looking at the share of Americans in dire straits. That measure also supports Dewhurst’s point — that poverty has increased during Obama’s term. Then again, the percentage of residents in poverty had begun to grow in 2007, two years before Obama’s first in office. 
Finally, it’s a reach to say Obama is personally to blame for the increase in poverty. 
On balance, we rate Dewhurst’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097455280>],/factchecks/2012/apr/10/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-poverty-ranks-64-million-under/

Dem in Wisconsin governor recall says GOP-backed bill means women ""can't do something about"" pay discrimination
","
In making her case to be elected governor in Wisconsin's 2012 recall election, Democrat Kathleen Falk railed against actions taken by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature during a speech on March 24, 2012.

Addressing a candidates forum on the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Ojibwe reservation in northwestern Wisconsin, Falk made this statement about pay equity for women:

""It used to be, thanks to the work of our Legislature and prior governor, that that man and woman sitting right in the front row there, doing the same job at the workplace, he making a dollar, she making 81 cents to the dollar, doing the same job -- well, until a couple weeks ago, she had a right to do something about it. But the Republican Legislature passed a bill that you said you can't. That bill's on Governor Walker's desk. I've urged him to veto it.""  

We previously looked at a claim related to the same bill. We gave a Mostly False to state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, for saying the bill would repeal a law that ensures men and women get equal pay.

Falk's statement is slightly different.

The former Dane County executive claims that women would no longer have ""a right to do something"" about pay discrimination on the job if the bill is signed by Walker. (The measure won Walker’s approval on April 5, 2012)

Falk’s case

Asked to back up the statement, Falk campaign spokesman Scot Ross said the bill would take away the right of women who suffer pay discrimination to sue in state court, ""so there's nothing women can do.""

But when we assessed the Mason claim, we found there would still be other recourse for employment discrimination victims: 
-- There are two routes to filing an employment discrimination complaint -- the state Equal Rights Division and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
-- If workers prove discrimination using the state system, an administrative law judge can ""make them whole"" by ordering the employer to pay back pay with interest, legal fees and job reinstatement, if there was a termination. If the discrimination is proved in the federal system, often a ""make whole"" settlement is reached through mediation. 
-- In either system, discriminated workers can collect larger sums of money from an employer -- compensatory and punitive damages -- only by suing. 
Options available

So women suffering pay discrimination could still file a state or federal complaint in an effort to be made whole. And they could still seek larger monetary damages by suing in federal court.

Indeed, the option of suing in state court was instituted only recently, in 2009, under a law adopted when Democrats controlled the Legislature and governor’s office.

A lawyer who specializes in representing workers told us the GOP bill would make it harder on victims of employment discrimination because it is easier to sue in state court than in federal court.

But eliminating the state lawsuit option wouldn't affect the three other avenues of legal recourse available to workplace discrimination victims.

And Falk’s claim was women facing pay discrimination would have no options at all.

Our rating

Falk said women facing pay discrimination can't ""do something about it"" under a bill passed by Wisconsin Republicans. But of the four legal options available under the current law, only one would be eliminated by the bill.

We rate Falk's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C447540>],/factchecks/2012/apr/10/kathleen-falk/dem-wisconsin-governor-recall-says-gop-backed-bill/
"['Jobs', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Gov. Rick Scott changes the math for '700,000 jobs'
","
Rick Scott, the candidate, ran on a platform of creating jobs. That's why the businessman-turned-politician won a bruising Republican primary last summer, he said. That's why he squeaked by Democrat Alex Sink in November 2010. ""That was my whole campaign,"" he said in February. ""Seven steps to 700,000 jobs over seven years.""

And more than a year since candidate Scott rolled out his 7-7-7 plan, Gov. Scott still talks frequently about those 700,000 jobs.

But just how do you keep track?

Scott the candidate offered one measure: ""Our plan is seven steps to 700,000 jobs,"" he said in a debate a year ago, ""and that plan is on top of what normal growth would be."" Now Scott the governor is offering another. ""700,000,"" he told reporters Oct. 4, 2011, when asked how many jobs he promised to create.

""But the initial promise was to create 700,000 on top of projected growth,"" Scott was asked.

""No,"" Scott said.

While the creation of those jobs is a central promise we're tracking on the Scott-O-Meter, we wanted to rate Scott's statements about his promise on our Flip-O-Meter, which PolitiFact Florida created to measure whether a candidate's shifting on any particular position.

 Scott: 'We're going to grow 700,000 more jobs'

Let's rewind to July 2010. State economists had already estimated Florida's recession rebound — no matter who the new governor might be — would add more than 1 million jobs by 2017. On July 21, Scott unveiled his 7-7-7 plan. He would introduce ""accountability budgeting."" He would reduce government spending. He would cut regulation. He would focus on job growth and retention. He would invest in world-class universities. He would shrink property taxes. He would get rid of the state's corporate income tax. Those changes would create 665,000 jobs over seven years. He rounded up, and the 700,000 jobs promise was born.

Reporters wanted to know: If the state's expected growth alone was projected to restore 1 million jobs, did that mean Scott's structural changes to spending, regulation and the tax code would add 700,000 more?

""Are those jobs that are in addition to the number of jobs that are going to be created automatically, just without any change in tax policy over the next five or 10 years?"" a reporter asked Scott while traveling on his campaign bus. (We know, because we have the video.)

Scott answered yes, then pointed out that jobs aren't created automatically. The reporter then corrected himself.

""Well, projected. The job creation that is projected over the next five years,"" he said.

""It's what's projected, yeah. It's what's projected, yeah,"" Scott said, nodding. ""It's on top of that. If you do these things we're going to grow 700,000 more jobs."" 

Reporters had their answer. Scott's plan would ""grow 700,000 more jobs"" than Florida would generate without him.

Three months later, Scott made pretty much the same statement during a debate sponsored by Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association. (We have video of that, too.)

""Our plan is seven steps to 700,000 jobs, and that plan is on top of what normal growth would be,"" Scott said.

The debate moderator later noted that would mean creating about 1.7 million jobs, when only about 1 million Floridians were currently unemployed.

""We're going to grow the state,"" Scott responded.

In November, Florida elected the jobs governor.

 Scott: 'I don't know who said that'

Not long after that, Scott moved the goalpost.

The new promise: Create 700,000 jobs. Period.

In June, Scott spokesman Brian Burgess touted news that Florida had added 50,000 jobs since January, saying that Scott was going to count every one toward keeping his promise.

In the same few days, another Scott spokesman, Lane Wright, brushed off a question about Scott's original promise to create 700,000 jobs ""on top of what normal growth would be.""

""Gov. Scott committed to creating 700,000 jobs in seven years, and we are on track to meet that goal,"" Wright said.

In August, the governor himself weighed in. An Associated Press reporter reminded Scott that his jobs plan was designed to generate 700,000 jobs on top of those restored by the state's expected growth.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097488F80>],/factchecks/2011/oct/04/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-changes-math-700000-jobs-pledge/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie talks up job growth in New Jersey
","
Even before Gov. Chris Christie on Tuesday announced -- once again -- that he would not run for president, his conservative credentials and record in New Jersey had come under attack by members of each party.

Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain said Christie was too liberal, and Democratic Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley blamed Christie for high unemployment in the Garden State.

When the governor announced his decision to stay put in New Jersey, a reporter asked how much the criticism played into his decision.

""None. None. Because New Jersey's unemployment is significantly lower than it was when I got here,"" Christie said in a nationally televised news conference on Tuesday. ""And we've created 50,000 new private-sector jobs in the last 20 months after having lost 117,000 in the year before I got here.""

The governor is sticking around New Jersey -- ""whether you like it or not,"" as he said -- so PolitiFact New Jersey decided to see if the man in charge of Trenton has his facts straight.

We found that his numbers are accurate, but as in previous cases, he may be taking too much credit.

First, let’s review the unemployment changes.

When Christie took office in January 2010, New Jersey’s unemployment rate stood at 9.8 percent and there were 441,223 unemployed individuals, according to federal labor statistics. As of August 2011, the most recent data available, the state’s unemployment rate was 9.4 percent with 421,676 unemployed people.

That means the unemployment rate dropped by 0.4 percent and the number of unemployed individuals fell by 19,547. However, Christie said unemployment was ""significantly lower.""

New Jersey’s unemployment rate is moving in the right direction, but to be considered statistically significant, an over-the-year change in the state’s unemployment rate would have to be 0.9 percent, according to Sandra Mason, chief of the division of Local Area Unemployment Statistics at the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

New Jersey’s unemployment rate is lower, but not statistically significant.

Now, let’s talk about that private-sector job growth.

From February 2010 to August 2011, the state added 45,300 private-sector jobs. So the governor’s numbers are largely accurate -- but Christie can’t take all the credit for private-sector job growth.

In a previous ruling on a Christie statement about private-sector job creation, we spoke to several experts who said growth in that sector is the result of a variety of factors and can’t be attributed specifically to any governor. We rated the statement Half True.

Kim Rueben, director of the state and local program of the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said in an Aug. 17 email that ""it isn’t clear a specific governor can take a lot of credit for the new jobs. I think governors and state governments can change the climate but in general there has been little research showing specific programs (or economic development credits) have actually led to job creation.""

Christie also said the job growth in his administration came after New Jersey lost 117,000 private-sector jobs the year before he took office.

If you look at labor statistics from December 2008 to December 2009, Christie is dead on: the state lost 117,700 private-sector jobs. From January 2009 to January 2010, 105,000 private-sector jobs were eliminated.

Rutgers University professor Joseph Seneca told us the three measures cited above -- the reduction in the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons, and the increase in private-sector jobs -- all tell the same story.

""The data from both surveys point to improving labor market conditions,"" Seneca said. ""It’s a good start.""  

Our ruling

Christie said, ""New Jersey's unemployment is significantly lower than it was when I got here. And we've created 50,000 new private-sector jobs in the last 20 months after having lost 117,000 in the year before I got here.""

His statistics on private-sector job growth are accurate, and the unemployment rate is lower. But the unemployment decline is not statistically significant. And as we’ve said in the past, Christie can’t take all the credit for job growth in the Garden State.

We rate his statement Half True.

"['Immigration', 'Health Care', 'Texas', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum says Rick Perry talked up binational health insurance in a 2001 speech
","
In the Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate, Rick Santorum called Rick Perry soft on illegal immigration, citing the Texas governor's continued support for a state law allowing some children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. 
Also, Santorum said, Perry ""gave a speech in 2001 where he talked about binational health insurance between Mexico and Texas. I mean, I don't even think Barack Obama would be for binational health insurance."" 
We wondered whether Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, was right in insinuating that Perry spoke in favor of binational health insurance in 2001. 
First, some background: Binational, or ""cross-border,"" health insurance refers to coverage that provides benefits in two countries or in a country other than the one in which an enrollee lives or works. 
California has been a leader in binational plans, according to a 2010 report by David Warner, a professor at the University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs. He told us in an interview that although plan specifics differ, the general idea is for U.S. employers to offer their workers a choice between receiving their health care services exclusively in Mexico or getting standard U.S.-based coverage. Workers may live and work in the United States or may live in Mexico and commute across the border to legally work on the U.S. side. 
Warner's report says that at least four U.S. insurers offer binational plans that allow enrollees to access networks of providers in Mexico. For example, Blue Shield of California's ""Access Baja"" option generally restricts enrollees, who must live within 50 miles of the California-Mexico border, to seeking care through providers in the Mexican border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali. 
Proponents say that because binational plans are cheaper than standard U.S. plans (primarily because health care is cheaper in Mexico), they make it easier for low-income workers to afford coverage. 
In Texas, the state Department of Insurance told us that it doesn't know of insurers offering cross-border plans. However, it's possible that some employers in the border area do — if they are ""self-funded,"" meaning they bear the financial responsibility and risks of coverage themselves. Such plans are not regulated by the agency. 
Texas proponents of binational plans have said they could help reduce the uninsured population in the state's border region. In 2010, 43 percent of border residents were uninsured, compared to 23 percent statewide, according to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services. 
Opponents have expressed concerns about the quality of care provided by Mexican health care providers and the inability of the state to monitor it. 
Back to Perry and his speech. 
According to an Aug. 31, 2011, Dallas Morning News blog post, Perry mentioned binational health insurance at an August 2001 summit on border issues. It was hosted by the University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg, which is in the Rio Grande Valley about 10 miles from the Texas-Mexico border. 
According to news articles, the meeting brought together high-level government officials and business leaders from Mexico and the United States, including Norman Mineta, then the U.S. secretary of transportation. An Aug. 23, 2001, Morning News news article said panels at the summit weighed topics such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, water issues and border health concerns. 
Perry spoke to the gathering on Aug. 22, 2001. According to the text of his remarks, posted on his state website, he was upbeat about increased cooperation and trade between the United States and Mexico. And he called for the two nations to work together to solve shared problems. 
Perry then touched on infrastructure, trade and water issues before focusing on health care. He singled out several problems in border areas, including a lack of preventive care and the limited availability of medical specialists. ""We have much to gain if we work together to expand preventative care and treat maladies unique to this region,"" Perry said. 
Perry next said a legislative proposal by then-state Rep. Pat Haggerty, R-El Paso, and state Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., D-Brownsville, ""establishes an important study that will look at the feasibility of binational health insurance. This study recognizes that the Mexican and U.S. sides of the border compose one region, and we must address health care problems throughout that region."" 
Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman in the governor’s office, confirmed that Perry's mention of a binational health insurance study referred to a bill passed during the 2001 legislative session that created a committee to ""assess the health care needs of the border area"" and ""the affordability, cost-effectiveness, economic impact, and improved health status achievable through binational health benefit plan coverage."" 
Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Perry's presidential campaign, said the study ""ultimately concluded there were numerous barriers to accomplishing"" binational health insurance, ""and the Legislature took no further action on this concept."" 
The January 2003 report by the Interim Committee on Binational Health Benefit Plan Coverage, first discusses health care concerns in the Texas border region and California's experience with binational health insurance. It then lays out cost savings that binational insurance plans were projected to generate in Texas, as well as legal and practical impediments to implementing them. 
The report closes with 10 scenarios for moving forward if the Legislature ""determines that binational health plans are a viable option to provide affordable health plans."" The scenarios range from changing state law covering health maintenance organizations to allow for binational options to setting up a pilot project that would allow the plans to be offered in one part of the border region. 
In 2007, Sen. Lucio and Rep. Jose Menendez, D-San Antonio, introduced proposals to allow for the offering and regulating of ""cross border"" health benefit plans covering medical services within 75 miles of either side of the border. Those measures died. 
We asked Perry's campaign whether he favors binational health plan options for border residents and received no response. Separately, we reviewed news accounts and other Perry speeches and statements for signs that Perry talked up binational health insurance before or after his 2001 speech. 
We found one earlier reference, in an Aug. 6, 2001, ""editorial"" on the governor’s state website describing how legislation passed during that year's session would help the border region. Perry highlighted the same bill that led to the 2003 report: ""We further addressed health care needs through House Bill 2498, which establishes an interim study to provide recommendations for the development of affordable and accessible health care coverage — including the possibility of bi-national health care coverage — along the Texas-Mexico border region."" 
Earlier in 2001, Perry vetoed a measure calling for state health officials to develop a statewide ""strategic health plan,"" including an examination of how increased trade with Mexico had affected the border region. In a statement, Perry said one reason for the veto was ""the failure to include a binational approach to developing the plan."" 
""Effective solutions should also involve the cooperation and the commitment"" of Mexico, Perry said. 
Our ruling 
Perry talked about binational health insurance in a 2001 speech, as Santorum said. However, his dig about Perry's mention wrongly implies that the governor is working to establish binational health insurance. We found no evidence of Perry taking further action in the 10 years since. 
We rate Santorum's statement Half True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Pundits', ""Bill O'Reilly""]","
$16 muffin included coffee, tea, event space
","The $16 muffin: It’s just another piece of evidence that federal spending is out of control, according to pundit Bill O’Reilly and others who have pounced on an inspector general's report as evidence of a wasteful Washington.

O’Reilly left his usual perch hosting The O’Reilly Factor on Fox News to visit Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show. The announced topic was O’Reilly’s new book about Abraham Lincoln.

But the segment quickly became two powerful pundits from opposite sides of the political spectrum debating the role of government in society.

That, and trying to crack each other up.

""The $16 dollar muffin -- do we all know what the $16 muffin is?"" O’Reilly said, looking around. Stewart hadn’t heard, which seemed to delight O’Reilly, while the audience guffawed.

""Look, $16 muffin,"" O’Reilly explained. ""Broke the story last week on ‘The Factor.’ You were otherwise occupied, making your little wise remarks, not reading what’s happening. They had a bunch of conferences for pin heads, the federal government’s, and they ordered 250 muffins at 16 bucks a piece.""

""That’s a lot for muffins,"" Stewart said, playing the straight guy.

""Yeah!"" said O’Reilly.

The trouble with O’Reilly’s anecdote is that it’s not entirely accurate.

The $16 muffin started with a 122-page report released Sept. 20, 2011, from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General. The report followed a 2007 audit that found few internal controls on conference spending, especially for food and beverages. New guidelines were issued, and this year’s report was a check-up to see how the department was doing.

Not so great, according to the recent report.

""All the conferences occurred at major hotels that applied service fees – usually around 20 percent – to the cost of already expensive menu items. Our assessment of food and beverage charges revealed that some DOJ components did not minimize conference costs as required by federal and DOJ guidelines. For example, one conference served $16 muffins, while another served Beef Wellington hors d’oeuvres that cost $7.32 per serving,"" the report said.

""In our opinion, the lack of documentation we found regarding the necessity of costly food and beverage items indicated that not all sponsors were seriously questioning the need for expensive meals and refreshments at their events,"" it added.

Media reports summarized the inspector general’s overall negative findings, but couldn’t resist starting with the $16 muffin. In fairness, it was a verbatim quote from the report.

However, reading deeper into the report revealed that the $16 muffins were not completely a la carte. The department received some complimentary beverages and some fruit, though whether additional items were served at breakfast or at a later break is not quite clear.

Justice Department officials also told the inspector general that they were provided the meeting space without charge, though the report notes it’s departmental policy to use federal government meeting spaces whenever possible. And, the inspector general found that conference planners didn’t do any kind of cost breakdowns to show that the government got a better deal overall when it purchased food and received free meeting space.

The conference was held at the Capital Hilton Hotel in Washington in August 2007, and after the $16 muffin made headlines, the hotel’s headquarters issued a statement saying that invoices sometimes don’t fully reflect the services provided.

""Hilton has a long standing practice of working with government agencies to plan meetings and events that fall within their budgets,"" said the statement from Hilton Worldwide Corporate Headquarters. ""Dining receipts are often abbreviated and do not reflect the full pre-contracted menu and service provided, as is the case with recent media reports of breakfast items approved for some government meetings. In Washington, the contracted breakfast included fresh fruit, coffee, juice, and muffins, plus tax and gratuity, for an inclusive price of $16 per person.""

The Washington Post reported that if a person off the street went into the Capital Hilton Hotel and ordered pastries, coffee and a fruit plate, it would cost $29.15. That includes tax but no tip.

The inspector general’s office responded to Hilton’s statement with its own statement:

""The $16 muffin was based on documentation obtained during the audit showing that the Department was invoiced by the Capital Hilton Hotel $4,200 including gratuity and service charge for 250 muffins. Although we made repeated attempts over several months to reach the Capital Hilton during the course of the audit to discuss its billing, it was not responsive to our numerous requests. Since our report was issued, the Capital Hilton has stated that other food and beverage items, such as coffee, tea, and fruit, were included in the charged amount, but did not provide any supporting documentation. Even if the $4,200 fee included additional food and beverage items, the OIG believes, as stated in our report, that many individual food and beverage items listed on conference invoices and paid by the Department were very costly.""

Our ruling

O’Reilly got the $16 muffin story from a lengthy and thorough report issued by an independent inspector general. Additionally, the ""$16 muffin"" is how the inspector general phrased its charge of excessive spending.

We reviewed the long report, and it seems to be thorough and independent, as are most reports from inspectors general. The report’s main findings are that the government is paying for items that appear too costly when invoices are reviewed. Even if the $16 muffin is fiction, then it seems reasonable to believe that the Justice Department’s own spending records are incomplete or inaccurate.

On the other hand, a full reading of the report showed the $16 muffins included beverages and possibly fruit, as well as meeting space. While a $16 breakfast is no bargain, it’s not as bad as $16 for a solitary baked good.

Also, O’Reilly made his remarks to Jon Stewart on Sept. 28, after Hilton issued its first statement on Sept. 23 saying the invoices may not have been complete. So the report was under question when O’Reilly debated Stewart. (We contacted O’Reilly for comment, but we didn’t hear back.)

Because the federal government didn't pay $16 for a muffin even if it paid too much for breakfast, we rate O’Reilly’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F80C40>],/factchecks/2011/oct/04/bill-oreilly/16-muffin-included-coffee-tea-event-space/

Chris Christie confirms he won't seek presidency in 2012
","
""What short of suicide do I have to do to convince people I'm not running? Apparently, I actually have to commit suicide.""  
-- Gov. Chris Christie, Feb. 16, 2011 
  
""Now is not my time. I have a commitment to New Jersey that I simply will not abandon."" 
-- Gov. Chris Christie, Oct. 4, 2011 
  
There’s an old joke about politicians (also lawyers and women) that goes something like this:

How do you know when a politician is lying?

His lips are moving.

Well, that leaves out Gov. Chris Christie, who announced on Oct. 4 that he will not seek the presidency in 2012 – reaffirming the same statement he has made numerous times this year, despite a chorus of support that has grown all year for him to join the race.

""What short of suicide do I have to do to convince people I’m not running? Apparently, I actually have to commit suicide,"" the governor said in February.

Christie is alive and well – and it’s likely the national spotlight will continue shining on him as he continues running the Garden State – and possibly becoming a presidential contender for 2016.

Christie’s political status gained momentum after he became the state’s U.S. attorney.

""I won't consider running for office again,"" Christie said in 2002, just before taking that office in 2003. ""The door is shut.""

Actually, it was more like ajar.

Despite his statement, Christie began doing things that made political watchers go ""Hmmm.""

In the same 2003 story where Christie said he was done running for higher office, The Star-Ledger reported the following:

""He lost 60 pounds. He was spotted dining with political power brokers. And he's traveled the state making speeches to civic groups.""

And much like this year with the national buzz about him running for president, early chatter in 2003 started and grew into a cacophony that Christie could be gubernatorial material for 2005.

Of the chatter about him running for governor, Christie said at the time that hardly a day goes by when someone doesn't ask him about it - attention he said he finds flattering.

Any of this sound familiar?

Even after his suicide reference in February, Christie was spotted schmoozing with GOP financiers and criss-crossing the country to stump for others in the party. He also used those publicized and unpublicized trips – as well as various town hall meetings across New Jersey -- to remind people that he would not seek the presidency.

Still, he offered speeches that sounded a lot like campaign stumps, and started to give coy answers when asked about whether he would run.

During a press conference Oct. 4 at the Statehouse in Trenton, Christie admitted that he had been thinking about seeking the presidency when he spoke last week at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. Next, word came that former first lady Nancy Reagan, President George Bush and Henry Kissinger were urging Christie to run. 
Speculation was at its peak. And there's a reason why, according to Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research in Washington, DC. 
""Americans love to have choices and they love a contest (as do the media),"" Bowman said in an email. ""I think that is the source of the wild speculation. And, Chris Christie had some strong backers with terrific media connections who were pressing him to run and talking up his candidacy. His straight-talking persona appealed to many.""     
Christie finally gave his answer Oct. 4, saying he would stick by his words and commitment to run the Garden State.

""Now is not my time,"" Christie said during the press conference. ""I have a commitment to New Jersey that I simply will not abandon.""

Making promises isn’t a difficult endeavor for Christie, who’s been in politics since age 14.

That’s when Christie volunteered for former Gov. Tom Kean's gubernatorial campaign. And despite a bevy of political victories, Christie also had some political losses: He failed to get on the ballot for the state Senate one year, lost a divisive primary for the Assembly and lost re-election to the Morris County Board of Freeholders after a three-year term.

As a political fund-raiser, Christie pulled in hundreds of thousands of dollars while serving on the finance committee for George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. 
That experience could be handy if Christie decides to run for president in 2016.

So after months of stating loudly that he’s not running for president in 2012, Christie’s lips moved again Oct. 4 – and the words spoken numerous times before about not seeking the presidency were true.

For that reason, we give Christie a No Flip on the Flip-O-Meter.

Haley Barbour says Barack Obama benefited from biggest Congressional Democratic majorities since Lyndon Johnson
","
During the Oct. 2, 2011, edition of CBS’s Face the Nation, two governors -- Democrat Martin O’Malley of Maryland and Republican Haley Barbour of Mississippi -- faced off over a variety of political and policy issues. 
At one point, Barbour parried O’Malley’s criticism of Republican economic policies by noting the size of President Barack Obama’s congressional majorities after he took office in early 2009. His argument was that Obama had significant legislative advantages that should have enabled him to do what he wanted policy-wise -- meaning that Obama can’t legitimately blame the Republicans for blocking what he wanted to do. 
O’Malley, Barbour said, has ""amnesia about the fact that Obama had the biggest Democratic majorities in Congress since Lyndon Johnson. They passed everything he wanted, including ramming health care, Obamacare, down the country's throat and now they complain, well, jeez, we didn't get everything we wanted, those mean Republicans. Bill Clinton never did that. Ronald Reagan never did that. When they had Congress in the other party, they led. And this president, he is going to learn how to lead, or he's going to go back to Chicago."" 
We thought we’d check whether Barbour was right that Obama had larger Democratic majorities than at any point since the Johnson presidency, which took place from November 1963 to January 1969. 
The short answer: He’s wrong. 
On opening day in 2009, the Democrats had a 257-178 edge over the Republicans in the House, and a 57-41 edge in the Senate, with two Independents caucusing with the Democrats. (Eventually, the Democrats got to 58 votes in the Senate, plus the two Independents, when Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter switched parties.) 
Congressional margins typically change over the course of two years as lawmakers retire, die or win seats in special elections. So for simplicity, we’ll stick to the opening day numbers. 
Here are the Congresses in which the Democrats had more House members than they had in 2009. The year listed is the year of the start of that Congress. 
1993: 258 Democrats
1991: 267 Democrats
1989: 260 Democrats
1987: 258 Democrats
1983: 269 Democrats
1979: 277 Democrats
1977: 292 Democrats
1975: 291 Democrats 
Now, here are the Congresses in which the number of Senate Democrats equaled or exceeded the 57 from 2009: 
1993: 57 Democrats
1979: 58 Democrats
1977: 61 Democrats
1975: 61 Democrats
1969: 57 Democrats 
So, both the House and Senate simultaneously equaled or exceeded 2009 levels for significant stretches of four Congresses -- the ones beginning in 1975, 1977, 1979 and 1993. That’s about one-fifth of the Congresses since the Johnson presidency. And for three of those Congresses, there was also a Democratic president in office -- first Jimmy Carter, then Bill Clinton. 
Of course, internal splits within the Democratic caucuses made the party weaker than the numbers alone would suggest. But that was also true in 2009, the year to which Barbour was referring. 
Our ruling 
It’s true that Democratic strength in Congress at the beginning of Obama’s term was the strongest it had been in 16 years. But that’s not what Barbour said -- he said the numbers were the strongest going back to President Johnson in the late 1960s. And that was not the case. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFFC240>],/factchecks/2011/oct/04/haley-barbour/haley-barbour-says-barack-obama-benefited-biggest-/

Marcy Kaptur says the U.S. imported 500,000 cars from South Korea but only sent 6,000 there
","
At least one facet of the job creation plan that President Obama outlined in a September 8 address to a joint session of Congress did not sit well with Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, Ohio’s longest serving member of Congress.

During the speech, Obama called for Congress to approve pending trade agreements with Panama, Colombia, and South Korea, contending their passage would make it easier for American companies to sell their products abroad.

""If Americans can buy Kias and Hyundais, I want to see folks in South Korea driving Fords and Chevys and Chryslers,"" said Obama. ""I  want to see more products sold around the world stamped with the three proud words:  ‘Made in America.’  That’s what we need to get done.""

A few days later, Kaptur took to the House floor to deliver her own take on those trade agreements. She argued they’d actually whittle away U.S. manufacturing and escalate a jobs drain to other countries. She focused part of her ire on the automotive provisions in the pending US-Korea Free Trade Agreement, complaining the United States would still end up importing far more cars from Korea than it sends there, even with its adoption.

""Last year, Korea sold nearly half a million cars in our country,"" Kaptur said. ""The United States, you know how much we sell to them? Six thousand. What kind of deal is that? And we’ll be lucky if, under this agreement, where there’s a hope that we might sell perhaps, 75,000 cars to Korea, so they get a half a million, we get a handful? How’s that a credible plan to create jobs in our country?""

We were intrigued by Kaptur’s assertions so we decided to check out her statistics.

According to a March 2011 report compiled by the United States International Trade Commission, 561,626 Korean passenger vehicles were imported into the United States during 2010, representing 4.9 percent of the U.S. auto market. Korean auto makers sold Americans another 381,505 vehicles they made in the United States, another 3.3 percent market slice. Hyundai and Kia have car plants in Montgomery, Ala., and West Point, Ga.

General Motors, Ford and Chrysler exported 7,450 vehicles to Korea that year, representing a mere 0.62 percent of that country’s passenger vehicle market, which is the world’s 12th largest, the ITC report says. If vehicles made in the United States by foreign-based producers were included in that export figure to Korea, the statistic would rise to 13,044 vehicles, representing 1.09 percent of Korea’s market.

Those statistics exclude the 125,730 vehicles that GM’s Daewoo Auto & Technology Division produced and sold in Korea. In January 2011, GM eliminated the Daewoo brand name and began calling those cars Chevrolets. Those vehicles wouldn’t be affected by the pending trade deal because they’re not exported, according to an August 2011 Congressional Research Service report on the deal.

The trade agreement’s current draft contains provisions aimed at boosting U.S. exports to Korea, including reductions in tariffs on U.S. made vehicles and an easing of fuel economy standards.

But the Congressional Research Service report casts doubt, given differences in the the U.S. and South Korean motor vehicle markets, ""whether the Detroit Three (GM, Ford and Chrysler) ... would ever gain more than a fractional position in the South Korean market.""

Kaptur was correct that there is a wide disparity between the number of South Korean vehicles imported to the United States vs. the number exported to Korea. Her claim of
""nearly half a million"" imports is slightly understated.

Her office said that’s because she cited 2009 numbers from a Congressional Research Service report, instead of the 2010 statistics we found. 
Her number for domestic vehicles is understated, too. She said 6,000, as compared to a tally of 7,450 for General Motors, Ford and Chrysler that the ITC provided. 
But that also only considers vehicles made by the Big 3 U.S. automakers. Nearly 5,600 more vehicles made by foreign-based automakers at plants in the United States also went to South Korea. That’s a point of additional information.

On the Truth-O-Meter, her claim rates Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FB8880>],/factchecks/2011/oct/04/marcy-kaptur/marcy-kaptur-says-us-imported-500000-cars-south-ko/

Is Perry right on Texas job growth?
","
Republican presidential frontrunner Rick Perry visited the Atlanta area Friday to talk to a group about what his state has done to help businesses flourish.

The Texas governor proudly did so amid some verbal shots at President Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney.

Perry made a Texas-size claim about job growth in his state during his 12-minute speech at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre.

""My home state since June of 2009 created 40 percent of the new jobs in America,"" Perry told the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, an organization that researches and advocates for fiscally conservative ideas to promote the Peach State’s economic growth. June 2009 is when economists believe the ""Great Recession"" ended.

Was Perry right? We wanted to find out.

Perry has based his candidacy -- in part -- on all the people working in Texas, saying policies like the state’s lack of an income tax and his efforts to get out of the way of businesses are part of the reason for the job growth.

In June 2009, there were nearly 10.3 million Texans on payrolls, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In August 2011, the most recent federal data available, slightly more than 10.6 million people were working in Texas. The increase was about 323,000 jobs.

Nationally, the number of additional Americans working increased by nearly 837,000 during that same time span. If you do the math, Texas accounts for 38.6 percent of that increase. Perry’s camp calculates the increase at 39.2 percent. It came up with the same amount of new workers in Texas but said the job increase was 824,000.

Either way you slice it, the percentage of additional workers in Texas in comparison to the rest of the nation is impressive. So what’s going on in Texas?

Some economic experts say Texas has some natural advantages, such as its oil, its ports and its proximity to Mexico. Thomas Saving, the director of Texas A&M University’s Private Enterprise Research Center, noted several other factors -- such as it being a right-to-work state and having low debt -- that draw businesses to the state.

Saving, who teaches at Perry’s alma mater, said much of the job growth is in education and health care. The state’s population is growing, which means it needs more teachers. Texas, he said, has more people on the Medicaid rolls because of that population growth, which requires more health care professionals.

Saving noted that the governor’s office in Texas does not have as much power as other states, so Perry should not get all the credit for the job growth. He also noted the simple factor of the additional people moving into the Lone Star State is another explanation for the job growth. That state’s population grew by nearly 4.3 million people between 2000 and 2010, more than any other state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. California was second, with a population increase of about 3.4 million. Texas is now third in U.S. population, behind California and New York.

Economist Doug Hall also pointed out the state’s population growth and its unemployment rate, which has risen from 7.7 percent in June 2009 to its current rate of 8.5 percent.

""That’s a pretty significant number that [Perry] doesn’t mention,"" said Hall, director of the Economic Analysis & Research Network for the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute.

Our friends at PolitiFact Texas tackled a similar topic when Perry boasted about the state’s job creation during a GOP presidential debate. It noted that moderator Brian Williams pointed out that Texas has the highest-in-the-nation share of minimum-wage workers.

Perry’s numbers are on target, but there is some context to consider here. Some of the growth may be attributable to Texas’ regulations, but there are other factors, such as the state’s major population growth and the large number of minimum-wage workers. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979D2600>],/factchecks/2011/oct/04/rick-perry/perry-right-texas-job-growth/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz says David Dewhurst ducked nine U.S. Senate forums after declaring his candidacy
","
In an online video ad, U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz likens Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst to the mythical chupacabra, saying his opponent -- the Republican frontrunner for the seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison after 2012 -- isn’t engaging with his opponents. Specifically, the narrator says: ""Since he entered the race on July 21, Dewhurst has skipped nine candidate forums.""

Nine skips in nine forums?

Cruz’s campaign passed us a list of nine Senate candidate forums that took place from July 21 through Sept. 15, 2011, with contact information for each event’s organizer. And in telephone interviews, forum organizers confirmed to us that Dewhurst did not appear at the gatherings.

The Cruz campaign did not list an Aug. 28 event near Sugar Land, organized on behalf of U.S. Rep. Pete Olson, R-Houston; both the Dewhurst and Olson campaigns confirmed that the lieutenant governor and other GOP Senate candidates attended and were given five minutes each to speak.

Thus, out of 10 forums between July 21 and Sept. 15, Dewhurst did not appear at nine.

But is not showing up the same as skipping? We wondered.

The organizers of seven forums told us Dewhurst’s campaign told them beforehand that Dewhurst would not participate.

Exceptions: Marc Moffitt of the Denton County Republican Party said Dewhurst’s camp said he couldn’t come until after he declared his candidacy and then he announced his candidacy the same July night as the party’s forum, meaning he wasn’t even a candidate until then. And Toby Walker of the Waco Tea Party said she never heard from Dewhurst’s camp about her invitations to its Aug. 13, 2011, event. Walker said: ""It’s almost worse never to get a response. It’s like you’re not worthy.""

Among other forum organizers, Dean Wright, who steered the July 30, 2011, Austin Tea Party forum, said the group set out a chair for Dewhurst in case he changed his mind. Robert ""Gonzo"" Gonzalez, overseeing an August forum for the Clear Lake Tea Party, said Dewhurst’s camp told him it was ""early in the campaign (to attend); I accepted that."" Capy Alexander of the Republican Women of Kerr County said Dewhurst’s camp sounded interested in its Aug. 19, 2011, event, but ""as it turns out, he was unable to come. I don’t know why.""

Most of the nine organizers told us they did not view Dewhurst’s non-attendance as ""skipping."" Maria Acosta of the Central Texas 9-12 Project said she would better describe its Aug. 20, 2011, gathering as a ""lost opportunity.""

However, Katrina Pierson of the Garland Tea Party said that even though Dewhurst’s campaign said before its Sept. 15, 2011, event that Dewhurst had a prior commitment, she still views him as skipping out because the group initially told him about its plans in May.

The Dewhurst campaign responded by stating that Dewhurst was acting governor on six of the nine event dates listed by Cruz and had a previously scheduled Republican event on another.

Dewhurst himself, after he held an Austin town hall event Oct. 3, told us, ""There is a whole other dynamic that folks are forgetting. Every week now for six weeks in a row, and maybe for another 13, 14 or 15 months, I’m the acting governor. ... I’m having a hard enough time just to go out and do some of our campaign events when we have both paperwork, responsibilities -- when we had the Bastrop (wild)fire, I was over there almost the whole week, totally consumed by it. So state business for me comes first.""

Of the candidate forums, Dewhurst said: ""Quite frankly, I’m interested in getting our message out to the people, not necessarily spending a disproportional amount of time (with) the candidates talking to each other. … What I think is in the voters’ best interest is to hear from the candidates, and so that’s what we’re doing. We’re going to almost a different city every day.""

Looking forward, he said, that ""as we can, we’re going to go to a forum or so every month."" This month, he said, he plans to appear at an Oct. 21 candidate forum hosted by the Spirit of Freedom Republican Women PAC in Sugar Land.

Our take: Dewhurst did not appear at nine forums, eight of them after the night he announced his candidacy. But it’s a mite questionable to say he outright skipped the events. In most cases, his campaign said beforehand Dewhurst wasn’t going to appear.

Under Chris Christie, does New Jersey have ""one of the higher unemployment rates in the country""?
","
On the Oct. 2, 2011, edition of CBS’s Face the Nation, two governors -- Democrat Martin O’Malley of Maryland and Republican Haley Barbour of Mississippi -- faced off over a variety of political and policy issues.

Host Bob Schieffer brought up one of the hottest political stories of the day -- the potential presidential candidacy of another governor, Republican Chris Christie of New Jersey. After months of denying the possibility of a run, Christie had recently indicated that he’s reconsidering his stance on a GOP primary bid.

O’Malley tried to throw cold water on Christie’s record since he took office in January 2010.

""When it comes to being effective at creating jobs, improving schools and expanding opportunity, (Christie’s) record in New Jersey has not been a record of governing for effectiveness,"" O’Malley said. ""His bond rating has been downgraded by two of the bond rating agencies. His unemployment in New Jersey is one of the higher unemployment rates in the country at 9.4 percent. Last year, New Jersey created no net new jobs. And his schools, because of the choices he's made to cut education funding, have actually been declining in their national ranking. So that's not a record of leadership and governance and effectiveness.""

We decided to focus on the two jobs-related claims -- that ""New Jersey (has) one of the higher unemployment rates in the country at 9.4 percent,"" and that ""last year, New Jersey created no net new jobs."" We’ll rate them in separate Truth-O-Meter items, taking up the first claim in this item.

We turned to the most recent state-by-state data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment figures. This data covers August 2011.

O’Malley was correct that New Jersey’s unemployment rate in August was 9.4 percent. And he’s correct that New Jersey fared worse than the nation as a whole (9.1 percent) and worse than the regional rate for the middle-Atlantic states (8.4 percent).

But was it ""one of the higher unemployment rates in the country""? That’s a bit tougher call.

New Jersey actually ranked 15th among the 50 states or 16th if you include the District of Columbia. Here’s the list of states that ranked higher than New Jersey in unemployment:

Nevada: 13.4 percent
California: 12.1 percent
Michigan: 11.2 percent
South Carolina: 11.1 percent
District of Columbia: 11.1 percent
Florida: 10.7 percent
Rhode Island 10.6 percent
North Carolina: 10.4 percent
Mississippi: 10.3 percent
Georgia: 10.2 percent
Alabama: 9.9 percent
Illinois: 9.9 percent
Tennessee: 9.7 percent
Oregon: 9.6 percent
Kentucky: 9.5 percent
New Jersey: 9.4 percent

So does New Jersey have ""one of the higher unemployment rates in the country""? It’s higher than about two-thirds of the states, but it’s lower than about one-third.

The figures show that New Jersey is ""in the bottom third of all states in terms of employment,"" said Elisabeth Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, which O’Malley chairs. ""Perhaps it would have been more accurate to say that Gov. Christie's New Jersey has one of the ‘highest’ unemployment rates in the nation.""

We’ll also note an underlying flaw in claims like these. O’Malley tries to pin the blame for New Jersey’s relatively weak  job market on Christie, when in fact the jobs picture in any given state is influenced by a host of factors, from national and international trends to state policies inherited from a governor’s predecessor. It’s an especially dicey to pin blame on Christie, who has only been in office for a little over a year and a half.

Our ruling

O’Malley got the figure right (9.4 percent), and he has a point that New Jersey’s unemployment rate is higher than the national and regional averages. However, we think most people, if they heard O’Malley’s claim, would expect that a state with ""one of the higher unemployment rates in the country"" would rank higher than 15th out of 50 or 16th out of 51. Finally, O'Malley said, ""When it comes to being effective at creating jobs … (Chris Christie has not had) a record of governing for effectiveness."" Christie’s responsibility for his state’s difficult jobs picture is unclear. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BBD340>],/factchecks/2011/oct/03/martin-omalley/under-chris-christie-does-new-jersey-have-one-high/

Did Chris Christie's New Jersey create no net new jobs last year?

We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment figures. 
We concluded that the most obvious interpretation of ""last year"" was 2010, so we looked at the jobs data in New Jersey over the course of 2010. There are actually two ways to measure this -- measuring net job creation in the state from January 2010 to December 2010, or from January 2010 to January 2011.

Using the first time frame, total jobs in the state fell from 3,852,600 to 3,844,700 -- a drop of 7,900, or about two-tenths of 1 percent. Using the second time frame, the total number of non-farm, seasonally adjusted jobs fell from 3,852,600 to 3,828,900 -- a decline of 23,700 jobs, or six-tenths of 1 percent.

So the declines over that period were modest on a percentage basis, but they were indeed declines, not increases. So on this score, O’Malley is right.

However, this approach amounts to cherry-picking. Why stop the clock at the end of Christie’s first year when an additional eight months of data are available?

In fact, if you continue counting through August 2011, the job picture during Christie’s tenure looks more robust. From January 2010 to August 2011, the number of jobs rose from 3,852,600 to 3,866,600 -- an increase of 14,000 jobs, or four-tenths of 1 percent.

In the meantime, to get a sense of context, we looked at the national job statistics over the same period.

For both measurements of job growth in 2010 alone, the number of jobs nationally grew by eight-tenths of 1 percent. For the period January 2010 to August 2011, the number of jobs grew by 1.4 percent.

We’ll also note an underlying flaw in claims like these. O’Malley tries to pin the blame for New Jersey’s relatively weak job market on Christie, when in fact the jobs picture in any given state is influenced by a host of factors, from national and international trends to state policies inherited from a governor’s predecessor. It’s especially dicey to pin blame on Christie, who has only been in office for a little over a year and a half.

Elisabeth Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, which O’Malley chairs, noted that he actually understated the job pattern for 2010. New Jersey didn’t just create zero net jobs, as O’Malley indicated, but actually lost jobs over that period. Looking at the data, she said, ""Gov. Christie has been ineffective at creating jobs in New Jersey.""

Our ruling

In discussing job creation, O'Malley said, ""When it comes to being effective at creating jobs … (Chris Christie has not had) a record of governing for effectiveness"" and went on to say that last year New Jersey created ""no net new jobs."" Using the year 2010 as the yardstick, O’Malley is correct that ""last year, New Jersey created no net new jobs."" And it’s true that for every period we studied since Christie took office, New Jersey underperformed job-creation numbers for the nation as a whole.

However, we think it’s cherry-picking for O’Malley to use the data for 2010 only when the data for 2010 and 2011 are available -- and when the expanded data contradicts the point that was accurate for just 2010. 
At least as important, Christie’s responsibility for his state’s difficult jobs picture is unclear. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B99340>],/factchecks/2011/oct/03/martin-omalley/did-chris-christies-new-jersey-create-no-net-new-j/

Earl Blumenauer says delaying air pollution rules will kill 34,000 people a year
","
Even in these cynical, partisan days, there are some universal truths. For example: Sulfur dioxide is a pollutant that can severely affect a person’s health and, in extreme cases, be fatal. Nitrogen oxide is another common and nasty pollutant that makes people sick.

Scientists and non-scientists as well as Republicans and Democrats generally agree the stuff is bad for you.

But how you deal with it is where agreement ends -- at least in Congress.

On the House floor Sept. 23, Republicans muscled through legislation that would delay or scrap rules to reduce mercury and other harmful air emissions, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Though the bill passed, it’s highly unlikely to pass the Senate and would be vetoed by President Barack Obama if it did.

Nevertheless, the House debate was lively.

Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., was one of the loudest critics, insisting that delaying the tougher air pollution rules would have dire results.

""Every year these protections are delayed, another 34,000 people will die prematurely,"" he said.

Really? That’s a lot of dead bodies and it’s very specific. Perfect for PolitiFact.

First, some background.

As passed on a nearly party-line vote of 249-169, the bill would, among other things, require the president to set up a committee of Cabinet-level officials to evaluate the toll that a dozen-plus Environmental Protection Agency regulations would have on jobs, electricity, gasoline prices and competitiveness.

Republicans said action was needed to slow down a runaway bureaucracy.

""While there are reasonable regulations that protect our children and help keep our environment clean, we need to stop unelected bureaucrats from imposing excessive regulations that unnecessarily increase costs for consumers and make it harder for our economy to create jobs,"" House Speaker John Boehner said.

Blumenauer and other Democrats said the bill was a craven gift to business that would result in dirtier air and more death.

Blumenauer’s dire prediction was directed at the bill’s delay of something called the Cross‐State Air Pollution Rule which would limit the amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide belching from power plants in 27 states.

The pollutants react in the atmosphere to create ground-level ozone and set free tiny particulates that can damage lung capacity and cause respiratory problems.

In real numbers, the EPA says the rules would reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide from the plants by 6.4 million tons a year (from 8.8 million tons in 2005) and to 1.4 million tons a year of nitrogen oxide (from 2.6 million tons annually in 2005).

Those are big numbers and Blumenauer argued Sept. 22 during floor debate that lawmakers voting for the bill would be directly responsible for making people sick.

""The losers are hundreds of thousands of people (who) will die, get illness from cancer, asthma, lost school days, millions of lost work days, the lost quality of life that is documented beyond belief,"" he said. ""This is real, and these people lose.""

Blumenauer’s aides said he was relying on studies conducted by the EPA to support his claim.

The most authoritative of those studies is a 414-page analysis released in June. The dense title suggests it’s a product of science rather than sound-byte politicians: ""Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Federal Implementation Plans to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone in 27 States; Correction of SIP Approvals for 22 States.""

The report relied on the work of EPA scientists and a survey of independent, peer-reviewed studies by outside scientists.

And there, listed among the ""key findings"" is this: ""The benefits result primarily from 13,000 to 34,000 fewer (particulate matter) and ozone-related premature mortalities.""

The report repeats the number eight more times.

We find that Blumenauer was on solid ground. But he also  cherry-picked the highest death number rather than using the range of 13,000 to 34,000 additional deaths.

While that omission does not change the conclusion that air pollution is bad for public health, it could exaggerate the problem. For that reason, we rate this claim: Mostly True.

"['Abortion', 'Wisconsin', ""EMILY's List""]","
EMILY's List says GOP U.S. Senate hopeful Tommy Thompson pushed law that exposed partial-birth abortion providers to life in prison
","
EMILY’s List, one of the 100 largest overall donors to federal elections over the past two decades, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, has set its sights on the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in Wisconsin.

The group -- whose acronym stands for ""Early Money Is Like Yeast"" -- has raised $8.39 million in the 2011-2012 election cycle alone to elect pro-choice Democratic women to office.

Founded in 1985, the group takes credit for helping elect 16 women to the U.S. Senate and 86 women, including Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin, to the U.S. House of Representatives.

EMILY’s List is backing Baldwin’s run for the Senate seat that is being vacated in 2012 by Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl. And it is criticizing the Republican Senate hopefuls, including state Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, former U.S. Rep. Mark Neumann and former Gov. Tommy Thompson.

In a Sept. 19, 2011 blog post, EMILY’s List derided all three GOP contenders as ""far-right, conservative white males."" It focused criticism on Thompson, who was Wisconsin’s governor from 1987 to 2001 before becoming U.S. health and human services secretary under President George W. Bush.

The group declared that as governor, Thompson ""pushed such strict laws that abortion providers faced potential life imprisonment and women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues.""

Strong words and a strong statement.

The statement contains two parts. We’ll address them one at a time.

Abortion providers facing prison

In its blog post, EMILY’s List cited a 1998 Wisconsin law signed by Thompson that banned most partial-birth abortions. The law defined the procedure, performed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, as one ""in which a person partially vaginally delivers a living child, causes the death of the partially delivered child with the intent to kill the child and then completes the delivery of the child.""

Under the law, a partial-birth abortion could be performed to save the life of a woman. But anyone who illegally performed a partial-birth abortion could be convicted of a Class A felony, punishable by life in prison.

That procedure, long controversial, is rarely used -- a point even pro-choice advocates made when fighting the ban.

At the time, Thompson was quoted as saying: ""This issue has captured our hearts, for the people of Wisconsin will not stand for a procedure so heartless to occur in our state. This is a matter of humanity. Banning partial birth abortions is simply the right thing to do.''

A federal appeals court struck down the Wisconsin law as unconstitutional in 2001. That court cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a similar Nebraska law, which the high court said put an ""undue burden upon a woman's right to make an abortion decision.""

That left Wisconsin among 14 states whose partial-birth ban laws have been blocked by courts and are not in effect, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, an independent research organization that analyzes data on population growth and reproductive health. 
The institute doesn’t have statistics on partial-birth abortions, per se, but its latest national figures show that 1.5 percent of abortions in 2006 were done during the late second trimester or the third trimester of pregnancy. In any case, partial-birth abortions make up only a portion of the 1.5 percent of all abortions that are performed later in a pregnancy.

So, although partial-birth abortions were rarely done, Thompson did --as EMILY’s List claimed -- support a law that subjected partial-birth abortion providers to possible life imprisonment.

Women forced to leave state

The second claim made by EMILY’s List was ""women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues.""

The group cited news articles about abortion providers around Wisconsin canceling abortion appointments after a federal judge refused to issue a temporary restraining order to prevent the 1998 partial-birth ban law from going into effect.

The articles quoted providers as saying that women who had scheduled abortions were forced to reschedule them or to get the procedure done out of state. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported at the time that abortion providers throughout Wisconsin put all abortion procedures on hold for a few days as they waited for legal questions about the law to be sorted out.

EMILY’s List did not provide us evidence to show that any women left Wisconsin ""to receive attention for life-threatening issues.""

The group’s spokeswoman, Jess McIntosh, said in an email: ""The abortion providers who stopped working told dozens of prospective patients who needed to be seen immediately that they had to travel. Assuming not a single one did that and went on to have the procedure just isn't plausible.""

It’s also not likely, however, that all or even most females who were seeking an abortion at the time faced a life-threatening situation.

Asked about the EMILY’s statement, Thompson campaign spokesman Darrin Schmitz said: ""Gov. Thompson is proud of his pro-life record and defense of the unborn.""

Our conclusion

In support of Baldwin’s Senate bid, EMILY’s List said Thompson had ""pushed such strict laws that abortion providers faced potential life imprisonment and women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues.""

A partial-birth abortion ban that Thompson signed into law as Wisconsin’s governor did contain the life imprisonment provision.

The law also caused many abortion providers, at least for a few days, to stop performing abortions. That means it was possible some Wisconsin women had to leave the state in order to get an abortion. But there is no proof, as EMILY’s List claimed, that women were forced to leave the state ""to receive attention for life-threatening issues.""

Gov. John Kasich touts contacts with companies to create, retain jobs
","
  
Ohio Gov. John Kasich has taken to the airwaves to tout his record on jobs.

The first-year Republican governor is featured in a television commercial that began airing in September in which he talks about his early success with job creation in Ohio and declaring it as proof he is a man of his word. Kasich promised during last year’s gubernatorial race that his pro-business agenda would to bring jobs to Ohio.

Kasich defeated incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland last November. But you wouldn’t be able to tell it from this ad. It looks and feels every bit like campaign commercial. It was even shot from the same Y-shape rural road intersection where Kasch filmed one of his ads for the campaign.

""We’re . . . keeping and creating jobs in our state,"" Kasich says in the new commercial, paid for by the Republican Governors Association. ""From American Greetings, to Wendy’s, to Diebold, we’ve gone to the their doorsteps to keep jobs right here in Ohio.""

PolitiFact Ohio recently checked another claim by the governor about jobs, giving him a rating of Mostly False for suggesting that his administration is solely responsible for the net 45,000 new jobs in the state this year.

The statistic about the jobs was correct for January through July, but economists we talked to said it was too soon to know if the governor’s policies would boost employment. Job growth in Ohio, they said, had been well underway for more than a year.

But this claim is different, so PolitiFact Ohio took another look.

Kasich has had some high-profile headlines after striking deals laden with tax incentives to keep American Greetings and Diebold in Northeast Ohio after both companies threatened to move their headquarters out of state.

Kasich’s critics do not believe either company was really going to leave and just used the threats to exploit the governor for additional taxpayer-paid sweetheart deals. American Greetings, for example, in addition to naming the Chicago area as a possible new location for its headquarters also said it was considering moving within Northeast Ohio even before the governor got involved.

But the part of his claim where he says that he is keeping jobs here seems to be easily proven by those two deals alone. But whether his policies are creating jobs for Ohio is a bit more dicey to test.

Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols provided a list of ""development deals for which we did the heavy lifting.""

The list claims the current administration has created 557 jobs and retained 10-times that many — 5,529. The American Greetings deal retained 1,750. A deal keeping Central Ohio staple Bob Evans here, rather than moving to Texas, lured 150 additional jobs here, according to Nichols.

The list includes nine companies in all.

The numbers backup the statement. Determining how much credit goes to the administration is not always so clear, but the governor can certainly lay claim to having kept some jobs here and attracting some new ones.

Kasich did not offer a tally for his job creation and retention record, or take credit for all job growth in the state. Rather, he offered up a general statement about efforts in his administration that have yielded some results.

Herman Cain: Recovery 14 million jobs behind typical upswing
","
GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain wants voters to put the blame for the nation’s stubborn unemployment squarely on the shoulders of the Commander-in-Chief.

Cain called President Barack Obama’s stimulus package ""failed"" in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed. He said he ""pays no mind"" to the economy. He also presents evidence in the form of economic data:

""If our recovery were more typical of the postwar era . . . we would have 14 million more jobs today,"" Cain wrote Sept. 15.  

Fourteen million more jobs?

Since economic estimates are often complicated to evaluate, we talked with Cain economic advisor Richard Lowrie. We also took a look at a Wall Street Journal op-ed written by former Texas U.S. Senator Phil Gramm that Cain referenced in his own column

Gramm wrote a piece that appeared April 15 called ""The Obama Growth Discount."" It argued that under Obama’s economic policies, job growth is uniquely dismal, even among the postwar era’s deepest recessions.  

""Forty months after the start of the 1953, 1957, 1973 and 1981 recessions, total employment was on average 4.7% higher than the pre-recession peaks, while total employment today is still down 4.7%—that's a total employment gap of 13.9 million jobs.""

Lowrie told PolitiFact Georgia that he used Gramm’s method to do his own calculations, so we did as well.

We compared total employment figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics at their pre-recession peak, calculated their percentage difference from employment 40 months later, and averaged the results for what Gramm considered the four worst postwar recessions.

Lowrie found employment typically grew at about 4.8 percent, for total jobs gap of 13.6 million.  Cain rounded up to 14 million.

PolitiFact Georgia came up with figures ranging from some 12.4 million to 13.6 million, depending on how we chose our data. Some downturns, such as those in 1957 and 1981, start less than 40 months after the last recession, so there’s room for debate on how to account for downturns that don’t fit the mold.  

So Cain cherry picked higher numbers, plus he rounded up a good bit, but his math makes sense.  But we wanted to dig a little deeper. His calculation depends heavily on what one considers the nation’s worst postwar recessions. So we asked around.

Economists told us that there are a lot of ways to measure the depth of a recession. You can look at its length, how much it shrinks the size of the economy, and how it affects jobs, to name a few metrics. This means that while economists widely consider certain recessions, such as the most recent one, as among the worst in the postwar era, there might be room for debate if you tried to rank some of the others.  

Still, while you might disagree with some of Gramm’s choices of ‘worst’ recessions, they are reasonable. According to our calculations, the four recessions he cited boasted the postwar’s largest reduction in gross domestic product, a measure that describes the size of the nation’s economy.

We also found it’s possible to argue that Gramm’s way of comparing recessions is invalid.  Emory economics professor Tom Smith said each recession is so unique that Gramm’s calculation is only useful as political rhetoric against Obama. It conveys little, if any, useful information about the recession or Obama’s record, Smith said.

""It’s a trickster move,"" Smith said. ""It’s a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat,"" Smith said.

So Cain’s statement does have weaknesses. The number he used in the Wall Street Journal is on the high side of the calculations. It’s also rounded upwards by about 400,000 jobs. And it’s fair to dispute whether this is a good way to measure Obama’s economic record.

Also, Cain could have been more clear. He should have emphasized that he meant that there would be 14 million more jobs if this recession were more typical of the most severe postwar recessions, rather than postwar recessions in general.

That said, Cain’s calculation that we would have 14 million jobs was within reason, if a bit high. We therefore rate Cain’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971BB200>],/factchecks/2011/oct/03/herman-cain/herman-cain-recovery-14-million-jobs-behind-typica/
"['New Jersey', 'Ethics', 'John Wisniewski']","
John Wisniewski claims Chris Christie’s ethics reform package represents a “new agenda”
","
Gov. Chris Christie has been promoting his ethics reform package for more than a year, but that message apparently never reached the ears of Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) until this past month.

Wisniewski, chairman of the state Democratic Party, claimed in a Sept. 26 interview on NJToday that Christie was silent on the subject of ethics reform until coming up with a new agenda in September.

""The governor has this urgent ethics reform package. So when we met as a body in the Legislature in June, the governor was silent, and in July, the governor said nothing. And in August, the governor was traveling to meet with the Koch brothers (Charles and David Koch),"" Wisniewski told anchor Mike Schneider.

""And finally, in September, he’s now come up with a new agenda and he’s talking about an issue – he’s accusing legislators, accusing me, of not disclosing where we earn our income. Every year, we file a financial disclosure report.""

Does the governor’s ethics reform package represent ""a new agenda""? It didn’t take long for PolitiFact New Jersey to determine Wisniewski was off with that claim.

The package took a backseat over the summer -- when officials were debating pension and health benefits reform, and the state budget -- but Christie first unveiled his ethics reform proposals a year ago.

""This really has been on the agenda for over a year,"" said Brigid Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair State University.

Wisniewski told us he stands by his statement. Even if Christie spoke about ethics reform in the past, that has not been his agenda, Wisniewski said.

""It’s not been what he’s talking about,"" Wisniewski said.

Let’s explain how long Christie has been discussing ethics reform.

In September 2010, Christie proposed a series of ethics reform measures, such as having a more detailed financial disclosure statement for the legislative branch, and a complete ban on dual office holding.

By April 2011, the governor was still talking about how he had proposed an ethics reform package in September, but none of his proposals had received a hearing in the Democratic-controlled Legislature.

At an April 26 town hall meeting, Christie said, on the subject of ethics reform, the Legislature’s report card would read, ""demonstrates a complete disinterest in the subject matter.""

In the months following those remarks, ethics reform would fall into the shadows behind pension and health benefits reform and, soon after that, a showdown over the new state budget. In August, much public attention focused on proposed toll hikes and then Hurricane Irene.

By September -- with Election Day on the horizon -- Christie renewed his focus during recent town hall meetings on ethics reform.

David Redlawsk, a political science professor in the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said it’s incorrect to claim ethics reform represents a new topic for Christie, but he agreed that the proposals fell off the radar after being unveiled last year.

""He made the proposals, but he never did what was necessary to push them hard,"" Redlawsk said. ""He turned to other parts of his agenda.""

Before we turn to our ruling, let’s talk about the financial disclosure report cited by Wisniewski in the television interview.

Wisniewski and other legislators are required to file financial disclosure statements by May 15, detailing sources of income and other data from the preceding calendar year. For each source of income, legislators must show the range of their earnings according to four categories, with the highest level listed as $50,000 or more.

""Nobody’s hiding anything and it’s outright false to suggest otherwise,"" Wisniewski told us.

In his most recent report, Wisniewski listed his sources of earned income as what he receives through his law firm and through his legislative salary.

But the financial disclosure statements submitted by Christie and other designated state officials provide greater detail of income earnings. Those forms outline seven categories with the highest level identified as greater than $500,000.

Our ruling

Wisniewski claimed Christie had ""come up with a new agenda"" for ethics reform this past month. But the governor unveiled his ethics reform proposals a year ago, and reiterated the need for action earlier this year.

Still, Wisniewski is right that ethics reform has not been the governor’s top priority in recent months. We rate the statement Mostly False.

"['New Jersey', 'Deficit', 'State Budget', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims he balanced two budgets while facing $13 billion in deficits and didn’t raise taxes
","
Gov. Chris Christie has some advice for Washington, D.C.: follow New Jersey’s lead.

The Republican said in a speech last week at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., that the world doesn’t view the United States as it once did, in part because of partisan bickering. But in New Jersey, he said, ""you have actually seen divided government that’s working.""

""We compromised, on a bipartisan basis, to get results,"" Christie said Tuesday. ""How do we do this? How do we do it? Through leadership and compromise. Leadership and compromise is the only way you can balance two budgets with over $13 billion in deficits without raising taxes while protecting core services.""

As Christie mulls a possible bid for the White House, PolitiFact New Jersey looked at his tenure in the Garden State. We found his claim needs a few clarifications.

The $13 billion in deficits includes a $2.2 billion mid-year deficit in the fiscal 2010 budget -- a spending plan approved by his predecessor -- and a $10.7 billion projected deficit for fiscal 2011.

The $10.7 billion figure was the state’s projected structural deficit -- or the difference between the amount needed to maintain spending levels and fully fund every program mandated by state law and state revenues -- for fiscal 2011. The state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services calculated the structural deficit.

Christie, in his fiscal 2012 budget proposal, dismissed the structural deficit as the ""old way of budgeting."" We’ll address that later.

First, let’s tackle how Christie handled the $13 billion in deficits.

Christie’s plan to handle the fiscal 2010 deficit included ""375 line items of cuts, efficiencies and program eliminations,"" according to a February 2010 news release from the governor’s office. Among those was a $475 million cut in aid to school districts.

The governor tackled the projected $10.7 billion deficit for fiscal 2011 by reducing property tax rebates, school and municipal aid and skipping a more than $3 billion pension payment, among other measures.

New Jersey’s Constitution requires a balanced budget every year. So, Christie did balance both budgets.

But is a budget balanced when the state skips a required payment to the pension system?

""It’s certainly not uncommon for governors to use the word ‘balance’ imprecisely,"" said Bob Ward, deputy director of the New York-based Rockefeller Institute of Government. ""From a private-sector perspective, a budget that simply skips a required pension payment could not be described as balanced. In the context of state government budgets, the claim may be technically correct.""

Let’s cede that point to the governor.

But Christie signed another spending plan this summer. What happened to the fiscal 2012 budget?

The Office of Legislative Services projected the fiscal 2012 structural deficit at $10.5 billion.

But, in a February budget speech, the governor said the projected deficit ""assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterday’s New Jersey.""

Now, Christie said, ""the baseline is zero"" for budgeting.

David Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the Office of Legislative Services, said ""that’s not an illegitimate way to look at it,"" but the executive branch appears to be using two different methodologies.

""I don’t know what the right answer is, but it does seem like adding apples and oranges if they are using that calculation for one year and not another,"" he said.

""In his first year in office, the governor closed more than $13 billion in deficits created because past administrations and Legislatures approved costly programs without creating sustainable sources of long-term funding to pay for them.  This created monstrous deficits,"" Andy Pratt, a state Treasury Department spokesman, said in a written statement. ""We’ve returned to a zero-based budgeting approach that starts on the assumption that we spend within our means and budget based on realistic and sustainable revenues.  Except in theoretical terms, that means there are no longer any deficits to discuss.""

Now, let’s tackle Christie’s other point that he didn’t raise taxes. PolitiFact New Jersey previously found that while rates for the state’s three major taxes have remained the same, several experts said at least one of three tax credits programs reduced in fiscal 2011 could represent a tax hike.

Our ruling

The governor said his administration balanced ""two budgets with over $13 billion in deficits without raising taxes.""

Several experts said cuts to tax credit programs could represent a tax hike.

And while Christie is technically correct that he balanced two budgets with $13 billion in deficits, that figure includes a projected structural deficit. And the governor has since dismissed structural deficits as ""the old way of budgeting."" He can’t have it one way one year and then change it the next year.

We rate the governor’s statement Half True.
