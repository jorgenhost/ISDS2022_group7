Mitt Romney says unemployment in Texas weakens Rick Perry's appeal
","
In an email blast challenging Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s latest TV ad, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney questions Perry’s proclaimed record creating jobs in the Lone Star State by hammering the number of unemployed Texans and changes in the Texas unemployment rate.

Whoa, Mitty!

The Texas economy has been roaring since about 1990. Pia Orrenius, a senior economist for the Federal Reserve branch in Dallas, told us this year that some of the favorable economic factors in Texas are its booming Gulf ports and its surging trade with Mexico and China.

Orrenius also ranks among experts who have told us that job gains and losses in a state aren’t controlled by whoever is governor. Orrenius said in June: ""Long before Rick Perry"" became governor, ""we were talking about the great Texas economy. There are so many exciting things about the Texas economy that precede any political flavor of the month.""
   
In this story, we’re checking five claims in Romney’s multi-barreled Oct. 26, 2011, press release. It says that more than 1 million Texans are out of work and that the state’s unemployment rate has doubled on Perry’s watch and is at its highest level in nearly 25 years. Also, the Texas rate is higher than the rates in 27 states, the email says, and has escalated faster than the national rate during Barack Obama’s presidency.

1) Romney’s spokeswoman, Gail Gitcho, says in the press release that ""more than a million workers in (Perry’s) state are out of a job.""

Information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier helped us confirm that 1.04 million Texans were unemployed as of August 2011. There were slightly more unemployed Texans as of September, the bureau says.

2) From the Romney release: ""The unemployment rate in Texas is 8.5 percent, more than twice as high as when Perry took office.""

The unemployment rate has doubled during Perry’s governorship — going from 4.2 percent in December 2000 to 8.5 percent in September 2011, according to BLS data.

3) Romney’s release says the ""unemployment rate in Texas is at a level not seen in nearly a quarter of a century.""

That’s also correct, per the bureau: The state’s September unemployment rate, 8.5 percent, was the highest Texas had experienced since the 9.3 percent rate reached in November 1986, nearly 25 years before.

4) The email also says that in September, ""27 states had a lower unemployment rate than Texas.""

That’s correct, according to the bureau’s state-by-state breakdown of September unemployment rates.

5) The email blast also says that since Obama became president, in January 2009, the Texas ""unemployment rate has grown nearly twice as fast as the national rate.""

That claim was new fodder for the PolitiFact Texas Truth-O-Meter.

Romney says that between January 2009 and September 2011, the national unemployment rate grew by 16.7 percent, increasing from 7.8 percent to 9.1 percent. Over the same period, the email says, the unemployment rate in Texas grew from 6.4 percent to 8.5 percent — a 32.8 percent increase. According to BLS data, the unemployment rate figures for both Texas and the nation are correct.

In a telephone interview, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, said the Texas unemployment rate has grown faster than the national one since January 2009. She suggested another way of measuring the changes; the U.S. rate rose 1.3 percentage points between January 2009 and September 2011 while the Texas rate increased 2.1 points. Then again, Abbot pointed out, the Texas’ unemployment rate remains below the national one.

Abbot also suggested that we look at the change in the raw number of unemployed workers in both the U.S. and Texas. We found that those numbers also largely support Romney’s point that unemployment has been growing faster in Texas since January 2009 than it has across the country. The number of unemployed people nationally rose 16.8 percent between January 2009 and September 2011 while the number in Texas increased 38 percent.

We took one other dip into the numbers, this time thinking about timing. During many fact-checks of jobs-related claims, we’ve learned that changing the time period in a comparison can result in big differences in the numbers.

Romney’s statement considers the increase in unemployment since Obama entered office in January 2009, about a year after the national recession began and after the U.S. and Texas jobless rates had both begun to climb. Unlike the Texas unemployment rate, though, the U.S. rate has been on a generally downward trend from its latest peak of 10.1 percent in October 2009.

Rolling back the starting month of Romney’s comparison to November 2007, the month before the recession began, narrowly causes the difference between Texas and the nation to flip. From November 2007 to September 2011, the U.S. unemployment rate rose 4.4 percentage points, an increase in the rate of 94 percent. In the period, the Texas unemployment rate increased by a smaller 4.1 percentage points, up 93 percent.

Choosing yet another time period, one starting in January 2006, the Texas performance seems even better, relative to the nation. Between January 2006 and September 2011, the U.S. unemployment rate rose faster than the Texas one: 4.4 percentage points vs. 3.4 points.

Our ruling

Each of Romney’s Texas-tied jobless claims is factually supported, yet his claims fuel a misleading impression — that the Texas governor has guided its economy into a ditch. To the contrary, the Texas economy has fared relatively well for more than 20 years.

Besides, it’s unreasonable to blame, or credit, a state’s governor for changes in unemployment rates. A single state official, even the governor, doesn’t hold sway over the many factors that drive the economy.

"['City Budget', 'Labor', 'Wisconsin', 'Tom Barrett']","
On using Gov. Scott Walker’s collective-bargaining limits to help balance the city of Milwaukee budget, Barrett walked a fine line
","
When Republican Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his controversial curbs on collective bargaining, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett blasted away.

Milwaukee, Barrett said, could get health and pension concessions from public employees at the bargaining table without ""attacking"" workers’ rights and trying to ""obliterate"" people.

The mayor, who ran against Walker in the 2010 election, backed the decision by Senate Democrats to flee to Illinois to block a quorum on Walker’s bill.

Eight months later, the Democratic mayor took advantage of a key plank in Walker’s bill to help save millions on health insurance costs and balance the city budget without having to negotiate with city unions. In the past, the city would have had to negotiate such a change.

Not after Walker’s move.

As the Milwaukee Common Council considers Barrett’s budget proposal, and some in labor launch barbs at him, it seems like a good time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter.

First, our requisite reminder: The Flip-O-Meter measures whether a political figure has changed positions. It does not evaluate whether any move is good politics or good policy. Some will see a change as being open to new ideas, others as political pandering.

Now, a brief history lesson:

On Feb. 11, 2011, Walker introduced what became Act 10, the historic budget-repair bill that required state employees to pay more for health insurance and pensions, as part of his move to take away most collective bargaining rights from most public workers. Protesters flocked to Madison and occupied the Capitol rotunda for weeks.

The bill also extended the state-employee benefit cuts to local municipalities and schools by taking health and pension out of bargaining for most unions at the local level as well. The law requires local communities whose employees are in the state health plan for local governments to move to start charging employees 12 percent toward health care premiums.

Milwaukee is not in that plan, so it was free to set whatever level of cost sharing it wanted.

These ""tools,"" Walker said, would help local governments make up for the big cuts in local education and municipal aid he proposed March 1, 2011, to close a $3 billion shortfall in the next two-year  budget.

So, did Barrett change his position by using one of the ""tools"" that the bill handed to local governments?

We reviewed Barrett’s public statements and actions as recorded in dozens of news stories, speeches and press conferences in 2011.

Barrett immediately started a nuanced two-step dance in his public statements -- objecting to some parts of the proposal while saying other parts were necessary.

Let’s start with whether Barrett’s rhetoric was consistent, before comparing his deeds to his words.

The approach toward unions: Barrett, who was supported by nearly all public unions except police and fire in the 2010 governor’s race, made clear he thought Walker overreached with some of Act 10 in ways that Barrett saw as union busting.

Walker wanted to make it harder for unions to collect dues and remain certified, as well as eliminate nearly all collective bargaining -- moves that some said would shrink unions into irrelevance or put them out of business.

Walker was messing with ""the fundamental right to organize,"" Barrett said within days of Walker’s February announcement. ""It’s an ideological war to try to crush labor,"" Barrett said a few weeks later when interviewed on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow show on March 7, 2011.

Barrett didn’t specify which of the bill’s provisions he felt crossed the line into union busting. But he made clear he believed he could have used the ""rough and tumble"" of collective bargaining with unions to get concessions similar to what Walker wanted.

Impact on city budget: Barrett predicted that Milwaukee’s budget would come out a big loser due to the aid cuts in Walker’s two-year budget. He said in March that the combination of aid cuts, rising expenses, a levy freeze and exempting public safety workers from benefit changes ""just makes our structural deficit explode.""

Walker said just the opposite, and he was right: By August, city estimates showed a potential gain of at least $11 million from the two separate state budget bills.

Most of the savings, the Journal Sentinel reported in August, could come from health care benefit changes that Barrett didn't have to negotiate with unions -- thanks to Walker’s changes.

So we saw Barrett criticizing the bill in pretty stark terms -- inaccurately in one case. But he liked some of it, and even wanted more.

Here’s where this gets interesting.

Paying more: The mayor -- early and often -- said public employees would have to pay more, needed to pay more, and the public wanted them to pay more.

It’s notable that Barrett said that even before the big public unions publicly said they would swallow Walker’s financial demands if he dropped the limits on bargaining.

With an eye on solving his own budget problems, Barrett said Feb. 22, 2011, that he’d support city employees paying the same higher contributions as state workers. He even credited Walker for paving the way by getting a ""mandate"" in his election win for raising state pension and health contributions.

And the mayor sought to push state lawmakers to go even further than Walker, who had proposed exempting public safety unions from the collective bargaining limits. He called on lawmakers to subject police and fire unions to the same bargaining limits as other public employee unions so the sacrifice could be shared among all workers.

Barrett minced no words. He said the law enforcement retirement and health benefits were ""Cadillac.""

The mayor went further.

As the standoff with AWOL Democrats continued over Walker’s bill, Barrett called Feb. 24, 2011, for an ""alternative"" to Walker’s bill.

Specifically, he said the GOP should set aside the sharp limits on union bargaining and just vote on requiring the benefits changes.

As the Journal Sentinel reported, Barrett would ""impose the health care and pension changes and extend those changes to all public employees, leaving the rest of the budget-repair bill's provisions for separate debate later.""

He also asked Republican lawmakers to require city of Milwaukee workers to pay 12 percent of their health premiums -- just as Walker was proposing for state employees and some municipal workers not in Milwaukee.

Mandate the benefits changes at a specific level?

That would mean having the state dictate what amount Milwaukee workers should pay. That’s a far cry from local collective bargaining and would have taken away some flexibility on letting some communities decide what to impose.

Was Barrett sending out mixed signals -- criticizing excessive excessive limits on collective bargaining, while he endorsed scrapping them for health care, one of the biggest-ticket items?

Barrett told us his statements were not meant to endorse limits on health care bargaining. When we asked how else his proposal would have imposed greater health contributions on local workers, he said he was only trying to goad GOP legislators and Walker into a separate vote on the limits.

Enough with the words.

Now let’s look at Barrett’s deeds in summer and fall of 2011, when it came time to decide whether to use the ""tools.""

In September 2011, as he prepared his budget proposal, Barrett was free to impose more health-care cost sharing because the GOP had removed it as a mandatory subject of bargaining by the budget-repair bill.

He did so, at basically the same level as the bill required for state employees (12 percent). It was a big key to balancing his budget while avoiding major cuts.

He also followed through on his promise to get the police and fire unions -- with whom he still has to bargain -- to agree or to consider paying more towards health insurance. He also offered them a wage increase for 2012. Police supervisors and firefighters ratified the deal; rank and file police rejected it.

Barrett shied away from crediting Walker, citing the city’s past success getting employee unions to agree to pay more.

This sequence of events rubbed the city’s biggest labor union the wrong way.

Barrett gave ""lip service"" to opposing Walker’s bill but then exploited it,"" says Rich Abelson, executive director of AFSCME District Council 48. And Marty Beil, head of the biggest state employee union, said labor would not back Barrett in a possible recall election because there’s no difference between Barrett and the governor.

Said Abelson: ""If you don’t want to screw your employees, don’t screw your employees.""

Barrett told us he was just dealing with reality.

He felt it was either eliminate 300-400 city jobs and trim key services due to the state budget’s cuts -- or use the help Walker provided.

""It’s a real world issue,"" he said.

So where does it land on the Flip-O-Meter?

Abelson calls Barrett’s actions opportunistic. We see some irony here, and a heavy does of Realpolitik.

But Barrett made very clear early on that he wanted the same concessions Walker was seeking -- and applied to a broader group. So it’s not really a surprise that ultimately he grabbed the chance once he and other Dems lost the battle over the union-power items.

And while his messages on the union power issues crossed wires at times, his statements from the start signalled he was willing to be seen as ready to impose benefits changes.

The union’s disgust over Barrett’s position underscores that.

The Flip-O-Meter defines a No Flip as ""no substantial change in position.""

That fits the bill here.",/factchecks/2011/oct/27/tom-barrett/using-gov-scott-walkers-collective-bargaining-limi/
"['New Jersey', 'Pensions', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims judges collect better pension benefits at a lower cost than other public employees in New Jersey
","
Gov. Chris Christie has handed down his ruling: fork it over, judges.

In a fight over whether judges are required to pay more toward pension and health benefits as required by a law passed this summer, Christie has blasted the state's judiciary as protecting its own wallet as other public employees ante up.

""Everyone who has the privilege of a public pension should pay their fair share for their public pension. That's all this is about. And the courts now try to muck this up to make it about judicial independence. I want the judiciary to be independent,"" Christie said during a Tuesday press conference. ""I just don't want them to be a part of an elite, special class of citizens who get better benefits at a lower cost than everybody else in the state and do that at the expense of the taxpayers. It simply doesn't make sense.""

State Superior Court Assignment Judge Linda Feinberg ruled last week that judges are exempt from the new law because it amounts to a pay cut, which the state Constitution forbids for the judiciary.

Christie has appealed the judge’s decision and called for a constitutional amendment to circumvent it. He also tied the issue to the Nov. 8 election, calling on candidates vying for the 120 legislative seats up for grabs to choose a side on whether judges should pay more.

As the debate continues in the courts and the state capital, PolitiFact New Jersey checked Christie’s claim that judges reap more from the pension system than they sow. We found Christie is right.

Among the five major pension funds covering public workers in New Jersey, recent retirees in the judicial pension system collected the largest average annual benefit and contributed the smallest percentage of their salaries, prior to the new pension reform law.

The amount public employees collect in pension benefits depends on a variety of factors, including their occupation, salary and years of service. We should also note that most public workers receive subsidized health benefits in retirement.

Public school employees, state police and the judiciary branch each have a pension fund. Police and firefighters have a retirement system and other public employees belong to the Public Employees’ Retirement System, or PERS.

New retirees -- those who have retired in the year preceding July 1, 2010 --  from the judicial pension system collected an average annual pension benefit of $107,540, the largest among the state pension funds in that category.

The same types of retirees in the state police pension fund collected $65,232. New, local retirees in PERS collected $17,599, the smallest amount among the funds in that category.

Before the pension law that passed this summer, judges contributed 3 percent of their salaries toward their pensions, the smallest percentage among public employees. Members of the state police pension fund contributed 7.5 percent and members of PERS contributed 5.5 percent.

Under the new law, the amount judges pay toward their pensions jumps, over a seven year period, from 3 percent to 12 percent of their salary, the largest percentage compared with the contribution rates of members of other pension funds.

Our ruling

Christie, during a news conference on judicial pensions, said judges ""get better benefits at a lower cost than everybody else in the state.""

The average annual pension benefit for new retirees in the judicial pension system is the largest. And judges contributed, prior to the pension and benefit reform law, 3 percent of their salary toward their pension,  the smallest percentage among public employees.

We rate Christie’s statement True.

U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette says $1 billion in infrastructure investment translates to 42,000 jobs
","
Congressman Steve LaTourette is a self-described huge proponent of infrastructure spending, because, he says, it generates good-paying jobs and spurs economic development. The Bainbridge Township Republican, who spent 14 years on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, says on his House website: ""Major infrastructure projects are proven job generators and spur economic development. For each $1 billion in infrastructure investment, 42,000 jobs are created.""

That figure has been used  by Republicans and Democrats alike. With the White House and Congress engaged in a standoff over how best to revive the American economy and create jobs, and with infrastructure spending on the table, now seems a good time to look into this figure.

Although cited by a number of industry-backed groups that want the government to invest heavily in highway, bridge, airport and rail projects, the number actually comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration. But it is outdated. It comes, in fact, from 1996.

An updated federal study is expected in 2012, so for now the department pointed us to its most recent number, from 2007: $1 billion in highway spending supports 27,800 jobs.

That’s a big difference from 42,000.

The Department of Transportation explains why: The figure changes over time. It was higher a decade earlier. For that matter, the figure was higher only months ago, when the federal government (and news stories) used extrapolations from earlier studies and said the number was around 30,000. In a recent update to its website, the DOT said: ""Increases in construction materials prices and wages over time will tend to reduce the number of jobs supported by each $1 billion invested.""

The particular figure used by LaTourette and others was considered accurate 15 years ago. Said the DOT at the time: ""Per $1 billion of investment in 1996, the Federal-aid highway program supports approximately 42,100 total full-time equivalent jobs.""

Of those jobs, 7,900 were for on-site highway construction. This meant laborers, engineers, specialists and managers.

Another 19,700 were indirect jobs in industries that support highway construction. This included jobs in stone and clay mining and quarrying, lumber, steel  and  concrete,  and professional services.

The final 14,500 jobs were ""induced,"" or jobs supported by the general economy as a result of the other workers spending their wages.   

Note that the government figures included not only jobs created  but also jobs supported.  This is tricky territory; remember when then-President-elect Barack Obama said the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 would create or save up to 4 million  jobs? Critics complained that was a broad way of measuring.

There have been still other figures cited by federal transportation authorities, including one in 2007  that said with $1 billion from the federal government plus a match from states, 34,799 jobs would be supported. But that would mean spending a total of $1.25 billion, with $250 million coming from the states, according to the Congressional Research Service. Remove the state portion and consider only the federal government’s fanciful $1 billion and the figure drops to 27,800 -- the same number the feds say is the most recent.

Had LaTourette been referring to infrastructure in general, and not specifically transportation infrastructure, he might have cited pre-recession work from the University of Massachusetts,  where economists said that $1 billion in general infrastructure spending creates 18,000 jobs.

Then there’s the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, which said in a 2008 report on the nation’s infrastructure, ""For example, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials estimates 42,000 jobs are created for every $1 billion dollars invested in transportation projects."" That’s the same figure LaTourette used.

And just this week, another figure came across our desk, with extraordinary timing. Cleveland Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, announcing the latest infrastructure bill, said in a news release: ""According to the Federal Highway Administration, for every $1 billion spent on highway and bridge construction, nearly 35,000 jobs are created."" Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown used the same 35,000 figure in September, and his office notes that the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials uses that number, too.  

That number, however, assumes states will kick in $250 million, as the Congressional Research Service explains. It’s a model based on $1.25 billion in spending; otherwise, that $1 billion gets you 27,800 jobs.

So which is it? We’re inclined to go with the one that the Federal Highway Administration gave us -- 27,800 -- and regard all the others as outdated or built on assumptions that cash-strapped states are ready to gear up their highway spending. Every one of these figures comes with caveats anyway. Large construction projects take years to plan, with only about a quarter of the money being spent in the first year, so some economists question their stimulative value. Highway advocates say the early funding is a  catalyst, improving the outlook for future years at a time many people are afraid of the uncertainty. Libertarians disagree with moderate Republicans over whether the government should even stay in the road-building business. Democrats and Republicans disagree over details of the various bills that have been proposed, particularly their funding.

Yet there appears to be widespread agreement within Congress that America’s roads and bridges need repair, and general consensus in Washington that this is a way to create some number of jobs -- if and when lawmakers can come to terms on the other points.

In the most general sense, then, this makes LaTourette’s claim halfway accurate.

His communications director, Deborah Setliff, says the 42,000 figure was put on his website in February 2010. Federal highway authorities were not just citing it 15 years ago but also  in 2002, she noted, and House and Senate members working on transportation legislation that passed in 2005 gave the higher figure of 47,500 jobs per $1 billion in federal highway spending (note the emphasis on ""federal"").

Former Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta in 2008 and 2009 used the ratio of 37,000 jobs per $1 billion in infrastructure spending. Senate Democrats used the same figure in 2009. And just this year, Nick Rayhall, the ranking Democrat on the House transportation committee, put the figure at 36,000 jobs. But fellow committee member Corrine Brown of Florida, also a Democrat, separately said the number of jobs per $1 billion was 42,000.

These, fellow Americans, are your lawmaking experts. LaTourette’s number was off, but his general concept has plenty of support, which is why we say pick a number.  Any number.

It’s also why LaTourette’s claim is rated Half True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/26/steve-latourette/us-rep-steve-latourette-says-infrastructure-invest/

Leon Panetta says military has ""hollowed out"" after major wars
","
In congressional testimony reported in a New York Times article on Oct. 23, 2011, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned against cutting defense spending too severely as the U.S. winds down its involvement in Iraq and reconsiders how to proceed in Afghanistan.

""After every major conflict — World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the fall of the Soviet Union — what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the-board cuts that impacted on equipment, impacted on training, impacted on capability,"" Panetta said. ""Whatever we do in confronting the challenges we face now on the fiscal side, we must not make that mistake.""

After a reader pointed out this quote to us, we decided it was worth checking.

Before starting our analysis, we’ll note a few factors.

First, on the statistical side, we’ll look overall defense spending, and troop levels. For spending, experts told us that the best figures to use are inflation-adjusted, annual totals. 
Second, the definition of the key phrase Panetta used -- ""hollowing out"" -- is open to interpretation.

""‘Hollowing out’ is a rather imprecise term that is floating around the Pentagon a lot these days,"" said Todd Harrison, senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent think tank on defense and related spending. ""It can mean not providing troops with adequate pay and benefits so that the best ones leave. It can mean not providing troops with adequate training, leaving them unprepared for combat. Or it can mean providing troops with substandard equipment, poorly maintained equipment or an insufficient quantity of equipment. When Panetta and others in the Pentagon say this, I’m not sure if they mean all of these things happened in the past or just some of them.""

The Pentagon did not respond to a query seeking data and background to support Panetta’s point, so we turned to a range of military experts and historians to assess whether the U.S. military experienced a ""hollowing out"" as Panetta said.

Now, let’s look at some numbers. For spending, we measured the decline from the peak spending year of the war to the lowest level within five years after hostilities ended.

The full details of our methodology can be found here, but the bottom line is that defense spending fell after World War II by 92 percent, after the Korean War by 53 percent, after the Vietnam War by 26 percent and after the Cold War by 28 percent.

As for worldwide troop levels, they fell by 27 percent after the Korean War, by 40 percent after the Vietnam War and by 32 percent after the Cold War. (The data we found did not include numbers for the aftermath of World War I, or for troop levels after World War II.)

What both of these measurements show is that for the periods following Korea, Vietnam and the end of the Cold War, both defense spending and worldwide troop levels declined by about one-quarter to one-half within a few years. So Panetta has a point.

Still, determining whether these declines led to a ""hollowing out"" requires looking at more than just the raw numbers. After all, it’s no surprise that both military spending and troop levels would decline after a war concludes.

A more relevant question is whether the decreases were severe enough in their scope and composition to hurt the United States’ ability to act militarily, given the threats the nation faced at the time. This is more of a judgment call, and the experts we contacted expressed some ambivalence.

""The accuracy of Panetta's statement largely hinges on how you define ‘hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the board cuts,’"" said Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University. ""His point is that during periods of budget cutting, we have to make smart choices, rather than cutting everything back the same amount, and that our choices have to reflect the threats we'll face in the future. That's a point I suspect most people would agree with. My caveat is that his use of historical examples is a bit suspect, and doesn't reflect the political realities that governed defense spending during the 20th century.""

Let’s take a look at the political, economic and military contexts surrounding each of the post-war periods Panetta cited.

Post-World War I

The cuts made after World War I are universally considered to have been major. But at least one historian we contacted believes that the damage to American military capabilities has been overstated.

""We did make huge cuts in defense spending after World War I, but that was to be expected after waging a massive conflict in Europe and was vital in that we could not have sustained wartime spending levels indefinitely,"" Janda said. ""The cuts made sense in that we faced no serious threat to the continental United States, and they were unavoidable in a political environment that by the mid 1920s had concluded that our involvement in World War I had been a mistake."" The arrival of the Great Depression in 1929 made the need for cuts even more urgent, Janda said.

He added that the largest cuts came in Army spending, under the belief that the Navy was the nation’s first line of defense and critical to protecting overseas possessions. Once it became clear in the late 1930s that conflict with Japan and Germany was likely, military spending began to rise again.

""Should we have started sooner? Maybe,"" Janda said. ""Should we have spent more on the Army? Yes. But that's in hindsight, and it's not like the cuts of the 1920s were still haunting us in 1939. So I think that while Mr. Panetta is right about the fact that we cut defense spending after World War I, he's overstating the case to argue that those cuts ‘hollowed out’ the force that existed when we were threatened almost 20 years later.""

Post-World War II

The decline in defense spending after World War II was massive and rapid. The U.S. Army shrank from 89 divisions in 1945 to 10 in 1950, said Ted Wilson, a historian at the University of Kansas.

In this context, June 1950 -- the start of the Korean War -- came as ""a rude awakening,"" said William W. Stueck, historian at the University of Georgia. Unlike the two-decade period between the world wars, the Korean War came about five years after the end of World War II, and for this reason it has become a poster child for the dangers of a ""hollowed out"" military. But even here the situation is more complicated.

Janda notes that, as after World War I, cuts were made because ""our wartime spending levels were politically and economically unsustainable. Did we hollow out the force? I don't think so. It dramatically shrunk in size, to be sure, but we still had the largest navy and air force on the planet. What cost us in Korea in 1950 was that the veterans of World War II had largely gone home, and the Army was composed of draftees with no combat experience. It's also true that our tanks and bazookas could have been better, and that the Army took the brunt of the cuts between 1945 and 1950. But again, that was because we made a choice and decided that in a world with nuclear weapons that we were better off putting the bulk of our resources into the Air Force and the Navy as our first line of defense.""

Post-Korean War

Unlike the enormous decreases following both World Wars, the aftermath of the Korean War was the first in a series of more modest cutbacks. The key difference is that by then the Cold War was underway, and the U.S. determined that a standing military -- one backed by cutting-edge technology from a permanent defense industry -- was necessary.

After the Korean War, President Dwight Eisenhower ""continued to see a high-level -- even an expanding -- security threat from the Soviet Union,"" Stueck said. But because of concerns that high military spending could be a threat to the U.S. economy, Eisenhower made substantial cuts in the Army (his old branch), though he increased Air Force spending. When John F. Kennedy entered office, he pursued an expansion of the defense budget even before the escalation in Vietnam.

Both Janda and Harrison see this period as a weak link in Panetta’s claim.

""Eisenhower made a number of deliberate decisions in the early 1950s to shift the focus of military strategy from fighting major ground wars like Korea to using nuclear deterrence to stop Soviet expansion,"" Harrison said. ""These were not blind, across-the-board cuts, as Panetta suggests, but rather were targeted cuts that reflected a shift in strategy.""

Post-Vietnam War

The term ""hollowed out"" is most widely associated with the post-Vietnam era, when the United States was recovering from an unpopular war. There’s wide consensus that military readiness -- not to mention a willingness to intervene militarily -- slumped in the 1970s, which provides some support for Panetta’s claim.

But even here, several experts said that the ""hollowing out"" had a lot to do with the military’s shift from the draft to an all-volunteer force -- an important transformational change that caused some short-term challenges. ""After the all-volunteer force was instituted in 1973 and wages increased to attract quality volunteers, morale rose to new peaks,"" said Tim Kane, a senior fellow at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.  

Another factor was more obscure -- procurement decisions made under President Richard Nixon.

""The biggest problem we had in the 1970s was that we needed new tanks and aircraft, and we didn't have them because of decisions made in the 1960s and early 1970s by the Nixon administration, the Army, and the Air Force,"" Janda said. Systems like the M-1 Abrams, the B-1 bomber, the MX Missile, Cruise missiles and stealth fighters were in the pipeline, he said, but they were ready only by the time Ronald Reagan became president, he said.

So while the term ""hollowing out"" may be apt for the post-Vietnam period, it’s more of a stretch to say it was caused by ""deep, across-the-board cuts.""

Post-Cold War

There was a ""peace dividend"" after the end of the Cold War, but it was limited by the rapid emergence of the Persian Gulf War. And during the 1990s, the United States participated in a large number of limited military interventions in such places as Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Haiti and the no-fly zones in Iraq, often using air power, sometimes combined with specialized ground forces.

""Were we ‘hollowed out?’ No,"" Janda said. ""We were still the most powerful nation on the planet. But we had to make choices, just like the Romans did 2,000 years ago when they stopped expanding and limited the number of legions in the Roman Army. No nation can afford to spend too much on defense.""

Our ruling

Panetta said that ""after every major conflict — World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the fall of the Soviet Union — what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the-board cuts.""

He’s correct that spending and troop levels fell -- enormously after the World Wars, more modestly after the other conflicts. But there’s less consensus that the cuts -- particularly the ones that followed after the conclusion of Korean War and the Cold War -- led to a ""hollowed out"" force. We think it’s a stretch to suggest, as Panetta does, that cuts were made across the board. In most cases, the cuts weren’t knee-jerk but were in fact made with a larger strategy in mind. On balance, we rate Panetta’s comment Half True. 
CORRECTION: The quote checked in this item was made at a congressional hearing. While the comment was included in a recent New York Times story, it was not made during one of Panetta's two interviews for the that story, as the initial version of this story had indicated.",/factchecks/2011/oct/26/leon-panetta/leon-panetta-says-military-has-hollowed-out-after-/
"['Environment', 'Energy', 'Oil Spill', 'Florida', 'Bill Nelson']","
Sen. Bill Nelson said his battle for BP video allowed scientists to calculate Deepwater Horizon flow
","
It's been a year and a half since oil suddenly gushed from the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig into the Gulf of Mexico. 

In the early days, rig operator BP estimated about 1,000 barrels a day might be escaping into the gulf. The true number? More like 50,000 to 60,000 barrels — or more than 2 million gallons — every day, for nearly three months.

How did we learn it was so high?

U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., says it wasn't until he and a Senate colleague were able to ""wrangle the actual streaming video"" from BP that scientists were able to calculate the flow.

Nelson spoke about the spill Oct. 11, 2011, on the Senate floor, where he urged his colleagues to find a way to fund gulf research. He began:

""As one of the senators from a state that borders the Gulf of Mexico, naturally we have been quite concerned in the followup to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. You will remember that was an oil spill that at first BP said: Oh, it was only 1,000 barrels a day. It was not until Sen. (Barbara) Boxer, the chairman of the environment committee, and I were able to wrangle the actual streaming video from 5,000 feet below the surface and put it up on my Web site that the scientists could then calculate how much oil was coming out. It was not anywhere close to 1,000 barrels a day. In fact, it ended up being 50,000 barrels of oil a day that was gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of that total number of days, almost 5 million barrels of oil has gushed into the gulf, we can expect some serious economic and environmental consequences and particularly the consequences on the critters."" 

The senior senator from Florida, responsible for lifting the veil on a disaster unfolding 5,000 feet underwater?

For this fact-check, we're weighing the statement, ""It was not until Sen. Boxer ... and I were able to wrangle the actual streaming video (of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill) from 5,000 feet below the surface and put it up on my Web site that the scientists could then calculate how much oil was coming out."" 

We reached out to scientists, reviewed news and video from the time, checked official reports on the spill and spoke with the senator's office. 

• • •

On April 20, 2010, an explosion ripped through the drilling rig, killing 11 crew members. As flames raged above water 49 miles off the coast of Louisiana, something equally violent was happening beneath the surface.

It wasn't yet clear what.

But within a day, a nonprofit group called SkyTruth, led by a geologist who had worked for the energy industry, began collecting and analyzing satellite images of the spill — brown swirls a reporter would later say resembled peanut butter. The group got help from Florida State oceanographer Ian MacDonald.

On April 24, BP said that a broken riser pipe was leaking 1,000 barrels a day. A few days later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration boosted the estimate to 5,000 barrels. That was the first official ""flow rate estimate."" It would be used for weeks. It wasn't based on much.

In late April and early May, SkyTruth said satellite images and Coast Guard maps of the slick showed the flow might be more than four times that.

But none of those estimates could fully account for what was happening below the surface, where chemical dispersants created tiny droplets that spread in underwater plumes.

• • • 
On May 12, BP released a 30-second video of oil and gas spilling from the end of a broken pipe — and scientists scrambled to update their estimates, which now ranged from 20,000 to 100,000 barrels a day. By mid May, media reports spread additional doubt about the 5,000-barrel estimate. Rep. Edward Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who chaired the Energy and Environment Subcommittee, sent BP a letter questioning the size of the spill. 
A few days later, Sens. Nelson and Boxer sent their demand for underwater video. They soon got seven hard drives of high-resolution digital imagery, thousands of hours, said Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin. Low-resolution streaming video — what you may have seen online — wouldn't give scientists the detail they needed, so the senators' offices also uploaded high-resolution files to large-file transfer sites on the Web and in some cases even copied the hard drives and sent them to researchers, such as Timothy Crone at Columbia University.

In June, the senators repeated their call for video evidence, this time for all video records.

In the Oct. 29, 2010, issue of Science magazine, a report co-authored by Crone said the oil's flow was at least 10 times higher than first reported. It credited high-resolution video data ""provided by the office of Senator Bill Nelson and by the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works.""

""Sen. Nelson was one of the strongest proponents of open data access, and his work along with the work of others on that committee were critical for the work of independent scientists to go forward,"" Crone told PolitiFact Florida.

Paul Ruscher, a Florida State professor who along with MacDonald urged that BP release more information, said much of what scientists suggested was initially ignored.

""It was a staffer from Sen. Nelson's office who was contacted at some point, and whom I then contacted, to try to encourage both Senate and House energy committee members to get involved,"" he said. 

Ruscher said Nelson and other politicians, including Sen. John Kerry and Markey, should get full credit for pushing NOAA, the Coast Guard and BP to release video.

Final official estimates came from the Flow Rate Technical Group, which used several methods to estimate the amount of oil that streamed from Deepwater Horizon. Among its evidence: high-resolution video.

Our ruling
 
Nelson told his Senate colleagues, ""It was not until Sen. Boxer ... and I were able to wrangle the actual streaming video (of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill) from 5,000 feet below the surface and put it up on my Web site that the scientists could then calculate how much oil was coming out."" 

Scientists quickly challenged BP's early estimate based on satellite images and Coast Guard maps. Independent estimates improved when BP released short video clips. But scientists who specialize in flow rate calculations based on high-resolution, time-stamped video didn't have access to data they needed until Nelson's and Boxer's offices pushed for it. Some of those files were indeed downloaded from Nelson's website, while some were on physical hard drives that had to be mailed.

A casual listener might think scientists were unable to make early calculations that challenged BP's word without video from Nelson's website — and that's not quite the case. Meanwhile, other lawmakers also pushed for greater openness. But letters, press releases and interviews show Nelson did play a key role in the release of critical data, and for that we'll rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/26/bill-nelson/sen-bill-nelson-said-his-battle-bp-video-allowed-s/
"['Jobs', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says ""we"" created 1 million new jobs while rest of nation lost over 2 million
","
In a TV ad targeted at voters in Iowa, Texas Gov. Rick says he'll create at least 2.5 million jobs as president. ""And I know something about that,"" Perry says. ""In Texas, we created over 1 million new jobs while the rest of the nation lost over 2 million."" 
Perry aired a similar claim at the top of the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Reagan presidential library in California after NBC News anchor Brian Williams asked whether Texas, with its poverty rates and highest-in-the-nation share of minimum-wage workers, is the ""kind of answer Americans are looking for."" 
""Actually, what Americans are looking for is someone who can get this country working again,"" Perry replied. ""And we put the model in place in the state of Texas. When you look at what we have done over the last decade, we created 1 million jobs in the state of Texas. At the same time, America lost 2.5 million."" 
We dug into Perry’s statement in a September fact-check, rating his claim Half True. 
Without question, Texas has enjoyed phenomenal job growth over most of the time Perry has been governor, though how much came because of his leadership — or any state-level actions — is debatable. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney hinted as much in the Sept. 7 debate, saying: ""Texas is a great state. Texas has zero income tax. Texas has a right-to-work state, a Republican Legislature, a Republican Supreme Court. Texas has a lot of oil and gas in the ground. Those are wonderful things, but Gov. Perry doesn't believe that he created those things."" 
In a post-debate interview, economist Thomas Saving, director of Texas A&M University’s Private Enterprise Research Center, told us that Texas has relatively low state debt and endured less of a housing bubble than many states. Still, he said, the state's economy might have been strong over the past decade regardless of who was governor. 
Pia Orrenius, an economist for the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve Bank, told us in a June interview that the Texas economy has been roaring since 1990. ""Long before Rick Perry"" became governor, she said, ""we were talking about the great Texas economy. There are so many exciting things about the Texas economy that precede any political flavor of the month."" She listed as favorable factors the state's range of natural resources, its energy and high-tech sectors, its booming Gulf ports and its surging trade with Mexico and China. 
Also, we recognize that job-gain claims can overreach. An example: Perry’s January 2009 claim that about 70 percent of the U.S. jobs created between November 2007 and November 2008 were in Texas. We rated that claim False because the percentage was based on comparing new jobs in Texas with new jobs in 13 other states and the District of Columbia where job gains outnumbered losses; it ignored jobs created in 36 states where job losses overall outnumbered gains. 
Back to 2011: Perry’s campaign said in an Oct. 26 press release that the jobs statement in his Iowa ad is based on a comparison of the change in the number of Texas' nonfarm jobs during Perry's tenure as governor with the change in the rest of the nation. 
In December 2000, when Perry became governor, Texas had 9.5 million jobs while the other 49 states and the District of Columbia had 123.0 million. And in September 2011, Texas had 10.6 million jobs while the rest of the country had 120.6 million. 
That means Texas had 1.1 million more jobs in September than it did in late 2000, while the rest of the country had 2.4 million fewer jobs. So, Texas ended up with a lot more jobs than before, and other states, together, had even more net job losses. 
Specifically, Texas was among more than 20 states with net job gains in the period, while more than 25 states ended up with net job losses. In raw numbers, the net job losers were topped by Michigan and California, which together accounted for about 1.3 million fewer jobs. Michigan experienced the nation's greatest percentage slide, more than 15 percent. 
Conversely, while Texas had by far the greatest raw job gain, its 11.2 percent growth rate for the period was less than the percentage increases for Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. With its 21.2 percent increase, North Dakota led the nation, followed closely by Wyoming and its 21.1 percent jump. 
Lee McPheters, director of the Economic Outlook Center at Arizona State University, earlier told us by email that it's natural that the most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — would generate big raw job gains and losses. 
It's also crucial to notice the time period being analyzed, he said. For instance, Florida outpaced Texas in job growth from 2000 to 2007, he said, but then lost jobs for three years. Texas experienced steady job losses in a shorter period, from late 2008 through 2009. He wrote: ""So the difference is in the recent years, where states such as Florida and California dropped out of the job growth derby while Texas continued to add jobs in 2010 and into 2011."" 
So, how does Perry's comparison stand up? 
At a glance, it reflects the health of the Texas economy in his time as governor and the state's perpetual outsize significance in terms of raw job counts. 
Yet there's also a meaningful weakness in such a comparison. The governor of any state with net job gains in the period over the past decade could make a similar declaration, leaving the misimpression that only their state gained jobs while the rest of the country lost jobs. In this vein, for instance, Arizona could boast that it created 144,800 jobs while the rest of America lost 1.5 million. Left out of this formulation is that 20-plus other states also had job gains. 
Also, the Texas economy was rocking before Perry became governor. And most of each state’s economic circumstances — in Texas' case, no state personal income tax and vast natural resources, for starters — aren't controlled by the governor.

GOP Gov. Scott Walker says ""largest category"" of those entering technical college already have four-year degrees
","
We’ve heard the lousy job market has led many people to go back to school.

But huge numbers of people with four-year degrees going to technical college?

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker spoke about technical colleges when he was asked about unemployment during a TV interview that was broadcast Oct. 16, 2011. He told CW14 in Green Bay he had repeatedly heard employers say ""we have jobs, particularly good-paying manufacturing jobs, we just don’t have enough skilled workers, we don’t have enough people interested in those jobs.""

The Republican governor went on to say:

""In fact, the largest category of people coming into the technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees because the jobs that they’re looking for with their degrees aren’t there, and so instead they’re going back to school to get more technical training.""

Technical colleges have long been the next step for many students who have just finished high school and for experienced workers looking to upgrade their skills. So we wondered if those groups are now being outnumbered in Wisconsin’s technical schools by people with bachelor’s degrees.

That’s what Walker said -- but it apparently isn’t what he meant.

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie told us in an email:

""My understanding is that this quote was based on a conversation he had with tech college officials where they made a point to highlight the fact that one of the fastest growing enrollment demographics was individuals who have attended four-year colleges.""
  
That’s a far cry from Walker stated in the interview. He labeled college graduates the largest group entering technical schools.

So, let’s dig into the numbers.

Technical colleges are a key part of the discussion of how to attack unemployment in Wisconsin, where the jobless rate was 7.8 percent in September 2011, and at the national level. A few days after an October 2011 survey revealed that U.S. manufacturers lack qualified applicants for 600,000 skilled positions, the Wisconsin AFL-CIO cited the shortage and called on Walker to restore a 30 percent funding cut he made to technical colleges in the 2011-2013 state budget.

The number of college graduates, meanwhile, who applied to U.S. graduate schools rose 8.4 percent in 2010, according to a September 2011 report from the Council of Graduate Schools. So, are an increasing number of four-year graduates heading to technical college, too?

As of 2009, the number of four-year degree holders transferring into one of Wisconsin’s 16 technical colleges""had grown 30 percent in the last decade,"" according to a publication from the Wisconsin Technical College System.

But that statistic is a bit dated and it deals with whether that group is increasing. A small set of individuals can still show a large percentage increase. Moreover, Walker referred to four-year grads in relation to other groups.

So, we sought more information from Morna Foy, executive assistant and vice president of policy and government relations for the technical college system.

Foy said she believed Walker was trying to repeat a statement that she and other technical college system officials had made -- that a growing percentage of transfer students into the technical colleges are students who already have four-year degrees.

We asked her for a breakdown of transfer students who entered technical college in 2009, 2010 and 2011, to see if there were any trends. Foy emphasized that the 2011 figures were just being finalized, so Walker would not have been aware of them when he made his statement.

The figures show that students with four-year degrees -- more specifically, those who had completed 16 or more years of schooling -- made up 15 percent of the nearly 10,000 technical college transfer students in 2009. The rate increased to 16 percent in 2010.

So, based on figures that had been publicized when Walker did the TV interview, there was a     1-percentage-point increase between 2009 and 2010 in the number of people entering technical college who had four-year degrees. (The rate remained at 16 percent for 2011.)

But in each of the three years, the largest category of students transferring into the technical colleges each year remained those who had completed 12 years of schooling -- in other words, high school graduates.

High school graduates made up more than one-third of the transfer students each year, more than twice the level of four-year grads.

Our conclusion

Walker said ""the largest category of people coming into the technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees."" Walker’s spokesman said the governor actually meant to claim that an increasing number of people with four-year degrees are going to technical college.

Between 2009 and 2010, the percentage of college graduates entering technical college rose a bit. But high school graduates make up the largest category of transfer students in technical schools, far outnumbering those with college degrees.

Sayreville Mayor Kennedy O'Brien blasts Democrats' political ad
","
Building permits, secret meetings and big developers – oh my!

Sayreville voters should keep those concerns in mind, if a political mailer circulating in town – complete with marquee-style lettering and an exclamation point or two -- is to be believed.

""Since Mayor O’Brien took office Sayreville has issued 22,081 Building Permits! Now O’Brien is Holding Secret Meetings with Big Developers"" reads a large postcard mailed to residents in this small Middlesex County borough. The postcard shows a man attempting to climb a small mountain of paperwork – presumably applications to build in the borough. A large headshot of O’Brien, a Republican, is in the background. The postcard states that it’s paid for and authorized by the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. O'Brien is seeking re-election to a four-year term. His opponent is Democrat Stanley Drwal.

Although the ad doesn’t specifically state it, the inference from the ad is there’s a lot of building going on under O’Brien’s watch. And building can be a dirty verb in New Jersey. For some people, it means more children in schools, more government services needed and less open space – all costing more tax dollars.

PolitiFact New Jersey checked the claims in the ad and found that the number of building permits issued during O’Brien’s 11-year tenure as mayor is correct – but only about 5 percent of those were to construct homes. As for secret meetings? That depends on who’s asked.

""This is a personal attack,"" O’Brien said about the ad. ""It’s personal and it’s misleading. They must think the people of Sayreville are stupid. We only have about 11,000 homes in Sayreville.""

Actually, the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Fact Finder survey for 2010 shows Sayreville has 16,393 housing units. The Census Bureau defines a housing unit as ""a house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single room occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters,"" spokeswoman Stacey Gimbel Vidal said in an email.

An ad doesn’t have to make a specific statement for its intent to be clear, according to Dr. Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.

""When I look at things I try to look at the whole picture,"" Madonna said. ""What meaning are they trying to convey consciously and subconsciously?""

The Democratic State Committee sent an Open Public Records Act request to the borough on Sept. 20, seeking the number of building permits issued in Sayreville from Jan. 1, 2000 to Sept. 20, 2011. O'Brien became mayor in 2000.

Kirk Miick, the borough’s construction official and director of code enforcement, said he contacted the organization and asked if a breakdown was wanted of what the permits were for, and was told that just a total number of permits issued was needed.

Miick told PolitiFact New Jersey the borough issued 22,081 permits during the requested timeframe but noted that of those, about 1,240 were for new homes – single-family residences, condominiums and townhouses. Another 3,026 were for significant additions or modifications to existing houses, while the rest were permits for demolition work, pools, sheds, fences, warehouses, educational facilities and more.

Now, about those ""secret"" meetings.

Jason Springer, communications director for the Democratic State Committee, provided us with copies of news stories and a letter from the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office relating to a February 2010 incident in which O’Brien showed up at a meeting at the Woodbridge Hilton between Deborah Lee and Robert Kaye of the development firm PRC Group. Lee, an alternate on the Planning Board, was at the meeting as president of the Spinnaker Pointe Homeowners Association. When O’Brien showed up -- unexpectedly, according to Lee -- she asked that the discussion not include matters to be brought before the Planning Board.

A portion of the meeting recorded on tape was later found to have been deleted. The Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office investigated and determined that a crime had been committed – tampering with public records and information -- but had no suspects and closed the investigation without filing criminal charges. The prosecutor’s office then made a number of recommendations about better securing future recordings of public meetings.

O’Brien, who owns a sales and marketing agency, said the meeting was not held secretly. O’Brien said he travels frequently for work and often conducts borough business where a meeting is convenient – a practice he has done since he’s been mayor.

""If I can meet somebody at a restaurant I’ll meet them at a restaurant, I’ll meet them in a lobby of a hotel on a parkway -- wherever I am and wherever they are, I meet with them, at borough hall and all points in between,"" he said.

O’Brien said Councilwoman Lisa Eicher, a Democrat, filed an ethics complaint against him with the state Department of Community Affairs, regarding the meeting. We checked with the state for the status of the complaint.

""For reasons of confidentiality, we can neither confirm nor deny the receipt of an ethics complaint,"" DCA spokeswoman Lisa Ryan said in an email. ""Ethics complaints are only subject to public disclosure 30 days after mailing a notice of dismissal or a notice of violation to the individual named in a complaint and the complainant.""

We also asked Springer about evidence of other alleged secret meetings that O’Brien supposedly had, since the wording of the mailer indicates more than one, and that such meetings are continuing.

""If the Mayor told us he was holding additional secret meetings, they wouldn’t be very secret,"" Springer responded in an email. ""However, one has to assume so, otherwise why would someone go through such great lengths to erase evidence of the first meeting.""

Springer also questioned the appropriateness of doing borough business outside Sayreville.

""Meetings with a developer should take place in Borough Hall, not in a hotel in another town,"" he said.  ""The very nature of the meeting, with the surprise appearance of the Mayor was highly inappropriate.  And again, if there was nothing to the meeting, why would someone go through such great lengths to erase part of the recording?""

Our ruling

The Democratic State Committee sent a mailer to Sayreville residents stating more than 22,000 building permits had been issued in the borough during the incumbent mayor’s tenure, and accused him of having secret meetings with big developers. We confirmed that 22,081 permits were issued, but just 5 percent -- 1,240 -- of those were for new home construction. O’Brien says a complaint alleging that an out-of-town meeting he attended in February 2010 was unethical was filed with the state DCA, but the agency will neither confirm nor deny that. A spokesman for the Democrats admits assuming Kennedy is having other ""secret"" meetings, but there’s no proof of that allegation. Therefore, we rate this claim Mostly False.

Occupy Providence sign says Goldman Sachs CEO earns in an hour what minimum wage worker earns in a year
","
In downtown Providence, as in other cities around the globe, protesters inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement are trying to raise awareness about economic inequalities.

On a recent visit to Occupy Providence’s encampment at Burnside Park, a Providence Journal reporter spotted a hand-written sign that compared the earnings of a minimum wage worker with those of Goldman Sach’s CEO, Lloyd C. Blankfein.

The sign read: ""Minimum wage = $16,000/year CEO-Goldman Sachs (Lloyd Blankfein) $16,000/Hour.""

It goes without saying that Goldman’s CEO earns piles more money than most Americans, never mind Rhode Island’s minimum-wage workers.

Ever since the New York investment bank accepted a $10-billion government bailout during the financial crisis in 2008, Goldman Sachs has made national headlines for its super-sized executive compensation packages.

But we had our doubts about whether Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, actually earned in one hour what a minimum wage worker in Rhode Island earned in an entire year. So we decided to check it out.

The facts

The minimum wage in Rhode Island is $7.40 per hour, so simple math shows that someone who works 40 hours per week for 52 weeks (or 2,080 hours) will earn $15,392 a year. (The minimum wage was the same in 2010 as this year. Many minimum wage workers don’t get benefits, unlike CEOs. But we’ll get to that later.)

The protest sign said $16,000, which is pretty close.

But calculating the pay of chief executives is more complicated because a large share of their compensation is typically in the form of stock options, pension contributions and other non-cash payments.

In 2010, Goldman reported it paid Blankfein a salary of $600,000 plus a bonus of $5.4 million, for a total of $6 million, according to its 2011 proxy statement, the most recent available data.

That’s 375 times more than a minimum age worker would earn in Rhode Island. But it’s a mere $2,885 an hour, not $16,000. (We’re basing this calculation on a 40-hour work week.)

But wait, there’s more.

Besides his salary and bonus, the company reported that it gave Blankfein $12.6 million in restricted stock, boosting his annual compensation to $18.6 million. If he worked 40 hours per week, his hourly rate would amount to $8,942. And that’s without benefits.

Goldman also paid Blankfein $464,067 in 401(k) matching contributions, term life insurance premiums, medical and dental premium payments, long-term disability insurance premiums, life insurance premiums and perks such as his company car and driver.  

(The protesters might have mentioned that the $185,000 Goldman paid for Blankfein’s car and driver last year is more than 3½ times Rhode Island’s median household income in 2010.)

In all, Blankfein’s compensation in 2010 totaled  about $19.06 million.

But once again, simple math shows that the estimated cash value of his compensation that year is $9,165 an hour -- not $16,000 an hour as the protest sign declared.  

Our ruling

The Occupy Providence protest sign was close when it stated that the minimum wage in Rhode Island is $16,000 a year (it’s actually just under $15,400). And its point -- that CEOs such as Blankfein make enormous sums of money while people at the bottom of the economic ladder make almost nothing  -- is well taken. But the claim that Goldman Sachs’ CEO earned $16,000 an hour was way off.  We rate it False.

Joe Biden says murders and rapes increased in Flint, Mich., after the police force was reduced
","
Editor’s note: When we first examined this statement from Vice President Joe Biden, we rated his statement Mostly True. We noted in that report, published Oct. 20, 2011, that the numbers he gave for rapes seemed questionable. Shortly afterwards, we explained why our original report was at odds with other independent fact-checkers in a story, ""When fact-checkers disagree."" We also asked for reaction from readers. Since then, we found more definitive evidence that Biden's numbers on rape are wrong. We have re-reported this item and given it a new rating of Half True. We have also archived our original report with the Mostly True rating.

If Congress doesn’t pass President Barack Obama’s jobs plan, crimes like rape and murder will go up as cops are laid off, says Vice President Joe Biden.

It’s a stark talking point. But Biden hasn’t backed down in the face of challenges during the past week, citing crime statistics and saying, ""Look at the facts."" In a confrontation with a conservative blogger on Oct. 19, Biden snapped, ""Don’t screw around with me.""

We were intrigued by comments Biden made in Flint, Mich., on Oct. 12, 2011:

""In 2008, when Flint had 265 sworn officers on their police force, there were 35 murders and 91 rapes in this city.

""In 2010, when Flint had only 144 police officers, the murder rate climbed to 65, and rapes, just to pick two categories, climbed to 229.

""In 2011, you now only have 125 shields. God only knows what the numbers will be this year for Flint if we don't rectify it. And God only knows what that number would have been had we not been able to get a little bit of help to you.""

We looked at Biden’s crime numbers and turned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Statistics to confirm them. But the federal numbers aren’t the same as the numbers Biden cited. (Several of our readers did the same thing; we received several requests to check Biden’s numbers.)

What’s going on here? We asked Biden’s office, and they said they got the numbers from the city of Flint.

For the sake of clarity, we’ll look at the murder numbers first and then turn to the rape numbers.

Murders in Flint

Our research showed murders are an acknowledged problem in the city of Flint. The Flint Journal reported that murders in the city reached a historic high of 66 in 2010, with homicides happening so often that one officer deemed the city a ""killing field."" That same year, the city laid off 66 officers, bringing the total number to about 120.

In May 2011, Flint voters approved a tax renewal to prevent more layoffs. But they rejected a separate tax increase to fund the city jail. The jail has been shuttered since 2008.

When when we looked at the FBI’s crime statistics, we found that Flint reported 32 murders in 2008 and 53 murders in 2010. (The Michigan State Police reported the same numbers.) Biden said 35 and 65 -- not exactly the same, but in the ballpark.

After Biden’s remarks garnered attention, the city of Flint released a statement to several news organizations saying that the 2010 data reported to the FBI was incorrect, due to a clerical error, and that the number Biden used was accurate.

Rapes in Flint

For rapes, though, the numbers seemed seriously off. The FBI showed 103 rapes in 2008 and 92 rapes in 2010 -- a small decline. The numbers Biden cited were 91 rapes in 2008 and 229 in 2010 -- a dramatic increase.

At first, we wondered if the differences were the result of the FBI’s more restrictive reporting requirements for what constitutes rape. The FBI definition -- ""the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will"" -- is particularly restrictive, excluding male victims and other types of sexual assaults. (The New York Times recently published a detailed report on the problems of the rape definition.)

However, it now seems clear that numbers the city of Flint gave Biden were wrong, that someone in the city used numbers for rape alone in 2008 but all categories of criminal sexual misconduct in 2010. (Our friends at Factcheck.org noted this discrepancy in several of their ongoing reports on the topic.)

We checked numbers for rape with the Michigan State Police. They found that the Flint Police Department reported that rape, using the most restrictive definition, declined from 108 in 2008 to 92 in 2010. The state police also provided us numbers reported by the Flint Police Department for all sexual crimes, and those too declined, from 262 incidents in 2008 to 219 incidents in 2010.

We should note that the city of Flint e-mailed us one statement in defense of the numbers Biden used. But the city’s spokesperson has not answered repeated phone calls and e-mails from PolitiFact to further explain discrepancies.

Do more police officers mean less crime?

So Biden is largely correct on murder in Flint going up, but wrong about the increase in rapes.

Still, how would Obama’s jobs bill increase the number of police? It does not directly fund police positions. Rather, it sends additional money to the states, primarily for education. Biden is likely making the assumption that additional money in one area could prevent layoffs in another, as many states are required to balance their budget on an annual or biannual basis.

Then there’s the question of whether fewer cops equals more crime.

Generally speaking, most of the evidence we reviewed said that the number of police is one factor among several in preventing crime.

James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said he agreed with Biden’s general point. The primary problem with reducing force strength is that there are fewer officers to staff special units that target a community’s particular problems, such as gangs or sexual assaults, he said.

Large-scale reductions like Flint’s are particularly problematic, because rebuilding a force when the economy improves will take time, according to Fox.

""It’s not like a light switch you can turn off and on,"" he said, because it takes so much time to hire and train new officers. ""I’m always concerned when police force numbers are cut drastically. In the long run, it’s very problematic.""

We then turned to the peer-reviewed literature to see if social scientists have been able to isolate the effect of the size of the police force on crime. We found several recent studies concluded more police did reduce crime. But we also found at least one study that questioned the previous research, saying they did not control for other factors, such as public intolerance of crime.

Our ruling

Biden cited statistics saying that as Flint reduced its police force, the number of murders and rapes increased significantly. We find good evidence that the number of murders increased, but the number of rapes actually declined.

Experts we spoke with and research we reviewed suggest that police force size has some bearing on crime but that it is only one of several factors.

In ruling on Biden’s statement, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/25/joe-biden/update-joe-biden-says-murders-and-rapes-increased/

Blog post says GOP has sponsored ""zero"" job creation bills
","
A reader recently sent us a post circulating on Facebook and on blogs that blames the House Republican majority for focusing their legislation on lots of topics -- except for job creation. Here’s the text of the chart:

""The numbers: Republicans have introduced 44 bills on abortion, 99 on religion, 71 on family relationships, 36 on marriage, 67 on firearms/gun control, 522 on taxation, 445 on ‘government investigations,’ and zero on job creation.""

It cites as its source a post on the liberal website Daily Kos written on Oct. 21, 2011, by Minnesota-based blogger and self-described ""unrepentant liberal"" Myles Spicer,

""Given that these Representatives were elected to pass job creation bills so needed by our country, what has the House been doing this past year?"" Spicer asked in his post. ""Well, mostly they have occupied themselves with a variety of social, moral and value issues. ... The Congressional Research Service (CRS, a non-partisan arm of Congress that tracks such things) offers an appalling look at our current Congress’ activities.

""They have introduced 44 bills on abortion (one just the other day reaffirming existing legislation on this subject). 99 on religion. 71 on family relationships. 36 on marriage. 67 on firearms and gun control. 552 on taxation—and though most were to reduce taxes, there have been no significant changes on tax law with all time invested and bills introduced. And finally a massive 445 bills on ‘government investigations.’ There is a category labeled ‘job creation legislation’ originated by Congress, and tracked by the CRS. In that category the CRS reported: ‘No bills at this time. The Congressional Research Service has not tagged any bills in the current session of Congress with this issue area.’  If ever the analogy of ‘rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic’ was apt, this is it!""

We wondered about the accuracy of the post based on Spicer’s argument, so we took a look.

We didn’t find anything about legislative subject headings at CRS’ own website, but we did find a list of subjects for current legislation at THOMAS, the legislative-tracking website run by the Library of Congress.

Using THOMAS, you can search bills that have been offered during the current Congress -- the 112th -- by their CRS subject matter. The list of subject areas begins in alphabetical order here.

When comparing the numbers, we allowed for some variation due to the list being continuously updated as new bills are introduced. That said, we found that the numbers in the Internet post were quite close to what was listed in THOMAS for abortion, religion, family relationships, marriage, firearms, taxation and government investigations.

What about ""job creation""? As it turned out, we couldn’t find a topic area by that name at all.

We located Spicer and asked him for his sourcing. He told us he had used the website opencongress.org, a non-profit, non-partisan database of legislative and other congressional data. He pointed us to this page, where a category of bills categorized under ""job creation"" is listed. ""Job creation"" had zero entries.

We quickly noticed two things about the database. First, the numbers cited on opencongress.org for the social issues and other topics in the chart were close to what THOMAS had -- in other words, they closely followed the CRS subject headings. And second, ""job creation"" was only one of many, many topics that had zero bills associated with it in the opencongress.org database.

We reached David Moore, executive director of the Participatory Politics Foundation, which runs opencongress.org. He said that his website displays not only CRS issue labels used for bills pending in the current Congress but also labels that have been used at least once in the past three Congresses, even if none have been applied yet to bills in the 112th Congress.

By Moore’s count, opencongress.org includes 4,795 issue areas in all. But only a fraction of these subject headings have any bills listed under them, because CRS has not tagged any bills with those headings during the current Congress.

We did not hear back from CRS or THOMAS, so we don’t know why CRS has used the ""job creation"" label in the past but not this year.

However, our research suggests that the lack of bills labeled ""job creation"" this year doesn't mean there have been no bills aimed at promoting employment introduced in the current Congress.

Why? The House version of President Barack Obama’s American Jobs Act -- which we’re sure the president and his supporters would characterize as a ""job creation"" bill -- doesn’t even get slapped with that subject heading.

The bill -- officially H.R. 12, introduced on Sept. 21, 2011, by Rep. John Larson, D-Conn. -- is listed under no fewer than 68 separate subject headings, including ""aviation and airports,"" ""Buy American requirements,"" ""electric power generation and transmission,"" ""Internet and video services,"" ""metals,"" ""solid waste and recycling"" and ""water use and supply.""

But it doesn’t carry the label ""job creation.""

Instead, several closely related subjects have been applied to H.R. 12, including ""economic development,"" ""economic performance and conditions,"" ""employee hiring,"" ""employment and training programs,"" ""labor and employment,"" ""unemployment"" and ""wages and earnings.""

And how many bills have been introduced under these other headings? Here’s the list. (Some bills may be included in more than one category.)

Economic development: 64 bills
Economic performance and conditions: 55 bills
Employee hiring: 24 bills
Employment and training programs: 172 bills
Labor and employment: 151 bills
Unemployment: 107 bills
Wages and earnings: 143 bills

In reality, then, six of these seven jobs-related categories included more bills than either abortion or marriage, and four of the seven included more bills than religion, family relationships or firearms.

We see a few additional problems with the post.

It’s wrong to say that only Republicans sponsored bills on social issues, taxation and government investigations.

For every legislative subject cited in the ad, the THOMAS list includes bills introduced both by Republicans and Democrats. We checked each topic area to make sure that Democrats had offered bills on those topics, and in each case, they did. So it’s wrong for the post to say that ""Republicans have introduced"" that many bills. Both parties have. (Spicer, to his credit, did not make this mistake; the creator of the subsequent post did. ""When I state that these folks were elected to get us more jobs, I did not exclude the Democrats,"" Spicer told PolitiFact.)

It’s wrong to point to this data as evidence that Republicans are going hog wild on ""government investigations.""

To be sure, Republicans are using their control of House committees to probe government operations, including potential corruption and scandals. (The Democrats did the same after 2006 when they controlled Congress and George W. Bush was in the White House.) But it’s wrong to suggest that the 445 ""government investigation"" bills amount to evidence in support of this tendency.

Most of the bills tagged with this category are there because they contain some sort of oversight mechanism, such as defining who will oversee a newly created federal program and how. So most of these bills involve run-of-the-mill government oversight mechanisms, not an effort to gin up high-profile administration scandals.

Keep in mind that these categories are very broad.

Labeling a bill with a subject category doesn’t mean the bill is primarily about that issue. For instance, a very, very large number of congressional bills have some impact on the tax code, even if it’s tangential. That’s why so many bills get categorized as being tax-related.

To one degree or another for the other, this pattern holds for subject headings, too. The ""religion"" category doesn’t just include bills of interest to conservative Christians, as someone reading the post might assume. It also includes the ""Noose Hate Crime Act of 2011,"" sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas and the ""Veterans, Women, Families with Children, and Persons With Disabilities Housing Fairness Act of 2011,"" sponsored by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas.

""Job creation"" means different things to different parties.

Most conservatives today are dead-set against traditional forms of government-based economic stimulus known as Keynesian economics, primarily spending initiatives. So if ""job creation"" is defined to primarily include Keynesian initiatives, then Republicans aren’t going to be sponsoring any ""job creation"" bills. Instead, Republicans argue that tax cuts and budget cutting will help the economy prosper.

Our ruling

While congressional Republicans have certainly introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, the  claim that the GOP has focused on issues other than job creation just isn't supported. The numbers cited in the post include Democratic bills, and the definition of what constitutes a ""job creation"" bill is open to significant debate.

But the post’s most important flaw is the contention that Republicans have offered ""zero"" bills on job creation. This number stems from a methodology that also excludes Obama’s American Jobs Act from the category of ""job creation"" bills. If  you look at alternative job-related subject headings, the number of bills offered by lawmakers from both parties actually exceeds most of the social-issues listed in the blog post.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/oct/25/facebook-posts/blog-post-says-gop-has-sponsored-zero-job-creation/

Paul: Herman Cain called Federal Reserve critics ""ignorant""
","
The New Hampshire Republican presidential primary debate gave voters a glimpse into a bitter feud between what some might consider unlikely political foes: Texas Congressman Ron Paul and Atlanta-area businessman Herman Cain.

Moderators gave each candidate one chance to pose a single question to any one of his or her opponents. Paul used his turn to attack Cain.

The former Godfather’s Pizza CEO ""belittled"" him and his followers, who want the Federal Reserve to undergo a major audit, Paul said.

""You said -- you've used pretty strong terms -- that we were ignorant and that we didn't know what we were doing, and therefore there is no need for an audit anyway because if you had one you're not going to find out everything because everybody knows everything about the Fed,"" Paul said during the Oct. 11 debate at Dartmouth College.

""I did not call you or any of your people ‘ignorant,"" Cain fired back. ""I don't know where that came from.""

Did too, Paul shot back: ""I’ll get it for you.""

Paul’s supporters rose to the challenge. Within hours after the debate’s end, the Internet swirled with what they said was proof that Cain called them ""ignorant.""

Cain’s denial caught our attention. Did Cain really call Paul and his followers ""ignorant""?

The Fed is a touchy issue among many Republicans, especially Paul supporters, who think it conducts too much business behind closed doors. Congress created the central bank of the United States to give the nation a more stable financial system, but Paul thinks the Fed brought about the current economic troubles through backroom dealings and bad policy. He wants the organization audited and abolished.

Paul and Cain both consider themselves strict Constitutionalists and enemies of big government, but Cain is a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. For Paul supporters, that’s like having a giant bull’s-eye painted on your back.

Even before Cain announced his run for president, Paul supporters were dogging him at campaign stops, asking him to back a full audit of the Fed. (Cain’s position on auditing the Federal Reserve is the subject of a separate PolitiFact item.)

We contacted Paul’s camp so it could give us its best evidence against Cain, but it didn’t get back to us. In its absence, we sifted through news accounts, news databases, Internet videos and websites where backers posted what they called key evidence of Cain’s name-calling.

We found that Cain isn’t shy about his disdain for Paul’s criticisms. He’s not above calling someone ignorant, either. Last month, he said President Barack Obama showed ""ignorance of basic economics.""

But we found no record that Cain ever called Paul or his backers ""ignorant.""

Bloggers and news accounts repeatedly referred to two sources as proof against Cain: his recently released book ""This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House"" and a 2010 clip from Neal Boortz’s radio show. Cain frequently subbed in for Boortz when he was a talk show host on radio AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB

Let’s take a look at the book. Near the end of the chapter ""The Cain Doctrine,"" Cain wrote that Paul supporters stretch the truth whenever they attend his appearances and say he does not want an audit of the Federal Reserve.  

Instead of calling Paul backers ""ignorant,"" Cain wrote this: ""I get the same stupid question at almost every one of these events. I know it’s a deliberate strategy. How can a person randomly show up at a hundred events and ask the same stupid question to try to nail me on the Federal Reserve? ""

And this: ""But I’ve got news for the Paulites: It’s not going to work, because the American people are a lot smarter than they are.""

Cain did call some people stupid, but not Paul’s supporters: ""[T]here are stupid people out there -- the people who are running this country, and I’m worried about them,"" Cain wrote.

Now for Cain’s radio statement, which Paul backers posted online.

""I think a lot of people are calling for this audit of the Federal Reserve because they don’t know enough about it,"" Cain said, according to their online post. ""There’s no hidden secrets going on in the Federal Reserve to my knowledge.""

Once again, Cain did not use the word ""ignorant."" He did say backers of a Fed audit need to understand the bank better.

How do we rule?

Cain said plenty of disparaging things about Paul’s backers. He called their questions ""stupid."" He said Fed audit backers ""don’t know enough about it.""  He said the American people are are ""a lot smarter than they are.""

You could even say that Cain ""belittled"" Paul’s followers, as the Texan claimed during the debate.

But Paul was very specific that one of the ""strong terms"" Cain used against his backers was the word ""ignorant."" Paul said he’d produce proof, but neither he nor his supporters have done so. We couldn’t find any, either.

Repeatedly debunked idea of “shedding” COVID-19 vaccines is still false
","In the spring, claims began spreading widely that vaccinated people can ""shed"" the COVID-19 vaccine and harm those around them. Now, six months later, those false claims have come full circle. A viral Oct. 27 blog post reads, ""Pfizer Confirms COVID-Vaccinated People Can ‘Shed’ Spike Proteins And Harm The Unvaccinated."" The claim can be traced to an April press release, when the hoax about vaccine shedding was proliferating. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) People vaccinated against COVID-19 cannot shed spike proteins to harm anyone. Many experts have debunked this notion, saying it is a conspiracy intended to undermine the vaccines. Experts also have said that the spike proteins produced through vaccination cannot infect others.  The blog post says its source is a June 26 article from National Times Australia. That article, in turn, cites a May 4 post on Christians For Truth, which then references the ultimate source of the false information: an April 26 press release from America’s Frontline Doctors. That group has spread misinformation and conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. In April, when America’s Frontline Doctors issued the press release, claims about vaccine shedding had emerged as a prevailing narrative in the anti-vaccine community, PolitiFact reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that vaccine shedding ""can only occur when a vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus,"" and none of the COVID-19 vaccines in use in the United States meet that description. Other vaccines, such as measles and flu, use a piece or weakened version of the germ that is being vaccinated against. The spike proteins referenced in the claim occur in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which use mRNA technology. The CDC explains that mRNA vaccines work like this: The vaccine sends instructions to the body’s cells to make a piece of spike protein, which is also found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. The cells make and display the protein, and ""our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it."" The resulting immune response produces antibodies. The spike proteins are harmless, do not cause illness and do not last long in the body. The claim also says that ""Pfizer confirmed"" that people can shed spike proteins, which is unsubstantiated. This part of the claim appears to have originated with an April 29 tweet from Dr. Simone Gold, the founder of America’s Frontline Doctors who also was arrested for actions stemming from her participation in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Gold’s tweet says ""Pfizer trials warned men to stay away from pregnant women,"" referencing part of Pfizer’s trial protocol that explains when an ""environmental vaccine exposure"" during pregnancy is considered to have taken place. PolitiFact reported that the passage in the protocol ""is described by experts as standard language meant to widely cover any possible exposures. …(E)xposure to a person who has received the Pfizer vaccine will not transmit virus particles."" A blog post claims, ""Pfizer Confirms COVID-Vaccinated People Can ‘Shed’ Spike Proteins And Harm The Unvaccinated."" People vaccinated against COVID-19 cannot shed spike proteins, and spike proteins produced through vaccination cannot infect others. Vaccine shedding is not possible with the COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. Pfizer did not confirm that people can shed spike proteins. That claim is based on a misinterpretation of the company’s clinical trial protocol. We rate this claim False.   ",/factchecks/2021/nov/08/blog-posting/repeatedly-debunked-idea-shedding-covid-19-vaccine/

No lie: COVID-19 is largely spread by unvaccinated people.
","NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers kicked off quite the social media stir after he tested positive for COVID-19 Nov. 3 and then went on a sports talk show two days later to discuss it. Rodgers began sharing some falsehoods about vaccines during an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" Nov. 5 — and one statement in particular had us doing the discount double fact-check.  ""This idea that it’s a pandemic of the unvaccinated, it’s just a total lie,"" Rodgers said, mentioning that he knew of many vaccinated people who had gotten sick with the virus. ""If the vaccine is so great then how come people are still getting COVID and spreading COVID and unfortunately dying from COVID?"" The 37-year-old Green Bay Packer revealed that he chose an alternative treatment against COVID-19 instead of getting vaccinated, because he has an allergy to an ingredient in the mRNA vaccines, and was hesitant about the safety of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after its use was briefly halted in April due to concern about blood clots.  Vaccinated people can get COVID-19 — but unvaccinated people are far more likely to catch and spread the virus, and are at a higher risk of being hospitalized or dying. Here’s what the evidence shows. First, it’s important to note that the coronavirus spread widely in the spring and fall of 2020, before vaccines were widely available — in other words, the virus took root among unvaccinated people. By the time the first COVID-19 vaccine was approved and distributed for emergency use in the United States in December 2020, the total number of cases in the country had spiked higher than 17.2 million, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.  The delta variant began spreading quickly in the U.S. in mid-2021, at a time when vaccination rates were rising. But in a previous fact check, Dr. Daniel B. Fagbuyi, emergency room physician and former Obama administration appointee to the National Biodefense Science Board, disputed a claim that vaccinated people were the ones responsible for spreading the COVID-19 variants. ""If that were the case, based on all the other (COVID-19) cases, we wouldn’t have seen all these variants before we got the vaccines,"" Fagbuyi said.  The alpha, beta and gamma variants were found first in unvaccinated populations. And Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, pointed out that the delta variant was first detected in India, which was largely unvaccinated at the time.  Now that the vaccines are available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in a recent study that unvaccinated participants who had prior infection were over five times more likely to catch COVID-19 than fully vaccinated participants, and another study showed that unvaccinated people are over 10 times more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19.  Vaccinated people can still catch COVID-19 — no vaccine is perfect — but they contract it at a much lower rate. A New York Times analysis found that a vaccinated American’s odds of getting a breakthrough case of COVID-19 is 1-in-5,000 a day. We reported in September that it could be even lower than that — according to a calculation of CDC data, the chances were about 1-in-5,000 per week, or about 1-in-35,000 per day.  Another answer to Rodgers’ question about breakthrough infections: Some vaccinated people can still be at risk of getting severe cases of COVID-19 because they have immune system deficiencies that may limit the vaccines’ effectiveness. Fewer than 3% of Americans are immunocompromised, and the CDC says that they ""may not build the same level of immunity to 2-dose vaccine series compared to people who are not immunocompromised."" The CDC recommends that people with moderate to severe immunodeficiency receive a third dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Gen. Colin Powell’s recent death was one such case. Powell had been fully vaccinated with both doses of the Pfizer vaccine, but was 84 years old and had battled Parkinson’s disease and multiple myeloma. He became sick before he could receive his third dose. We reached out to Rodgers through the Green Bay Packers, but a team spokesperson told PolitiFact that Rodgers is still on the reserve list as he recovers from COVID-19 and is not yet available to talk to the media.  NFL QB Aaron Rodgers just said there are no long-term studies of COVID-19 vaccines and fertility issues. He’s wrong. ##aaronrodgers ##covid19 ##vaccine   Rodgers claimed that the idea that the pandemic being one of the unvaccinated is a ""total lie.""  The virus started and spread among unvaccinated people before vaccines were developed and rolled out, and COVID-19 variants like the delta variant were first detected among populations that were unvaccinated.  Vaccinated people can catch COVID-19, but at much lower rates than those who are unvaccinated. They are even less likely to be hospitalized or die from the virus. Fewer than 3% of people in the U.S. have immune system deficiencies, which puts them at a higher risk of catching COVID-19. The CDC recommends that people with moderate to severe immunodeficiencies get a third dose of the vaccine to build up immunity. We rate Rodgers’ claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/nov/08/aaron-rodgers/no-lie-covid-19-largely-spread-unvaccinated-people/

Mark Robinson mostly wrong about how NC Attorney General treated protestors
","North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is accusing the state’s top prosecutor of doing his job in bad faith. Robinson took aim at North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein during an interview with conservative pundits Diamond and Silk. Robinson told them he follows his ""religious convictions,"" and claimed that Democrats such as Gov. Roy Cooper follow their ""political convictions."" ""It's the same way with our attorney general,"" Robinson said around the 10-minute mark of this video, adding:  ""His deeply held political convictions cause him to go after his political enemies, who he believes committed the acts on January 6th. Meanwhile, those folks here in Raleigh and Winston who were committing acts of terrorism on our streets a couple summers ago, he’s said nothing about it and was derelict in his duty in prosecuting any of those people."" Robinson, a Republican, has said he’s 95% sure he’ll run for governor in 2024. Stein is expected to run for governor on the Democratic side. Some of Robinson’s statements could benefit from more clarity. But his office didn’t return calls or emails from PolitiFact North Carolina. Nonetheless, it’s clear that Robinson is accusing Stein of pursuing some people who commit violence while failing to speak out or even prosecute others who commit violence. Not only does Robinson get some facts wrong, he misrepresents the extent of the attorney general’s power. Let’s go over the various parts of his claim. Shortly after protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, the Federal Bureau of Investigation asked for the public’s assistance ""in identifying individuals who made unlawful entry into the U.S. Capitol building and committed various other alleged criminal violations."" Robinson said Stein decided to ""go after"" the people who stormed the Capitol. That’s not exactly right.  Stein invited people who might recognize Jan. 6 protestors in media coverage to report information to the attorney general’s office. ""Our office received a number of calls from North Carolinians who wanted to share their opinion and/or tips about the Jan. 6 insurrection,"" spokeswoman Laura Brewer told PolitiFact NC in an email. Then, as vice president of the National Association of Attorneys General, Stein signed a letter to Acting U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen stating that he and other attorneys generals would ""continue to do our part to repair the damage done to institutions and build a more perfect union."" More than 650 people face federal charges in connection with the Capitol breach on Jan. 6. As a state attorney, Stein wouldn’t be involved in actually prosecuting those federal cases. The attorney general’s office merely ""referred the tips we received to the FBI,"" spokesperson Nazneed Ahmed said. Ahmed emailed a statement from Stein, who says he viewed helping the FBI as an effort to protect the country’s laws. ""The insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol not only destroyed property and defiled the most important building in our democracy, they tried to overturn an election,"" Stein’s statement to PolitiFact NC said. ""We cannot allow those who promote the big lie to cover up what happened and its profound implications for American democracy."" Robinson referred to people ""who were committing acts of terrorism on our streets a couple summers ago."" He was likely referring to violence that broke out in late May 2020 as people protested a Minnesota police officer’s murder of George Floyd. Robinson claimed that Stein ""said nothing"" about that violence. That’s inaccurate. Stein released a statement about the protests, which he posted on Facebook on June 1. While Stein recognized the harms of systemic racism, he also condemned violence. ""The overwhelming majority of protesters are protesting because they want things to get better – and they’re prepared to work to make it so,"" Stein’s 2020 statement said. ""Others are exploiting these moments for their own agenda, forcing many already struggling small businesses to bear the cost. That is unacceptable and wrongdoers should be held accountable, but it will not distract from the work we have to do to heal our nation."" Robinson said Stein has been ""derelict in his duty in prosecuting any of those people."" That also appears to be inaccurate. Stein’s office says state law blocks the attorney general from prosecuting local charges unless the case is referred to the attorney general’s office by a local district attorney. And Ahmed said Stein hasn’t received any such requests. ""The Attorney General may not, absent an invitation from a district attorney, prosecute a person or entity for a state law crime in the state’s trial courts,"" according to Shea Riggsbee Denning, director of the North Carolina Judicial College at UNC.  That interpretation is backed-up by the state Supreme Court, Denning told PolitiFact NC in an email. She wrote about the case in 2018. ""The Supreme Court explained in State v. Camacho, 329 N.C. 589 (1991), that the elected district attorney has exclusive discretion and authority to determine whether to permit the prosecution of any case by the special prosecution division of the attorney general’s office,"" she said. Robinson said Stein decided to ""go after his political enemies"" who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, but has ""said nothing"" about violent protesters ""and has been derelict in his duty in prosecuting any of those people."" Robinson embellished Stein’s role in finding people who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. The attorney general’s office, which doesn’t have jurisdiction to prosecute federal charges, merely collected and relayed tips to the FBI. Robinson is wrong about Stein staying ""silent"" about violent protests in North Carolina. He released a statement in June. He also appears to be wrong about Stein being ""derelict in his duty"" to prosecute violent protesters. Stein’s office says it hasn’t received a request to participate in a local case, which it would legally need in order to get involved. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

A post linking Astroworld tragedy to COVID-19 vaccines and graphene oxide is false
","Investigators are still looking into what caused the crowd surge at Houston’s Astroworld music festival that killed eight people and injured dozens more during a performance by rapper Travis Scott. Some people on social media claim to have an explanation: the COVID-19 vaccines. ""WHAT HAPPENED AT THE TRAVIS SCOTT CONCERT?"" one Facebook post begins. ""They’re practicing!! Once they put graphene oxide in you, all they have to do is TUNE THE FREQUENCY!! The post goes on to say that a material called graphene oxide can ""destroy consciousness"" and control people through magnetic frequencies, which includes music.  ""They will turn people into zombies, literally … As others have said, this is a test run on the vaxxed,"" it concludes. There’s no evidence to suggest graphene oxide can literally turn people into zombies. But there’s a bigger problem with the theory: None of the vaccines contain graphene oxide.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Graphene-family materials have an array of uses in biotechnology, and there’s evidence that the compound can be toxic in certain circumstances. But claims that the COVID-19 vaccines contain the substance have proven untrue. We previously fact-checked a claim that falsely said graphene oxide — a material made by the oxidation of graphite — was used in Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. A company spokesperson told us that the material is used in some vaccines, but none by Pfizer. None of the listed ingredients is another name for graphene oxide, and the material doesn’t appear in ingredient lists for the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines.  Ron Mertens, founder and CEO of Graphene-Info.com, a graphene news website, said graphene oxide is ""not magnetic and not a conductive material, so it cannot be used in the ways people suggest in such videos."" Full Fact, a fact-checking organization in the United Kingdom, reported that the rumors about graphene oxide in vaccines appear to have originated with a Spanish study from June 2021. The report claimed that, using a microscopic technique, a solution created from a vial of Pfizer’s vaccine was observed to be similar in form to graphene oxide.  But the study hasn’t been published in a journal or peer-reviewed, and it offers no conclusive evidence. It’s not even clear that the vial being tested contained a legitimate vaccine sample. Fact-checkers at Health Feedback reported that the person who sent the vial to the researcher has been known to spread anti-vaccine content.  A Facebook post claims the AstroWorld concert was a ""test run on the vaxxed"" because people who are injected with graphene oxide can be controlled through magnetic frequencies, including music. The vaccines don’t contain graphene oxide.  We rate this False. ",/factchecks/2021/nov/08/facebook-posts/post-linking-astroworld-tragedy-covid-19-vaccines-/

Claim that COVID-19 vaccinated in UK are developing immunity problems is false
","An article citing United Kingdom government reports raises alarms about the risk of AIDS, falsely claiming that COVID-19 vaccinations are degrading people’s immune systems. The article, by an author identified only as ""a concerned reader,"" appeared on a website called The Exposé, which describes itself as an alternative to the U.K. government-owned BBC and ""lying"" mainstream media. ""UK Government reports suggest the Fully Vaccinated are rapidly developing Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,"" read the first part of the headline.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Oct. 30 article began with claims that reports on COVID-19 cases show that ""double-vaccinated 40- to 79-year-olds have now lost lost 50% of their immune system capability,"" and that 30- to 49-year-olds ""will have zero COVID / viral defense at best, or a form of vaccine mediated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome at worst, by the first week in January."" The article adds: ""Everybody over 30 will have lost 100% of their entire immune capability, certainly for COVID and most likely for viruses and certain cancers….Fully vaccinated 30- to 49-year-olds will have lost it by the first week in January. These people will then have no immune defence against Covid-19 at all."" A spokesperson for the UK Health Security Agency dismissed the claim, saying: ""COVID-19 vaccines do not cause AIDS."" We found no evidence to support the claim that the vaccines weaken, let alone destroy, the body’s immune system.  Here’s what the latest Surveillance Report from the agency says about the vaccines’ effectiveness in the U.K., which administers vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca: After a two-dose course, the vaccines are 65% to 90% effective in preventing symptomatic disease from the Delta variant, and 90% to 99% effective against hospitalization.  Rates of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death are substantially higher among unvaccinated people than among vaccinated people. The effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing certain outcomes may wane over a period of several months. But the report contains no indication that the vaccines degrade the immune system overall. Research in the U.S. — which uses vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — similarly shows that the vaccines do not degrade the immune system.  Earlier in October, we rated False a claim that a person’s immune system ""tanks"" after their second COVID-19 vaccine dose. On the contrary, we found that research from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others show that the vaccines boost the body’s immune response. For example, one Aug. 13 CDC report found that people who had been infected with COVID-19 in 2020 got a dramatic boost in virus-killing immune cells later because they were vaccinated. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told PolitiFact that the suggestion that the immune system is weakened by the COVID-19 shots rather than bolstered by them isn’t supported by clinical trial data, which includes thousands of people. ""This wasn't observed in any of the phase 3 trials, where complete blood counts were obtained,"" he said. Other fact-checks reached the same conclusion. The Associated Press rated false a claim that a study from the Francis Crick Institute in London found that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine destroys a type of white blood cell called the T cell and weakens the immune system.  The AP found that the vaccine doesn’t destroy T cells or weaken the immune system. On the contrary, it generates a strong T cell response and boosts immunity, according to experts. Health Feedback also found no evidence to back the claim that COVID-19 vaccines weaken the immune system.  A claim that U.K. ""government reports suggest the fully vaccinated are rapidly developing Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"" has no factual basis.

No, the virus that causes COVID-19 is not a patented bioweapon
","An image shared on Facebook makes a disturbing claim about the virus that causes COVID-19: it is actually not a virus but a patented biological weapon, an astonishing fact affirmed by a top court in Europe. ""Spain is now the 9th country to take its health minister to court and win,"" the post says. ""The Spanish High Court announced the COVID-19 is a bio weapon with a patent, not a virus."" The post, shared more than 11,200 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) None of what the post says is true. The image shared on Facebook is just the last link in a long chain of misinformation. When asked for a source, the author of the post shared a link to an article on the website VicGeorge.net, which also includes content on the Deep State, reptilians, and the 9/11 attacks. But the article is sourced from two BitChute videos by Charlie Ward and David Mahoney, who have promoted the QAnon conspiracy in the past. And their videos reference yet another source, a news clip produced by what appears to be a Spanish TV station. The VicGeorge.net article presents the most structured description of the false claim. It says that Spain’s supreme court asked the country’s health minister to provide evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 actually exists. It claims that the minister did not attend the hearing and instead ""sent a letter explaining that NO EVIDENCE for the virus’s existence can be found.""  The article goes on to say that whatever is causing COVID-19 was actually manufactured in a laboratory and was patented ""years ago."" This is a distortion of events that happened in Spain earlier this year, according to Spanish fact-checking website Newtral.  In July 2021, Spain’s ministry of health received a request for information about the virus from a citizen. In September 2021, it answered the questions in the request, including one asking if the ministry had samples of the virus for testing. The ministry said it did not have them. Ward and Mahoney claimed in their BitChute videos that this failure to provide the samples means that SARS-CoV-2 does not exist as a virus. That baseless assumption ignores other explanations for why the agency did not provide a sample of the virus. Spain’s ministry of science told Newtral that laboratories in Spain have previously isolated SARS-CoV-2, a procedure that has been happening in laboratories around the world for two years now. According to the World Health Organization, China first isolated the virus in January 2020, and SARS-CoV-2 has since been isolated in the US, Canada, Germany, and Australia, proving that it does exist as a virus. The claim that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a laboratory is harder to verify, because we still do not know with certainty how the pandemic started. Earlier this year, U.S. intelligence agencies spent three months investigating the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19 and looked into the two most popular theories about how it emerged: that it came from an infected animal and that it appeared after an accident in a laboratory. ""After examining all available intelligence reporting and other information,"" the agencies remained divided, the declassified final report said, stating that both hypotheses were ""plausible."" A lack of evidence, in part due to a lack of collaboration from China, made it hard for the agencies to say with complete certainty which theory was right. But in the same report, which was made public on Oct. 29, the agencies said that SARS-CoV-2 was not developed by China as a biological weapon. They are skeptical of these theories ""because they are supported by scientifically invalid claims,"" because their proponents do not have access to key sites like China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, and ""because their proponents are suspected of spreading disinformation."" The agencies also said that Chinese officials were unaware of the existence of the virus before the beginning of the pandemic. Finally, the claim that the virus was patented derives from a misreading of documents, according to fact-checkers at Reuters. Reuters examined a video that claimed to show two patents for SARS-CoV-2 filed in 2004 and 2015 — proof that the virus had been known well before the pandemic started in 2019, and had somehow been kept hidden in a secret plot. But as reported by Reuters, and as can be seen in the patents here and here, the documents actually refer to SARS-CoV, the older virus that causes SARS and a member of the family of coronaviruses that also includes SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.  Similar patents have been used to spread misinformation before, according to the Office for Science and Society at McGill University in Canada. The Facebook post claimed that Spain’s supreme court announced that COVID-19 is a patented biological weapon. This inaccurate claim is based on a distortion of events that took place in Spain. The country’s highest court said no such thing. The post lacks evidence for its claim that the Chinese created the virus that causes COVID-19 as a bioweapon, and there was no patent for the virus before the pandemic started.  We rate the post False.",/factchecks/2021/nov/05/facebook-posts/no-virus-causes-covid-19-not-patented-bioweapon/

Meme about the glacial change since Al Gore was born is still wrong
","Before the United Nations global climate summit kicked off on Nov. 29, an old meme starring climate activist and former Vice President Al Gore started to spread again online.  ""The day Al Gore was born there were 130,000 glaciers on Earth,"" the post says. ""Today, only 130,000 remain.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We fact-checked this back in 2019. It was wrong then, and it’s wrong now.  First, know that the standards for what qualifies as a glacier — a body of snow and ice that’s big enough in size and mass to move under its own weight — are not universal. The U.S. Geological Survey defines them ""according to the commonly accepted guidelines in which a body of ice has an area of at least 0.1 kilometers squared, or about 25 acres.""  William Colgan, a senior researcher with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told PolitiFact in 2019 that the emerging global standard for defining a glacier is a minimum of 1 hectare, or 100 by 100 meters. That’s about 2.5 acres, or roughly equivalent to the grassy area inside a 400-meter running track.   How many of those were there in 1948, the year Gore was born? We don’t know, Colgan said. Scientists use satellites to map glaciers and reliable satellite monitoring didn’t start until the mid 1980s.  We do have estimates of the total number of glaciers today. According to the Randolph Glacier Inventory, Colgan said, there are 197,654 glaciers that are at least 1 hectare, or 0.01 square kilometers. That’s 67,654 more than the Facebook post says, not counting the thousands of glaciers that are ""missing,"" meaning they’re too small to be included in inventories.  Walt Meier, a research scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center, told PolitiFact that inventories are always changing. The numbers could increase because more glaciers are getting mapped, he said. When we looked at this claim back in 2019, one database on the center’s website listed 306,865 glaciers. Bruce Raup, who works on the center’s Global Land Ice Measurements from Space initiative, told PolitiFact that approximately 300,000 is still a solid number in 2021.  Some glaciers are being newly counted in regions that weren’t covered before, such as Iran, which has a small number of glaciers, Raup said.  There ""were definitely"" more than 130,000 glaciers when Gore was born, he said — they just weren’t well-counted. He speculated the figure came from the World Glacier Inventory, and indeed, the inventory ""contains information for over 130,000 glaciers."" But the inventory is just a snapshot of glacier distribution in the second half of the 20th century — it’s not comprehensive. ""The number of glaciers probably is actually growing over time, due to ice complexes shrinking and breaking apart into pieces"" Raup said. ""But our data aren’t good enough to document this well.""

Their post doesn’t mention where the vessel came from, and the name of the ship isn’t shown. There’s no mention of DeSantis or backed-up ports in the original TikTok video.  But comments on this post, as well as another Instagram post that shared the video, claim that it came from California, where cargo ships have been backed up for weeks. Other ports across the country have experienced the same problem, including in Savannah, Ga. We can’t confirm whether the ship came from California; nothing in the original video suggests that it did.  Marine Traffic spokesperson Gergios Hatzimanolis said according to their data, it doesn’t appear that any cargo ships have been diverted from L.A. to Miami within the last 15 days.  PolitiFact reached out to Port Miami to get clarification regarding the claim, but did not get a response.  We’ve explained the backlog in previous fact checks: it’s due to a cascade of issues including a spike in consumer demand for the holidays, shortages of workers unable to unload the larger ships, and COVID-19 outbreaks. It’s true that DeSantis has invited backed-up cargo ships to reroute to ports in Florida. But people who used the video as proof of this may have jumped the gun — ship experts say there’s not enough data, and it’s too soon to tell whether the backlogged ships have pulled anchor and come to the Sunshine State. DeSantis’ press secretary Christina Pushaw told PolitiFact that Florida ports are offering incentives to shipping companies to bring their business to them.  Edie Ousley, spokesperson for the Florida Ports Council, said that the state has partnered with shipping companies that want to avoid the congested ports altogether. Hapag-Lloyd in the United Kingdom has temporarily rerouted their vessels to come to JAXPORT. An Instagram post re-shared a video showing a cargo vessel entering PortMiami, claiming that backed-up cargo ships had been rerouted to Florida. The original video, posted to TikTok, doesn’t say where the cargo ship came from or its name.  Marine Traffic’s data doesn’t show that any backlogged ship diverted to Florida within the last 15 days. At least one shipping company has partnered with a port in Jacksonville, Fla., to avoid the west coast altogether. But that doesn’t mean that ships that were already en route to backed up ports have changed their course. Unless more evidence about the ship in the video appears, we see no evidence that shows the ship rerouted from California to Florida. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/nov/05/instagram-posts/no-evidence-video-ship-shows-rerouted-cargo-arrivi/

Australian state isn’t freezing unvaccinated people’s bank accounts
","The leader of Victoria, a small state in southern Australia, has been criticized for imposing strict COVID-19 regulations, including mask mandates and vaccination requirements for indoor weddings, funerals, hair salons and restaurants. But a claim about Premier Daniel Andrews applying financial penalties to pressure people to get vaccinated isn’t true.  ""Australia PM of Victoria is freezing people’s bank accts who haven't had the V, they can’t buy or sell until forced into submission,"" an Oct. 31 Facebook post reads.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no evidence to support the claim that Andrews is freezing the bank accounts of unvaccinated people to pressure them to get vaccinated. A search for news clips turned up only similar unsubstantiated claims shared on sites like Reddit and Twitter. Government websites don’t mention any such action or proposal. Andrews’ office did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. Andrews has been described as responsible for imposing ""some of the most stringent pandemic-control measures on Earth.""  When COVID cases surged in Victoria in July 2020, Andrews sent the capital, Melbourne, into one of the world’s longest lockdowns. Although there were a range of restrictions in a four-stage system, some of the restrictions in Victoria included:  People in the Melbourne area were allowed to shop for food and other necessities only within a 5 kilometer radius of their homes.  Exercise was capped at an hour per day. A curfew was in place from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. Gyms, restaurants, entertainment venues and places of worship were closed.  The state has said it would relax the rules as more people got vaccinated.  On Oct. 29, Victoria reached a vaccination milestone: 80% of its residents aged 16 and older were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The achievement meant some restrictions were relaxed, and businesses such as gyms, retailers and entertainment venues could reopen to fully vaccinated customers.  The state is still working to achieve a 90% vaccination rate for anyone ages 12 or older. Misinformation about Andrews’ plans for unvaccinated Victorians has been fact-checked in the past. For example, ABC Fact Check debunked the claim that Andrews planned to ""strip Medicare coverage"" from the unvaccinated. A Facebook post claimed that the premier of Victoria, Australia, is freezing the bank accounts of unvaccinated people to pressure them to get vaccinated against COVID-19. We found no evidence to support this claim. We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2021/nov/04/facebook-posts/australian-state-isnt-freezing-unvaccinated-people/

Supply chain problems are real, not manufactured
","A TikTok video that has been viewed nearly a half-million times claims that there is no supply shortage, and that problems getting goods to American consumers are manufactured.  In a clip from ""The Stew Peters Show,"" a conservative internet broadcast, a man claiming to work in the Port of Los Angeles says that the port workers have broken productivity records, and there is no shortage of goods.  ""The goods are in the warehouses,"" said the man, whose identity was concealed. ""There is no shortage."" Host Stew Peters asks him if the shortage is manufactured.  ""It has to be,"" the man says. ""There’s no explanation. Because when we’re working this hard getting that much tonnage out, that means it’s going somewhere. But if it’s not getting to the people it’s stopping somewhere. I think it’s stopping at the ... supply warehouses, that’s the only place it could be."" TikTok identified this video, which was posted on Oct. 24, as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) The supply chain problems are real, resulting in empty store shelves and predictions that holiday shoppers will have trouble finding every gift on their list. There’s no evidence that the crisis is fabricated. And despite what the man in the video claims, there are explanations for these problems that go beyond what may be happening at one seaport. The problems getting goods to consumers have been the subject of congressional hearings and presidential announcements. The causes are complex and multifaceted, according to reports from the ground at these ports, explanations from people who work along the supply chain and information from experts.  In a widely shared Medium essay, union truck driver Ryan Johnson explains several problems in the supply chain, based on his experience. He describes how long wait times for truck drivers at the ports to pick up freight discourage independent drivers, who are not paid by the hour, from going to the ports at all, because it is not cost-effective. A shortage of warehouse workers means that it takes longer to make pickups at warehouses — three or four hours instead of 20 or 30 minutes.  ""It means that as a freight driver, I cannot pick up as much freight in a day as I used to, and since I can’t get as much freight on my truck, the whole supply chain is backed up,"" wrote Johnson, who lives in Washington state and has been a truck driver for 20 years. ""Freight simply isn’t moving.""  Debra Glassman, a professor at the University of Washington who teaches finance and business economics, said that the cargo unloading at the port described in the video is just one link in the supply chain.  ""It is entirely possible that some goods have moved into warehouses and are stuck there waiting for transportation to retailers or customers,"" Glassman said. ""There is a shortage of truckers that has slowed transportation and delivery. This is a real problem, not a ‘manufactured’ one. There are a lot of reasons for the trucker shortage, including an aging workforce, difficult working conditions, and relatively low pay. So my conclusion is that goods could be stuck in warehouses for genuine supply chain reasons."" According to an executive at a Minnesota candy manufacturer, a shortage of trained and available workers is the biggest disruption to her supply chain, but not the only one. Christine Lantinen, owner of Maud Borup Inc., told federal lawmakers in October that the cost to ship a standard 40-foot shipping container rose from about $4,300 to $30,000 between August 2020 and August 2021. Patrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse University, said the supply chain became more complex and strained as companies tried to cut costs. Now, we have what Penfield considers a ""global supply chain in crisis.""   In an interview on C-SPAN, Penfield said there is a shortage of base materials, such as chemicals and semiconductor chips, and lead times are getting longer. For example, shipping goods from China used to take 30 or 35 days, and now takes 73 days. Those delays are compounded by congestion at the ports, ships waiting to be unloaded, a lack of warehouse space, and a worker shortage.  There were problems before the pandemic, Penfield said, but the pandemic has been the big contributor to the current problems, along with weather events and cyber attacks.  The problems are not confined to the United States. Daniel Maffei, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission, told a congressional panel in June that congestion, reliability and cost issues are problems worldwide for ports, businesses and transportation networks linked to oceans.    Maffei also said that while shipping containers stacked high at ports make for dramatic photos, there are problems throughout the supply chain. ""Outdated infrastructure, equipment and labor shortages, railroad issues, and limited warehousing all diminish our capacity to move containers,"" he said.  PolitiFact looked at several claims that aim to assign blame for the supply shortages, and found that many interconnecting factors affect the supply chain. The coronavirus is restricting capacity at Asian factories, major weather events like hurricanes are disrupting shipping, and shipping containers and raw materials are in short supply. Retirements have also led to a shortage of truck drivers.    We reached out to ""The Stew Peters Show,"" and a representative declined to provide evidence for this claim.  A TikTok video claims that workers at ports efficiently getting goods off of container ships shows that the shortages of goods are manufactured.  Experts and people who work in industry said that there are real problems throughout the supply chain, worldwide. While some goods may be sitting in warehouses because they are not being processed quickly, the issues disrupting the flow of goods to consumers go beyond that to include labor shortages at various points in the supply chain, as well as a shortage of raw materials and rising transportation prices.  This is not a manufactured crisis.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire! ",/factchecks/2021/nov/04/tiktok-posts/supply-chain-problems-are-real/

Facebook posts get the details wrong about use of Moderna in Scandinavian countries
","A social media post misleads when it says use of the Moderna vaccine has been completely discontinued for everyone in Iceland and for all young people in other Scandinavian countries.  ""Moderna has been pulled in Iceland and pulled for everyone under age 30 in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark due to heart issues,"" says the viral Facebook post.   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The information is not accurate. Iceland continues to administer Moderna for booster shots for those 60 and older. Of the other countries listed, only one — Sweden — has temporarily suspended the use of the Moderna vaccine for all people under 30 years old.  Finland has limited the use of Moderna only for men and boys under age 30. Norway recommends Pfizer over Moderna for certain people but does not prohibit anyone from taking Moderna. And Denmark said those under 18 can request Moderna if desired.  The countries made the decisions in early October based on an unpublished study conducted by health agencies from four of the five countries. The study showed an increased risk of heart inflammation, called myocarditis, following vaccination with Moderna in adolescents and young adults, and primarily in boys and men. Sweden’s Public Health Agency noted, ""The risk of being affected is very small,"" according to the Associated Press.  The study results are being assessed by the European Medicines Agency and final results are expected soon.  Of the countries listed in the Facebook post, Iceland has taken the most far-reaching actions. First the country’s health authorities said they would completely suspend the use of Moderna. A few days later, they walked that back and said the vaccine would be used as a booster for those age 60 and older ""for the time being.""  Sweden temporarily suspended the use of Moderna for people born in 1991 or later. The country’s public health agency initially said the pause would last until Dec. 1, but later extended that deadline.  Finland is not administering Moderna to men and boys under 30 years old. ""The guidelines are a precautionary measure that will be reassessed when research data is accumulated,"" the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare reported.  In Norway, the country’s Institute of Public Health recommends that those under age 18 and males under age 30 should be offered the Pfizer vaccine rather than Moderna, but also notes that  ""the side effect is rare and the absolute risk is still low."" The agency says people have a choice: ""Those who are to be vaccinated in the future can in any case choose the type of vaccine they want, both as the first and second dose.""  Denmark initially said it was pausing use of the Moderna vaccine for those younger than 18, but later clarified that people under age 18 still could request Moderna. A Facebook post said, ""Moderna has been pulled in Iceland and pulled for everyone under age 30 in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark due to heart issues.""  The information is inaccurate. Iceland has not ""pulled"" the Moderna vaccine and is still using it for some people over 60.  Of the other countries, Sweden temporarily suspended the use of Moderna for all people under 30, but Finland only restricts its use for males under age 30. Norway and Denmark recommend that young people take vaccines other than Moderna but do not require it.  We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/nov/04/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-get-details-wrong-about-use-moderna/
