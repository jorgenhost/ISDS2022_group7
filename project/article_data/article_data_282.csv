Xavier Becerra is wrong that no law addresses partial-birth abortion
","Congressional Republicans recently quizzed Xavier Bercerra, the secretary of health and human services, on abortion policy.  At a May 12 hearing, Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., asked Becerra about some of his testimony during his confirmation hearing earlier this year, when the nominee said that his job would be to ""make sure that I’m following the law.""  Bilirakis asked Becerra whether he agreed that ""partial-birth abortion is illegal."" The term generally refers to late-term procedures formally known as ""dilation and extraction"" or ""dilation and evacuation,"" which opponents of abortion have long considered especially objectionable. Here’s their exchange: Becerra: ""We will continue to make sure we follow the law. Again, with due respect, there is no medical term like partial-birth abortion, so I’d probably have to ask you what you mean by that to describe what is allowed by the law. But (the Supreme Court case on abortion) Roe vs. Wade is clear, settled precedent: A woman has a right to make decisions about their reproductive health, and we will make sure that we enforce the law and protect those rights."" Bilirakis: ""And do you agree with this particular law?"" Becerra: ""Which law are we talking about, sir?"" Bilirakis: ""The law concerning partial-birth abortion."" Becerra: ""Again, as I said, there is no law that deals specifically with the term partial-birth abortion. We have clear precedent in the law on the rights women have to reproductive health care.""  One of the things Becerra said caught the attention of anti-abortion advocates — that ""there is no law that deals specifically with the term ‘partial-birth abortion.’""  A reader asked us to look into it, and when we did, we found that Becerra was wrong: The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act was enacted in 2003. Becerra should have known that: As a member of the House then, he voted against it. The 2003 law is not obscure; it was the subject of long and heated debate before it was passed by the Republican-contolled House and Senate and signed by President George W. Bush. Its aim was to limit late-term abortions by banning the specific procedures used for them. The law says a physician is involved in a ""partial birth abortion"" if he or she ""deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother, for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus."" According to the law, a physician who knowingly performs a partial birth abortion is subject to up to two years in prison and a fine. The one exception is if the procedure is necessary ""to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury."" (The mother is not subject to prosecution under the law.) The House passed the legislation on June 4, 2003. Becerra, then representing a district in California, voted against the measure, as did 132 other Democrats out of the 205 then serving in the chamber. The law was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007. Several scholars who have studied abortion law agreed that Becerra’s statement is wrong. ""In a nutshell, there is a law that deals with the term partial-birth abortion,"" said Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor and the autor of several books on abortion, including ""Abortion in America: A Legal History, Roe v. Wade to the Present."" Given the clear language of the law, the ""statement is clearly false,"" said Teresa S. Collett, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas.  It’s important to note that there is a long-running dispute between abortion-rights supporters and anti-abortion advocates over whether the term ""partial birth abortion"" is the appropriate one to use for abortions of this type. The term has usually been favored by opponents of abortion, perhaps because it suggests that a child has been ""born,"" which would make the abortion procedure more akin to murder. On the other side, abortion-rights advocates have tended to use the phrase ""late-term abortion,"" which is less polarizing. Because the 2003 law was passed under unified Republican control, and because anti-abortion lawmakers are disproportionately Republican, the term ""partial-birth abortion"" was used in the law.  In other words, experts said that ""partial birth abortion"" is really more of a political label than a medical one. ""I would say that Becerra was engaged in legalistic quibbling to avoid answering the question,"" said Dwight Duncan, a University of Massachusetts law professor. When we reached out to Becerra’s office, they offered a statement centered on the argument that dilation and extraction is the term recognized in the medical literature and by practitioners, not ""partial birth abortion."" ""Roe v. Wade is the law of the land and HHS will continue to follow the law and ensure the American people have access to health care — including reproductive care,"" the statement said. ""During the hearing, Secretary Becerra clarified that partial birth abortion is not a medically recognized term. As the secretary said multiple times, HHS respects and will enforce the law."" Becerra said, ""There is no law that deals specifically with the term ‘partial-birth abortion.’"" While the term ""partial birth abortion"" is more of a politically derived label than an official medical term, the legal reality is that Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003, and the Supreme Court upheld it in 2007. Becerra himself voted against the law when it came up in the House. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C46E8C0>],/factchecks/2021/may/19/xavier-becerra/xavier-becerra-wrong-no-law-deals-partial-birth-ab/

University of Miami researchers looked at effects of COVID-19, not vaccines
","A recent Instagram post points to research out of the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine as evidence that COVID-19 vaccines will affect sperm production.  ""The Miller School researchers have confirmed that the COVID19 virus can affect sperm production inside the testes,"" the post says. ""What’s in the experimental ‘vaccine?’ They can’t deny it won’t affect the male sperm production either by injection or transmission."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In November, the University of Miami announced that a new study by Miller School of Medicine researchers found that COVID-19 can invade the testicles in some men who are infected with the virus.  The study was published in the World Journal of Men’s Health. Dr. Ranjith Ramasamy, the lead author and the director of reproductive urology at the Miller School, said at the time that ""the findings could be the first step in discovering COVID-19’s potential impact on male fertility and whether the virus can be sexually transmitted,"" according to the university.  By analyzing testis tissue from six men who died of COVID-19, the researchers found impaired sperm function in the tissue of three of the men, and evidence of COVID-19 in the tissue of a fourth man. Other viruses, such as the mumps, are known to affect sperm production and fertility. However, according to the university, ""more studies are needed to evaluate exactly how testis tissue responds to the virus and what that might mean to male fertility and sexual transmission."" The study says that it is ""limited by the small sample size and inability to assess the long-term consequences"" of COVID-19 on sperm production. In its conclusions, the researchers wrote: ""The findings of this study could be the first step in discovering impacts to fertility or the possibility of sexual transmission of the virus. On the basis of these preliminary findings, we believe that COVID-19 can penetrate the blood-testis barrier and enter the testis in some men."" The study does not mention vaccines. We reached out to Ramasamy to find out if the Instagram post accurately characterized their work.  Dr. Daniel Nassau, one of Ramasamy’s fellows and an investigator on the study, responded.  ""I am not sure where they are getting vaccine from this article, but that statement is not true,"" he said.  The school’s researchers are separately evaluating how mRNA vaccines may affect fertility, he said, and they’re waiting for the results to be published. But, he said, ""we do not think the vaccine will affect male fertility."" A fever can temporarily suppress male fertility, Dr. Parviz Kavoussi, a reproductive urologist at St. David’s South Austin Medical Center, told the Austin American-Statesman. And a percentage of people who receive any vaccine, including a COVID-19 vaccine, could experience a fever after getting the shot. But the effects are short-term. ""At three months, it’s going to bounce back,"" he said.  We rate claims that studies show the COVID-19 vaccine will affect sperm production False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFE4B40>],/factchecks/2021/may/19/viral-image/university-miami-researchers-looked-effects-covid-/

Clip of Capitol police speaking with rioters doesn’t prove mob was given OK to enter building
","A viral video of U.S. Capitol Police officers speaking with a group of rioters inside the Capitol on Jan. 6 is fueling a counter-narrative of what actually happened that day.  Bloggers and social media users are describing the 44-second clip as evidence that pro-Trump rioters were given permission to enter the U.S. Capitol that day, and that the violence depicted in several other photos and videos is the work of Democrats.  The video shows a man named William Watson telling the rest of the group that the police are willing to work with them peacefully. It then pivots to an officer telling them, ""show us no attacking, no assault. Remain calm."" Toward the end, the man who wore a fur headdress, known as the ""Q Shaman,"" yells for everyone to be peaceful and says ""we have the right to peacefully assemble.""  ""Video shows U.S. Capitol Police gave protesters OK to enter,"" reads the video’s caption on Facebook. Additional text in its description says: ""The video directly contradicts what government prosecutors allege in complaints against citizens shown in the video."" This is wrong. The video does not show officers allowing rioters into the building. The officers are blocking the hallway and attempting to de-escalate the situation, a spokesperson for the Capitol Police told PolitiFact.  More than 400 people have been charged in federal court related to the riot, and the charges include obstruction of law enforcement, violence with a deadly weapon and assault. Five people died, many more were injured, and repairing the damage to the building is estimated to cost millions. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This clip briefly shows one group of rioters who were already inside the building. Police officers were vastly outnumbered during the breach. ""There is no evidence of misconduct (by police) in the short video clip,"" a Capitol Police spokesperson told PolitiFact. ""The officers are blocking the hallway and attempting to de-escalate the situation, as they are trained to, by telling the crowd to not attack or assault and to remain calm. The Department is working closely with its federal law enforcement officers to ensure the criminals who unlawfully broke into the U.S. Capitol during the Joint Session of Congress are successfully prosecuted.""  The full picture of the day shows that the mob climbed walls, pushed through barricades, smashed windows and broke doors to get into the Capitol. They vandalized the building, ransacked offices and stole government property. Some assaulted officers. And they ultimately caused the House and Senate to shut down for several hours on the day they were certifying the presidential election.  Here are a few examples of what happened that day, as described in charging documents filed by prosecutors:  Video shows that rioters used makeshift weapons including hockey sticks, flagpoles and a police shield stolen from an officer. Many were charged with offenses related to deadly or dangerous weapons, and a few were charged with offenses related to firearm possession.  One rioter screamed at an officer to shoot him, and multiple officers had to fight and subdue him.  Another is seen using a stick-like weapon outside the building, making stabbing movements at officers’ necks between their helmets and body armor where they weren’t protected. One person used a metal flagpole to attack a police officer, while another sprayed officers with a chemical irritant. The claim that the video contradicts prosecutors' statements appears to be a reference to the federal case against Jacob Anthony Chansley, the shirtless ""Q Shaman."" Chansley faces charges that include civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building. But in this viral clip, we see only a snippet of Chansley’s interactions with police that day. Other videos show him climbing scaffolding, screaming into a bullhorn and running onto the dais of the Senate chamber. In Chansley’s detention memo, prosecutors say that the officer seen in the video, Keith Robishaw, ""calmed the protestors somewhat and directed them to leave the area from the same way they had entered.""  It adds: ""Most complied, but Chansley disobeyed the order and instead began heading up a different stairwell toward the Senate floor. Officer Robishaw, alone with more than 25 rioters in the Senate Chamber, attempted to engage with Chansley and asked for his assistance to use the bullhorn to get the protestors out of the Chamber. Instead of doing so, Chansley ran up on the dais where Vice President Pence had been presiding just minutes before, and begin posing on the dais for other rioters to document and photograph, and wrote a note to Vice President Pence saying, ‘It's only a matter of time, justice is coming.’"" Chansley was ordered to stay in jail because, among other reasons, he committed a felony that involved the use of a dangerous weapon (a spear), and prosecutors noted there were ""serious risks that he will flee and obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice.""  Social media posts are describing a video clip of Capitol police officers with a group of pro-Trump rioters on Jan. 6 as evidence that officers allowed the mob inside the building. The officers in the video are attempting to de-escalate the situation by telling the rioters, who already breached the building, to remain calm and peaceful. There is overwhelming evidence that shows the mob forcefully entering the Capitol, with many attacking police officers in the process.  We rate this Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BD4C80>],/factchecks/2021/may/18/facebook-posts/clip-capitol-police-speaking-rioters-doesnt-prove-/

Do New York’s homeless veterans qualify for the Excluded Worker Fund?
","In April, New York state’s Democratic-led Legislature passed — and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed — a budget that included $2.1 billion for a new Excluded Worker Fund. The fund would make one-time payments of as much as $15,600 to immigrants in the country illegally who lost work during the coronavirus pandemic.  The idea was to provide aid to New Yorkers whose immigration status prevented them from receiving other forms of aid during the pandemic. Critics of the program expressed outrage that the state was preparing to hand over thousands of dollars to immigrants who were in the United States illegally.  Some national figures weighed in, such as Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is considered a possible 2024 presidential candidate. Citing a New York Times article explaining the provision, Cotton wrote in the tweet: ""New York's 1,200+ homeless veterans are ineligible for these $15,600 payments."" New York's 1,200+ homeless veterans are ineligible for these $15,600 payments. https://t.co/0BMLbxVQMm Is Cotton correct that New York homeless veterans do not qualify for this aid? We reached out to Cotton's office and were referred to a website that did not address our question. Our research suggests that Cotton’s argument is both inaccurate — homeless veterans are not expressly barred under the program — and a misleading restatement of the fund’s intent: It’s meant to help the people who wouldn’t be eligible for the kind of aid most veterans already qualify for. Excluded Worker Fund benefits are available to New York state residents who have been excluded from unemployment insurance, pandemic-related federal support, and other programs because of their immigration status, said Freeman Klopott, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Budget.  They must have earned no more than $26,208 in the prior year and suffered a loss of work-related earnings or household income due the coronavirus pandemic, Klopott said.  The fund doesn’t explicitly bar homeless veterans, as Cotton suggests. If any homeless veterans happen to meet those requirements, they would qualify for these benefits, Klopott said. As a practical matter, this is probably a small group, even if the number of homeless veterans in New York state is higher than the 1,200 cited by Cotton, since few veterans are likely to be excluded from other aid programs because of their immigration status. While the U.S. military routinely accepts noncitizen immigrants who are in the country legally — often granting them citizenship after several years of service — it generally does not accept immigrants who are in the country illegally.  An exception is a program called Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or MAVNI. The program, created under President George W. Bush and left largely in limbo during the Obama and Trump administrations, allows immigrants in the country illegally who possess certain in-demand skills such as foreign languages or medical training to join the military. This program is not only dormant but was capped at a few thousand individuals in its early years, making its members a tiny fraction of the overall veteran population. A broader issue is that Cotton’s tweet garbles the purpose of the program. Any homeless veterans who are already U.S. citizens or legal residents would have been eligible for the original assistance programs that the Excluded Worker Fund is supposed to be backstopping. In his tweet, Cotton singled out one sympathetic group — homeless veterans — as being uniquely blocked by this program. But by Cotton’s logic, homeless veterans would also be ""ineligible"" for corporate tax breaks and countless other provisions of the budget that were not directed at the homeless or veterans in New York. And by the same token, farmers, math teachers and poets who are U.S. citizens would be ""ineligible"" for the program, because it’s not meant for them. ""The veteran community has been hit hard during COVID-19 and continues to need help,"" said  James Fitzgerald, deputy director at the NYC Veterans Alliance, told PolitiFact. ""Other communities are in need of help as well, including our immigrant community. Our government should focus on helping as many individuals as possible so we can recover from this terrible pandemic."" Cotton said, ""New York's 1,200+ homeless veterans are ineligible for these $15,600 payments."" The post mischaracterizes a program that would provide aid to people who were excluded from other aid programs because of their immigration status. The vast majority of homeless veterans are already U.S. citizens or legal residents, and thus are not the population the Excluded Worker Fund was designed to help.

The reference is to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s leading epidemiologist, and Dr. Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On May 11, during a Senate committee hearing on fighting COVID-19 — the same one where Fauci and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky clashed over the origins of the virus — Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., questioned Fauci, Marks and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about vaccination levels among employees of their agencies.  The CDC and the FDA are key agencies involved in screening vaccines. Fauci heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of a different agency, the National Institutes of Health. In response to Burr’s question, Fauci said of NIAID: ""I think it’s probably a little bit more than half, probably around 60%."" Marks said ""it’s probably in the same range"" for FDA employees. Walensky didn’t give a percentage for CDC employees, saying they have the option to report their vaccination status but that ""the federal government is not requiring it, so we do not know."" The Instagram post from a few days later shows the first part of a now-deleted three-tweet thread from @Breaking911, the Twitter account for the Breaking911 news site, which is listed by Columbia Journalism Review as unreliable. The second part of that thread showed a video clip of Burr asking his question. The third part of the thread is another tweet from @Breaking911 that says: ""CDC, FDA employees were in one of the first groups to be offered the vaccine. 50-60% percent of employees are vaccinated according to Fauci and Marks, meaning 50-40% of employees are refusing the vaccine."" But that’s not what it means. The officials’ answers about the vaccination levels do not mean that the rest refused to be vaccinated. The percentages given by Fauci and Marks are in the range of the vaccination levels among the overall adult U.S. population. As of May 17, 59.8% of U.S. adults have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 47.4% are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Vaccinations continue around the country. As of May 12, the seven-day moving average was more than 1.62 million vaccinations per day in the U.S., according to the CDC.  A widely shared Instagram post claimed: ""About 40% to 50% of CDC, FDA employees are refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, according to"" Anthony Fauci and FDA’s Peter Marks. Fauci, Marks and the CDC’s Walensky were asked what percentage of their employees have received the COVID-19 vaccine. Fauci estimated 60% for his National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Marks said probably in the same range for the FDA, and Walensky didn’t give a percentage for the CDC.  None of them said anything about employees who refuse to be vaccinated.

Assembly GOP touts taking spending out of the budget, but it also took revenue along with it
","Budget season in Wisconsin is heating up — and Republicans are already clashing with Gov. Tony Evers over how the state should spend its money.  Evers proposed a $91 billion budget for 2021-23 that aimed to expand Medicaid, legalize marijuana and raise $1 billion in taxes. GOP lawmakers on the state’s powerful Joint Finance Committee, which is tasked with writing the budget, removed hundreds of items from the governor’s proposal tied to his key priorities.  The committee also tackled Evers’ proposed spending increases — a move the Assembly GOP lauded in a recent tweet.  ""Republicans on the Joint Finance Committee removed more than $8 billion in spending increases from Gov. Evers' budget proposal,"" they tweeted on May 7, 2021. Let’s see what’s behind the numbers. We reached out to the office of state Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, for evidence to support this claim since Born is co-chairman of the Joint Finance Committee. An aide pointed us to two documents: a summary of Evers’ budget recommendations compiled by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau and a recent motion passed by the committee. According to the Fiscal Bureau, the governor’s proposal would have upped spending by more than $8.1 billion from 2021-23. The Fiscal Bureau measures increases and decreases by comparing funding to the second year of the previous budget — also known as the base year.  Those increases included $1.6 billion more for K-12 schools and a $190 million boost for the University of Wisconsin System.  Republicans on the Joint Finance Committee voted on May 6, 2021, to return the budget proposal to the $83 billion base for 2020-21. That means Evers’ proposed spending increases are out, and lawmakers are essentially starting the process from scratch.  So, in that sense, the Assembly GOP’s claim is on point — lawmakers did indeed strip out over $8 billion in spending hikes.  But that statement doesn’t tell the full story. Killing Medicaid expansion, for example, deprives the state of an additional $1.6 billion in federal funds, and regulating marijuana was slated to bring in $165 million in revenue. Less revenue usually means cuts to schools and other services.  What’s more, Republicans will very likely put more spending back into the budget, but focused on their priorities — meaning the actions they’re now boasting about are only temporary.  In a tweet, the Assembly GOP said ""Republicans on the Joint Finance Committee removed more than $8 billion in spending increases from Gov. Evers' budget proposal."" The GOP-led committee did return the 2021-23 budget proposal to previous spending levels, which negated the increases proposed by Evers. But the claim doesn’t acknowledge that Republicans took away potential revenue sources and will likely put spending increases back in the budget as they draft their plan. A statement is Mostly True when it is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That fits here.   ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A48CDC0>],/factchecks/2021/may/18/wisconsin-assembly-gop/assembly-gop-touts-taking-spending-out-budget-it-a/

Iowa leads the nation in overall high-school graduation rates, lags behind in minority graduation

","Back at the beginning of the year, before COVID-19 altered the state’s school calendar, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds praised public schools In her January Condition of the State address for having ""the highest high-school graduation rate in the country."" It’s a popular sentiment that other Iowa politicians second — most notably Republicans when touting their state funding record for public schools. For example, Sen. Amy Sinclair, R-Allerton, made similar comments in a *Cedar Rapids Gazette* article from February, in which she defended increased state funding for K-12 schools. Sinclair told the newspaper Iowa’s schools have the nation’s highest high school graduation rates but also score well enough in national testing and have a reputation for being the best in the nation. We checked high-school graduation data from the National Center for Education Statistics and found these statements have a factual basis. Iowa graduation rates have increased steadily over the past decade, from 88 percent in the 2010-11 academic year to 91 percent in 2016-17. The rate took a marginal dip between 2015-16 and 2016-17, from 91.3 percent to 91 percent. Iowa ranked No. 1 in the nation for graduation rates from 2011 to 2017, often ahead of runner-up states such as New Jersey, Nebraska and Wisconsin by a full percentage point, according to a Daily Iowan analysis of NCES data. ""We do need to be proud of our graduation rate, and our schools are working incredibly hard,"" Iowa State Education Association President Mike Beranek said in an interview with the DI April 30. "" … our statistics are really quite the envy of many other states in the country."" Beranek said he doesn’t expect Iowa’s graduation rates to be affected negatively by school closures during spring as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, he said he believes the shift from in-person to virtual instruction in many state schools could shed light on inequities within Iowa. He pointed to varying access to internet, food and transportation among students as examples of inequity within the education system. ""While we do have a discrepancy between those students who are in poverty and those students who aren’t, it’s still lower than a majority of states in the country,"" Beranek said. ""And I’m hopeful that our districts are doing everything they can to ensure that doesn’t widen but it narrows — and that’s a goal of our districts in Iowa is to continue to narrow that gap."" According to numbers from the NCES, graduation rates for black and Hispanic populations in Iowa were 82 percent and 82.4 percent in 2016-17, respectively — compared to a 92.7 percent graduation rate among the state’s white population and an overall state graduation rate of 91 percent. Iowa ranked 13th and 12th in the nation for black and Hispanic graduation rates, respectively.  Iowa was the 11th state in the nation for graduation rates among students with disabilities at 74.3 percent, and eighth in the nation for economically disadvantaged students at just over 83 percent in 2016-17, according to NCES data. Iowa’s high-school graduation rate reached a record high of 91.6 percent in 2019, according to a March press release from the Iowa Department of Education. Graduation rates in the state have increased 3.3 percentage points overall, 9.3 percentage points for Hispanic students, and 8.4 percentage points for African American students since 2011, the release stated. ""Iowans should be proud of our consistent, upward trend in graduation rates,"" Iowa Department of Education Director Ryan Wise wrote in the press release. ""Schools are also ensuring students are prepared to succeed beyond graduation by making classwork relevant and engaging through career academies, college credit and work-based learning opportunities that help students connect what they are learning to postsecondary opportunities."" Reynolds, Sinclair and additional Iowa politicians said Iowa has the nation’s highest graduation rates in the U.S. National data confirms these statements and shows a steady increase in Iowa’s graduation rates since 2011. Graduation rates among minority populations in Iowa are relatively low compared to those of other states, however, and none surpassed 85 percent in 2016-17.

Conspiracy theory falsely claims George Floyd’s death was staged
","As protests in Minneapolis turned violent, some Facebook users falsely said the event that sparked them was staged by police. A May 28 post claims the death of George Floyd was a ""staged event."" Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody May 25 after being handcuffed and pinned down by a white officer. ""I think there is at the very least the ‘possibility,’ that this was a filmed public execution of a black man by a white cop, with the purpose of creating racial tensions and driving a wedge in the growing group of anti deep state sentiment from comon (sic) people, that have already been psychologically traumatized by Covid 19 fears,"" reads the post. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared thousands of times and copy-pasted by other users. (Screenshot from Facebook) There is no evidence to back it up. We reached out to the original poster for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.  After a video of Floyd’s death started to circulate on social media, protesters took to the streets in Minneapolis. Four police officers involved in the incident were fired. The officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck was taken into custody and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on May 29. The video shows police who were dispatched to a Minneapolis store May 25 after receiving a 911 call alleging that Floyd had paid with a counterfeit bill. Two officers detain Floyd near a police car; one of them has his knee on Floyd’s neck.  ""Please, I can't breathe,"" Floyd says in the video, before going silent after several minutes of pleading with police. Another angle of the encounter shows three officers watching as the arresting officer, Derek Chauvin, presses his knee into Floyd’s neck. Law enforcement experts have broadly condemned the technique. The FBI and Justice Department are investigating Floyd’s death as a possible violation of federal civil rights laws. Hennepin County and federal prosecutors are also looking into the possibility of bringing additional charges against the officers involved in the incident. We reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. None of the investigations have disputed that the video shows Floyd’s death — and that Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck, killing him. The nearly 1,000-word Facebook post weaves together a series of speculations and unrelated facts, the motives of the officers and the timing of the incident to spin an unproven conspiracy theory. None of it confirms that the incident was staged. Conspiracy theories that allege a tragedy was either staged or fabricated commonly circulate online following major news events. False claims that Floyd’s death was staged first started bubbling up in Facebook groups for supporters of President Donald Trump on May 27.

Claim on Republican Party origin oversimplifies Democrats' position
","Political polarization hasn’t exactly diminished in the face of a worldwide pandemic. So it’s hardly a surprise that a recent Facebook post highlighting Wisconsin’s role launching the Republican Party was built on a critique of the Democrats of old. A post shared more than 9,000 times after being posted in the ""Educate-A-Liberal"" Facebook group described it this way: ""The Republican Party of the United States of America was founded in a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin. PURPOSE: To counter the Democrats’ plans to expand slavery in America. EVERY American should REMEMBER this important bit of American history on election day!"" There is, of course, an underlying assertion here that the parties have changed so little in 150-plus years that their 19th-Century policies should be factored into present voting decisions.  But we’ll set that aside to focus on where and why the party started. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Is it correct to say the Republican Party started in Ripon ""to counter the Democrats’ plans to expand slavery""? We’ll examine the location and motivation claims one at a time. The exact origin of the Republican party is a point of debate, but Ripon has a solid claim as — at the very least — playing a key role. A brief history page on the official GOP website describes Ripon as hosting the first Republican party meeting, on March 20, 1854. A 1914 writeup on the origin of the party by Ripon College professor A.F. Gilman said 54 of the 100 or so eligible voters in the area attended that meeting, a combination of Whigs (a party that was fading at the time), disillusioned Democrats and Free-Soilers (a short-lived anti-slavery coalition). Gilman reports the meeting was organized by Alvan Bovay, a founder of what became Ripon College, who put forth the name Republican for the newly formed group. Bovay was friends with Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, who eventually published the term as a recommended label for the fledgling party, furthering the name’s eventual adoption. Other key moments include a July 6, 1854, anti-slavery convention in Jackson, Mich., where the first statewide candidates were selected by the new party. They adopted a platform that said the group would ""cooperate and be known as Republicans."" The GOP website says this is the first ever ""mass gathering of the Republican Party."" Encyclopedia Britannica also pointed to the Ripon and Jackson meetings as the key founding moments Charles Cohen, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Wisconsin, said calling Ripon the birthplace overreaches a bit, though. ""The Republican Party was founded by dissident Whigs and others in a decentralized process; it had no single origin,"" he said in an email. ""It would be more accurate to say that Ripon is the birthplace of the name ‘Republican Party.’"" Historians are clear that the Republican Party was founded, in large part, as an anti-slavery party. The creation was spurred by the May 1854 passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which was sponsored by Democrat Stephen Douglas. To garner needed support from southern Democrats, Douglas inserted a provision allowing residents of the new Kansas and Nebraska territories to decide for themselves whether to allow slavery.  This effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had divided the country at the 36° 30' parallel between the pro-slavery South and the anti-slavery North. So Republicans were pushing back against a Democratic piece of legislation, but is the post right to summarize this as ""the Democrats’ plans to expand slavery""? Not really, historians say. The divide at the time was not as much Democrats and what would soon be called Republicans, but simple geography — the North-South split that ultimately fueled the Civil War. ""(The Republican Party) was a party founded by ex-Democrats and ex-Whigs who were opposed to slavery,"" said Joshua Zeitz, an author who has taught history and politics at Cambridge, Harvard and Princeton universities. ""A whole bunch of northern Democrats opposed (the Kansas-Nebraska Act), and that’s why they left the party."" James Thurber, a government professor at American University, agreed. ""It is not accurate nor fair to describe that as the ‘Democrats’ plan,’"" he said in an email. Cohen said the majority of the Democratic Party at the time did support expanding slavery, but they ""were not united in support of slavery, as the (post’s) wording suggests."" A viral Facebook post says the Republican Party started in Ripon, Wis., ""to counter the Democrats’ plans to expand slavery."" The party has clear origins in Ripon, notably because the name of the party originated there. But there were other meetings around that time that can lay claim to being pivotal in the party’s formation as well. More critical to this rating is the over-simplification of the Democratic Party’s stance. The majority of Democrats did indeed support an expansion of slavery, but not all. Northern Democrats opposed that expansion, some of whom abandoned the party to help create the Republican Party. In other words, the split was more geographic than partisan. That leaves us with a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details. That’s our definition of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097238FC0>],/factchecks/2020/may/29/facebook-posts/republican-party-origin-democrats-slavery/

Ron Johnson changes tune on watchdog independence under Trump
","When President Barack Obama was in office, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was a fierce advocate for the independence of inspectors general, a group that serves as the internal watchdogs for the federal government. In comments before Congress, through reports of his committee and in news releases, he  championed the need for oversight through these offices. But some prominent voices have noted a shift from the Wisconsin Republican under President Donald Trump — particularly as Trump has removed five inspectors general in a series of moves many have labeled political retaliation. ""The man who was so worried about politicization of the IGs under Obama has not even offered pro-forma objections to the defenestration of the watchdogs that he used to champion,"" the longtime Wisconsin radio voice Charlie Sykes, a conservative, wrote May 20, 2020, for The Bulwark. ""Even as Trump makes a joke of the independence of the inspectors general, Johnson remains one of Trump’s most eager lieutenants."" A May 18, 2020, Washington Post analysis headlined in part as ""Hypocrisy watch"" noted how Johnson had ""downplayed"" the removals in a recent CNN appearance. That makes this a good time to break out our Flip-O-Meter. Our requisite reminder: We are not measuring whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. We’re just examining whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views. Has Johnson changed his stance on the independence of inspectors general, particularly related to the president? Let’s check the archives. Inspectors general provide oversight and accountability throughout the federal government. The position was created in 1978 after the Watergate scandal. The 74 inspectors and their staff — a total of some 13,000 people across all departments — perform audits, investigations and inspections. They are tasked with finding and deterring waste, fraud and abuse, and reporting their findings to both the agency head and Congress. Inspectors general are appointed by the president for all cabinet-level departments, but are considered non-political positions. Their independence from political officials and the agencies they work in has been fiercely protected over the years — including by Johnson. Since March 2020, Trump has fired or replaced five inspectors general, three of whom the Washington Post described as being removed in apparent retaliation. The May 18, 2020 story laid out the background this way: Acting Health and Human Services Department inspector general Christi Grimm had issued a report on ""severe shortages"" of hospital equipment during the coronavirus outbreak — a report that Trump derided. (State Department inspector general Steve) Linick had issued a report critical of State Department officials and called an ""urgent"" briefing on Ukraine disinformation during Trump’s impeachment, in addition to reportedly investigating (Secretary of State Mike) Pompeo for potentially using official staff for personal errands. The now-ousted intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, had forwarded the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump’s impeachment. Trump was asked about firing Atkinson, and he cited the complaint. ""I thought he did a terrible job,"" Trump said. ""Absolutely terrible. He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report … and he brought it to Congress with an emergency."" Trump has also removed acting Transportation Department inspector general Mitch Behm, and acting Defense Department inspector general Glenn Fine. Both were part of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, monitoring the Trump Administration’s dispersal of the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. Fine was chairman. An array of Democrats have blasted Trump’s actions. U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, joined the chorus, posting May 16, 2020 on Twitter: ""The firings of multiple Inspectors General is unprecedented; doing so without good cause chills the independence essential to their purpose. It is a threat to accountable democracy and a fissure in the constitutional balance of power."" Johnson took a prominent role defending inspectors general in 2015, when many Republicans in Congress were criticizing Obama for delays making permanent appointments. ""It’s just incredibly important to have permanent inspectors general that are completely independent that will provide Congress and the American public transparency and that watchdog assignment — that responsibility for departments and agencies — so that we have awareness of what’s happening,"" Johnson said at a hearing on inspectors general that he chaired. ""It’s the only way we’re going to be able to improve the efficiency, the effectiveness, the accountability of government is to have that type of transparency."" At that hearing, Johnson also criticized the act of ""retaliating against people that were issuing reports"" that their superiors didn’t like, the Washington Post reported. In a June 2015 statement before a Congressional committee hearing, Johnson said permanent inspectors general are needed because they are more secure in their position and less at risk of ""compromising their work to appease the agency or the president."" And a May 2015 report spoke even more directly to the present situation. The report, issued by the Homeland Security Committee, which Johnson chairs, said this in support of the proposed Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2015: ""The power of the President … to remove an IG threatens the IG's independence at a very basic level. The IG Act attempted to temper this power by adding procedural safeguards meant to protect IGs from being removed for political or other nefarious reasons."" On a May 17, 2020, appearance on Jake Tapper’s ""State of the Union’ show on CNN, Johnson addressed inspectors general for several minutes. He first described independence, with a key qualifier about the presidential role. ""I think their independence needs to remain within their agencies,"" Johnson said. ""I’m very mindful of the fact that inspectors general don’t work for Congress. They actually work for the administration. They are part of the executive branch. … They work and serve the president of the United States. … They serve at the president’s will."" As a quick aside, we’ll note it’s a significant stretch to say the inspectors general don’t work for Congress. The act creating the position expressly said one of their purposes is ""to provide a means for keeping the head of the (agency) and the Congress fully and currently informed about problems and deficiencies."" During the CNN appearance, Tapper told Johnson he finds it hard to believe the senator would ""have the same attitude you have now"" if Obama had removed multiple inspectors general in a short time. Johnson, addressing Linick specifically, downplayed the firing, after noting he had issues with Linick responding to one prior oversight request. ""I spoke with senior officials both with the White House and the State Department, I understand their reasoning,"" Johnson said. ""I’m not crying big crocodile tears over this termination: Let’s put it that way."" When inspectors general were up for debate in 2015, Johnson spoke out strongly and repeatedly about the need for independence, saying they shouldn’t compromise their work ""to appease the agency or the president."" He specifically condemned the idea of retaliating against inspectors general for reports superiors didn’t like. A report from his committee even said the president’s ability to remove an inspector general ""threatens the IG’s independence at a very basic level."" Of course, that was under a Democratic president. With a Republican now in the Oval Office and removing several inspectors general for reasons many view as political, Johnson is singing a different tune. He talks about inspectors general serving ""at the president’s will,"" and how they ""work and serve the president of the United States."" That’s a complete change in position, or as we call it, a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000002809749E500>],/factchecks/2020/may/29/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-inspector-general-independence-trump/

First, the term ""Medicare cuts"" has long been volleyed between both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and the White House — and often has proven to be a powerful political tool.  Second, the connection between ""cuts"" to Medicare and the coronavirus pandemic was a new concept we wanted to explore.  We reached out to Priorities USA Action to ask for the basis of these statements.  Josh Schwerin, a PAC spokesperson, sent us a links to news articles and confirmed that the ""$451 billion in cuts"" referred to Trump’s 2021 proposed budget for Medicare.  Asked to pinpoint where the $451 billion came from, Schwerin pointed us to a February ABC News article that said the president’s budget plan would ""whack away at federal spending on health care over the next 10 years ... including $451 billion less spent on Medicare."" He also sent us links to a February Washington Blade article and February press release from Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) — both of which also cited that figure.  In fall 2010, a few months after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, Republicans aired midterm campaign ads attacking Democrats for ""cutting"" or ""gutting"" Medicare. The reason was the law included a $500 billion reduction in projected spending for Medicare over 10 years, which would be used to help fund the ACA.  The Obama administration said the reductions in spending would come from lowering payments to Medicare Advantage plans and providers and would not affect the level of care that Medicare beneficiaries received. They also said it would help make the Medicare system more financially stable.  Now, almost 10 years later, Democrats are using the same language to criticize the White House’s long-term plan for Medicare spending.   ""‘Cuts’ is a term that has been thrown around for many years,"" said Tricia Neuman, executive director of the Program on Medicare Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""This is a semantic issue that often gets politicized, often in an election year."" (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation).  Neuman explained that what is being considered here is a reduction in the projected increase in spending over a certain period. This reduction is based on estimates of how much the government is projected to spend on programs — factoring in proposed policy changes — for the following 10 years, taking into account current levels of spending, assumptions about economic growth and trends in use of Medicare coverage, said Neuman.  Trump’s 2021 budget blueprint for Medicare estimated that spending would increase each of the 10 years. But the estimate also suggested that the administration’s proposed policy changes would reduce the spending increase compared with estimates of what would be spent if the changes were not implemented.  ""Let’s say Medicare spends $100 in 2020 and is projected to spend $200 in 2021,"" Neuman said. ""If the budget said we’re going to reduce the growth in spending by $25, that's a reduction in an increase. But other people might call that a cut.""   We reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicare, for its take on that $451 billion figure, but have not heard back.   Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the actual figure could be anywhere from $400 billion to $600 billion, depending on how calculations are done. His analysis relied on the executive branch’s Office of Management and Budget calculations and landed on a figure close to $505 billion. Other variables, such as ""likely savings from drug price reform"" — yet to be enacted — move it closer to $600 billion.  The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities came up with a similar estimate: $501 billion. The Congressional Budget Office’s estimate not including savings generated from proposed drug pricing reforms was closer to $400 billion.   In all cases, though, the reductions in Medicare spending would be achieved through proposals such as lowering payments to providers and paying the same amount for the same health service offered in different settings, among other things.  Goldwein said these proposals for Medicare reform are largely bipartisan and ""either mimic or build upon"" those advanced during the Obama era. He also said that, in his organization’s view, the ""cuts"" are savings to the Medicare program and beneficiaries, who would see lower premiums and out-of-pocket medical costs.  The policy experts said it’s likely the reductions in spending wouldn’t directly affect the care that Medicare beneficiaries receive. But provider groups have complained that lower reimbursements might drive some doctors to leave Medicare. Hospitals have argued against the proposal for equalizing payments for similar services because they say their overhead expenses are higher than those of a doctor’s office or off-site clinic and their higher rates help finance other necessary services.  The Priorities USA Action ad also alleges that Trump is trying to cut Medicare ""in the middle of a deadly pandemic."" But the timeline of events doesn’t support this statement.  The White House released the 2021 budget proposal on Feb. 10 — well before the COVID-19 outbreak had become a part of our national consciousness.  The first domestic case of COVID-19 was announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Jan. 21. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus a ""public health emergency of international concern"" on Jan. 30.  On Feb. 10, the day the budget was released, the CDC put out a press release stating there were 13 cases of the disease in the U.S. CNN also published an article that day stating the vast majority of COVID-19 cases and deaths had occurred in China. Authorities didn’t announce the first U.S. death from COVID-19 until Feb. 29. The WHO declared a pandemic on March 11.  ""These budget proposals were probably developed well before the pandemic hit the U.S. and hit it hard,"" said Neuman. However, she added, ""the administration hasn’t disavowed these proposals, but they also haven’t pushed them forward.""  Joseph Antos, a scholar in health care and retirement policy at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said it was a ""ridiculous statement to connect cutting Medicare spending to the COVID crisis.""  ""The implication of the video that this is going on actively while we’re in the middle of this crisis, that’s dead wrong,"" said Antos.  The Priorities ad said Trump is trying to make $451 billion in Medicare cuts ""in the middle of a deadly pandemic."" This is an exaggerated attack, even before the pandemic is layered on top of it. The dollar figure itself is ""in the ballpark"" of what the policy proposals would generate in spending reductions, giving this ad a sliver of truth. However, in the Trump budget, the amount is spread out over ten years -- important context that was omitted.    What’s in Trump’s budget proposal is not a direct cut to Medicare benefits. Instead, Priorities uses the age-old political tactic — employed on both sides of the aisle — of holding up a reduction in projected spending growth as a ""cut.""  Moreover, the ad leaves the impression that Trump is trying to whack Medicare for seniors at a time when panic is particularly high because of the coronavirus. But that connection to the pandemic is also misleading. The presidential budget was released weeks before most of the nation began to comprehend the threat of COVID-19.  The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts and context that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B88CC0>],/factchecks/2020/may/29/priorities-usa-action/democratic-super-pac-uses-familiar-political-play-/

CNBC’s Joe Kernen wrong about US per capita COVID-19 deaths
","On the day the U.S. topped 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, CNBC hosts Joe Kernen and Andrew Ross Sorkin shouted over each other about the threat of the virus and its impact on the stock market. After Kernen said Sorkin had panicked about the coronavirus and spooked investors, Sorkin accused Kernen of dismissing the virus as a way to defend President Donald Trump. ""You didn’t panic about anything,"" Sorkin said during the May 27 dust-up on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box."" ""100,000 people died, Joe, and all you did was try to help your friend, the president."" Kernen responded that he has been trying to help investors ""keep their cool, keep their heads,"" adding that ""as it turned out, that’s what they should’ve done."" Then he explained why. ""We’re down near the low end of per capita deaths,"" Kernen said. ""… Most places are at 60 deaths per 100,000. We're at 29."" The next day, the two told viewers that they had made amends, with Sorkin saying they were ""having the conversation that’s happening at everybody’s dinner table."" In case you’re having the same argument over dinner tonight, we wanted to arm you with the facts: Kernen’s claim on deaths per capita isn’t completely accurate. While the U.S. is close to 29 deaths per 100,000 people, it is not ""near the low end of per capita deaths,"" we found. Only a handful of countries have had more deaths per capita. RELATED: Trump’s comparison of COVID-19 deaths in Germany, US is wrong A CNBC spokesperson cited data from Johns Hopkins University tracking deaths per 100,000 people, a metric that public health experts generally consider useful. As of May 26, the day before Kernen’s claim, the U.S. had recorded 30.23 deaths per 100,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins.  That was better than 10 countries. It was worse than more than 130 others, including many nations of similar size. Specifically, the U.S. had more deaths per 100,000 people at the time of Kernen’s comment than all but a handful of European countries: San Marino, Belgium, Andorra, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ireland. Only San Marino (pop. 34,000), Belgium (pop. 11.6 million) and Andorra (pop. 77,000) had more than 60 deaths per 100,000 people. Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy had over 50 deaths per 100,000. Those figures have hardly changed as of May 27. The U.S. is at 30.69 deaths per 100,000 people, behind the same 10 European nations but ahead of the rest.  Three other sources public health experts told us are reliable — the Kaiser Family Foundation, Our World in Data and Worldometer — show similar numbers.  Each source shows the U.S. performing worse than the vast majority of countries. ""We have a very high death rate here compared to most countries in the world, and some of our states have among the highest death rates in the world,"" said Brooke Nichols, assistant professor of global health at Boston University. The U.S., in particular, is ""a patchwork epidemic"" because of its ""expansive, diverse geography and populations,"" Nichols said.  Different geographic areas experience varying outbreaks and death tolls due to a number of factors, such as the age of the population, how far along the epidemic curve the area is and how well the local health care systems have been able to manage, she said. If you compare individual U.S. states to other countries, Nichols said, the situation looks worse. Eleven states plus Washington, D.C have more deaths per million people than the U.S. as a whole, according to Worldometer data for May 28.  Some states are comparable to the worst countries. As we’ve noted, another way to compare countries is to consider recent — rather than total — death counts per capita. But as of May 28, numerous countries have also had fewer daily deaths per capita based on a seven-day average than the U.S., per Our World in Data. Kernen said: ""We’re down near the low end of per capita deaths … Most places are at 60 deaths per 100,000. We're at 29."" The U.S. has hovered slightly above 29 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people in recent days, but it is far from being ""down near the low end of per capita deaths.""  Only a handful of countries are performing worse by that metric, and just three have recorded more than 60 deaths per 100,000.

There’s no plot to microchip people during COVID-19 tests
","Social media users have shared a lot of misinformation about a possible vaccine against COVID-19, including allegations that Americans will be microchipped if they’re vaccinated.  A recent Facebook post uses a similar ploy to discourage people from getting tested for the coronavirus.   ""This is what Bill Gates and George Soros want to do,"" the post says, ""secretly stick you with a chip while testing you for the coronavirus... the Dems have a bill on the House floor ready to vote on it to require this …. House Bill 6666…. no bull…. look it up and WAKE UP!!!!"" The post also shows an illustrated cross-section of a person’s nasal passage and mouth while he tilts his head back. In the illustration, someone with white gloves inserts a long swab up the person’s nose into the nasal passage. An arrow pointing toward the end of the swab says: ""Implant microchip here."" ""If they have to dig this deep to get to ‘infected’ tissues then it isn’t coming out when you talk to someone closer than 6ft,"" reads text over the image.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The coronavirus has killed more than 354,000 people worldwide, and more than 100,000 people in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends staying at least 6 feet away from people outside of your home to prevent being exposed to the virus, which is thought to mainly spread from person to person via respiratory droplets that are produced when someone coughs, sneezes or talks.   This post is wrong to suggest that because COVID-19 testing requires a long nasal swab, infected people can’t produce these droplets that could infect someone else.  ""The swab has to go pretty far back because cells and fluid must be collected from along the entire passageway that connects the base of the nose to the back of the throat to get a really good specimen,"" MD Anderson Cancer Center says in this post about COVID-19 testing.  There are also other COVID-19 tests that are less invasive, such as a throat swab, the center adds, but it’s not as sensitive as the nasal swab.  We’ve previously fact-checked several incorrect claims about coronavirus, microchips and Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates and liberal billionaire investor George Soros.  We couldn’t find any credible evidence to support the claims being made against the men in this Facebook post.  We’ve also already debunked a claim that ""the Democrats are pushing for an implanted microchip in humans, and everyone to be vaccinated."" There is a resolution that was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on May 1 ""to authorize the secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences, and for other purposes."" But H.R. 6666 doesn’t mention microchips or suggest that people should or will be chipped if they’re tested for COVID-19. The resolution isn’t on the ""House floor"" as the Facebook post claims. No action has been taken on the so-called TRACE Act since Rep. Bobby Rush,D.-Ill., introduced it nearly a month ago. Bill Gates also was not involved in crafting the act (and USA Today has more on that in its fact-check).  Gates has recommended contact tracing to end the pandemic. But in an April 23 essay, he says that some countries — China and South Korea among them — have required coronavirus patients to disclose their whereabouts for the past 14 days using GPS information and spending records.  ""It is unlikely that Western countries will require this,"" Gates writes.

Theresa Greenfield’s no-corporate-PAC pledge needs some explanation

","Theresa Greenfield, a Democrat running in the party’s Senate primary in Iowa to face Republican Sen. Joni Ernst in November’s general election, has made her refusal of corporate political action committee (PAC) money a major part of her campaign. Endorsed by the activist group End Citizens United, Greenfield’s campaign website touts a ""grassroots campaign, by Iowans, for Iowans.""  ""I’ve taken a pledge not to take one dime of corporate PAC donations,"" Greenfield said in an Iowa PBS debate with Democratic challengers on May 18.  But how removed is Greenfield from corporate PAC money? Shunning corporate PAC money is generally not a huge sacrifice for Democratic challengers because corporate PACs give almost exclusively to sitting members of Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.  Greenfield has not taken any donations directly from corporate PACs, a review of her most recent Federal Election Commission filings shows. Those filings, covering donations through March 31, show that Greenfield had received $62,100 from Democratic Party committees and $418,512 from other PACs, including Democratic leadership PACs.  Corporate PACs are committees made up of employees of a specific corporation and funded by contributions from those employees. The company cannot donate directly to candidates but can underwrite some of the PAC’s expenses.  Leadership PACs are committees affiliated with current or former members of Congress which often donate to candidates across the country, especially in races that are seen as competitive, such as Iowa’s Senate race.  These leadership donations have raised criticisms from one of Greenfield’s Democratic challengers, businessman Eddie Mauro. He says the PAC money ties Greenfield to special interests,even if it isn’t directly from corporate committees. Mauro hasn’t taken money from any PACs in the primary race according to FEC filings, and his funding comes from individual donations and self-funding.  ""That leadership PAC money that she gets is full of pharmaceutical money, of fossil fuel money, of big ag money, and all kinds of money,"" Mauro said in the Democratic Primary candidates’ debate on May 18.  Greenfield has received donations from 34 leadership PACs totalling $252,300 according to FEC filings, and many of them have in turn received donations from corporate PACs.  Blue Hen PAC, associated with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., has donated $10,000 to Greenfield’s campaign. Pharmaceutical and health product companies are the biggest donors to Blue Hen, according to the CRP, having received $42,500 from pharmaceutical PACs and employees. AbbVie, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and Amgen are a few of the drug companies that have made donations to Blue Hen.  Several other PACs Greenfield has received donations from have similar contributions from drug companies and other corporate industries.  Greenfield received $10,000 from Impact, a PAC associated with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Impact has taken $87,500 in donations from pharmaceutical PACs, $31,500 from Telecom companies, and $22,500 from commercial banks.  Companies that have donated to Impact include Comcast, Facebook, Bank of America, Lockheed Martin, and Honeywell International, as well as many of the same drug companies as Blue Hen. While they make up a small percentage compared to other industries, Greenfield has received some donations from PACs with donors in the fossil-fuel industry.  People’s Voice, a PAC associated with Sen. Tammy Baldwin D-Wi. that has donated $10,000 to Greenfield’s campaign, has received $7,000 in donations from U.S. Venture, a Wisconsin-based petroleum company. Common Ground PAC, associated with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has contributed $10,000 to Greenfield’s campaign. Common Ground received a $2,500 donation from Tellurian Inc, a natural gas company in Texas. This donation makes up a tiny portion of Common Ground’s more than $1 million in funding.  Greenfield isn’t the only candidate in the prima ry who has received these leadership PAC donations. According to FEC filings, retired Navy Admiral Michael Franken has received $1,000 from both Mass PAC, associated with Rep. Michael Capuano, D-Mass., and Defense Dem PAC, associated with Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va.  Still, Greenfield is accurate when she says she hasn’t taken corporate PAC money. She hasn’t taken donations directly from corporations. Advocates for campaign finance reform and Greenfield’s campaign argue that that’s an important distinction.  ""Corporate PACs are a specific designation under the FEC that in practice only exist for corporate special interests to gain influence. As Theresa has pledged, she is not accepting one dime of contributions from corporate PACs,"" Greenfield communications director Sam Newton wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan. Greenfield has been endorsed by End Citizens United, an organization dedicated to reforming campaign finance and overturning Citizens United v. FEC, a 2010 Supreme Court case that allowed corporations more freedom to influence elections. End Citizens United encourages candidates to pledge not to take corporate PAC money, which Greenfield was referencing in the debate. Patrick Burgwinkle, communications director for End Citizens United, said taking leadership PACs does not violate that pledge. Burgwinkle said the separation between corporations and leadership PAC money recipients means the corporations don’t have the same influence over candidates that they would have had they donated directly.  ""If AT&T gave money to a senator, and then that senator turns around and gives money to Theresa Greenfield, AT&T hasn't gotten any access or influence over Theresa Greenfield,"" he said.  The candidate may feel indebted to that particular senator, but a leadership PAC donation doesn’t grant the same access to a candidate that a direct corporate PAC donation does.  Eleanor Powell, an associate professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, agreed, saying leadership PAC contributions don’t grant the same access that corporate PACs do.  Still, leadership PAC donations are a grey area in campaign finance, she said. ""It’s hard to have hard and fast true-false evaluation, given the messiness of modern American campaign finance law,"" she said. ""Our system isn’t really well set up to make these really clear distinctions ... The system, right now, is just sort of inherently messy."" Greenfield says she hasn’t taken any corporate PAC money. That’s largely accurate in the sense that she has no donations directly from corporate PACs. She has been endorsed by End Citizens United, an organization that pushes to end corporate donations to politicians. Her funding is in line with their no-corporate-PAC pledge.  Much of the money she has received from Senate leaders may have originated from corporations. But she didn’t seek it or receive it directly. Campaign finance advocates and experts agree there’s a difference between leadership and corporate PACs.

Tiffany wrong on claim that officials don’t want Wisconsinites to go to doctors, spend time outdoors
","U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, a Republican who won an open seat in Congress in a May 11, 2020 special election, is off to Washington -- but still has his sights set on state government and how it is handling the coronavirus crisis. Tiffany, who spent nearly seven years as a state Senator before winning the seat, tweeted this on May 26, 2020: ""First the health secretary says don't go to hospitals or clinics, now the tourism secretary says don't recreate. What next, the education governor saying no school this fall?"" The tweet linked to an online article from a Madison-based TV station. It came on the day Democrat Gov. Tony Evers’ stay-at-home order originally was going to expire. (The order was lifted May 13, 2020 under a state Supreme Court ruling.) We can’t look into the future, of course, so we’ll have to set aside the bit about what school may look like this fall. But we can look back and see what Department of Health Services secretary Andrea Palm and the Department of Tourism secretary Sara Meaney said in regard to the COVID-19 outbreak. Did Palm say ""don’t go to hospitals or clinics?"" And did Meaney say ""don’t recreate""? No. And: Not exactly. When we asked Tiffany for backup for the claim, his staff pointed to a May 24, 2020 story from WMTV, a Madison-based NBC news affiliate, as it related to tourism and Meaney. This is the article that was linked in his tweet. With a headline of ""Wisconsin tourism officials encourage people to not travel to seasonal homes,"" the article noted Memorial Day weekend is the unofficial start of summer and went on to say:  Travel Wisconsin urged people to stay at their permanent residences when the 'safer at home' order was first announced in March and a month later the department's stance hasn't changed. ""Straight up answer, as the Wisconsin Department of Tourism we are not advising that people travel outside their home communities to recreate,"" Sara Meaney, Secretary of Wisconsin Department of Tourism, said. The rationale: As people travel to cabins and summer homes, it could help spread the coronavirus and potentially overwhelm small healthcare systems in northern communities. In the article, Meaney acknowledged the state can’t stop people from traveling, and suggested those who do travel within the state take personal precautions, such as using face masks, and call ahead to see if any restrictions are in place where they are going. When asked about the statement, Department of Tourism spokesman Craig Trost pointed us to an online toolkit focused on ways to stay safe while enjoying the outdoors.  The toolkit, created with help from the Department of Health Services, includes guides to safely enjoying parks and trails, going boating, fishing, cycling, camping and walking, using ATVs and UTVs, as well as a guide to going to the beach. The toolkit includes this line: ""We encourage all land managers, communities, and businesses that support outdoor recreation to use these tools to help create a consistent statewide message inviting Wisconsinites to get outside, stay safe, and be well."" So, while Meaney discouraged state residents from traveling Up North, the department does not say to avoid any kind of recreation. What’s more, state parks are still open for hiking, along with many boat launches, trails and other recreational sites.  When it comes to hospitals and clinics, a Tiffany staffer said the congressman was ""referring to the cancellation of elective surgeries, DHS encouraging patients to use virtual doctor visits instead of in-person, and DHS recommending that dentists postpone all elective treatments."" But those examples have problems as well. The April 2, 2020 news release from the Department of Health Services, cited by Tiffany, called on residents to use telehealth options during the COVD-19 public health emergency.  Department spokeswoman Jennifer Miller said the agency has never advised against going to see a doctor, but has supported using telehealth -- that is, video visits and the like -- in some cases to get care.  ""We want people to stay connected to their medical providers now more than ever, and to call their doctor especially if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19,"" she said in an email.  Indeed, health facilities -- including dentist offices -- were declared essential during Evers’ stay-at-home order. That said, some hospitals limited elective surgeries and some doctors cut back on in-person visits due to concerns over the transmission of the coronavirus. Likewise, any dentist offices delayed routine things, such as teeth cleanings. Those decisions were made by the health care providers and institutions, though, not mandated by the state. And those institutions have started to take in-person appointments and schedule surgeries again.  Tiffany claimed top state officials called on residents not to travel and not to see doctors. While the tourism secretary discouraged folks from traveling to cabins and tourist areas in parts of the state with fewer hospital beds, the department website is focused on safe travel -- not no travel. And when it comes to seeing doctors, the health secretary advocated using virtual visits where possible, but did not suggest residents avoid treatment. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Let’s break down the three main claims: ""Italy has allegedly discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium. "" This is wrong.  COVID-19 is a disease caused by the virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Bacteria and viruses can create similar symptoms and spread through human-to-human contact, but they are different biologically. Bacteria can replicate without a host cell, but viruses require some kind of host to replicate, explained Emily Bruce, a faculty scientist at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine. Bacteria can replicate themselves because they have developed DNA and are considered a living organism, while viruses usually contain RNA. A late February study analyzing samples from nine new COVID-19 patients found that the disease possessed a ""single strand, positive-sense RNA genome,"" which is a characteristic of coronaviruses and not bacteria. Its genetic makeup was similar to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndromes. It was distantly related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are both coronaviruses that have caused large outbreaks before.  This established the cause of COVID-19 as a virus, as a bacterium would not genetically match with these other coronaviruses. Italy’s Ministry of Health still identifies the cause of COVID-19 as a coronavirus on its FAQ page. ""It clots the blood and reduces the oxygen saturation from dispersing throughout the body."" There is some evidence of blood-clotting problems from COVID-19, but they’re most likely caused by lung complications.  Studies from the Netherlands and France have found a connection between severe COVID-19 and blood clots. The French study found that 23 out of 100 patients with a severe case of COVID-19 had blood clots in their pulmonary artery, which carries blood from the heart to the lungs to be oxygenated. Richard Watanabe, professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine at, agreed that there is new evidence that COVID-19 can cause blood clots and other blood complications. This could be attributed to how ""people infected with COVID-19 develop pneumonia, which impedes breathing and oxygen saturation."" Watanabe said that there needs to be more research on COVID-19 and clots and embolisms, especially with an increase in Kawasaki disease-like symptoms in young COVID-19 patients. RELATED: Top 10 uncertainties about the coronavirus ""They went against the World Health Organization's ‘law’ that no bodies receive autopsies.""  This is inaccurate. There is no recorded announcement from the World Health Organization that autopsies should not be conducted on deceased COVID-19 patients. In fact, the organization released guidance this month on how to perform such an autopsy safely. The first English-language autopsy report on COVID-19 patients was done in Oklahoma, and the findings were published on April 10. Our ruling A social media post claimed that Italy found that COVID-19 is an easily treatable bacteria when it went against WHO’s guidelines and performed an ""illegal"" autopsy.  COVID-19’s cause has been extensively studied and identified as a virus, and the WHO never discouraged autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19. We rate this False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D362C0>],/factchecks/2020/may/28/facebook-posts/covid-19-virus-not-bacterium/

It's unclear how many ingredients, raw materials are imported from China
","Earlier this month, Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., co-signed a letter urging President Donald Trump to bring drug production back to the U.S. and out of China. She’s been a consistent voice against Chinese-made pharmaceutical ingredients, co-introducing a bill last year that would require the Department of Defense to only buy U.S.-made medicine. She later praised action by Trump in March. On March 18, Trump issued an executive order and invoked the Defense Production Act. The law allows the government greater control over private companies in the name of national defense. Enacted in 1950, the law has been used thousands of times each year for everything from missiles to body armor, for the U.S.-Mexico border wall. In some cases, it gives the government priority on an order, say, for face masks. The act allowed Trump to order General Motors to make ventilators. In a news release two days after Trump’s order, Hartzler said she supported the move and would keep pressing the administration to use the DPA authority ""to ensure medical ingredients and raw materials for medications are produced in the United States."" ""Right now, China controls 80% of all ingredients and raw materials going into our generic prescription drugs, allowing them the ability to cut off that supply chain in a moment of conflict,"" she wrote. We decided to look into it because 80% is a big chunk of our prescription drug ingredients. It’s a statistic that has come up in other places before, though in different ways. Last year, Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley wrote that ""80% of (active pharmaceutical ingredients) are produced abroad, the majority in China and India."" More recently, in 2020, a similar statistic has come up in ABC News, AP News, The Hill and Fox News. The earliest use of the statistic we could find was from a 1998 report by the Government Accountability Office, but it didn’t say the ingredients all came from China. So, what’s right, and how applicable is the figure today? First, we’ll define the materials Hartzler referred to: Raw materials are chemical compounds that are used to make other parts of medicine. While they can be used for other things, such as for packaging, raw materials can be mixed to create ingredients for prescription drugs, ranging from binding ingredients to active pharmaceutical ingredients. Active pharmaceutical ingredients are then the active and primary parts of prescription drugs, allowing the drug to do what it needs to do. So, for example, a generic painkiller uses ibuprofen. The ibuprofen is what ends up stopping the pain, so it’s the active pharmaceutical ingredient, but other ingredients are used in the pill, too. Hartzler’s team directed us to the 2019 U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission Report to Congress. The report says a ""substantial portion of U.S. generic drug imports"" is imported. So, of this substantial portion, how many ingredients and raw materials come from China? That 2019 report didn’t say. In a 2010 project from the NSD Bio Group to the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, ""the U.S. imports an estimated 80% of the raw ingredients contained in both products manufactured, sold and consumed in this country."" The statistic, according to the report, was first generated by the Governmental Accountability Office in 1998. Does it mention what percentage of the raw ingredients come from China alone? No. It simply says that the raw ingredients are imported. Raw materials are a muddy area, too. The 2019 Review Commission Report gives many citations with an 80% figure, but only one refers to medicine-making active ingredients. Raw materials are mentioned in the report, but no statistics are given. And the report focuses on active pharmaceutical ingredients, not general ones. ""The United States sources 80% of its (active pharmaceutical ingredients) from overseas and a substantial portion of U.S. generic drug imports come either directly from China or from third countries like India that use (active pharmaceutical ingredients) sourced from China,"" the 2019 Review Commission Report says. So, a lot of generic drug imports are from China, but 80% of active ingredients are ""from overseas."" We can agree that most of the active ingredients come from China; even these places overseas sometimes import the active ingredients from there. The report even says that India ""relies on"" China for 80% of India’s active pharmaceutical ingredients. And how much does the U.S. rely on? Again, that’s hard to say. The FDA does not track the distribution of ingredients, and drug companies do not have to cite where the active ingredients in their drugs came from. In 2019, Janet Woodcock, M.D., the director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , a branch of the FDA, testified about protecting the U.S. medical supply chains. Woodcock said the FDA does ""not know whether Chinese facilities are actually producing APIs, how much they are producing, or where the APIs they are producing are being distributed worldwide, including in the United States."" Woodcock said the FDA does ""not currently know whether (active pharmaceutical ingredient) manufacturing facilities are actually producing the drug, or in what volume."" This is because facilities do not have to report how many active pharmaceutical ingredients they are producing. Tracking active pharmaceutical ingredients can be tricky; a country can create these ingredients and export them for the production of the finished drug. According to the testimony, making active pharmaceutical ingredients in India makes it anywhere from 30% to 40% cheaper for U.S. companies. A product may stop in more than one place to create a finalized product. In the testimony, Woodcock provided a breakdown of where the active pharmaceutical ingredient facilities are that contribute to the U.S. pharmaceutical market. The number of registered facilities that make these ingredients in China ""more than doubled between 2010 and 2019."" By country, in 2019: Thirteen percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facilities are from China. About 18% of these facilities are in India. And 28% are in the U.S. And in terms of prescription drugs, the World Health Organization lists 461 drugs as part of their Essential Medicine List, according to testimony. These meet the ""most important needs in a health system"" and include ""anesthetic, antibacterial, antidepressant, antiviral, cardiovascular, anti-diabetic, and gastrointestinal agents."" The percentages of facilities that make active pharmaceutical ingredients for these drugs are fairly similar to that of the general international ones. Fifteen percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturing facilities for these essential medicines are from China. The U.S. has about 21%. Again, in both the general and essential-medicine active pharmaceutical ingredient facilities, this does not indicate how many ingredients are produced. Regardless, the U.S. still has more facilities than China making these ingredients for the American market. The 2017 FDA at a Glance confirms, saying ""approximately 80% of active pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturers are located outside of the U.S."" Hartzler said, ""Right now, China controls 80% of all ingredients and raw materials going into our generic prescription drug."" While a large part may come from China, putting it all at 80% does not add up. The 2019 Commission Report and the testimony say 80% of active ingredients are from overseas. The government reports credit the figure for all imports of raw materials, and the GAO says active ingredients are made in more than 150 countries. We rate this statement as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AF0E40>],/factchecks/2020/may/28/vicky-hartzler/its-unclear-how-many-ingredients-raw-materials-are/

Are coronavirus cases going down all over the US?
","As the number of coronavirus deaths neared 100,000, President Donald Trump struck an optimistic note about the state of the pandemic.  ""Cases, numbers and deaths are going down all over the Country!"" Trump tweeted May 24. Broadly, Trump has a point that the known spread of the virus has slowed in much of the United States. That said, the virus does continue to spread in some places, even if its rate of spread has declined from its level a few weeks ago. Let’s start with the big picture. Coronavirus deaths shot up quickly in March, peaked in April, and have been falling, though fairly slowly, in May. (The trend line in the following charts is jagged because the daily numbers for both measures tend to be smaller on the weekends before catching up early in the week.)   The same pattern can be found in data for the daily increases in positive coronavirus tests nationally:   In other words, the pandemic is easing, but not disappearing. The velocity of the spread is slowing, but it hasn’t stopped. The number of cases continues to grow. And the national picture hides substantial variation within states. ""The U.S. is a patchwork of local epidemics right now, and looking at an overall national trend will mask sub-national trends,"" said Joshua Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Some places have seen significant declines in case numbers and shrinking epidemics. Some places have not yet seen significant numbers of cases at all. Still other places see ongoing transmission and, in certain locations, epidemics that are growing, albeit slowly."" Let’s look at a few states where the daily number of new cases has declined steadily. Here is the data for New York and New Jersey.    And New York and New Jersey aren’t the only states that have seen clear declines. Using the Kaiser Family Foundation’s data tracker, we found several other states that saw a distinct pattern of declining cases over time: Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. (You can see the patterns most clearly if you visit Kaiser’s data page, click on ""daily trends,"" and select ""seven-day rolling average change in cases"" for each of these states.) By the same token, other states have seen distinct increases over time, something that undercuts Trump’s argument. For instance, here’s a chart showing the daily increase in cases in Alabama, North Carolina, and Virginia:   Using Kaiser’s data tracker, we found several other states that had a distinct pattern of rising cases over time: Arkansas, California, Maine, West Virginia and Wisconsin. And if you drill down beyond the state level, there are localities where coronavirus continues to spread quickly. These ""hot spots"" include counties like Trousdale and Lake, Tenn.; Dakota and Colfax, Neb.; Lincoln, Ark.; Nobles, Minn.; and Ford, Kan., according to New York Times calculations. Often, hot spots have meatpacking plants or prisons where the coronavirus spreads easily. Overall, death rates are declining in large cities and their suburbs, but have leveled off at a high level in medium-sized cities, small cities, towns, and rural areas, according to a data analysis by the Washington Post. Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor in Boston University’s department of global health, noted that the sharp decline in cases in New York City has driven the decline nationally, and that separating out the rest of the country shows only a very small decrease:   Infection counts are subject to external factors, particularly the number of tests conducted. The more you test, the more infections you’ll find. ""Looking at case counts alone can be misleading if you want to know whether local epidemics are getting better,"" said Forrest W. Crawford, a Yale University biostatistician. Still, data from the New York Times show that all states are making progress in at least one regard: a slower increase in infections than earlier in the epidemic.  ""The lockdowns and social distancing did work to slow growth, but not completely extinguish it,"" said Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University. Ultimately, the data is varied enough that observers can choose to look at the glass as either half full or half empty. ""People who want to argue that things are getting better focus on slowing rates of growth,"" Crawford said, while those who argue that things are getting worse focus on declining case counts.  Trump said, ""Cases, numbers and deaths (of COVID-19) are going down all over the Country!"" In general, the daily number of new infections and deaths is going down nationally, and in many states. However, a significant minority of states are seeing the number of new, daily infections rise, and some counties are ""hot spots"" with rapid spread. This suggests a patchwork pattern with generally slower spread than earlier in the pandemic.

Ex-Minneapolis cop misidentified in photo of man wearing a ‘Make Whites Great Again’ hat
","Four Minneapolis police officers were fired on May 26, 2020, after video surfaced of a white officer pinning down a black man by the throat with his knee.

But amid national outrage at what unfolded, misinformation is also spreading. The image of Derek Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, has started to appear on Facebook alongside another photograph of a man with a red baseball cap that reads ""Make Whites Great Again.""

Trump’s Pants on Fire claim that Twitter is ‘completely stifling free speech’ by fact-checking him
","President Donald Trump lashed out at Twitter for tagging a misleading tweet with a ""get the facts"" button, accusing the company of trampling his right to free speech. ""Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!"" Trump said May 26 in one of several tweets attacking the social media platform.  ....Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen! The charge came after Twitter marked Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about mail-in ballots with a label that linked to news articles and said, ""Get the facts about mail-in ballots.""  For years, Twitter has let users like Trump — who has over 80 million followers on the platform — broadcast falsehoods unchecked. Now, Trump has promised ""big action"" against the company and threatened to ""strongly regulate, or close them down."" But six legal experts who study the First Amendment told us Twitter hasn’t violated Trump’s constitutional rights. It’s a private company, and it hasn’t blocked Trump’s speech. ""Assuming Trump means to suggest that Twitter has violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech, he is completely wrong,"" said Mary Anne Franks, professor of law at the University of Miami School of Law. ""They’re not stifling free speech — they’re exercising free speech,"" added UCLA School of Law professor Eugene Volokh. ""They are letting him speak, but responding to the speech with their own. That’s their First Amendment right, just as it’s his First Amendment right to criticize them."" The first problem with Trump’s attack is that it misconstrues the Constitution’s First Amendment protection of free speech. ""The First Amendment was specifically designed to protect you against the government,"" said Kate Klonick, assistant professor of law at St. John’s University School of Law. Twitter isn’t a public utility or an arm of the government. ""There’s no right to speech on Twitter, a private platform,"" said Ellen Goodman, professor of law at Rutgers Law School. As a private entity, Twitter can set its own terms of service and strike or flag posts accordingly, said Nicole Ligon, the supervising attorney of the First Amendment Clinic at Duke Law. ""The president’s free speech is not impaired simply because he disagrees with Twitter’s policies,"" Ligon said, noting that ""he has plenty of other channels"" to speak freely. ""They censor speech all the time that is constitutionally protected,"" such as nudity and hate speech, added Ashutosh Bhagwat, professor of law at the UC Davis School of Law. The second problem with Trump’s claim is that Twitter has marked one post, a move that legal experts said is itself protected under the First Amendment. ""Twitter did not delete his false claims, but merely added the option of accessing correct information to them,"" Franks said. ""This is a very modest exercise of another treasured free speech value, namely counterspeech.""  Volokh, the UCLA law professor, said protections for counterspeech trace back to a ""famous line"" from former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis.  The line, from a concurring opinion in Whitney vs. California, was endorsed in New York Times vs. Sullivan, a landmark 1964 Supreme Court decision about defamation. Brandeis made a case for counterspeech, writing that ""the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones."" ""Simply responding to speech with speech of your own is the very sort of ‘counterspeech’ that the Supreme Court has said is the proper response for speech with which one disagrees,"" Volokh said.  It’s possible that Trump was speaking of free speech in a more vague way. In a general sense, people often ""conflate the robust rights that they’re guaranteed under the First Amendment with general freedom of speech principles,"" Klonick told us. But that argument also falls flat in this case. Franks said it would be ""nonsensical,"" since Twitter didn’t remove anything but instead ""offered correct speech in response to incorrect speech."" If Twitter started taking down Trump’s tweets, Volokh said, then people could reasonably argue that the platform was stifling free speech in this broader sense, even if such action wouldn’t cross the First Amendment’s free speech clause. But that’s not what Twitter is doing. ""What would be a violation is if the government told Twitter to ban Trump’s speech, and then only his speech as a private person, and not the office of the presidency,"" Goodman said. The bigger First Amendment threat, experts told us, is Trump’s vow to take action against Twitter — something he can’t unilaterally do. ""The First Amendment protects Twitter from Trump,"" Klonick said. ""The First Amendment doesn’t protect Trump from Twitter."" Trump said, ""Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH."" Six legal experts told us Trump is wrong. The First Amendment limits the government, not private platforms like Twitter. Twitter’s decision to mark one tweet as misleading is itself protected under the First Amendment.
