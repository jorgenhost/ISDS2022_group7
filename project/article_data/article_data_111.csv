Dewhurst claim that Wendy Davis raised money for socialists group unsupported and ridiculous
","Wendy Davis became debate fodder late in a roundtable showdown between Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and state Sen. Dan Patrick, who will meet in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the Republican Party’s lieutenant governor nomination. Toward the end of their quarrelsome give-and-take joust, hosted May 7, 2014, by WFAA-TV in Dallas, Patrick blamed Dewhurst for igniting Davis’ gubernatorial bid with his oversight of the Texas Senate in the summer 2013 special legislative session in which Davis, a Democratic senator from Fort Worth, filibustered GOP-sought abortion restrictions. Dewhurst scoffed, saying that Republican Greg Abbott, the state attorney general, is winning the governor’s fray. ""And Wendy Davis’s star is falling, not rising,"" Dewhurst said. ""She was just doing a fund-raiser in Chicago with the international socialists organization."" She was? We put that claim to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. We asked Dewhurst’s campaign spokeswoman, Eliza Vielma, for the basis of Dewhurst’s claim, and, by email, she pointed to May 6, 2014, Abbott campaign press release. The Abbott release quoted a Chicago Sun-Times news blog post previewing Davis as a featured guest at a May 5, 2014, Chicago fund-raiser for U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. Abbott’s release also cited an Oct. 16, 2010, post on ""The Corner,"" a National Review Online blog that describes itself as a ""web-leading source of real-time conservative opinion."" The 2010 post, by Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Ethics & Public Policy Center, said that while researching his book, ""Radical-in-Chief: Barack Obama and the Untold Story of American Socialism,"" he came across ""documentary evidence"" that Schakowsky was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America at the start of her political career. Kurtz closed his post by saying the ""idea of socialist politicians working openly or quietly within the Democratic Party is not a wild impossibility but a real phenomenon."" No documents were included in the post to back up Kurtz’s claim that Schakowsky was a member of the socialist group. So we followed up with him. By email, Kurtz said Schakowsky was an ""active member"" of Chicago’s DSA chapter in the 1980s, a conclusion he said he based on chapter newsletters from 1983 and 1986 that he said he viewed in archives at New York University. ""I do not know how long"" Schakowsky ""remained a member of the DSA,"" Kurtz wrote. After we published this fact check, Kurtz told us by email, he sent Breitbart Texas copies of the relevant newsletter pages. Schakowsky is credited as the author of an article in the February/March 1983 issue of the Chicago Socialist, published by the Chicago chapter. Her article recapped a Joliet meeting of the Illinois Public Action Council, a mix of progressive groups. A June 1986 newsletter item, headlined ""DSAers on the move,"" included a sentence stating that on the local political scene, a DSAer had been hired by the chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party while Schakowsky’s bid ""for Cook County Board got a boost when she drew 2nd ballot position among 14 candidates."" The Cook County Board of Commissioners is the county’s legislative body. Also by email, Bob Roman, secretary of the Chicago DSA chapter, told us the posted excerpts were authentic. Schakowsky’s House spokesman, Lee Whack, referred us to her campaign political director, Alex Armour, who didn’t engage. By telephone, Maria Svart, the national director of the DSA, noted the group is an activist and educational group and not a political party. She also reaffirmed what a predecessor in that role, Frank Llewellyn, told PolitiFact in 2011. To join the group, a person must fill out a form and pay dues, Llewellyn said, adding that the last member of Congress who was a card-carrying member was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. Svart also said that while the group doesn’t announce its members, as far as she knows, Schakowsky isn’t a member and never was. Separately, we spotted a web post by the Chicago chapter of the DSA showing Schakowsky spoke at the group’s May 13, 2011, Eugene V. Debs-Norman Thomas-Michael Harrington dinner celebrating union organizers and other activists on the left. A May-June 2011 DSA recap said Schakowsky told guests that despite Democrats being the House minority, she was optimistic in that conservatives in Congress had over-reached. A DSA web page on the history of the annual dinner lists Schakowsky as the 2000 dinner’s honoree. That listing led to another web post detailing why Schakowsky was honored, touching on her actions as a consumer advocate and state and federal legislator. It didn’t speak to her membership (or not) in the DSA. By phone, Roman said Schakowsky is ""not somebody that we claim as a member."" He also said he generally doesn’t comment on whether anyone is current or former member. ""Once you say ‘so and so’ is a member, was a member or was never a member, then you open yourself to queries about any single person who has ever been a member,"" Roman said. To our inquiry, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas (fairly new to Texas) said of Dewhurst’s statement: ""That’s potentially the most absurd claim I’ve ever heard."" Petkanas emailed us a copy of the invitation to the Schakowsky event attended by Davis. The invitation  lacks mention of Davis--and lists Winstead as the star attraction. Petkanas also provided what he described as the prepared text of Davis’ remarks at the event, which do not include an appeal for donations to Schakowsky’s political kitty. ""Davis stopped by the event to talk about Texas and give an update on her campaign,"" Petkanas said. Our ruling Dewhurst said Davis raised money in Chicago for a socialist organization. Davis appeared at a fund-raiser for a Democratic U.S. House member who may have participated in DSA chapter meetings in the 1980s. There’s no sign Schakowsky is a current DSA member, nor is there evidence Davis raised money for a socialist group. This claim shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 6:18 p.m., May 12, 2014: This article was updated to include detail about the newsletter excerpts relied upon by Kurtz, the conservative author.

Abbott claim that Wendy Davis raised money for a member of socialist group unconfirmed, ridiculous
","Republican Greg Abbott says Wendy Davis raised money far from Texas for a U.S. House Democrat who doubles as a member of a socialist group. In a press release headlined ""Sen. Davis Has A Lot To Answer For,"" Abbott said Davis, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, campaigned with U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Chicago, a liberal initially elected to Congress in 1998.  Abbott’s campaign manager, Wayne Hamilton, said in the release: ""Sen. Davis’ fundraising on behalf of an extreme liberal Chicago congresswoman – a member of the Democratic Socialists For America no less – is merely the latest in a series of questions Sen. Davis has refused to answer about her ethics and her judgment."" It’s not unheard of for someone to assert a foe is a socialist. But such claims haven’t held up in our past fact checks and Abbott’s statement ultimately lacked confirmation as well. In 2011, we rated as Pants on Fire a claim that U.S. Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston and Eddie Berniece Johnson of Dallas were among Socialists in Congress. At the time, a leader of the Democratic Socialists of America said no members of Congress were members of its party. The next year, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C.,  gave the same rating to a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that President Barack Obama was a socialist. Abbott’s May 6, 2014, release pointed out that a May 5, 2014, Chicago Sun-Times news blog post said Davis, who had raised money for her own campaign in Chicago May 4, was going to be among featured guests for Schakowsky’s annual ""Ultimate Women's Power Lunch"" at midday along with Lizz Winstead, co-creator of the Daily Show, and Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, Sweet wrote.

Congress propelled fewer bills into law in 2013 for lowest productivity since tallies started in 1947
","U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro bemoaned inaction in Washington, D.C., in a public breakfast interview with the McAllen Monitor. On April 24, 2014, the first-term San Antonio Democrat told Carlos Sanchez, the newspaper’s editor, that after spending 10 years as a state legislator, he was struck by the slow pace of Congress in his rookie year there. Castro said that ""if you look at 2013 in terms of the productivity of Congress, one of the most striking things to me was how each of us ... 535 members of Congress can be very busy during the day ... but at the end of it all not very productive. That was a very strange thing to grasp. 2013 was the least productive year in congressional history since we’ve been keeping records."" Castro continued: ""Harry Truman in the 1940s campaigned against a ‘Do-Nothing Congress’ and that ‘Do-Nothing Congress’ passed over 900 bills. Congress last year passed 67 or so. So that gives you a sense of the context and the environment which I came into, which I experienced in that first year."" Castro had made the same claim just before President Barack Obama gave his latest State of the Union address, according to a Jan. 27, 2014, entry on the Business Insider blog, which also quoted Castro calling the current Congress ""the most gridlocked in American history."" ""Most gridlocked"" strikes us an uncheckable opinion. We asked Castro instead about his ""least productive"" assessment. By email, Castro spokeswoman Laura Zapata provided an audio clip of Castro’s statement at the breakfast, which we used to transcribe what he said. Castro’s staff confirmed the unproductivity of Congress in 2013, Zapata said, after news reports said as much. She said Castro specified 67 bills passing into law because a few other successful proposals simply re-named buildings. Zapata also pointed out an undated chart published by USA Today attributed to information from the U.S. House Clerk’s Office. The chart indicates that through late December 2013, the 113th Congress had passed 72 measures into law. At a glance, the chart suggests that count was lower than any year going back to 1947 when, the chart says, 395 laws came to be. The National Journal reported Dec. 19, 2013, the year's output amounted to the tiniest fraction of 6,366 bills introduced by lawmakers, according to House and Senate records, adding ""fodder to the narrative building in recent years that"" Congress ""has become a dysfunctional, polarized, overly partisan legislative body."" Next, we turned to the website for the clerk’s office, which offers one-page detailed numerical recaps of each year’s congressional proceedings dating back to 1947. According to the web page for 2013, 73 measures made it into law through the year. That was a low compared to previous low-end years including 1995 (88 bills passed into law); 2011 (90); 1981 (145); 1969 (190) and 2012 (193), according to the clerk’s web pages. Our ruling Castro said Congress in 2013 had its least productive year since 1947, advancing 67 bills or so into law. Some 73 bills made it into law in 2013, which was the least by 15 for any year since 1947. We’re taking no position on whether this production was good or bad.

Handel attacks Perdue on tax returns
","In politics, being the rich guy can have its advantages and disadvantages. Case in point, Republican U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue, a former CEO of several large corporations who has risen to the top of the polls. He’s portrayed himself as a by-the-bootstraps candidate offended by the ways of Washington, endearing himself to conservatives. Perdue has also spent a lot of his own money on television ads ridiculing his opponents. One of those opponents, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, recently challenged her fellow candidates to release their income taxes. A Perdue spokesman called it ""voyeurism,"" and Handel criticized his decision. ""David Perdue Flip-Flops Again, Refuses to Release Tax Returns,"" the Handel campaign said in an April 22 press release. Did Perdue flip-flop? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d conduct our own audit. When Perdue entered the race in July 2013, Channel 2 Action News political reporter Lori Geary asked him how open he would be about releasing his financial information. ""Everything,"" Perdue said in the interview. ""I have no problem in that. … I’m going to be totally transparent."" Perdue did not specify whether that included releasing his tax returns. The television report did not say whether he was asked about releasing his tax returns. Four months later, in November, Perdue filled out a financial disclosure report with the U.S. Senate, as required by law. The disclosure forms, though, do not require a candidate to add up his or her entire wealth. The report shows Perdue was a board member of five corporations, collecting nearly $900,000. He held stocks and bonds in about 150 companies. His assets in more than 40 of those companies and entities ranged between $100,000 and $1 million. That doesn’t include the 18 individual retirement accounts Perdue listed in the report and other assets that he and his wife own. A separate report Perdue filed in February shows he owns 2 acres on the wealthy sand of St. Simons Island. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported Perdue’s net worth, after examining his disclosure, at between $11.9 million and $48 million. In recent years, political candidates -- particularly wealthy politicians -- have been pressured to unveil their income taxes in addition to the reports they’re required to fill out. For example, Mitt Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee and a former corporate CEO, responded to those demands by releasing his 2011 return and a summary of returns from the prior 20 years. Critics complained the summary didn’t offer enough details about his finances. President Barack Obama’s tax returns are available online dating to 2000. On April 14, the AJC reported Handel was releasing her taxes and encouraged her Republican opponents to do the same in an ""effort to promote government transparency."" The challenge was seen as directed at Perdue. Two candidates, U.S. Reps. Phil Gingrey and Jack Kingston, agreed to do so. Perdue did not. One week later, on April 21, Handel hammered Perdue, citing the Channel 2 interview. ""David fails to realize that this is an election, not an auction, and that he has an obligation to the voters of Georgia to be transparent and forthcoming about the millions of dollars he is spending to try to buy this election,"" Handel campaign manager Corry Bliss said. ""One can only assume that David has a lot to hide since he has changed his mind on releasing his taxes."" Perdue campaign spokesman Derrick Dickey countered: ""In the time since his first interview as a candidate last year, David has produced detailed personal financial information for the public. After going through that process, at this point it seems that anything more only satisfies some folks’ voyeurism."" Perdue’s cousin, former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, once used a similar line when pressured to release his tax returns. Sonny Perdue said he preferred to release his tax records during campaign season, not while governing. ""I think that's an absolutely appropriate thing to do rather than a sort of voyeuristic sort of thing, "" Sonny Perdue told the AJC. Brian Galle, a former prosecutor in the U.S. Department of Justice’s tax division, said Senate disclosure reports have information that isn’t included in tax returns and vice versa. The disclosure reports contain information about the assets held by a candidate. Galle said tax returns include potentially embarrassing information, such as whether the candidate has lost money through bad financial dealings and how much money -- or little money -- he or she gave away through the charitable contributions category. Galle, an assistant professor at Boston College Law School, said he believes candidates should release their tax returns to the public. ""It ought to be routine,"" he said. On May 1, the Perdue campaign invited two AJC reporters to look at 10 years of the candidate’s tax returns as part of an article on his business record. It showed Perdue earned $55 million and paid $21 million in taxes, or 38 percent, over that period. Over the 10 years of tax returns reviewed by the AJC, Perdue donated about $1 million to charities, or just under 2 percent of his income. The Associated Press also reported it has looked at Perdue’s returns, along with Gingrey’s and Handel’s. Kingston and Michelle Nunn, who’s leading the polls among Democrats vying for the Senate, have said they would release their returns, but neither has done so. Another GOP candidate, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, declined, directing reporters to his disclosure reports. Handel campaign spokesman Dan McLagan, noting the Perdue campaign’s initial comments about voyeurism and its subsequent decision to show the candidate’s tax returns, said Perdue had ""flip-flopped-flipped."" ""It’s a high level of difficulty, and I think (Perdue) missed the dismount,"" McLagan said. To sum up, Perdue agreed to release his financial information when he announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in July 2013. A few months later, Perdue filled out a federal financial disclosure report. In April, Handel criticized Perdue for not releasing his tax returns a week after she challenged her Republican opponents to do so. Perdue has since shown his returns to the AJC and AP. Perdue did show his returns, but only a few weeks after Handel’s challenge. And a pledge of total transparency means your taxes are open to inspection to the public, not just a few reporters. We rate Handel’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/may/09/karen-handel/handel-attacks-perdue-tax-returns/
"['Oregon', 'County Government', 'Elections', 'Infrastructure', 'Deborah Kafoury']","
Did Deborah Kafoury's leadership take the Sellwood Bridge from a languishing project to one now under construction?
","Awful things happen when bridges collapse. The 2007 collapse of the Interstate 35W Mississippi River Bridge in Minneapolis, for instance, left 13 dead and scores more injured. The calamity was blamed on a 1960s design flaw in plates used to connect bridge beams. Closer to home, Multnomah County officials worried about the stability of the Sellwood Bridge for years. No one thought the bridge was about to fall down, but everyone knew it needed to be replaced. Cracks in the structure’s concrete and steel, along with extraordinarily high use -- it’s the busiest two-lane bridge in Oregon -- earned it a two on a federal bridge-safety scale of 100. The Claim Deborah Kafoury was a former state legislator and a Multnomah County commissioner when she stepped down in October 2013 to run for Multnomah County chair. She faces attorney Jim Francesconi and four other candidates in the May 20 primary. Her campaign website lists the Sellwood Bridge among her accomplishments. ""When Deborah took office,"" it claims, ""the project had languished for years, with only $11 million in funds. With her leadership the remaining funding was secured that got the project moving forward."" We wondered if Kafoury deserved that much credit. The Analysis We called Mike Pullen, a Multnomah County spokesman, and asked about the $11 million figure. He emailed an internal budget document titled, ""Sellwood Bridge Funding Plan."" It was dated June 4, 2009, which was five months after Kafoury took office as a commissioner. The document listed four possible financing scenarios. Each added up to the $321 million the project was then estimated to cost. They differed in the amounts expected to be collected from various contributing sources. All four scenarios included $11 million budgeted but unspent in completing a federally mandated environmental impact statement. That backed Kafoury’s claim that only $11 million of the projected $321 million needed to build a new Sellwood Bridge was on hand when she took office. Did her ""leadership"" help vacuum up the rest? Construction is now well under way so we know who’s paying for what. By far the single biggest source is the $141.7 million coming from a $19-a-year Multnomah County vehicle registration fee. We started our check there. Kafoury, who had been a legislator for six years before winning election as a commissioner, told us in a telephone interview that she took the lead in lobbying for a new bridge during the 2009 legislative session. She focused primarily on House Bill 2009, which included a provision giving Multnomah and Clackamas counties the authority to divert increased vehicle registration fees to the bridge. (Clackamas County, on a public vote, later pulled out of the plan.) Kafoury said she traveled frequently to Salem, meeting with, among others, Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, and state Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro. We called Courtney. ""She drove me nuts over that bridge,"" he exploded. ""I’m not making this up. To me, the Sellwood Bridge is Deborah’s bridge."" Multnomah County commissioners are elected on a nonpartisan basis. Still, Kafoury is a Democrat, so naturally Courtney might support her. For balance, we called Starr, a Republican. ""I was managing the funding package for that bill and, based on my conversations with her, the Sellwood Bridge was added to that package,"" Starr said. ""As far as I’m concerned, she was the only person in Multnomah County I dealt with on that issue."" Did Kafoury have as strong a hand in the bridge’s other significant funding sources? The city of Portland, through then-Mayor Sam Adams, had already come out in favor of building a new bridge. Adams caught considerable flak for proposing to spend city money on a bridge it didn’t own. Adams and Ted Wheeler, then county commission chair, were in talks about the bridge when Kafoury joined the commission. When Jeff Cogen succeeded Wheeler, those discussions continued. The aim was inking an intergovernmental agreement specifying the duties and contributions of each. ""But until we had the money in hand from the vehicle registration fees, nothing was going anywhere,"" Kafoury said. ""When I went to Salem and got the funding, I called Sam and asked him for a firm commitment. We’d never have gotten the IGA if I hadn’t gotten the money."" Adams, now executive director of the City Club of Portland, did not dispute Kafoury’s statement. The city’s portion of the project, now with an overall budget of $307.5 million, is $74.5 million. One last piece of the bridge’s financing collage we looked at was a $17.7 million federal grant, awarded in December 2011. Kafoury did join a county delegation that traveled to Washington, D.C., earlier that year to lobby for the grant, according to her and other county workers. But the extensive time spent preparing the grant was substantially ""staff-driven,"" the county’s Pullen said. Without that money, the county would have still been looking at a $20 million funding gap. The Ruling Kafoury, in her campaign for Multnomah County commission chair, cites construction of a new Sellwood Bridge as a major accomplishment. When she took her seat on the commission in 2009, she said, ""the project had languished for years, with only $11 million in funds. With her leadership, the remaining funding was secured that got the project moving forward."" Budget documents confirm that only $11 million was on hand in 2009, and efforts to replace the aging span had been going on for at least several years. It’s also clear that without a lot more money, the project was going nowhere. State legislators from both parties say Kafoury was instrumental in including the Sellwood Bridge in a huge transportation funding bill approved not long after she took office. Yet while that money was key to getting the city of Portland to commit cash, important discussions between the city and county not directly involving Kafoury took place both before and after she was elected. Kafoury also lobbied federal officials for a grant that closed a remaining funding gap, but work around that grant was largely staff-driven. Kafoury played a pivotal role in securing the bridge’s first big chunk of money, which was key to getting it going. But she wasn’t the only to show ""leadership"" on the project. Other legislators had to buy into the transportation bill, and leaders such as Adams, Wheeler and Cogen helped secure money from the city of Portland. We rate Kafoury’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/may/08/deborah-kafoury/did-deborah-kafourys-leadership-take-sellwood-brid/

Does a $10.10 minimum wage get you out of poverty?
","During an appearance on MSNBC, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., touted one of President Barack Obama’s key agenda items -- raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10, Schumer said, ""is important for one reason, and very important to us, which is, it's the bare minimum. You work 40 hours a week, you get out of poverty."" The trouble with Schumer’s claim is that the accepted definition of poverty is actually a sliding scale that depends on the size of a family. We’ll walk you through the math. What raising the minimum wage means Earning $10.10 an hour for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, produces a yearly gross income of $21,008. But people earning that amount also have a good chance of getting money back from the government through the Earned Income Tax Credit -- a provision of tax law that encourages work by low-income Americans. If your income is low enough -- but if you have a paying job -- the government supplements your income through refundable tax credits. Using the calculator at the IRS website, we created some sample taxpaying households. Both have two parents, only one of whom worked, and no complicated tax quirks. One had two children and the other had three. When we input the new minimum-wage level annual income of $21,008, the calculator told us that the EITC would provide an additional $5,370 to the family with two children and $6,040 to the family with three children. (EITC benefits are capped at three children.) So, combined, a hypothetical family of four would get $26,378 in gross income, and a hypothetical family of five would get $27,048. (The size of the tax credit can vary a bit depending on the taxpayer’s situation, but this at least shows the scale we’re talking about.) Is this enough to ""get out of poverty""? Would this be enough to escape poverty? As we noted earlier, the size of the family makes a big difference. The poverty level is not a single threshold, but rather a series of them scaled to the size of the household. (Caution for any statistical geeks reading this: There are actually two poverty federal levels, one calculated by the Census Bureau and one by the Department of Health and Human Services. They track each other pretty closely, but there are some small differences. We calculated our data both ways, and our overall conclusions held regardless of which measure we used. For simplicity, though, we’re only going to show our calculations for the HHS poverty line.) Using the HHS numbers for 2014, the poverty line is $11,670 for a one-person household, $15,730 for a two-person household, $19,790 for a three-person household, $23,850 for a four-person household, and up from there with the addition of each new person. Since the new $10.10 wage would be fully phased in by 2016 (if it’s passed by Congress) we estimated what these poverty guidelines would be in 2016. We did this by increasing the 2014 guidelines by the same percentage as the guidelines increased between 2012 and 2014, which is the most recent two-year period. This produced the following estimated poverty guidelines for 2016:   Persons in household Poverty guideline 1 $12,193 2 $16,354 3 $20,516 4 $24,678 5 $28,839 6 $33,003 7 $37,165 8 $41,329   So if one breadwinner earns a total of $26,378, then the new $10.10 wage, plus an EITC refund, is indeed enough to lift households of one, two, three, and four people beyond the poverty level. But it would be too small to lift the households of five people or more. (The additional EITC refund for a third child isn’t large enough to make a difference.) In other words, while raising the wage to $10.10 does get a lot of households out of poverty, it isn’t quite the guarantee that Schumer suggests. In addition, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 doesn’t get any one-person households out of poverty, because even the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 does that. To measure how ""right"" or ""wrong"" Schumer’s claim is, we wanted to measure what proportion of minimum-wage-worker households included one person, two persons, and so on. But experts told us there is no readily available data on this point. So we used the next best data we could find -- the Census Bureau’s distribution of impoverished households by the size of household. The three household sizes that get boosted out of poverty due to a wage hike to $10.10 -- households of two, three and four people -- collectively account for 46 percent of all households in poverty, according to this Census data. The remaining 54 percent either are out of poverty already at the current minimum wage (one-person households) or wouldn’t exceed the poverty line even after getting a raise to $10.10 an hour (households of at least five people). By that measure, Schumer is right a little less than half the time. These are estimates, but experts said these estimates are reasonable given the available data. A spokesman for Schumer said the statistic came from calculations by the Council of Economic Advisers, an office within the White House. (You can see a chart on page 6 in the slide show here.) The White House chart hangs its poverty-lifting claim on data for a four-person family, which squares with what we found. The problem with Schumer’s claim is that he glossed over some caveats and made too sweeping a case for the power of a $10.10 wage increase to knock out poverty. Our ruling Schumer said a new minimum wage of ""$10.10 is important for one reason … It's the bare minimum. You work 40 hours a week, you get out of poverty."" Raising the wage to $10.10 an hour does indeed put two-, three- and four-person households with one working member above the poverty line for the first time. But it doesn’t achieve a similar feat for one-person households (which already exceed the poverty line under the old, $7.25 wage) or for households of five or more people (who still wouldn’t earn enough with the $10.10 wage to escape poverty). Since the households helped by the $10.10 wage account for 46 percent of all impoverished households, Schumer is right slightly less than half the time. We rate his claim Half True. UPDATE, May 8, 3:15 p.m.: This item has been updated to clarify what calculations we made when determining the percentage of minimum wage workers's households who would be lifted out of poverty due to a rise to $10.10.",/factchecks/2014/may/08/charles-schumer/does-1010-minimum-wage-get-you-out-poverty/

'Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women,' bloggers say
","In the final days of Florida’s legislative session, some conservative blogs claimed that they had unearthed the ""real"" war on women -- a war being waged by Democrats. ""Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women,"" read one headline April 30, 2014, on WesternJournalism.com, a blogging platform for ""conservative, libertarian, free market and pro-family writers."" The story explained: ""Anyone who isn’t certain that Democrats are devoted to destroying America need only take a look at their despicable conduct in the Florida Senate. In a vote that never should have had to be taken, every single Democrat voted to force Sharia law on the people of Florida. By doing so, they placed women and children in very real danger. The vote was 24 votes for America and 14 votes for al-Qaida and the Taliban cast by loathsome Democrats."" The article said that elements of Sharia law include women being barred from voting, forced marriages for young girls, stoning to death of adulterous women and a requirement that women wear burqas -- the full-body clothing required of women in some very traditional Islamic societies -- when in public. While we were distracted by the close of the legislative session and a hotly contested governor’s race, we somehow missed Democrats voting in favor of burqas and stoning. But readers have made clear to us that they want to know: Did Florida Democrats vote to impose Sharia law on women? What the bill was about It's important to note that claims that ""Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women"" are wrong on many levels -- the first of which is that Democratic lawmakers didn't vote affirmatively for doing any of those things. They voted against a bill that would have barred the use of foreign laws in some contexts, something far more limited. Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings. Muslims differ on its interpretation.   At root of the Florida issue is a dispute between a Tampa Islamic center and some of its ousted trustees. In making a ruling on the case in March 2011, a circuit court judge cited Islamic law, sparking outcry from conservatives. That month, two Republican state lawmakers, Sen. Alan Hays and Rep. Larry Metz, announced they would push for a bill to ban foreign law in Florida courts. After several failed efforts, the bill that passed this year -- Senate Bill 386, ""Application of Foreign Law in Courts""  -- was watered down compared to previous versions. The bill doesn’t specifically mention Sharia law, and it doesn’t outright ban the use of Sharia law, said Eduardo Palmer, a Coral Gables lawyer who serves on the legislative committee of the Florida Bar’s international law section. But much of the discussion centered on Sharia law. The bill only applies to family-law cases, including divorce, child support and child custody. It doesn’t apply to other areas of law, such as corporate matters. The bill states ""A court may not enforce: (a) A choice of law provision in a contract selecting the law of a foreign country which contravenes the strong public policy of this state or that is unjust or unreasonable. ... The purpose of this section is to codify existing case law, and that intent should guide the interpretation of this section."" The law allows a judge to agree to apply foreign law as long as it doesn’t contradict public policy in the U.S. For example, if a couple signed a prenuptial agreement in Argentina and later gets a divorce in Florida, a Miami judge could decide to apply Argentina’s law in the divorce case here, Palmer said. But if a foreign law violated our public policy in the United States about child labor rules, for example, then a judge could reject it. ""That is the universal standard that most civilized countries adhere to,"" Palmer said. In reality, the bill doesn’t change existing law, which already allowed judges such discretion. An earlier version would have been much more aggressive -- it would have raised the standards before a judge could have allowed the use of foreign law. A compromise essentially codified existing law. The Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which tracks and counters anti-Islamic attacks, and Florida’s Anti-Defamation League, a group that fights anti-Semitism, both lobbied against the bill. Legislators who voted against the bill argued that it was unnecessary and was tantamount to an attack on Muslims. Rep. Jim Waldman, D-Coconut Creek, told the House ""This bill, this proposal, stems directly from a hatred of Muslims. It's caught on across the country and many other state legislatures have dealt with this, and I find it reprehensible."" Waldman called the bill ""a solution in search of a problem."" A Florida Senate staff analysis in April stated there were six states that currently had laws restricting foreign law in state courts: Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee. (An amendment approved by Oklahoma voters that expressly banned Sharia law was ruled unconstitutional, prompting Legislatures to later go with the more generic ""foreign law."") The Senate approved the bill 24-14, with all the votes in opposition coming from Democrats. The House approved the bill 78-40, with a majority of Democrats voting ""no."" (House Democrats who voted ""yes"" included Daphne Campbell of Miami, Betty Reed of Tampa and Hazelle Rogers of Lauderdale Lakes.) As of May 6, Scott had not signed it into law yet and a spokesman said his office would review the bill. How common and controversial is the use of foreign law in Florida courts? International law experts told us it’s not unusual for foreign law to get used in Florida courts. ""Foreign law is applied all the time, in various ways, and it is almost never controversial,"" said C. Ryan Reetz, a Miami lawyer and chair of the Florida Bar’s international section. For example, parties in international contracts frequently agree to apply a specific foreign country’s law to govern their agreements. ""In addition, there is an entire body of law called 'conflict of laws' or 'choice of laws' that governs when the law of a different state or foreign country will be applied to one or more issues in the case,"" Reetz said. ""As in all other states, the Florida courts have developed a series of conflict of laws rules that address this question. This body of law dates back to the founding of our country, and it has been especially well-documented over the last 100 years."" In contracts, parties can choose to apply the law of any jurisdiction and the court will accept those laws as long as it doesn’t conflict with our Constitution, said Cyra Akila Choudhury, Florida International University law professor who wrote a paper about states passing anti-Sharia laws.   ""The Hillsborough case that is referred to was a contract case in which both parties chose shari'ah as the law,"" she said. ""And the court had to give it credence as the freely chosen legal rules by which the contract was to be interpreted. It was no different than if they had chosen German law, or Klingon law."" The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida opposed the bill, although spokesman Baylor Johnson said the final version ""has relatively little impact on existing law."" ""Just like some folks think that tinfoil hats will protect you from the imaginary threat of aliens reading your thoughts, the ‘foreign law’ bill won’t protect against the imaginary threat of ‘Sharia law’ taking over Florida, because that threat isn’t real,"" Johnson said. Our ruling Claims like this one recently circulated on the internet: ""Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women."" Senate Democrats did vote against a bill that prohibits judges from applying foreign law in family-law cases if it contradicts United States public policy. In reality, though, the bill would have essentially codified existing practice. The bill didn’t single out Sharia law, and the United States Constiution still applies. It’s ridiculous -- beyond ridiculous, really -- to suggest that Senate Democrats forced on women such elements of Sharia law as burqa-wearing and stoning to death.

Dan Kaufman claims Gogebic iron mine could extend 21 miles
","Much of the debate over the proposed Gogebic mine in northern Wisconsin has turned on environmental and economic concerns. Less attention has been paid to the size of the project. In an opinion piece in the New York Times Sunday Review, ""The fight for Wisconsin’s soul,"" Dan Kaufman discusses the open pit iron mine that Gogebic Taconite wants to build in Iron and Ashland counties. Kaufman is a Wisconsin native, writer and musician who lives in Brooklyn N.Y. He’s also a freelance fact checker for the Times and has previously written about Wisconsin politics for the paper. ""The $1.5 billion mine would initially be close to four miles long, up to a half-mile wide and nearly 1,000 feet deep, but it could be extended as long as 21 miles,"" Kaufman wrote in the piece published March 29, 2014. That’s about the distance from Milwaukee’s Bradford Beach to, say, downtown Waukesha. We’ve considered a couple of previous statements that addressed the size of the mine. We rated True a claim by state Rep. Evan Goyke, D-Milwaukee, who said the mine would be larger than his Assembly district, which is among the smallest in the state. State Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, said the mine would be two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago. We rated that Mostly False. So what about Kaufman’s claim that the mine could be 21 miles long? Kaufman said the estimate was based on news reports, and documents that the company filed with the state of Wisconsin. Those records show Gogebic has an option to purchase the iron found in the deposit, which is 21 miles long, threading through the the Penokee mountain range. ""You'll notice our phrase says ‘but it could be extended as long as 21 miles,’"" Kaufman said in an email. ""We don't say it will be for sure. The company has many potential phases outlined of this project."" Here’s how the Department of Natural Resources describes the proposed mine on its website: ""Gogebic is currently considering potential development along a four-mile stretch east of Mellen in west-central Ashland County."" So, what accounts for the difference? Digging in The permit process for the mine is in the early stages, said Larry Lynch, a hydrogeologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He is the agency’s top administrator overseeing the project. The first stage would actually be two pits, each two miles long. That’s different from a single giant trench suggested in Kaufman’s claim. Kaufman describes a mine that if fully developed could be 21 miles long, a half mile wide and 1,000 feet deep. There’s no question this would be an immense project, if it happens. But the mine would never look like that. Lynch said the first phase involves the excavation of a pit, which would, in turn, be filled in by the next pit. (Separately, we rated Mostly True a Kaufman claim that the company would be allowed to fill in ""pristine streams and ponds with mine waste."") In any case, the mine’s first phase would operate for a projected 35 years. The mine faces strong opposition from the neighboring Bad River band of the Chippewa. And the permitting process would be repeated if the company wanted to mine any additional part of the deposit. That would depend upon what happens with the first phase, and comes with a host of unknowns. Geologists believe the deposit extends 21 miles, but Lynch said ""we do not have any information that says it will be economical"" for the company to mine all of the iron in the deposit. The iron in the latter phases might been too difficult to extract, in part because the iron is laced throughout the mountains in that region of the state. In any case, no one is suggesting the mine -- even if it was fully developed decades from now -- would be a single, 21-mile-long pit. Our rating Kaufman says the mine ""could be extended as long as 21 miles."" That’s the size of the deposit that Gogebic Taconite has the rights to mine. But the initial phase envisioned in the permitting process is a four-mile stretch. Any additional mining would require another permitting process and would be decades away. And that’s only if the company decides it’s worth the effort. Yourdictionary.com says: ""The definition of ‘could’ is often used in the place of ‘can’ to show a little doubt."" But there’s more than a little doubt here. Kaufman’s statement may be partially true, but it leaves out important information and details. That’s our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2014/may/08/dan-kaufman/Dan-Kaufman-claims-gogebic-iron-mine-could-extend/

Dan Kaufman: Wisconsin's new mining law would allow streams and ponds to be filled with mine waste
","Debate over the proposed Gogebic Taconite iron ore mine in far northern Wisconsin has quieted since the 2013 passage of a state law relaxing environmental protections for iron mining. But it has not disappeared. Gogebic wants to build a $1.5 billion open pit iron mine in the Penokee Range in Iron and Ashland counties, and has begun what is expected to be a long permitting process with the state Department of Natural Resources. The agency is one of several, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, that will weigh in on the project. Company officials and state business leaders say the mine will provide thousands of jobs in an economically depressed part of the state. Opposition comes from environmentalists, some local residents and members of the Bad River band of the Chippewa, whose reservation lies near the site. Opponents have dug in -- some literally in a North Woods encampment, and some in higher profile venues such as the pages of the Sunday New York Times. Environmental arguments against the project dominated a March 29, 2014 opinion piece in the Times by Wisconsin native Dan Kaufman, a writer and musician who now lives in Brooklyn N.Y. (Kaufman is also a fact checker who works as a freelancer for the Times.) Kaufman’s piece was titled ""The Fight for Wisconsin’s soul"" and detailed the size and scope of what all agree will be an immense project. (In a separate item, we rated Half True a Kaufman claim that the mine ""could be extended as long as 21 miles."") Gogebic had a hand in drafting the 2013 law, which Kaufman says would give the company  ""astonishing latitude"" when it came to building the mine -- including this startling claim: ""The new law allows the company to fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste."" When asked for backup, Kaufman said portions of the law, Section 295, mandate that the state approve the filling of ponds and streams, providing the company re-creates -- the legal term is mitigates -- the filled-in area in another location. ""So, an applicant shall receive DNR approval if they do something to ‘mitigate or compensate’ for the destruction elsewhere,"" Kaufman said in an email interview. But that important point was not mentioned in his original piece. In the interview, Kaufman noted the law doesn’t say where the company would have to do the mitigation work. It could, he argued, be nowhere near the mine. Kaufman’s overall interpretation of the mining law is correct, said Larry Lynch, a hydrogeologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He is the agency’s top official overseeing the project. For years, state law has allowed developers who build on wetlands to re-create an equivalent wetlands in another location. The mining law applied a similar standard to some bodies of water that would be affected by the Gogebic project, Lynch said. ""You can do that under limited situations,"" he said. ""If they are going to have to impact surface waters, they can propose to mitigate."" The law applies to small lakes and streams -- lakes that are smaller than two acres and streams that have a watershed smaller than two square miles. The question of where Gogebic will store waste rock is an important aspect of the mine project. That’s because to get at the iron deposits, the company will have to dig out and remove tons of undesired material from two pits that are each estimated to be two miles long. The rock that’s embedded with the iron is then removed, crushed and the iron removed with giant magnets. Preliminary plans call for the waste rock to be piled on the surface of the ground, an enormous pile called a ""waste facility."" Lynch said the company has not told the state where on the site they propose to locate such a facility -- or said whether any bodies of water could be affected. Tentative plans call for Gogebic to use waste rock from the second pit to backfill the first pit, while the remaining rock would remain on the surface. At this point, the company has not proposed filling in any streams or ponds. ""It will depend on the design submitted at that time,"" Lynch said. ""They may lay it out so that it doesn’t have any impact on streams or lakes."" Our rating The state law aimed at paving the way for the Gogebic mine relaxed environmental regulations for iron mining, and sped up the permit process, steps aimed at giving the company more certainty. Kaufman says that law also lets the company  ""fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste."" Kaufman’s correct that the new mining law allows streams and ponds to be filled in at the mining site. But he left out an important point --  that before that takes place the company and state would have to strike a deal for comparable streams and ponds to be created elsewhere.   We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/may/08/dan-kaufman/Dan-Kaufman-claims-wisconsins-new-mining-law-would/

Hillary Clinton says people don't like health care law, but like its individual components
","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton isn’t saying yet whether she’s running for president in 2016 -- ""I am somebody who has to really mull things over because there is a cost to everything,"" she said on May 6, 2014. Even so, Clinton remains very much in the public eye, including a May 6 keynote address to the National Council for Behavioral Health. In her remarks, Clinton voiced support for the Affordable Care Act and offered a nuanced take on the polling numbers. ""There have been many complaints and concerns about the Affordable Care Act, but I’ve been struck by the polling I’ve been reading, because it tells the same story,"" she said. ""A small majority of Americans don’t think they like the Affordable Care Act, but a large majority of Americans don’t want to do away with the protections that are in the Affordable Care Act. A small majority wants to repeal it, but that is slowly receding as a rising majority says, ‘No, fix it.’ This is the tradition of good, old-fashioned American pragmatism."" We recently fact-checked Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on the public’s support for repeal, which appears to have remained stable in recent months. And recent Kaiser Family Foundation polling shows that from March to April, the percentage of people who said they want improvements to the law jumped from 49 to 58. But what about Clinton’s claim that most Americans want to keep Affordable Care Act protections, even if they don’t like the law itself? Clinton didn’t return our request for comment, but we found her analysis to be on target. According to RealClearPolitics, a political news and commentary site that aggregates polls, an average of five polls found that 52.3 percent of voters expressed opposition to the health care law. That’s a small majority, just as Clinton said. Other surveys record smaller percentages, in the 35 percent to 45 percent range. What about her argument that Americans like specific protections in the law, even as they oppose the law as a whole? The Kaiser Family Foundation’s March 2014 report breaks down how voters feel about different components of the Affordable Care Act. A majority of Republicans, Democrats and independents favored 7 of the 11 elements Kaiser asked about in March. They are: Tax credits to small businesses to buy insurance: 88 percent support Close the Medicare ""doughnut hole"": 81 percent support Create health insurance exchanges: 80 percent support Extend dependent coverage: 76 percent support Subsidy assistance to individuals: 76 percent support Guaranteed issue of insurance policies: 66 percent support Penalties for insurers who spend too little on medical care: 65 percent support On an additional three elements of the law, a majority of Americans expressed support, but only a minority of Republicans: Medicaid expansion: 71 percent An increase in the Medicare payroll tax for upper income earners: 60 percent The employer mandate: 57 percent So on 10 of the 11 elements, substantial majorities of Americans expressed support, justifying Clinton’s claim that ""a large majority of Americans"" support individual elements of the law. But there was one exception: The individual mandate, one of the cornerstones of the law. It attracted the support of only 40 percent of Americans -- 55 percent of Democrats, 39 percent of independents and 21 percent of Republicans. Our ruling Clinton said, ""A small majority of Americans don’t think they like the Affordable Care Act, but a large majority of Americans don’t want to do away with the protections that are in the Affordable Care Act."" An average of recent polls shows that just over 50 percent of Americans favor repealing the law. And a recent Kaiser study shows that ""large majorities"" of Americans favor 10 of the 11 elements of the law the pollsters asked about.

Van Jones: In some states, black defendants are three times as likely to get death sentences than whites for same crime
","Oklahoma’s botched execution revived national concerns over the death penalty, with pundits highlighting who is more likely to pay the ultimate price for the most serious crimes. CNN Crossfire host and liberal pundit Van Jones connected death penalty sentences with race during a May 4 roundtable discussion on ABC’s This Week. Jones claimed that African-Americans are three times more likely than whites to be sentenced to death for the same crime, saying, ""In some states, people for the same crime, three times more likely to sentence an African-American defendant to death. I think that's very, very troubling."" PunditFact wondered: Is that true? Jones’ evidence The death penalty is not allowed everywhere, but 32 states have some form of capital punishment. Jones pointed to a study from the state of Washington as evidence of his claim. University of Washington researchers released a 2014 report examining the role of race in death penalty cases in that state from 1981 to 2012. The team examined trial reports of 285 adult convictions for aggravated murder during that period, controlling for many variables and probing the reports for details. The report was commissioned by attorneys for a Death Row inmate appealing his sentence to the Washington Supreme Court. The team’s most relevant finding to this fact-check: Juries were three times more likely to hand down a death sentence against a black defendant than in cases against white defendants whose cases had similar characteristics. This report is specific to the jury-sentencing stage, which is one stop in the death penalty process. For instance, prosecutors must also decide whether to pursue capital punishment, and there may be plea agreements after they make that decision. Jones sent us more information that we will discuss in the next section. What other studies say The Washington study was the only recent state-centric look at Death Row defendants’ race that experts could name. More often, research shows the victim’s race, not the defendant’s, to be a factor in death penalty cases, they said. Specifically, capital punishment is sought and imposed much more often in cases in which the murder victim is white than in comparable murders involving black victims, said James Acker, a University at Albany-SUNY School of Criminal Justice professor. This has been proven in several jurisdictions, he said, pointing to North Carolina, Georgia, Illinois and Maryland. In other words, it’s who you kill that has a more proven effect in death penalty sentencing, experts say. Other studies have linked defendants’ race and death penalty sentencing, though not always on a state level and not recently. An analysis by researchers including University of Iowa law professor David Baldus, who is cited as one of the foremost researchers addressing questions about race and capital punishment, examined a sampling of death penalty cases in Philadelphia from 1983 to 1993. The analysis found average death sentencing rates were 38 percent higher for black defendants than for other defendants. Baldus, who died in 2011, played a role in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1987 McCleskey vs. Kemp decision, in which the court determined Baldus’ research showing statistical evidence of racial discrimination in Georgia death penalty cases did not make the death penalty unconstitutional. Defendants accused of killing white victims were four times more likely to get the death penalty than those who killed black victims, his research showed. Baldus found then that race-of-defendant disparities existed in several other states, too, though ratios were not available or the studies were not always deemed well-controlled. The vast majority of death penalty cases are decided in state courts. But federal courts also decide some death penalty cases, and a 2000 analysis showed from 1995-2000, 45 percent of capital-crime cases approved for death penalty prosecution by U.S. attorneys involved black defendants, compared to 28 percent involving white defendants (a ratio of 1.6:1). Just because Washington is the only state with a reported 3:1 ratio for death penalty sentencing does not mean there are not more, experts told us. The problem is the data is very time-consuming to collect and analyze. ""This is a very difficult question to pursue in research,"" said Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminology professor, ""because you want to compare race of defendant/victim outcomes in comparable cases."" That’s a lot of information from which to sift, including how the murder was committed and characteristics of the victims and offenders. ""Having conducted such studies in two states (Maryland and South Carolina), it takes years to collect all the data,"" Paternoster said, noting the studies in Maryland and South Carolina did not show much of a disparity depending on the race of the defendant. Jones pointed to a study of racial disparities in inmates facing the death penalty in Harris County, Texas. Paternoster, who conducted the research after being commissioned by a Death Row inmate’s attorneys, found, ""The probability that the district attorney will advance a case to a (death) penalty trial is more than three times as high when the defendant is African-American than for white defendants."" But Paternoster told us his research isn’t necessarily representative of prosecutors’ decisions in Texas or Harris County (nor does it speak to sentences). Paternoster was examining 21 cases -- a subgroup whittled from 504 capital murder cases from 1992 to 1999 -- in which defendants’ crimes matched up with the circumstances of inmate Duane Buck’s double killing. Our ruling Jones said African-American defendants are three times more likely to receive a death penalty sentence than white defendants found guilty of the same crime in some states. We found racial disparities permeate cases surrounding the death penalty. The more proven factor is that the victim’s race affects a defendant’s sentence. Jones pointed us to a 2014 study of jury verdicts in death penalty cases in Washington, as well as other studies of metro jurisdictions. The situation in other states, however, is not as clear. Jones’ claim is partially accurate, as researchers have shown sentencing disparities by race do exist, but the state data to prove a pattern beyond Washington is either old or not exactly in line with the specific ratio Jones cited.

Are Mike Simpson and Nancy Pelosi politically aligned?
","We’ve seen plenty of Democrats called out for voting records that closely align with President Barack Obama and other party leaders. But it isn’t every day that a conservative super PAC claims that an eight-term Republican congressman is closely aligned with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. The Madison Action Fund is claiming just that, running an ad in Idaho linking GOP Rep. Mike Simpson to Pelosi, a frequent target of Republican ire. Here’s what the ad says: ""How liberal is congressman Mike Simpson? Simpson voted with Nancy Pelosi to bail out Wall Street. That wasnt enough spending for Mike Simpson, so he joined Pelosi in voting to take more of your money to fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes. Simpson also joined Pelosi in voting to regulate the sale of firearms."" (We should note that what’s good for the goose is good for the gander: A group backing Simpson is also running ads tying his Republican primary opponent, Bryan Smith, to Pelosi. We checked that claim separately here). Simpson did in fact vote for the Wall Street bailout, as Pelosi did. But beyond that, the ad gets more dubious. Is Simpson a ""liberal""? Despite what the ad suggests, Simpson and Pelosi have very different voting records. In the current Congress, spanning 820 votes, Simpson and Pelosi have voted the same way just 29 percent of the time, according to OpenCongress.org, a website created by the pro-transparency Sunlight Foundation. Still, 29 percent isn’t nothing and some may say, if Simpson was a real conservative, he would vote with Pelosi 0 percent of the time. Maybe, but not every congressional vote is polarized, and even some of the most conservative members of Congress have voted with Pelosi at least on some issues. For instance, no one would confuse Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., for a liberal, yet Bachmann and Pelosi have voted the same way 24 percent of the time since January 2012. Simpson has voted with his party 95 percent of the time. Calling him a liberal and insinuating ideological coziness between him and Pelosi is simply inaccurate. Did Simpson and Pelosi both vote ""to fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes""? This is an exaggeration. The Madison Action Fund’s ad cites a House vote from July 10, 2003. (You read that right — this happened 10 years ago.) On that day, the House of Representatives voted to pass an appropriations bill to fund the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which included money for the National Institutes of Health. An amendment to the bill offered by then-Rep. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., sought to strip funding from five National Institutes of Health research grants. Toomey said one of those grants was a ""study on San Francisco's Asian prostitutes and masseuses."" Simpson voted against Toomey’s amendment. Pelosi (who represents San Francisco) did as well, and it narrowly failed. But Toomey’s description of the research grant might have warranted a ruling from the Truth-O-Meter were it around back then. The grant was awarded to the University of California San Francisco, the home of the AIDS Research Institute, and studied ways to reduce HIV risks among Asian women. Researchers pinpointed commercial sex workers at massage parlors as a key source of the large increase in HIV prevalence among Asian and Pacific islanders in the Bay area, for whom AIDS was the second-leading cause of death among those aged 25 to 44 in San Francisco in 2001. The researchers interviewed sex workers about their background, education, history of violence from customers, and sexual health, in order to develop programs to improve awareness of drug abuse and STD prevention among at-risk Asian-American popuations. Whether this research should have been selected for funding given the limited pool of money available is a reasonable question to debate, but saying it was to ""fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes"" fails to factor in the public-health concerns at stake. Did Simpson and Pelosi vote together ""to regulate the sale of firearms""? This claim goes even further back. The Madison Action Fund singles out Simpson’s votes on the Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act, a 1999 bill that emerged in the aftermath of the Columbine High School shooting. While on the surface the bill added some background check provisions for gun shows, the measure was more complicated. It included an amendment that actually eased restrictions on firearm purchases at gun shows. That measure, which had strong backing from the NRA and was harshly criticized by President Bill Clinton, passed the House with help from 45 Democrats. Simpson voted for it; Pelosi did not. Clinton called the vote ""a great victory for the NRA."" But it also included an amendment that was added to require safety locks to be sold with all handguns. The amendment had overwhelming bipartisan support, including from a majority of Republicans. Simpson voted for it, as did Pelosi, and it passed 311-115. The National Rifle Association ultimately urged Republicans to back the entire bill on final passage. Simpson followed the NRA’s lead and voted for the bill. Pelosi didn’t. And it failed 147-280. So ultimately, Simpson and Pelosi were mostly on opposite sides of the fight over this bill. Most importantly, when it came on votes to ""regulate the sale of firearms,"" Simpson voted to loosen restrictions while Pelosi wanted to maintain the status quo. They only voted on the same side on a measure to require safety locks on handguns. Our ruling The ad cherry picks a handful of votes to create the impression that Simpson and Pelosi are in ideological lockstep. But the votes chosen are old, cherry-picked and deeply misleading. Suggesting any substantial alliance between Simpson and Pelosi is ridiculous.

Did conservative Club for Growth president say he respected Nancy Pelosi?
","An Idaho congressional race has become a key battleground in the face-off between establishment and anti-establishment Republicans. In an attempt to tar its rival with an ideology-bending linkage, Defending Main Street is trying to tie Bryan Smith, the Tea Party challenger to GOP Rep. Mike Simpson, to — of all people — House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. ""Meet the DC insider launching misleading attacks about Mike Simpson,"" the ad says. Then, the ad plays a clip of Club for Growth president Chris Chocola saying, ""The person I respect the most in Washington might surprise you: It’s Nancy Pelosi."" The narrator continues: ""His group spends more money trying to defeat Republicans than defeating Democrats. … And while personal injury attorney Bryan Smith and his financial backers help Pelosi, Mike Simpson is Nancy Pelosi’s worst nightmare."" (Not to be outdone, Smith’s supporters are also trying to tie Simpson to Pelosi. We looked at that ad separately.) In this fact-check, we’ll review Club for Growth’s record in recent campaigns and see whether the ad accurately portrays what Chocola said about Pelosi. What is the Club for Growth? The Club for Growth has supported candidates who are focused on lowering taxes and easing regulations. The club has frequently ruffled feathers within the Republican establishment by endorsing primary challengers to GOP incumbents and by pushing Republicans further to the right in order to head off intra-party competition. For example, in Indiana’s 2012 primary, the club supported Richard Mourdock over longtime Republican Sen. Richard Lugar (Mourdock won the primary but lost the general election). Last year, the club strongly backed the government shutdown to defund Obamacare. In this campaign cycle, they’ve pumped more than $100,000 into Idaho to help Smith oust Simpson in the primary, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the ad, Defending Main Street says the Club for Growth spends more money fighting Republicans than Democrats. They have spent quite a bit — $11.5 million since 2011— running ads against Republicans. That’s about 55 percent of $21 million they’ve spent in the last four years. But the money spent against Republicans wasn’t in general elections to help Democrats, it was in primaries where Republicans had conservative challengers. They’ve also spent more than $5 million attacking Democrats and about $4.5 million running ads supporting Republicans. So it’s true that the group has challenged Republicans, but typically by boosting one Republican against another in GOP primaries. Respecting Pelosi And how about that quote from Club for Growth president Chris Chocola, a former GOP congressman from Indiana? The clip is taken from an American Enterprise Institute discussion called ""Tea party vs. establishment: Who is helping the right, and who is hurting it?"" (Chocola was debating Steve LaTourette, who helped create Defending Main Street.) Chocola was defending Club for Growth’s support for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and like-minded conservatives in the House and Senate who last year pushed Congress to defund Obamacare even at the risk of a government shutdown. Here’s the transcript of Chocola’s remarks:: ""The person I respect the most in Washington my surprise you: It’s Nancy Pelosi. The reason I respect Nancy Pelosi is because she had a historic job. She was the first woman speaker of the United States House of Representatives. And she woke up for 40 years saying, ‘I want to pass nationalized health care.’ And she got the job that she could get it done, and during the process she realized that public opinion polls never get close to 50 percent approval. ... ""But she got it done and she knew it would jeopardize her historic job. She could lose her job over doing what she believed. But she found a way to do it. Because she believed in it so strongly, it’s the law today. Is there a Republican you can think of that is willing to risk their job to do what they think is right? Is there a policy that they’re willing to fight on? … If you don’t like the tactic of Ted Cruz going to the floor and doing a filibuster, what’s yours? What’s your tactic besides surrender? Is it better fight, make a point and lose, or just surrender, making no point?’"" The full context makes it clear that what Chocola admired about Pelosi was her tactical ability  -- her singleminded willingness to pursue her goals in the face of great risks -- and not the substance of what she was fighting for. Chocola didn’t support Pelosi’s policies or Obamacare, but instead wished Republicans would follow her example and take firm stances to pass their priorities. And that’s a very different impression than one would get from the ad. The moderator of the debate, AEI fellow and Washington Examiner columnist Tim Carney, told PolitiFact that he never took Chocola’s statement to mean he had love for Pelosi. ""Main Street's ad struck me as totally misleading,"" Carney said. ""Chocola was clearly saying Republicans need to be as dedicated to their conservative beliefs as Pelosi is to her liberal beliefs. The Main Street ad clearly implies Chocola is a buddy of Pelosi, which was not at all the nature of his remarks."" Our ruling There’s some truth to the claim that the Club for Growth tries to defeat Republicans. One of the club’s key strategies has been to put its money in Republican primaries in order to support the most aggressively conservative candidates. This means taking on some Republicans — but also supporting others. Meanwhile, Chocola clearly said what the ad said he did, but the ad takes that remark wildly out of context. Chocola was expressing admiration for Pelosi’s Machiavellianism, not supporting her political agenda. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/may/07/defending-main-street/did-club-growth-president-say-he-respected-nancy-p/

We said what? NRCC claims PolitiFact Ohio confirmed claim that Rep. Betty Sutton “maxed out federal debt”
","
Is up down? Is red blue? Is rain the same as sunshine?

In Washington, it is, and if it isn’t, someone will insist it is anyway.

So PolitiFact Ohio is amused -- and not entirely surprised -- that when we rated a claim ""Barely True,"" a political organization quickly sent out an e-mail to the press crowing that we had confirmed something that we absolutely did not confirm.

On Tuesday, May 31, we ruled that a claim by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), attacking Democratic congresswoman Betty Sutton, was Barely True. The claim was that Sutton and her Democratic colleagues ran up the nation’s credit card with unsustainable and irresponsible spending and ""now their credit card is maxed out.""

In other words, the nation’s federal debt problem was her fault.

While Sutton certainly voted for various spending bills, as we noted, our reporting also found that wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, President George W. Bush’s tax cuts (extended under President Barack Obama) and the recession played roles in the debt, too.

The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that ""Bush-era tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars — including their associated interest costs — account for almost half of the projected public debt in 2019 (measured as a share of the economy) if we continue current policies.""

But an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation said such an analysis ""fails basic statistics"" because it doesn’t look at Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and discretionary spending.

In other words, you can’t just blame the programs and decisions you don’t like or find convenient and ignore all others.

That cherry-picking criticism was apt for the claim about Sutton.

As we noted, Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling seven times under Bush, and three times under Obama. So yes, Sutton voted for spending bills, as detailed by NRCC spokesman Tory Mazzola, one of the sources with whom we checked while researching this matter. But you cannot ignore the roles that the wars, tax cuts and the struggling economy also played in the nation’s debt. Those were critical facts ignored by the NRCC claim that led to the Truth-O-Meter rating of Barely True.

Fast-forward to 9:51 a.m. today (June 1, 2011).That’s when Mazzola sent out this e-mail news release: ""PolitiFact Confirms Sutton ‘Maxed Out Federal Debt’ As She Ducks For Political Cover.""

In the text of his message, Mazzola wrote: ""POLITIFACT OHIO SAYS TRUE: ‘Betty Sutton and Her Fellow Democrats Went On A Spending Spree And Now Their Credit Card Is Maxed Out.’

For backup, Mazzola noted the sections of our fact-checking in which we quoted or paraphrased him.

He ignored everything else.

We sent him an e-mail this morning (June 1) noting our puzzlement, and he replied. ""By ruling it ‘true,’ albeit barely, you determined that the Democrats' responses were not believable, not credible, or false at least a degree more than ours were true,"" he said.

We could parse, say up is down, left is right, or that it’s snowing in Washington (never mind the heat wave), but Mazzola’s logic on this just won’t fly -- even inside the Beltway.

The Truth-O-Meter defines Barely True this way: The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That description fits the NRCC’s criticism of Sutton.

The Truth-O-Meter has other ratings available, of course, including its lowest, Pants on Fire. 
The definition? ""The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim."" 
One other way to put it is: We said what?

"['Virginia', 'Jim Moran']","
Rep. Moran says GOP requires use of cups in House cafeterias made by Koch Industries
","
At a recent Democrat-sponsored rally to end ""corporate dominance of our Democracy"" at George Mason University, Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, used Styrofoam to make a point.

Lecturing on what he sees as the growing influence of corporations, Moran suggested a link between between the billionaire Koch brothers of Kansas -- the influential conservative owners of Koch Industries -- and a recent preference for Styrofoam in House of Representatives cafeterias.  

""As soon as the Republicans took over the House of Representatives, they threw out all of the biodegradable utensils we were using in the cafeterias and they required us to buy Styrofoam cups and plates and so on that are manufactured by Dixie, and, in fact, this is part of Koch Industries,"" he said.

Moran added: ""The CEO was one of the partners of Koch Industries that is now benefiting from what we have to buy because we’re basically a captive audience in the House of Representatives.""

That sounds like a conspiracy theory worthy of an Oliver Stone movie. But a PolitiFact check is the best we can offer.

We asked Moran’s press secretary where the congressman came up with his information. She didn’t get back to us.

Moran’s initial statement begs two questions: 1) Did GOP leaders require the government to buy Styrofoam products from Dixie; and if so, 2) does Koch Industries benefit from that decision?

Now for the answers.

When Republicans took control of the House in January, House Administration Committee Chairman Dan Lungren, R-Calif., suspended the chamber’s composting program, part of the ""Green the Capitol"" initiative launched by former House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

The program -- which required use of biodegradable corn-based cups, dishes and utensils in the cafeteria -- was costing $475,000 a year to run and a review revealed that it had increased the House’s overall energy consumption, Lungren said.

Democrats were quick to pounce on the decision as environmentally unfriendly, even though the move had been recommended by outgoing Administration Committee Chairman Robert A. Brady of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, in December.

The decision did in fact lead to a move to Styrofoam. Beyond that piece of truth, however, Moran’s claim runs into serious problems.

First, Republicans didn’t make the decision to go to Styrofoam, much less to a Koch-related company. Instead, Restaurant Associates, a company that manages the cafeterias, was given discretion to do what they wanted.

""We just said, `Look, you don’t have to use compostable -- it’s not working. It’s increasing our energy, it’s not reducing our carbon emissions, and it’s costing a half a million dollars a year,’"" said Salley Wood, spokeswoman for the House Administration Committee.

""Of course, they’re going to go to the most cost-effective"" products, she said.

They went with WinCup, which makes Styrofoam products.

And while Dixie is a brand under Georgia-Pacific, owned by Koch Industries, WinCup has no affiliation whatsoever with Dixie apart from the fact that its owner, George Wurtz, years ago served as executive vice president at Georgia-Pacific, which was acquired by Koch Industries in 2005, a year before he left.

""Restaurant Associates is not currently using Dixie products,"" said Dan Weiser, a spokesman for the House chief administrative officer.  

So let’s look back.  

Moran claims that upon taking the House, Republicans ""required"" a move to Styrofoam products made by Dixie, a brand under the Koch Industries umbrella. Problem is, he’s wrong about everything.

The vendor, not House Republicans, decided to move to Styrofoam as a cost consideration after the composting program was discontinued for its ineffectiveness and high costs. And even that decision was based on a recommendation by Democrats.

Next, the company the vendor chose, WinCup, is not at all related to Dixie or Koch Industries, and is in fact a competitor. The fact that the man who owns WinCup once worked for a company that was bought by Koch Industries is irrelevant.

Moran must have been wearing a tin foil hat on the day he came up with this one. Pants on Fire!  ",/factchecks/2011/jun/01/jim-moran/rep-moran-says-gop-requires-use-cups-house-cafeter/

Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Ryan Medicare plan would allow insurers to use pre-existing conditions as barrier to coverage
","
On the May 29, 2011, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. -- recently named chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee -- criticized the proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to make significant changes to how Medicare works.

Currently, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for some types of coverage, and workers contribute payroll taxes.
 
Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would be insured by private insurance companies rather than the federal government, although they would receive ""premium support"" -- financial assistance from the government for buying insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money.

The plans would be sold on an ""exchange"" -- a virtual marketplace -- and would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and provides smaller premium support to high earners. Medicare payments would rise but not at a rate that is expected to keep pace with the growth in medical costs.

The Ryan plan was passed by the House in a near party-line vote, but it has more recently prompted some Republicans to oppose it, amid fears that voters will not be comfortable with its approach.

Wasserman Schultz hit this point hard in her Face the Nation interview. ""Like I said, the Republicans have a plan to end the Medicare as we know it. …"" she said. ""They would take the people who are younger than 55 years old today and tell them, ‘You know what? You’re on your own. Go and find private health insurance in … the health care insurance market. We’re going to throw you to the wolves and allow insurance companies to deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions. We’re going to give you X amount of dollars, and you figure it out.’ And these are people who have paid for their whole life into the system, are counting on that safety net.""

However, critics, including the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, argued that the Ryan plan doesn’t -- as Wasserman Schultz said -- ""allow insurance companies to deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions.""

We decided to take a look.

We’ll start by noting that the budget resolution is a non-binding proposal that has already died in the Senate. So any such plan can make promises -- like no barriers from pre-existing conditions -- without ensuring that those promises will be kept.

That said, the language in the Ryan plan is clear: In 10 years, when the Ryan plan would kick in, anyone who is eligible for Medicare under today’s rules would be eligible to receive coverage under Ryan’s plan.

Here’s the language from the budget that passed the House: ""Health plans that chose to participate in the Medicare Exchange would agree to offer insurance to all Medicare beneficiaries — to avoid cherry-picking and ensure that Medicare’s sickest and highest-cost beneficiaries received coverage.""

The Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching agency -- took this promise at face value when it analyzed the plan.

In its description of the plan, CBO wrote, ""Beneficiaries of the premium support payments would choose among competing private insurance plans operating in a newly established Medicare exchange. Those plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the Office of Personnel Management. Plans would have to issue insurance to all people eligible for Medicare who applied and would have to charge the same premiums for all enrollees of the same age. The premium support payments would go directly from the government to the plans that people selected.""

So the resolution itself and the CBO are in agreement: Under the Ryan plan, insurers participating in the revamped Medicare program would not be able to deny you insurance for pre-existing conditions.

When we contacted Wasserman Schultz’s office, a spokesman, Hari Sevugan, said that Wasserman Schultz stands by what she said. As supporting evidence, he provided a link to a paper by Paul Van de Water, a health policy specialist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

The paper analyzes a Medicare proposal put together by Ryan and Alice Rivlin, a Democrat who headed the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton. The proposal, released in November 2010, is similar in many ways to the Ryan budget proposal that passed the House.

Van de Water (who did not respond to an inquiry for this story) wrote that under the Ryan-Rivlin proposal, ""insurers would surely attempt to shun enrollees in poor health (who cost much more), as private plans do today in the Medicare Advantage program.""

We initially thought that the provisions outlined in the Ryan-Rivlin plan had been changed before the resolution went to the House floor. However, a look at the Ryan-Rivlin plan itself (a two-page outline) shows that the protections for pre-existing conditions are there, too -- in identical language.

""Health plans which choose to participate in the Medicare Exchange must agree to offer insurance to all Medicare beneficiaries, thereby preventing cherry-picking and ensuring that Medicare’s sickest and highest cost beneficiaries receive coverage,"" the Rivlin-Ryan plan said.

So it seems that Ryan has been consistent on the question of pre-existing conditions.

Is there still a way to get around those protections? Possibly. ""There are always ways for insurers to get around bans on pre-existing conditions -- put your office on the 8th floor of a building with no elevator, have no cancer specialists in your network,"" said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. But he added that the same criticism would apply to the health care law passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress and signed by Obama. ""There's nothing uniquely structural to Ryan's proposal that would make it more subject to such evasion,"" Tanner said.

Meanwhile, just because prospective beneficiaries couldn’t be barred due to pre-existing conditions doesn’t mean the Ryan plan would be a walk in the park for them.

Linda J. Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the centrist to liberal Urban Institute, said that a plan that shifts a greater share of costs onto patients -- as the Ryan plan would likely do -- could hit patients with pre-existing, chronic conditions the hardest. ""Big cost-sharing increases effectively shift more of the costs of providing care to those that use it most,"" she said. This would increase the pressure for insurers to cut back on expensive treatments, at least within the confines of the federal rules.

Wasserman Schultz is free to criticize the Ryan plan on any number of grounds, but in her comment, she went too far. Both the budget plan that passed the House and its predecessor, Ryan-Rivlin, specifically noted that coverage could not be prevented by a pre-existing condition. It may be easier to say you’ll bar ""cherry picking"" patients than it is to put it into practice, but Ryan has made his intentions consistently clear. We rate her statement False.

Gwinnett water use down, but by how much?

","
Charlotte Nash, the new head of Gwinnett County government, did some bragging about her county in a recent speech.

One of the claims was about water, specifically how much less H2O Gwinnett homeowners used in recent years.

""Annual water usage in 2010 was actually down more than 18 percent from usage in 2006,"" Nash, chairwoman of the county’s Board of Commissioners, said in her May 18 State of the County address.

Perhaps the statistic was true, considering that county and state officials have pleaded with Georgians to use less water after state environmental protection officials announced a ban on most types of outdoor watering in September 2007. The ban was lifted in June 2009. Currently, political leaders in Georgia, Alabama and Florida are battling over a water-sharing agreement.

A county spokeswoman suggested Gwinnett residents and business owners are being more conscious about conserving water.

""It would seem the water conservation trend that started during the extreme drought continues,"" Gwinnett spokeswoman Heather Sawyer told us in an email to explain why water use has declined in Georgia’s second-highest-populated county.

Sawyer also suggested Gwinnett’s toilet rebate program may be another factor in conserving water. The program gives homeowners a $50 to $100 discount for installing toilets that use less water when flushed.

PolitiFact Georgia was still curious about Nash’s numbers. The county’s population grew, according to U.S. census figures, from 588,450 residents in 2000 to more than 805,000 in 2010, a 37 percent increase. Nash’s statement claimed the county’s water use dropped by 18 percent in four years, yet the county’s population increased by 37 percent over the past 10 years.

Gwinnett officials provided us a spreadsheet with annual water use data dating to 1999. The average daily use for most years between 1999 and 2007 was nearly 84 million gallons a day. In 2007, the year the drought restrictions took effect, the average daily use was 86.4 million gallons a day. In 2008, the average daily use in Gwinnett dropped to just below 72 million gallons a day. The one-year decline was nearly 17 percent.

That one-year decline was actually less than the drop in the region, state officials told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2008. They said water use in North Georgia dropped by 24 percent from August 2007 to August 2008.

We felt better about believing the drop in water use in Gwinnett between 2007 and 2008. So, let’s take a closer look at Nash’s claim of an 18 percent decline from 2006 to 2010.

Sawyer alerted us to an error in the math work. Staffers used the difference between the 2006 and 2009 totals to come up with the 18 percent reduction. Gwinnett officials say the average daily use was 87.4 million gallons in 2006 and 71.3 million gallons a day in 2009. In 2010, the average daily use was 74.7 million gallons a day. That is a 14.3 percent decline.

Since the 14 percent reduction is pretty close to 18 percent, we don’t consider the error to be that egregious. We rate Nash’s claim as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/01/charlotte-nash/gwinnett-water-use-down-how-much/

NRCC says Rep. Betty Sutton's 'spending spree' maxed out federal debt
","
Our government gets some of the cash it needs by borrowing from foreign governments and other investors. As happens when your bills come due and your current income cannot keep up, the United States now needs to borrow even more. To get the money, Congress first must approve a debt limit higher than the current one of $14.294 trillion.

This is a lot like living on a credit card and asking the bank for a higher limit, an analogy that Republicans happen to like, too. In an attack used in some variation on 59 other Democrats in the U.S. House, the National Republican Congressional Committee claimed on May 18, ""Betty Sutton and her fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out.""

Sutton, from Copley Township, Ohio, near Akron, will probably face a re-election challenger next year. For now the NRCC is playing proxy for an eventual foe, accusing Sutton of recklessly spending and driving up the debt to dangerous levels.

But is it Sutton’s and her fellow Democrats’ fault -- is she such a profligate spender -- that the federal credit card has been maxed out?

This struck us as worth checking because of all the other spending and debt debates that have come up over the last decade, and the way that money flows in and out of the federal treasury.

Taxes are one part of the equation, spending the other.

You might remember the tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and former President George W. Bush, tax cuts that were extended in December for two years under Democratic President Barack Obama. While some economists say these were needed to give the economy a kick, they also meant less money came in from tax revenue.

Before the most recent extension, the Congressional Research Service said that the Bush tax cuts, with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion, played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits. Some will argue that tax cuts can actually pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth, but PolitiFact has previously found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth.

The Congressional Budget Office last year said extending all of them permanently, as many in the GOP would like, would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits.

Then there’s the recent economic downturn, which also played a role. And the nation is still engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with billions of dollars flowing out to pay for them. These began during the Bush years and continue under Obama.

The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities posits that just two policies dating from the Bush Administration — tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — accounted for over $500 billion of the deficit in 2009 ""and will account for $7 trillion in deficits in 2009 through 2019, including the associated debt-service costs.""

That’s deficits, but it applies to the debt (formed by cumulative and mounting deficits), says the center. The ""Bush-era tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars — including their associated interest costs — account for almost half of the projected public debt in 2019 (measured as a share of the economy) if we continue current policies,"" the center noted on May 20.

Or as Ezra Klein, the Washington Post economics blogger, wrote on May 23, ""In other words, cut the financial crisis and the major initiatives from the Bush era out of the picture, and we’d be in pretty good shape. In fact, we’d be in great shape.""

We asked Brian Riedl, the lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, what he thought of this analysis. He was blunt. ""Basically, their analysis fails basic statistics,"" he said in an e-mail.

Riedl referred us to his own blog, in which he wrote, ""Imagine a basketball team that loses 100-98. It would make no sense to cherry pick one single basket by their opponent and blame it for 100 percent of the loss – letting all other baskets scored off the hook. Yet that is essentially what CBPP (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities) is doing.""

Riedl’s broader point is that ""one could cherry pick"" any number of spending or tax policies and blame them for the entire problem. ""CBPP chose to pick the tax cuts, wars, stimulus/bailouts, and economic downturn to equal the sum of the deficit. One could have just as easily singled out Social Security and Medicaid (combined cost: $13 trillion), Medicare and net interest costs ($13 trillion), or discretionary spending ($15 trillion) for blame. There is no mathematical reason to single out the programs CBPP selected while ignoring the other costs.""

Where does this leave us?

Each side is cherry picking the numbers. The liberal think tank puts nearly all the blame on the wars, the tax cuts and the recession and its associated costs. The conservative think tank says the blame base is larger and involves entitlements as well as discretionary spending.

We also narrowed in on Sutton, talking with the NRCC; its counterpart, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; and Sutton’s office.

DNCC spokeswoman Haley Morris cited a 2009 PolitiFact item that noted that when Bush took office, the national debt was $5.73 trillion. When he left, it was $10.7 trillion. ""Pretty hard for GOP to argue about maxing out (the) credit card,"" she said.

Sutton’s office referred us to a statement she made in December when she voted to extend the Bush tax cuts. Those cuts were part of a compromise to also continue a form of federal unemployment insurance for jobless Americans running out of benefits. ""I am extremely disappointed that the Republicans insisted on adding billions of dollars to the deficit so that they could provide a bonus tax cut to the super rich and an extremely costly estate tax cut to 3,800 multi-millionaire and billionaire estates,"" Sutton said at the time.

Finally, NRCC spokesman Tory Mazzola told us when was asked about Sutton, ""You can start with the trillion-dollar stimulus bill."" Then there was the health care reform bill in 2010. Those two alone ""get you up to $2 trillion"" that the nation did not have, and it had to be financed, Mazzola said.

He followed up in an e-mail noting Sutton’s votes on two large spending bills, including one for $1.1 trillion, ""which provided an 8 percent discretionary spending hike for the third consecutive year and contained approximately 5,224 earmarks."" The latter bill passed in December 1999, and no House Republicans supported it. Sutton also voted for two previous debt-ceiling hikes, Mazzola said, and for a $26.1 billion bill that Mazzola called a ""state bailout"".

Others described that last bill as a way to help state and local governments struggling with the economic downturn -- and that difference in terminology helps get us to a conclusion.

To say that Sutton ran up the credit card is one way to interpret her record, but it ignores all the other spending and borrowing that factored into the debt. Were the war and the tax cuts the chief culprits? Democrats say so. Conservatives disagree, with Riedl saying that it amounts to cherry picking and ignores all the spending.  

Before ruling, we’re compelled to point out that since 2001, Congress has voted to raise the debt ceiling ten times, according to the Congressional Research Service. Seven of those hikes were under Bush, three under Obama.

Sutton certainly voted for spending, so we won’t rate the NRCC’s claim False. But with trees chock full of cherries, we find the NRCC’s statement to be so selective as to render it Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/may/31/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-rep-betty-suttons-spending-spree-maxed-o/

Wall Street Journal's Steve Moore says U.S. taxes were lower than rivals' in 1980s but are higher now
","
In a May 26, 2011, column in the Wall Street Journal, Stephen Moore, one of the editorial page editors, argued that the United States had low taxes compared to its rivals when Ronald Reagan was president, but now ranks among the world’s highest-taxed nations.

""In the late 1980s,"" Moore wrote, ""the U.S. was nearly the lowest taxed nation in the world, and a quarter century later we're nearly the highest.""

The claim came within a column that argued that proposals by President Barack Obama could effectively raise the marginal tax rate for the nation’s wealthiest taxpayers to 62 percent. We recently checked a similar claim by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who said that Obama policies would lead to a top rate of 44.8 percent. (Ryan’s claim -- which earned a rating of Mostly True -- used less expansive parameters than Moore's did.)

After a reader suggested that we look at the column, we zeroed in on Moore’s claim about comparative international taxes.

We should start off by noting that most comparisons like these are not made with every nation in the world but rather with countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, a group of nearly three-dozen large, industrialized democracies. This makes it a fairer comparison.

Because Moore was writing in the rest of the column about marginal personal income tax rates, we first turned to international comparisons of those rates for the OECD nations. We looked at data for 1988 -- Reagan’s last year in office, and a year when top U.S. marginal tax rates reached a new low -- as well as 2010.

For 1988, the highest marginal tax rate for U.S. taxpayers was 28 percent. Of the 20 countries in the OECD comparison, only one had a lower rate -- Switzerland, at 11.5 percent.

So using this statistic, Moore is correct.

However, top marginal tax rates are an imperfect statistic for this kind of comparison. Perhaps the most important problem is that they only take into account national taxes. Some OECD nations levy relatively light taxes at the national level but heavy taxes at the state and local level. This makes international comparisons using only the national statistic incomplete.

So we turned to another yardstick -- tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product. This measure shows how big the total tax burden is compared with a nation’s economy. It incorporates national, state and local taxes of all types, rather than just income taxes.

OECD statistics are available for 1985, in a study of 26 nations. In the U.S., total tax revenue accounted for 25.6 percent of GDP. Only six nations had a lower percentage -- Mexico, Korea, Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and Turkey -- and several of those were not among the top ranks of industrialized nations in 1985.

So here too, Moore’s has solid backing for his claim that in the 1980s ""the U.S. was nearly the lowest-taxed nation in the world.""

But what about today? Here, the backing is less solid.

Looking strictly at top marginal tax rates, the U.S. rate of 35 percent was solidly in the middle of the pack -- tied for 18th among the 34 nations studied.

Moore’s claim doesn’t hold up any better if you use taxes as a percentage of GDP.

In 2006 -- the most recent year for which an OECD comparison is available -- taxes accounted for 28 percent of U.S. GDP, up modestly from what it was in 1985. All told, 25 nations had a higher percentage than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage.

That hardly makes the U.S. ""nearly the highest"" taxed nation in the world. In fact, in order to rank in the top five nations on the 2006 list, the U.S. would have needed taxes to account for 43 percent of GDP -- about one and a half times their actual share.

When we asked Moore if there was any data we were missing that would prove his point about the U.S. tax burden today, he said, ""today our corporate tax rate is highest and our personal income tax with the Obama proposals (included) would be well above average.""

He’s basically correct that our corporate tax rate is the world’s highest -- we’ve ruled that claim Mostly True in the past, although for many companies, loopholes and other tax rules bring down the rate they actually pay. Even so, nowhere in the column does Moore bring up corporate or business taxes, so we don’t think that’s strong support for his claim.

As for potential tax increases under Obama, those are speculative. Because of that, we don’t see them as justification for stating that ""a quarter century later we're nearly the highest"" in taxation. Moore would have been on safer ground if he’d written, ""If the increases I’ve outlined here are enacted, we might end up with some of the highest tax rates in the world."" But even this would be speculative, since we wouldn’t know what other countries’ tax rates will be if and when the U.S. hikes Moore opposes are enacted.

We have no quarrel with Moore’s characterization of the late 1980s as a period when U.S. taxes were low compared with its rivals. It clearly was. But Moore's main point, that taxes have gone up significantly since the late 1980s, is a stretch. To the contrary, we find convincing evidence that the U.S. today remains a relatively low-tax nation compared to its industrialized competitors. U.S. tax rates might go up over the next few years, but that's speculation, not established facts. On balance, we rate Moore's comment Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/may/31/steve-moore/wall-street-journals-steve-moore-says-us-taxes-wer/

ADL makes claims about losses to Arizona's tourism industry
","

Critics accused Georgia’s new Arizona-style illegal immigration enforcement law of violating civil and human rights. ""Inhumane,"" they called it, and ""the civil rights issue of the 21st century.""

The Anti-Defamation League also accused the law of crimes against the economy. The law, they said, is ""anti-business.""  Major cities and organizations voted to boycott or avoid travel to Arizona after that state passed its tough law last year.

""Convention and tourism business will likely dip, as it did in Arizona, where it is estimated the state has lost more than $100 million in hospitality industry revenues since passage of the Arizona immigration laws,"" the ADL said in a news release April 15.

The claim that estimates show Arizona lost $100 million in hospitality industry revenue intrigued us. Is the ADL right?

Atlanta business leaders fear it is. Last month, the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau's executive committee unanimously passed a resolution opposing Georgia’s law, called House Bill 87.

Arizona’s law requires police to ask a person about his immigration status if they have ""reasonable suspicion"" he or she is in the country illegally. One provision of Georgia’s law gives officers more authority to check a suspect’s immigration status.

Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a separate 2007 Arizona law requiring certain employers to use the federal database E-Verify to check whether their new employees are eligible to work in this country legally.

We asked Bill Nigut, the ADL’s Southeast regional director, for evidence backing his group’s claim about economic losses. He referred us to news accounts from Foxnews.com, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Phoenix Business Journal.

Two May 2010 articles from The Wall Street Journal said the city of Phoenix estimated Arizona’s immigration crackdown could cost it $90 million in convention and hotel business.

The Foxnews.com article cited a report from the Center for American Progress, a progressive group that thinks Arizona’s immigration approach is bad for the economy, that put the loss at $141 million. The rest did not give specific estimates but quoted experts who said the controversy hurt Arizona’s tourism business.

We took a closer look at the Phoenix and Center for American Progress estimates.

Both have limitations. Hotels and convention centers are not required to report lost business to the city or the Arizona Hotel and Lodging Association, which did some of the research on which estimates are based. Not all major convention sites are part of the association, and the group did not poll its members for more data.

Plus, it’s hard to measure how many conventions would have booked in Arizona if there were no boycott.

The city of Phoenix released its $90 million economic loss projection in May 2010. The figure was based on a list of about 20 events whose organizers either canceled or expressed concerns over the state’s illegal immigration crackdown, according to The Arizona Republic.

The figure represents how much conventioneers would have spent in the region over five years. Actual boycott losses are unclear.

So far, four groups have canceled their events at the city-run Phoenix Convention Center at an estimated loss of $26 million in business, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. They would have brought 18,100 delegates, who on average spend $1,451 each on hotels, restaurants, entertainment, transportation and other expenses.  

Phoenix’s figure does not include losses from conventions canceled at venues that are not city-run or future declines from events that never booked. It also does not account for indirect losses (the money businesses would have spent on supplies to serve conventioneers) or induced losses (household spending by people who would have been employed).

Now, we look at figures from the Center for American Progress. It contracted with Elliott D. Pollack & Co., an established economic research and analysis firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., to determine the boycott’s impact on the state’s convention industry.
 
The November 2010 report found the state had already lost $141 million in direct spending on hotels and lodging, restaurants and other areas. With indirect and induced spending, Arizona lost $253 million in economic output.

Jim Rounds, an economist with Elliott D. Pollack & Co., noted that while tourism did lose money because of the cancellations, a portion of the declines were likely due to cuts in state funding for tourism advertising. Also, because few businesses would comment on the record on their losses, his estimate captures only ""roughly half"" of the total impact on tourism from the Arizona controversy.

We asked economists Bruce Seaman of Georgia State University and Tom Smith of Emory University’s Goizueta Business School to review the Center for American Progress study. They brought up shortcomings that were similar to ones Rounds acknowledged but otherwise said the analysis made sense.

Let’s sum up:

The ADL’s claim that ""it is estimated the state has lost more than $100 million in hospitality industry revenues"" has some significant shortcomings.  

No group the ADL cited placed the losses at $100 million. The Center for American Progress placed the direct losses more than 40 percent higher. Phoenix’s estimate was 10 percent lower, limited to city losses and expected to take place over five years.

These, however, are all just estimates and projections. The ADL’s point was that the tourism industry has and will lose millions of dollars.

The overall idea that Arizona will likely lose big money because of the new immigration law is correct. The ADL statement, however, leaves out important details and context.

That fits our definition of Half-True.",/factchecks/2011/may/31/anti-defamation-league/adl-makes-claims-about-losses-arizonas-tourism-ind/
"['Federal Budget', 'Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Eric Cantor']","
Eric Cantor says benefits and salary for public employees are far higher than private sector
","
During a break from Congress last week, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor came home to hear from local business leaders. He got an earful, not all of it from the business community.

As the forum wrapped up, Cantor was confronted by a few angry women, one of them shouting as she approached. They peppered Cantor with questions, and not liking the answers, one of them, a liberal activist with MoveOn.org, hurled insults.

Another woman took a different tack. She explained to Cantor that a friend of hers had recently taken a government job in Washington and was receiving fuel subsidies for the commute. With the high price of gas, the woman asked why shouldn’t she be also receiving fuel subsidies.

Cantor replied that there is an injustice between federal government and private sector employees that he is determined to correct.

""If you look at the benefits and wages of recorded federal employees, they far outstrip the market rates of the private sector,"" he said.

Do they? We thought it was worth a look.

To substantiate the claim, Cantor’s office sent over a few sources including a widely referenced 2010 investigation of federal versus private pay from USA Today.

The newspaper probe relied on 2009 data (still the most current available) from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. It showed that federal civil servants received average pay and benefits of $123,049 while private workers made $61,051 in total compensation.
According to USA Today, federal civilian employees received an average salary of $81,258 and benefits worth $41,791. Private-sector workers got $50,462 in pay and $10,589 in benefits.

Officials from public employee unions and some economists dismiss the compensation comparisons. They say the gap reflects the increasingly high level of skill and education required for most federal jobs and the government contracting out many lower-paying jobs to the private sector.

Another report by USA Today focused on salaries alone. It compared the 2008 pay for 40 occupations that exist in both the federal government and private sector, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

Federal employees earned an average salary of $67,691 while private workers, in the same mix of jobs were paid an average $60,046. That’s a difference of $7,645.

There are arguments on the other side when it comes to pay alone, however.  

Late last year, an annual report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to the Federal Salary Council concluded that federal civilian workers on average are paid 2.1 percent less than private workers.  But as a piece from our friends at FactCheck.org pointed out late last year, experts say there are flaws in the methodology there that prevent a true apples-to-apples comparison.

Howard Risher, the managing consultant on a detailed 1990 report on pay differences recently recently wrote in Government Executive magazine, there’s no way of truly knowing which sector receives higher salaries because ""neither has detailed job-to-job comparisons to support their arguments.""

All of that is well and fine, but it still doesn’t put a dent in Cantor’s claim, which looks at wages and benefits together. All parties agree that federal benefits are far more generous than those in the private sector.

Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, says there are good reasons why federal employees are better compensated the private-sector workers.

Federal employees typically to do more specialized work that requires more education and responsibility than their private-sector peers, he said. Federal workers also often have served longer in their positions than private employees, he added.

""To be surprised that federal workers receive average higher compensation than average private-sector workers is like being surprised when informed that school teachers are paid more than McDonalds’ employees,"" Burtless said.

Still, as the USA Today study found, federal pay was higher than private-sector pay in four out of every five job categories that existed in both sectors. These included accountants, nurses, chemists, public relations specialists, surveyors, cooks, clerks and janitors.

And, as Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute notes, federal pay has risen faster than private-sector pay in recent years, despite the recession.

""BEA data show that average federal salaries rose 58 percent between 2000 and 2009, which was much faster than the 30 percent increase in the private sector,"" Edwards writes.

So let’s look back.

Cantor claims that the ""benefits and wages"" of federal employees far outstrips those of the private sector.

On average, that’s true; total compensation for federal workers is nearly double the private sector average. Looking at salary alone narrows the divide a bit, and some argues private pay even exceeds federal pay, but Cantor played it safe by avoiding specific numbers and including benefits.

As some suggest, there may be solid reasons for the disparity -- expertise, education requirements, responsibility, seniority -- but that doesn’t change the facts. We rate the claim True.    ",/factchecks/2011/may/31/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-benefits-and-salary-public-employ/

State Rep. Rob Eissler says 34 children die from obesity every hour
","
Honoring Dallas physician Kenneth Cooper, who has spent much of his career promoting aerobics, state Rep. Rob Eissler warned against the dangers of obesity. It ""kills 34 children per hour,"" The Woodlands Republican said on the House floor May 23.

Obesity — an accumulation of body fat above the range generally considered healthy for one’s height — increases the likelihood of certain disease and health problems, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among children, the agency says, obesity can foster high blood pressure and heightened cholesterol, breathing and joint difficulties and fatty liver disease.

But does it kill a kid every couple seconds?

Eissler told us he based the claim on a documentary about obesity that premiered at Austin’s Long Center the previous evening: ""Health Needs a Hero."" Both Cooper and Eissler appear in the film, which focuses on childhood obesity.

""People die as a result of disease resulting from obesity,"" Eissler told us.

Jen Ohlson, the founder of PE3, an Austin-based nonprofit that works to curb obesity in schools, wrote, directed and produced the film. She sent us the statement from the documentary that Eissler was referring to: ""Our national cemeteries pay visual homage to American heroes on the battlefields of war. But there’s another battle on the home front: obesity-related diseases. They kill one person every 90 seconds, 34 people every hour, 822 people every single day and 330,000 people"" annually.

Ohlson cited a Wikipedia page and a WikiAnswers page as her source for the declared rates of death-by-obesity.

The Wikipedia page links to a 1999 study that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study, based in part on 1991 national statistics on body mass index distributions, population size and deaths, concluded that 280,000 to 325,000 U.S. adults annually die due to obesity.

We noticed a similar statistic posted online by the CDC. Based on mortality data from the 1970s, the agency said that 365,000 U.S. deaths a year could be attributed to obesity. That’s about 41 deaths an hour.

However, CDC spokeswoman Karen Hunter told us the agency lately estimates that obesity accounts for less than one-third that number: 112,000 deaths a year, or about 13 deaths an hour. According to an undated CDC sheet of frequently asked questions about calculating obesity-related risk, the estimate has dropped in recent years because CDC scientists started using newer data and different methods of analysis.

The 2005 study used different statistical methods to estimate the proportion of deaths related to obesity, taking the decline in obesity-related deaths among older adults into account, according to the sheet.

The sheet says the latest estimate, made public in 2005, is based on mortality data through 2000 from a ""nationally representative sample of U.S. adults,"" and ""appear to reflect a real decline in the risks of dying from obesity-related diseases like heart disease."" According to the sheet, the decline may be related to ""big improvements in the control of risk factors for heart disease"" and advances in ""life-saving interventions for obesity-related diseases,"" such as catheterization.

Note: All these estimated death rates, from the outdated to the most recent, are for adults, not children.

Hunter said the CDC does not know how many U.S. children annually die from obesity. The chronic obesity-related diseases that kill most Americans, including heart disease and diabetes, ""typically take decades to develop."" That is, they show up mostly in adults.  

For more expertise, we reached Stephen Pont, medical director of the Texas Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Childhood Obesity, affiliated with the Dell Children’s Medical Center of Central Texas in Austin. He told us that while he was unaware of any data showing that 34 children die every hour from obesity, the spirit of the claim reflected the magnitude of the problem.

Childhood obesity likely contributes to the number of adults who are estimated to die every hour as as a result of obesity-related diseases, he said. Even so, the mortality numbers are hard to pin down. Hunter told us that ""obesity, while often a contributing factor, is not typically listed as the ‘cause of death’ on a death certificate.""

It’s difficult for doctors to cite that cause on death certificates, according to the CDC’s sheet of frequently asked questions, ""because obesity has so many different effects on so many diseases.""

Obesity isn’t among the leading causes of death for 1-14 year olds, according to 2006 child mortality data on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website. What does kill kids most frequently: Unintentional injuries, cancer, congenital abnormalities and homicide. ""Diseases of the heart"" is the fifth greatest cause of death in among 1 to 4 year olds (1 death per 100,000 children) and 5 to 14 year olds (0.6 deaths per 100,000).

That doesn’t mean obesity isn’t a growing health problem for kids. Since 1980, according to the CDC, instances of obesity among children and adolescents in the United States has almost tripled. According to the 2007-08 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, approximately 17.5 percent of children who are 2-19 years old — 12.5 million — are obese.

According to the Texas Health Institute, an Austin-based nonprofit that works to improve the health in Texas communities, 35 percent of Texas children and more than half of Texas adults are overweight or obese, the Austin American-Statesman reported on May 14.

Time to weigh in.

No doubt, obesity has health consequences across age groups. But Eissler’s claim that 34 children die every hour because of it misstates an outdated statistic solely referring to adult deaths. And, according to the latest data, about 13 adults die every hour due to obesity-related disease — not 34.

The statement is ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2011/may/31/rob-eissler/state-rep-rob-eissler-says-34-children-die-obesity/

Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals chief says 'most' serial killers and people who engage in domestic violence start by abusing animals
","
The Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals wants the legal system to impose harsher sentences in animal cruelty cases.

During a discussion on the issue on WJAR's ""10 News Conference,"" which aired April 24, RISPCA President E.J. Finocchio said animal abusers are allowed to plead ""no contest"" and make a donation to the court instead of paying a fine, a practice that allows them to escape a formal conviction.

It's important to take animal violence seriously, he said.

""Animal cruelty and domestic violence go hand in hand,"" he said. ""Most of your serial killers, most of your people who commit domestic violence, they start off by abusing animals, the weakest of our society -- children, elderly, animals, women -- so there is a direct correlation statistically nationwide that animal abuse and domestic violence go hand in hand.""

We were intrigued by the possibility that animals might be a sort of ""gateway victim"" for most domestic violence perpetrators or serial killers, or that animal abuse might be a harbinger of murder and domestic violence.

When we asked Finocchio for supporting evidence, he sent us the society's winter 2009 newsletter, which mentioned five serial killers and the way they had harmed animals. He also suggested we check a June 2009 study in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence that examined whether animal cruelty is a ""red flag"" for family violence (more about that later).

In addition, we consulted with other experts. The consensus was that there is a link, but it's complicated.

""Animal abuse is strongly associated with a whole host of antisocial behavior running from violence against people to parking ticket violations. It lights up the board,"" said Arnold Arluke, a professor of sociology at Northeastern University.

""The study we did compared animal abusers to people who were not animal abusers. The abusers were five times more likely to have a history of violence toward people, four times more likely to commit a property crime and three and a half times more likely to commit a drug-related offense,"" he said.

The problem, he said, is that animal violence ""is not really a strong predictor or causal agent [of violence toward people]. There's a lot of people who commit animal abuse who do not go on to commit any other violence."" Among those who do, the animal violence is usually ""up close and personal"" (such as when an animal is strangled), the animal is typically known to the abuser, and there has been more than one instance of abuse.

""But,"" said Arluke, ""most cases aren't like that.""

In his statement, Finocchio talked about ""most"" serial killers and ""most"" people who commit domestic violence. Let's consider them separately.

SERIAL KILLERS: We contacted Ann Burgess, a professor of psychiatric nursing at Boston College who coauthored the 1988 book ""Sexual Homicide: Patterns and Motives."" The book is based on interviews with 36 serial murderers. She and her colleagues found that 13 (or 36 percent) had a history of animal cruelty.

""So you can't say most,"" she said, referring to Finocchio's claim.

""The FBI did a study of serial killers and they found fewer than 50 percent had a known history of animal abuse. In fact, some were known as the animal lovers in the neighborhood,"" said Arluke.

The idea of a link between animal abuse and serial killers ""becomes one of the expressions that people who champion [animal protection] like to throw around. It's smart politics because we don't want more serial killers,"" he said. ""But the minute you start to look at every instance of animal abuse as essentially predictive of every person who's going to be a serial killer, if that were the case, we would have tens of thousands of serial killers, and we don't, thank God.""

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PERPETRATORS: Once again, there is good evidence that animal abuse and domestic violence go hand in hand. The question is whether most abusers harmed animals first.

Surveys of women seeking help at domestic violence shelters have found that 46 to 71 percent report that their male abuser had harmed or threatened to harm a pet, according to the ""Red Flag"" study Finocchio referred us to, which was coauthored by Sarah DeGue of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and David DeLillo of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln.

People who engage in domestic violence are known to use pets to intimidate, coerce or control the victimized partner, DeGue and others told us. (In fact, Finocchio's organization serves as a safe haven for the pets of people victimized by domestic violence.)

But women who end up in a shelter constitute a very select group. After all, they aren't the only victims of domestic violence. And such studies don't show whether animal abuse came first.

DeGue and DeLillo said researchers, advocates and policy makers often assume that there's an overlap between animal abuse and domestic violence (including child mistreatment). Yet ""little evidence exists to support this contention.""

In their study of 860 college students they found that ""the majority (73.2 percent) of family violence victims overall did not report any exposure to animal abuse."" So only 27 percent of the victims of domestic and/or child abuse had seen or engaged in animal abuse as well. That's far from a majority, even if you assume that, in all these cases, the abuser started off harming animals.

""I'm not aware of any reliable research studies that have examined animal abuse perpetration as a precursor to domestic partner violence,"" said DeGue, now a behavioral scientist in the division of violence prevention at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""We actually found a number of cases that were the reverse, where people were first violent toward people and then subsequently became violent toward animals,"" said Arluke.

In short, there IS a link between domestic violence and animal abuse because violent people are, well, violent. If Finocchio had simply stuck with his assertion that ""animal cruelty and domestic violence go hand in hand,"" our ruling would be different.

Instead, he made the provocative assertion that there's a progression of violence because ""most of your serial killers, most of your people who commit domestic violence, they start off by abusing animals.""

The experts we consulted -- including one Finocchio sent us to -- said the best evidence shows that a majority of serial killers and domestic assailants do not have a history of animal abuse. The evidence supporting the idea that their first victims are animals is even slimmer.

So the judges unanimously ruled that his statement is False.

Hasner says post-recession job creation at worst since Great Depression
","
As U.S. Senate candidates in Florida gear up their 2012 campaigns, job creation is a hot topic. Republican and former state legislator Adam Hasner criticizes the Democratic incumbent -- Sen. Bill Nelson -- and President Barack Obama for sluggish job creation.

""Obama-Nelson economic record. Job creation ... at slowest post-recession rate since Great Depression,"" Hasner tweeted on May 23, 2011.

Many politicians and experts have talked about the ""jobless recovery"" -- when the economy rebounds but with lackluster job creation. But we wanted to check whether job creation after the most recent recession has lagged behind job creation after every other recession since the Great Depression?

On May 26, Hasner adviser Rick Wilson e-mailed us a May 20 USA Today article linked to in the tweet, which stated ""Nearly two years after the economic recovery officially began, job creation continues to stagger at the slowest post-recession rate since the Great Depression. The nation has 5% fewer jobs today — a loss of 7 million — than it did when the recession began in December 2007. That is by far the worst performance of job generation following any of the dozen recessions since the 1930s. In the past, the economy recovered lost jobs 13 months on average after a recession. If this were a typical recovery, nearly 10 million more people would be working today than when the recession officially ended in June 2009.""

We wanted to do our own checking on job recovery.

First, we obtained the dates of recessions back to the Great Depression from the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan research organization based in Cambridge, Mass. NBER's website has a chart listing the dates of the recessions (written as ""peak and trough""). The ""contraction"" line is the length of each recession. According to NBER, there have been 13 recessions since the one that started August 1929 and lasted for 43 months, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has month-by-month jobs data for 12 of them. 
The most recent recession was from December 2007 to June 2009, or 18 months. It's worth noting that although voters may judge Obama on job creation, that recession was well under way before he was elected president in November 2008.

We contacted economic experts to ask them about Hasner's claim. Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal, labor-backed think tank in Washington, D.C., disagreed with Hasner's claim about job growth: ""It’s not as fast as it could be, but he’s wrong, job growth after the early-2000s recession was slower, the slowest on record,"" she wrote in an e-mail.

Shierholz sent us a chart she created based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which on the left side shows percentage job growth over 22 months (because we are now 22 months from the end of the 2007 recession) following a recession for the last four recessions: 1981, 1990, 2001 and 2007. The chart shows the most sluggish job creation was following the 2001 recession, when the number of employees on non-farm payroll dropped by 976,000. Economists referred to the period as a ""job-loss recovery,"" she said.

""You are not going to find anything that is slower than early 2000 recession,"" Shierholz said in an interview.

But in the 22 months following the 2007 recession, the number of employees increased by 535,000.

And Shierholz sent more in an e-mail: ""The sluggish jobs recoveries following the last three recessions were due (to) slow output growth caused in large part by the fact that they were, to varying degrees, balance sheet recessions. (Balance sheet recessions are caused by real estate or financial asset bubbles bursting –- meaning that people and/or firms have assets that are worth less than their liabilities, so they will opt to pay down their debts rather than invest and consume, which slows growth.)""

We asked Shierholz about the claim in the USA Today article on which Hasner based his tweet.

The USA Today article cited job losses since the start of the recession -- that's not the same as the ""post-recession rate"" that Hasner referred to, after the recession was over. It's simply two different ways to look at job losses or growth.

""The recovery has not been the slowest,"" Shierholz said of the most recent recession. But she agreed that ""starting from the beginning of the recession, we are down more jobs ... than any other recession since the Great Depression; that is true.""

We sent Shierholz's chart to James Sherk of the conservative Heritage Foundation. He suggested measuring from the start of the recession rather than the end otherwise ""you ignore the severity of a recession."" He created his own chart starting from the beginning of the recession, which shows that the job picture is worse for the most recent recession than the previous three.

We e-mailed Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin to ask for a response. He didn't address the accuracy of Hasner's claim comparing job creation after recessions, but argued that Nelson has tried to create jobs by, for example, advocating for high-speed rail in Florida.

We sent Shierholz's chart to Wilson and he responded by e-mail: ""I'm not going to cherry pick obscure economic data: we quoted a sourced USA Today piece for the matter at hand.""

Hasner said that job creation has been at the slowest post-recession rate since the Great Depression. Words matter to us, and we think most readers understand ""post-recession"" to mean after the recession is over. When counting after the recession, the 2001 recession had a slower job recovery. And Hasner isn't providing a complete picture when he labels this the ""Obama-Nelson economic record"" -- the recession started before Obama was elected president and an individual senator can't be blamed for sluggish job recovery any more than Hasner, a former state legislator, can be blamed for unemployment in Florida. Still, Hasner's off by only one recession out of 12. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/may/30/adam-hasner/hasner-says-post-recession-job-creation-worst-grea/

Wisconsin Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller says Abe Lincoln jumped out of a window to deny a quorum
","
Mark Miller, the Wisconsin Senate minority leader, thinks Democratic state senators who fled to Illinois to block a vote on collective-bargaining limits were on the right side of history.

And he’s citing Abraham Lincoln as proof.

In a Journal Sentinel interview on May 18, 2011, the Monona Democrat who led the walkout repeated an anecdote that has been making the rounds for months in various media accounts of the battle over Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s move to curtail collective bargaining.

""When we were in Illinois, we learned that Abraham Lincoln had jumped out of a window in the Illinois Legislature in order to deny a quorum,"" Miller said. ""So we felt like in that case we were definitely in good company.""

Trying to deny a quorum -- that does sound familiar.

But is that fact or just a Lincoln legend?

Some of the details we heard caused us to wonder.

Many accounts, even in some well-regarded Lincoln biographies, claim Lincoln jumped from the second story. Now, we are well aware of the lanky Lincoln’s length, but, really, wouldn’t injury have been the result of such a leap? No injury was reported.

And many accounts refer to Lincoln jumping from the state Capitol building that day, Dec. 5, 1840. But historians note the new Capitol would not open until days later.

So what’s the truth?

We found numerous book and newspaper references to Lincoln’s desperate attempt to block a vote on a banking bill, including an account in Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer David Herbert Donald’s ""Lincoln"" (1995).

Lincoln, an advocate of a strong central banking system, was trying to save the state bank of Illinois.

Donald called it a ""second story"" job at the Capitol building.

Lincoln himself later made a brief speech about his ""jumping scrape"" when the Legislature reconvened in January 1841, historians say, citing legislative documents.

We located the Illinois State Register’s account of that day in the Legislature. The Springfield newspaper’s correspondent said Lincoln ""unceremoniously raised a window"" and jumped through. His account ran on Dec. 11, 1840 -- less than a week after the incident itself.

So, we found no real dispute on the outline of what happened.

But let’s settle some details.

We turned to the co-author of one of the books Donald, who died in 2009, cited for his account: Wayne Temple, chief deputy director of the Illinois State Archives in Springfield. Temple’s book is, ""Illinois’ Fifth Capitol: the House That Lincoln Built and Caused to Be Rebuilt.""

Temple has personally sifted through the newspaper accounts and legislative minutes from the 1840 session.

It happened, Temple told us.

""That’s the story, and I’ve done it from primary sources.""

The episode actually took place at a church serving as temporary legislative chambers, he said. The new capitol building wouldn’t open for the Illinois House until two days later. How does Temple know? ""I have records to show which church got paid,"" he said.

Tour guides at the Capitol sometimes have wrongly told visitors that Lincoln jumped from there, Temple said.

""If he had jumped out of there he would have killed himself,"" he said.

His ""escape,"" Temple said, was from the first floor, not the second.

Lincoln and his Whig Party colleagues had already been tallied as present and voting before they opened the window and jumped out, numerous accounts show.

So Lincoln may have been trying to block a quorum, but he failed.

""It was for naught!"" Temple said.

In Donald’s account, the Whigs were absent for many hours, leaving Lincoln and a few lieutenants behind to watch the proceedings. But they made a procedural blunder, necessitating their quick exit.

Democrats ridiculed Lincoln and his ""flying brethren,"" Donald wrote, noting that ""his celebrated leap caused him no harm because his legs reached nearly from the window to the ground.""

The senators in the ""Wisconsin 14"" ultimately failed to stop a vote, too, but they stayed away for 22 days, allowing massive protests to develop in Madison.

""Lincoln didn’t leave the state -- he didn’t even leave the square,"" Temple told us. ""The sergeant of arms could have gotten him by the nape of the neck and dragged him back.""

Wisconsin has seen its share of quorum-escaping moves over the years, according to a colorful historical account in the Wisconsin State Journal.

One episode, the paper reported, involved state Rep. Ruth Doyle, mother of former Gov. Jim Doyle, refusing to leave the ""ladies powder room"" where she fled to avoid voting on a resolution asking Gen. Douglas MacArthur to address the state Legislature about the ""appeasement of Communists in our own nation and the world.""

Let’s bring this back to the present.

In the summer of 2011, recall elections for state senators will help write history’s view of the tumultuous battle over collective bargaining rights in Wisconsin. It’s premature to predict the outcome now.

But let history record that media accounts in 2011 properly recorded that Abe Lincoln and the Whigs did try to block a quorum in 1840 by staying away. And the future president did leave through a window.

It was a botched attempt, and therefore is a poor comparison to the Wisconsin episode in February 2011.

But Miller heard it right.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Barbara  Boxer']","
Barbara Boxer says Medicare overhead is far lower than private insurers' overhead
","Amid a fierce debate over the future of Medicare, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., recently compared the administrative costs for the government-run program with the costs for private insurers.

""There's a 1.5 percent to 2 percent overhead in Medicare,"" Boxer said during an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews on May 24, 2011. ""The insurance companies have a 20 percent to 30 percent overhead.""

The issue is timely because Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has proposed reducing the government role in Medicare for people now younger than 55. They would receive financial support to buy coverage on the private market. Supporters say such a plan is needed to keep the program fiscally solvent, while detractors say it would gut longstanding protections and promises to seniors.

Boxer’s comment cuts to the core of whether a government-run program like Medicare has advantages over one in which private insurers take a primary role.

First, we should define ""overhead."" People may think of it as things such as rent and electricity. But in health care, the term typically refers more broadly to administrative costs, including expenses that are not strictly medical, such as marketing, customer service, billing, claims review, quality assurance, information technology and profits.

To measure the administrative costs for Medicare, we first turned to the 2011 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds -- the document prepared by Medicare’s fiscal overseers.

The trustees’ summary listed total Medicare expenditures of $522.8 billion for 2010, of which $7 billion was characterized as ""administrative expenses."" That works out to 1.3 percent -- not far off from what Boxer stated.

For the private insurance market, we turned to a 2008 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. CBO cited data, compiled by the McKinsey Global Institute, that estimated administrative costs for private insurers at 12 percent. That’s quite a bit lower than the 20 percent to 30 percent Boxer cited.

A different measurement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pegged the amount for private insurers at 11.1 percent for 2009 -- in the same ballpark.

However, the administrative burden for private plans get more complicated the deeper you dig. There are large variations between different types of insurance plans. The data cited by CBO found that administrative costs were about 7 percent for employers with at least 1,000 employees, but 26 percent for firms with 25 or fewer employees. Meanwhile, in the individual insurance market -- that is, plans secured by individuals on their own, rather than through an employer -- the rate was nearly 30 percent, CBO said.

A big reason for this variation, CBO and others have concluded, is that bigger plans can spread costs over a larger number of people.

When we asked Boxer’s office for their source for the 20 percent-to-30 percent statistic, spokesman Andy Stone told us that prior to passage of the Democratic health care bill in 2010, health plans in California were only required to spend 70 percent of premiums on medical care, with insurers able to spend up to 30 percent on profits and administrative costs. He also cited some opinion and news articles that cited figures in the 20 percent to 30 percent range, and even higher.

We don’t doubt that there are cases in which overhead reaches or exceeds 30 percent, but those cases are both anecdotal and at the high end of the range. The averages cited by CBO and CMS are significantly lower -- 11 percent to 12 percent -- and many of the bigger plans undercut even that level.

There are a few other factors to consider:

Is Medicare’s administrative cost really that low?  A lively academic debate has broken out over whether Medicare’s administrative costs are really as low as 1 percent or 2 percent.

The difference stems from whether Medicare essentially freeloads off other parts of the federal government for services that private insurers have to pay for on their own. Adjusted estimates for Medicare’s administrative costs cited by the Urban Institute, a think tank that does research on issues such as poverty and economics, range from 3.6 percent to 5 percent, rather than the 1.3 percent using the data in the trustees’ report.

But Edwin Park, a health policy specialist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that the differences are overblown, since Medicare’s administrative cost total already includes payments to other agencies for such services.

We won’t settle this question, but we will point out evidence that even when you control for the differences, Medicare is still considerably more cost-efficient. In one study, CBO found that privately run Medicare plans had 11 percent overhead, compared to 2 percent for traditional Medicare.

Are ""overhead"" costs a useful way to measure the efficiency of a health plan?

Not necessarily. As the insurance industry often says -- and independent experts generally agree -- the right kind of administrative expenses may actually lead to cost savings and improved outcomes. These include disease management, wellness programs and quality improvement programs. CBO notes that a heavily managed insurance plan may spend more on overhead but may end up with lower premiums and better outcomes, whereas a lightly managed program may spend less on overhead but end up charging its policyholders more, with less positive results. By this logic, a higher-overhead plan might actually be preferable.

In addition, Henry Aaron, a health care specialist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, suggested that over the long run, Medicare could benefit financially from having higher administrative costs in at least one area -- anti-fraud enforcement.

In other words, measuring overhead is worthwhile, but it has its limitations.

Our ruling

There is some disagreement over how much Medicare pays in overhead. It could be a few percentage points higher than the 1 to 2 percent that Boxer cites. But Boxer’s numbers are defensible since they come straight from the Medicare trustees’ report.

Meanwhile, Boxer’s 20 percent-to-30 percent figure for the private sector is more squishy. Some plans have overhead rates that high, but only a fraction do, and the industry-wide average is quite a bit lower -- 11 to 12 percent.

We’re convinced that Boxer’s underlying point -- that private plans have higher overhead than government plans -- is correct, if for no other reason than that profits matter only for private insurers. But for most plans and patients, the difference between Medicare overhead and private-sector overhead is not as great as she suggests. So we rate her statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/may/30/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-medicare-overhead-far-lower-pri/
"['Natural Disasters ', 'Texas', 'Jay Carney']","
Jay Carney says the Obama admin granted all of Texas' requests for fire management grants
","En route to El Paso with President Barack Obama on May 10, White House press secretary Jay Carney jumped on a reporter’s question about whether the administration’s denial of a disaster declaration for Texas was politically motivated.

In an April 16 letter to Obama, Gov. Rick Perry requested a ""major disaster declaration"" as a result of wildfires that have burned through the state. The request sought federal aid to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of firefighting costs already expended and to help the state fight burning fires in 252 of the state’s 254 counties, including Travis.

On May 3, the Federal Emergency Management Agency rejected the request after concluding that recovery needs did not exceed what state and local governments could handle, according to a May 4 Star-Telegram news article. Besides, Carney told reporters, ""this administration has been extremely responsive to the state of Texas’ requests for wildfire management assisting grants — 25 of them at last count,"" he said. ""All that have been requested had been, as far as I know it, have been provided.""

Indeed, the state has received 27 grants requested in connection with 27 wildfires that burned about 1 million acres in 31 counties. The grants cover 75 percent of the firefighting costs associated with the 27 fires. FEMA spokeswoman Rachel Racusen later told us the grants factored into the agency’s denial of the request for the disaster declaration because they ""fund many of the same emergency response activities Gov. Perry was seeking assistance for.""  

Separately, some affected Texas residents are eligible for other federal help, including low-interest loans and assistance to ranchers and farmers who lost livestock in the fires.

Texas Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor told us that from Sept. 1 through May 15, local fire departments and the state spent about $97.5 million on wildfires. Of that, the state has pitched in $90.8 million, and expects to be reimbursed about $23 million from the 27 approved federal grants to date.

Perry isn’t placated. During an interview on NewsRadio 1080 KRLD on May 11, Perry said: ""We've had over 9,000 different fires in the state of Texas, 2.3 million acres burned. If that doesn't rise to the level of a major emergency I don't know what does."" As of May 16, according to the service, 10,123 Texas fires burned nearly 2.6 million acres in 237 counties. On May 26, Perry appealed the Obama administration's decision to deny the declaration.

But this isn’t the first time the federal government hasn’t granted Texas’ aid requests. We found that it has gone both ways on fire-related requests for disaster declarations from Texas.

— In February 2009, according to FEMA, the Obama administration denied a Perry request for an emergency declaration for wildfires, and his subsequent request for a major disaster declaration. According to an April 2009 Abilene Reporter News article, Perry requested the declaration after wildfires burned through 400,000 acres, destroying 200 homes.

— In 2008, the Bush administration denied Perry’s request for a major disaster declaration due to wildfires that had burned, according to Perry’s office, nearly 940,000 acres in 215 counties, the San Antonio Express-News reported March 20, 2008. The reason: ""We just didn’t see that the state’s capacity to respond was overwhelmed,"" said FEMA spokesman Earl Armstrong, according to the Express-News article.

After the state appealed the rejection, the government granted a emergency disaster declaration, which is more limited in scope and doesn’t have the long-term federal recovery programs that can come with a major disaster declaration. Texas also received fire management assistance grants for 22 fires that year, according to FEMA.

— In January 2006, President Bush issued a major disaster declaration after at least 450 fires, blamed largely on a long drought, burned across north and west Texas. At the time, Perry wrote the federal government: ""Based on these extreme conditions, the magnitude of response required is beyond the resources and capabilities of the state and the affected local governments,"" according to a January 2006 Fort Worth Star-Telegram news article.

Since 1953, Texas has received more major disaster declarations than any other state — 84 — mostly for severe storms, flooding and tornadoes. California, the largest state, has received the second most (78) followed by Oklahoma (68) and Florida (63). Rhode Island has received the least (8).

So far, Obama has issued one major disaster declaration for Texas — in August 2010, for Hurricane Alex, according to FEMA. Before that, President George W. Bush issued two major disaster declarations after hurricanes hit the state in July and September 2008.

Carney correctly summed up the Obama administration’s approval of fire-fighting grants for Texas but he glosses over its denial of the disaster declaration, which could have covered more counties and provided retroactive assistance.

"['Ohio', 'Education', 'John Kasich']","
Gov. John Kasich says Ohio near bottom in classroom spending, but near top in administrative costs
","
Gov. John Kasich took office complaining that not enough money spent on public education was going towards classroom instruction. The implication was that Ohio’s public schools instead are spending too much on administrator salaries and slighting schoolchildren.

Well, he’s not implying anymore, he’s now saying as much.

""We are in the bottom 10 in dollars in the classroom and the top 10 in dollars in the bureaucracy and red tape,"" the governor told a national television audience on May 12 during a live interview on FOX News cable television.

The governor has made similar claims in the past, but his statement also contained something new, so Politifact Ohio decided to take a look.

It has been well documented that Kasich’s first operating budget released in March suggested putting the squeeze on public school education, proposing to cut funding to local school districts by 11.9 percent next fiscal year and another 4.9 percent the year after.

It would seem contradictory to cut funding to schools and yet chide them for not spending more in the classroom, school officials say. At the same time, Kasich wants to increase the number of charter schools, direct competition to school districts.

But the Republican governor insists he is giving the districts choices for how to save money and compete and yet still boost classroom spending all while drawing down fewer state dollars.

One is with controversial Senate Bill 5, the collective bargaining reform law that is suspended while a challenge is mounted against it by labor groups, including teachers unions. The law sharply curtails collective bargaining power of teachers and other public union workers, bans strikes and eliminates binding arbitration.

The other option the governor says districts can turn to is cutting their administrative and overhead costs by trimming the number of administrators they employ and looking for ways to consolidate their services.

PolitiFact Ohio checked a variation of the first part of Kasich’s statement last November when the new governor complained that Ohio was 46th in the country in classroom spending. We rated that claim Mostly True.

New this statement is the claim that Ohio ranks in ""the top 10 in dollars in the bureaucracy and red tape.""

It turns out the governor based his most recent statement, including the new part of the claim about administrative costs, on the same information as his previous comments, a 2010 report from the Greater Ohio Policy Center and Brookings Institution.

The report, ‘Restoring Prosperity: Transforming Ohio’s Communities for the Next Economy,’ focused on ways to improve Ohio’s economy by strengthening the state’s urban cores. Revising how education dollars are spent was one of the report’s conclusions.

""Ohio ranks 47th in the nation in the share of elementary and secondary education spending that goes to instruction and ninth in the share that goes to administration,"" the report states. A spokesman for Kasich said it was that line in the 76-page report that the governor is referring to with his comments.

It’s important to note, though, that the statistics, from the National Center for Education Statistics, are from a state-by-state analysis of data from the 2007-2008 school year, meaning they are about three years old.

The Dayton Daily News, which reviewed U.S. Department of Education statistics, recently reported that Ohio was 12th highest in terms of the amount of money spent on administrative costs and 46th lowest for spending in the classroom.

While those statistics do not perfectly match Kasich’s statement of Ohio being in the top 10 for administrative spending, they were close enough that  the administration highlighted the story in support of Kasich’s position.

We agree. That the Education Department’s data has Ohio slipping to 12th on administrative spending is not enough to make the governor’s underlying point inaccurate. Knowing it provides clarification.

"['Natural Disasters ', 'Texas', 'Todd Staples']","
Obama admin. denied Texas' request for disaster declaration to help fight wildfires
","Todd Staples, the Texas agriculture commissioner, takes issue with the Obama administration’s refusal to declare a major disaster in response to wildfires scorching parts of Texas.

During a May 12 Texas Tribune interview, Staples, a Republican eyeing a run for lieutenant governor, said: ""It’s just unconscionable that FEMA and this administration is denying our request for a general disaster declaration. And to put it in context, just in June of 2009, the same administration approved the type of declaration request that we’re asking, when nine counties out of the 77 in Oklahoma burned for about three days. We’ve had wildfires that have been out of control for two weeks.""

Asked whether the Obama administration had explained the denial, Staples said: ""Well, it is what it is. It’s indifference, or it’s political posturing, who knows what the real issue is.""

We wondered whether the feds really responded to fires in the Sooner State with a ""major disaster declaration,"" while spurning the Texas request for wildfires that lasted longer.

A governor can trigger federal aid is by asking the president to declare a major disaster in the state. That request must show the disaster ""is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the local governments and that federal assistance is necessary,"" according to information on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s website.

An April 10, 2009, ""situation update"" from the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said that 10 counties had been affected by the wildfires, which had injured at least 62 people and destroyed more than 100 homes.

According to an Associated Press article from the same day, Oklahoma's Democratic governor declared a state of emergency for 31 counties hit by wildfires and severe weather. On April 22, the governor requested the major disaster declaration that would ""deliver individual assistance to residents and business owners"" in nine counties, according to a press release from the governor’s office. Nearly 270 homes and businesses — including 228 homes — were damaged from the fires that started April 9, burning more than 100,000 acres.

On June 19, 2009, President Barack Obama declared a major disaster for Oklahoma, infusing federal aid into the state’s ""recovery efforts in an area struck by wildfires during the period of April 9-12, 2009,"" according to a FEMA press release, which Staples spokesman Bryan Black pointed us to.

""Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,"" according to the press release.

According to a July 28, 2009, FEMA press release, disaster assistance for Oklahomans affected by wildfires exceeded $2.9 million, including $1,590,000 in housing assistance grants. A total of 260 individuals from nine counties registered for federal assistance, the press release says.

What about Texas?

As of May 16, according to the Texas Forest Service, 10,123 Texas fires had burned nearly 2.6 million acres in 237 counties. Since the fire season began in November, 435 homes and 1,302 additional structures have been lost. Two volunteer firefighters have died.

In an April 16 letter to Obama, Gov. Rick Perry requested a ""major disaster declaration"" as a result of wildfires that have burned through the state. Perry’s request covered all but two of the state’s counties, including Travis. Perry sought Category B aid through FEMA’s public assistance program, making the state eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of firefighting costs already expended and to help the state fight burning fires.

His request didn’t include federal aid for individuals, though some affected residents are eligible for other federal help, including low-interest loans and assistance to ranchers and farmers who lost livestock in the fires.  

The federal government denied Perry’s request after FEMA concluded recovery needs from wildfires did not exceed what the state and local governments could handle, according to a May 4 Fort Worth Star-Telegram article.

On May 26, Perry appealed the Obama administration's decision to deny the declaration.

FEMA spokeswoman Rachel Racusen told us that the administration has provided Texas with 27 fire management grants to fund many of the same emergency response activities Perry sought assistance for. The grants covered 75 percent of the firefighting costs associated with the 27 fires, which burned about 1 million acres in 31 counties, and the state expects to be reimbursed about $23 million as a result, Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor told us.

From Sept. 1 through May 15, local fire departments and the state spent about $97.5 million on wildfires, she said. Of that, the state has pitched in $90.8 million.

Where does that leave us?

Staples correctly says that the Obama administration denied Texas’ request for a disaster declaration due to long-burning wildfires: The same administration approved a similar disaster declaration request from Oklahoma in 2009, in response to wildfires that burned for only a few days.

But the statement leaves out a crucial relevant fact. FEMA has not denied federal aid for the Texas wildfires; it’s approved fire-fighting grants adding up to $23 million — far more than Oklahoma’s approximate $3 million in disaster aid.

"['Agriculture', 'Gas Prices', 'Wisconsin', 'Wisconsin Corn Growers Association']","
Wisconsin Corn Growers Association says that without ethanol, gas would cost 15 percent more
","
The latest run-up in gas prices, to the $4 a gallon range, is causing some Wisconsin drivers to change their travel habits.

Gas prices have slid back since touching a recent high of  $4.13 a gallon on May 4, 2011, according to Wisconsingasprices.com. When Memorial Day weekend began, they were in the neighborhood of $3.88 a gallon, though prices varied some throughout the state.

But that’s still a big jump since the beginning of 2011, when drivers were paying around $3 a gallon for regular unleaded.

With the pain at the pump setting in, the corn growers and ethanol industry are trying to make the best of a bad situation. In a radio ad, the Wisconsin Corn Growers Association tells drivers that prices would be even higher without ethanol in the mix.

One version of the ad uses a fake host, ""Filler Up Phil"" who takes calls from people concerned about high gas prices. He tells one caller that ethanol adds to the nation’s fuel supply, and tells another that the fuel additive helps save consumers money.

""Without ethanol, gas prices would be at least 15 percent higher,"" the fake host says. ""With gas at four bucks, that means you’re saving 12 bucks on a 20 gallon fill-up.""

That’ll get your attention, no matter what kind of car you drive. It’s a specific claim but -- as with political ads -- carries a broader message: Ethanol is a boon for your wallet.

So, let’s husk it.

First, a little background.

Most gasoline is blended with 10 percent ethanol, a fuel made from corn. That’s part of federal legislation pushed by the corn growers, the ethanol industry and renewable fuels supporters that seeks to boost the amount of ethanol we burn in our cars. The industry is encouraged -- and propped up -- by a controversial $6 billion package of tax credits, production mandates and tariffs.

A key argument in favor of ethanol is that each gallon burned means less oil that needs to be imported.

The federal law seeks to boost ethanol production over time. The goal is to reach 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels in the U.S. market by 2022. Production was about 13 billion gallons in 2010, according to the Energy Information Administration.

The effort is driven by a variety of tax breaks and incentives, including a 45 cents a gallon tax credit paid to refineries and a 54 cent a gallon tariff on imported ethanol. The feds also require ethanol to be blended with conventional gas, and since last year when demand fell, they’ve come up with new ways to boost ethanol consumption.

But ethanol subsidies are under attack on a variety of fronts, including those who see the system  as a wasteful industry handout. The Wall Street Journal editorial board in January launched a major attack on the fuel -- and ethanol backer GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich.

The newspaper said four of every 10 rows of corn in the U.S. are grown for ethanol, an argument that fed complaints that a food crop was being wasted in our gas tanks. Still others condemn ethanol’s poor fuel efficiency and pollution impacts. And others blame ethanol for driving up the cost of food.

So, what about the claim in the ad?

The group based its claim on a 2008 report from the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University. The researchers found that ethanol reduces the cost of gasoline by about 40 cents a gallon.

They issued an updated report in April 2011 that factored in 2010 data for oil prices and increased production of ethanol. That report delivered an even more startling conclusion: Ethanol cuts gas prices by 89 cents a gallon.

It’s even higher if you live in the Midwest -- $1.37 a gallon, the new report says.

And the latest report from the center goes one step further. The researchers looked at what would happen if ethanol production stopped immediately. A gallon of gas would cost up to $7.20, or $144 for that 20 gallon fill up.

So when you do the math, the savings is even higher than described in the ad.

But there is another side to the issue -- one that carries its own costs.

The ethanol industry is supported by those aforementioned tax incentives. And federal law requires the industry to brew more, and burn more.

Including all of those factors, the Natural Resources Defense Council says it costs taxpayers $4.18 to produce each gallon of ethanol. Oil companies will be forced to buy more of the fuel that taxpayers have paid to brew, the group argues.

There’s also the question about burning food for fuel, and the impact that ethanol has on food prices. More corn burned means your cornflakes cost more.

Iowa State University economist Bruce Babcock last year estimated that ethanol policies drive up the cost of food by at least 1.5 percent.

""I don't see why we can really justify subsidies, when all that does is raises cost of producing food,"" Babcock told National Public Radio.

So where does that leave us (other than relieved we’re not paying $7 a gallon for gas)?

The corn growers say we’re paying less at the pump, thanks to ethanol being blended into gasoline.  The study they cite provides support for the claim -- indeed, an updated version  suggests the radio ad actually low balls the savings per fill-up.

But there is a cost to taxpayers to support the ethanol program -- $6 billion a year -- which goes unmentioned in the ad. And using food for fuel drives up the cost of your grocery bill, even as the price at the pump is offset by the program. And there are pollution and fuel efficiency concerns tied to the additive. Those are also unmentioned.

So, while generally true, the claim leaves out important information. On our gauge that’s a Half  True.",/factchecks/2011/may/29/wisconsin-corn-growers-association/wisconsin-corn-growers-association-says-without-et/
