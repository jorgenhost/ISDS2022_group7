Young Republican chairman says Rhode Island's public employees 4th highest paid in the U.S.; private sector workers 23rd
","
Amid tough economic times and an alarming deficit looming in state government, the pay and benefits state workers receive have come under increased scrutiny.

In a column arguing that things have gotten out of control in Rhode Island, Travis Rowley, chairman of the Rhode Island Young Republicans, said the pay of the state's public employees is excessive compared with the rest of the country.

""Last year it was discovered that Rhode Island's public employees ranked 4th in average pay, while the private sector ranked 23rd,"" he said in his posting on a local news website.

We found those statistics interesting. When we e-mailed him asking for their source, he said he found them in a 2009 report -- ""Rich States, Poor States,"" by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council. That ALEC report says the information came from the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, a business-financed research group, but it doesn't indicate which RIPEC report it's referencing or when the data were collected.

We went looking for the RIPEC report that had those numbers. We couldn't find it.

Neither could RIPEC, which searched reports going back to the mid-1990s.

RIPEC Executive Director John C. Simmons said the group even contacted the American Legislative Exchange Council to determine what it was talking about. ""We don't know where it came from,"" Simmons said. ""We're going back 10-12 years.""

That's the type of analysis the organization would like to do, he said, but added that comparing public- and private-sector jobs is difficult ""because the educational requirements are different. Normally public employees have a higher need for higher education, versus private employees.""

In an attempt to find our own data, we turned to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), where spokesman Gary Steinberg said the bureau doesn't routinely report such numbers for some of the same reasons Simmons talked about.

""It's not an apples to apples comparison,"" he said. One reason: the mix of jobs is very different. ""In the private sector, one occupation that's very large is cashiers, or retail sales clerks; there's a lot of low-paying jobs that don't exist in the public sector. And in the public sector you have jobs like police, fire and teachers that aren't always comparable"" in the private sector, he said.

Another reason, said Steinberg: public-sector pay is likely to be higher because there is less turnover than in the private sector ""and you would expect more-experienced employees to have higher earnings overall.""

That's why comparing the state-by-state ranking of public- versus private-sector employees is a fairer way to look at the issue.

We ended up doing our own comparison after discovering government statistics available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis at BEA.gov. We found that Rhode Island's state and municipal workers ranked 7th, not 4th, in wages and salaries, behind New Jersey, California, Connecticut, Nevada, New York and Maryland.

Private-sector workers rank 15th, not 23rd.

And when you look at the pay for state workers only, they ranked -- 12th -- behind the six states mentioned above and Alaska, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Vermont.

Meanwhile RIPEC, whose calls to the American Legislative Exchange Council have gone unanswered, was building its own spreadsheet using numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to determine whether the statistic cited by the ALEC report  was ever accurate.

The closest match that Simmons and his staff could find was in 2001, when Rhode Island ranked 24th in private pay. Municipal workers ranked 4th, but that doesn’t include state workers, who ranked 8th.

With their help, we were able to cull comparable numbers for 2009 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' database. The result: combined state and municipal worker pay ranked 3rd; private sector pay in Rhode Island ranked 20th. That's much closer to Rowley's assertion.

(Why the difference in rankings? Ashley Denault, a RIPEC policy analyst, said that may be due to the different ways the two agencies adjust their numbers. For example, we also found that the BEA reports higher numbers for wages in Rhode Island -- about $100 million higher for state and local government wages and $1 billion more in private sector wages paid out in 2009 -- than the BLS.)

Bottom line:

*Rowley accurately quoted statistics from a report, but that report cited a source that apparently doesn’t exist.

* Data from two federal databases offer two different pictures, with one set of statistics producing rankings much closer to Rowley's claim than the other.

* Rowley said the data ""was discovered"" last year, but the report he cites is from 2009.

Correctly citing bad information -- attributed or not -- doesn’t make a speaker’s statement true. Rowley could have uncovered the problem if he had examined the original source material.

But because the latest numbers from one federal database are somewhat close to Rowley’s assessment, we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE2EC00>],/factchecks/2011/mar/07/travis-rowley/young-republican-chairman-says-rhode-islands-publi/
"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Scott McCown']","
In a letter, Scott McCown says Texas would have to increase spending by 28 percent just to reach the national average for spending per resident
","
Opposing massive cuts in state spending, a former Texas lieutenant governor and a former state district judge recently told business leaders that past Texas Legislatures budgeted so conservatively that state government lags other states in per-person spending.

The Feb. 1 letter from Democrats Bill Hobby and Scott McCown to leaders of local chambers of commerce around the state says: ""To put in perspective how tight Texas is with a dollar, Texas would have to increase current state spending by 28 percent just to reach average state spending per resident"" across the country.

Asked the basis for the percentage, McCown, a former state district judge who is now director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income Texans, deferred to Eva DeLuna Castro, the center’s senior budget analyst.

In an e-mail, DeLuna said she drew on U.S. Census Bureau data to reach the percentage.

Nationally in 2009, state governments reported nearly $1.6 trillion in general expenditures. For Texas, the comparable figure was $98 billion, according to information posted online by the bureau.

DeLuna told us general expenditures include all money spent by a government in a fiscal year -- net of recoveries and other correcting transactions -- other than for retirement of debt, purchase of investment securities, extension of loans and agency or private trust transactions. She also said the bureau’s total closely tracked what the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters, and state comptroller’s office would typically say that the state spent in 2009.

The same year, the U.S. population was estimated at more than 306 million, including nearly 25 million Texans. DeLuna said she reached per-capita spending estimates by dividing the general expenditures by the population estimates. The result: $5,072 for the nation, compared with $3,959 for Texas. Finally, DeLuna said, she calculated what percentage increase would raise the Texas figure to the national average--28 percent.

When we checked with the Census Bureau, Cheryl Lee, chief of the state finance and tax statistics branch in its governments division, had no comment on the center’s calculation. She said the bureau doesn’t pair its finance findings with population data to reach per-capita numbers.

Separately, Austin economist Stuart Greenfield pointed out two other runs at calculating per-capita state spending comparisons, both of them citing information from the bureau and other sources.

A chart posted online by the Washington-based Tax Foundation says that in 2007, Texas state government spent $3,830 per person in state funds, ranking 50th among the states. That year, the foundation says, the national average was $5,446. Based on those figures,Texas would have needed to boost state spending by 42 percent at the time to draw even. But when we ran this past Mark Robyn, the foundation’s staff economist, he cautioned that the 2007 chart is outdated.

More recently, a 2009 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows Texas with state spending of $3,630 per person compared to the national average of $5,038--an indication that Texas would have had to increase its spending 39 percent that year to reach the national average.

A footnote to the foundation’s research posted online says the spending figures were obtained from the National Association of State Budget Officers. DeLuna of the Austin center said the NASBO total doesn’t take into account some Texas spending that the census bureau counted, such as extra money for state universities and Food Stamp benefits.

"['Rhode Island', 'Health Care', 'Kenneth McKay']","
McKay says Sen. Whitehouse said on the Senate floor: “Everybody in Rhode Island who disagrees with me about Obamacare is an Aryan, is a white supremacist.”
","
It looked like the 2012 election season was getting under way when Republican Kenneth V. McKay IV was interviewed Feb. 27 on the ABC6 news show ""On the Record.""

McKay, former chief of staff for ex-Gov. Donald Carcieri, and then for the Republican National Committee, is running for the state Republican chairmanship. At one point, the conversation turned to the possibility of either McKay or Carcieri challenging Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse if he runs for reelection next year.

""Let’s take a look at the record,"" McKay said of Whitehouse. ""This is a guy who stood up in front of the U.S. Senate and said, ‘Everybody in Rhode Island who disagrees with me about Obamacare is an Aryan, is a white supremacist.’""

We remembered Whitehouse making a passionate -- some said inflammatory -- Senate speech in 2009 about the decline in civility in politics. But we didn’t remember him castigating every Rhode Islander who opposed President Obama’s health care plan.

We asked McKay for his source and he referred us to the 20-minute speech we remembered, which Whitehouse delivered Dec. 20, 2009, during the health care debate.

It was a speech that lit up the blogosphere. Democrats and progressives called it historic and brilliant. Conservatives called it outrageous. One called it a lunatic rant.

McKay drew our attention to one paragraph that he called ""the relevant part."" Here it is:

""And why? Why all this discord and discourtesy, all this unprecedented, destructive action? All to break the momentum of our new, young President. They are desperate to break this President. They have ardent supporters who are nearly hysterical at the very election of President Barack Obama: the ‘birthers,’ the fanatics, the people running around in right-wing militias and Aryan support groups. It is unbearable to them that President Barack Obama should exist. That is one powerful reason.""

McKay wrote that when you read or hear the entire speech, you understand that Whitehouse is talking about Republicans in the Senate and their supporters in the fight against health care.

Then he reasoned that Whitehouse was suggesting that ""anyone in Rhode Island who is an ardent supporter of the fight against Obamacare are (sic) ‘nearly hysterical . . . the ‘birthers,’ the fanatics, the people running around in right wing militias, and Aryan support groups.""

We read the speech and disagree on several counts.

First, Whitehouse was excoriating Republican senators, not Rhode Islanders. In fact, he said nothing about Rhode Island in the entire speech.

Second, despite his strident language, nowhere in the speech did he come close to saying that everyone who disagreed with the health care plan is an Aryan or a white supremacist.

He accused his Republican colleagues of engaging in a campaign of obstruction and delay ""affecting every single aspect of the Senate’s business.’

He said they engaged in a ""campaign of falsehoods: about death panels, and cuts to Medicare benefits, and benefits for illegal aliens and bureaucrats to be parachuted in between you and your doctor.""

And he accused the GOP senators of voting against funding for soldiers, as another tactic to stall the health care vote.

But in the paragraph McKay cites, it’s clear that Whitehouse was criticizing fringe groups who are ""nearly hysterical at the very election of President Barack Obama""  not just opponents of the president’s health care plan.

In suggesting that Whitehouse labeled all opponents of the health care plan Aryans and white supremacists, McKay seriously distorted the senator’s speech. His further suggestion that, by extension, Whitehouse was applying the label to Rhode Islanders who disagreed with the president, is even more of a distortion.

"['Regulation', 'Virginia', 'Ward Armstrong']","
Ward Armstrong says a telecom bill would allow phone companies to refuse laying landlines for new customers
","
House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong has a contentious relationship with Virginia utility companies.

On Feb. 21, Armstrong took the House floor to oppose a telecommunications bill that updated telecom laws and changed certain regulations faced by landline carriers. Armstrong, D-Henry, disliked provisions in the legislation, which wound up passing the General Assembly.

One was a change that would allow phone companies to refuse to not run new landlines to homes and businesses if there is an adequate alternative that the customer could use, such as cell phone service. Another was a provision in the bill that Armstrong said would erode  the State Corporation Commission’s ability to regulate electric utilities.

Here’s what Armstrong, who is exploring a 2013 bid for statewide office, said on the House floor:

""If you pass this bill, a telephone company would no longer have to provide service by way of a landline facility to any customer, residential or business, who requests such service if there is an alternative provider, either wireless or wire-line. If the service is available through a cell phone, than that is an adequate substitute even if the service does not meet the service needs or pricing requirements of the customer.""

We looked at the legislation. It says that ""a telephone company shall not have the duty to extend or expand its facilities to furnish service and facilities when the person, firm or corporation has service available from one or more alternative providers of wireline or terrestrial wireless communications services at prevailing market rates.""

According to the SCC and Verizon, that means there is no requirement to run a landline to any new customer who can obtain coverage from another source, including cell phones.

Robert Woltz, Jr., the president of Verizon’s Virginia landline division, said his company increasingly faces situations where a developer building a new subdivision signs an exclusive telecom agreement with a cable company, such as Cox or Comcast. If one or two customers in the neighborhood want their landline from Verizon, Woltz said it makes little financial sense for the company to pay for the extensive wiring needed.

""If company ‘X’ serves the subdivision with Triple Play (cable, Internet and telephone service) and I only do voice, I shouldn’t have to invest lots of money to serve a few customers,"" Woltz said.

The new rules say a company can only decline to provide landline service if there is a ""reasonably adequate"" alternative. The SCC is now deciding how it will enforce that standard.

""It may just be on a case-by-case basis, unless there are a lot of complaints and the commission decides they need to make a defined standard,"" said William Irby, director of the  SCC’s Division of Communications.

Woltz said the SCC could check service availability in suburban areas through online searches and contacting cable companies. In disputes over whether wireless service is adequate, he said regulators could make house visits to test reception and ensure a phone works throughout a person’s house.

In his speech, Armstrong warned the bill could affect 4 million Virginians. But anyone who already has a landline should not see any changes. The bill would require landline providers to give any existing customer the option to have a landline repaired if service is disrupted.

""I don’t get to tell existing customers what to do,"" Woltz said.

Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, said her boss is concerned wireless service would be more expensive than landlines for consumers while offering fewer features.

There is also the concern with prices. The new law requires that the alternative service be available at ""prevailing market rates."" But Irby said those comparisons occur only in the same group of technology, meaning wireless prices are compared to other wireless services, not landline prices.

Let’s review.

Armstrong said a bill approved by the General Assembly would allow phone companies to refuse to run landlines to new customers if alternative services, including cell phones, are available. He’s right and we rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACB36C0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/05/ward-armstrong/del-ward-armstrong-says-telecom-bill-would-allow-p/
"['Regulation', 'Virginia', 'Ward Armstrong']","
Ward Armstrong says the telecom bill could hurt electric utility regulation
","
House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong has been battling with Virginia’s largest electric utilities for more than a year.

During the last week of the recently-concluded General Assembly session, that fight spilled into the debate on a telecommunications bill. Armstrong, D-Henry, was irked by several provisions in the legislation designed to modernize regulation as the state moves from a monopoly utility system to a new environment with many competitors.

Armstrong, who is exploring a run for statewide office in 2013, charged in a fiery floor speech on Feb. 21 that the bill would allow phone companies to refuse to run new landlines if there was an alternative for customers, such as using cell phone service. He also railed that the State Corporation Commission was worried the legislation could hinder its ability to regulate electric utilities.

Although the bill was approved by the General Assembly and is now on Gov. Bob McDonnell’s desk, the acrimony did not die. Several Republicans publicly accused Armstrong of spreading false information on the House floor. Armstrong, in return, defended his remarks.

So we looked at both of Armstrong’s charges.

Armstrong, in thundering floor speech, compared the regulation bill to a ticking time bomb.

""Let me quote the SCC report. ‘If this legislation, SB 1368, would limit such record keeping only to companies required to file rate of return statements annually, this could adversely impact the commission’s ability to get necessary rate of return information from electric utilities such as Dominion Virginia Power and Appalachian Power.’

""Where did that come from?"" he demanded, ""Where did that little nugget appear, that we’re going to allow Dominion and Appalachian not to submit rate of return information?""

The SCC regulates Virginia’s public utilities, including electric companies and certain segments of the telephone industry. The report Armstrong quoted was prepared by the SCC’s Division of Communications and released Jan. 24.

As Armstrong said, regulators initially had concerns about rate of return language. Electric utility regulation is complicated, but the SCC explains it this way: Regulated companies like ApCo and Dominion are allowed to ""recover through their rates their ‘reasonable and prudent’ operating expenses, plus a ‘fair’ rate of return (profit) on their ‘rate base,’ which is the value of their capital investment in things like generating stations and the distribution grid.""

Ensuring a fair rate of return requires lots of information on expenses, investments and other activities at the utilities, so there are rules ensuring the electric companies keep the detailed records needed by regulators. The SCC initially worried this law would undermine those rules.

So the SCC brought its concerns to the House Committee on Commerce and Labor, where the bill was being debated. The panel amended the bill on Feb. 3 to state: ""All public utilities doing business in the Commonwealth that file rate of return statements shall ... maintain all records necessary to prepare and submit annually a rate of return statement.""

William Irby, director of the SCC’s Division of Communications, told us the amendment satisfied his department’s concerns. ""Rate of return is not affected by this bill,"" he said.  

Armstrong’s speech pointing to the SCC’s concerns came on Feb. 21 -- almost three weeks after the concerns he was citing had been addressed.

Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, said her boss first learned about the change after his floor speech. She said nobody told Armstrong that the SCC’s concerns had been addressed in committee and that corrections had been made.

""We were pleased to find out that rate of return had been corrected,"" she said. ""That’s a positive.""

But Armstrong, speaking the day after he was supposedly corrected, said ""I don’t make any apologies when I stand up for the people of my district and for the people of this state.""

He also said he would not apologize for sending out an e-mail that repeated the incorrect information on electric utilities.  

Let’s review the record and put this debate to rest.

Ward Armstrong told the entire House of Delegates that a telecom bill could undo important regulations on electric utilities. And though he cited a report from the SCC, he spoke on the bill nearly three weeks after the regulatory body’s concerns about the issue were addressed by a House Committee.

This is the second time during the 2011 session Armstrong has used faulty or outdated information during floor speeches about electric utilities. On the last occasion, regarding incorrectly stated utility rate increases, we gave him the benefit of the doubt because the error involved data sent by the SCC to Armstrong.

There are no excuses this time around. Any delegate speaking about a bill on the House floor should know what the legislation says, especially when changes occurred nearly three weeks before his remarks.

We rate Armstrong’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE22E80>],/factchecks/2011/mar/05/ward-armstrong/ward-armstrong-says-telecom-bill/
"['Environment', 'Oregon', 'Mark Hass']","
Sen. Mark Hass says plastic bags not really recyclable
","

Sen. Mark Hass, a Beaverton Democrat, is one of the most vocal supporters of the plastic bag ban making its way through the Oregon Legislature this session. It makes sense, then, that he’s been pretty vocal about correcting perceived untruths on the part of the plastics lobby.

In a Feb. 8, 2011, committee hearing on the ban, Hass called lobbyists out for saying that plastic bags are recyclable. Here’s what he had to say:

""You know, I think Oregonians would really love to recycle your (plastic bags). They really would. And if they could, we wouldn’t be here today. The whole point of the recyclers being in support of this is because they can’t recycle your bags.

""Four percent are turned in to the supermarkets (to be) sent over to China. You just heard that testimony.

""If Oregon recyclers could recycle your bags, there would be no need for this (bill). We want to be able to recycle them. But we can’t. And so they don’t get recycled, and they do end up on the beaches and in the ocean. And you keep referring to these things as being recyclable. And I just want to caution you on that because I think you’re stretching things when you say these are recyclable.""

We wondered whether Hass was right. Are plastic bags destined for the landfill and nothing else? So, we started off on a fact-checking mission with this as our claim: Oregon recyclers can’t recycle plastic bags.

To start, we called the city of Portland’s Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, which is home to the Solid Waste and Recycling Program. We asked Bruce Walker, the manager of the program, whether Portlanders could just slip the ubiquitous plastic grocery bags into their curbside bins like they can other common recyclables.

""Absolutely not,"" he said. ""We have tried our darnedest, through public education, to get that message out there. … They absolutely should not be put in a recycling cart.""

Walker added: ""Throughout the state of Oregon, there is no curbside program that wants these materials.""

Next stop was the recyclers themselves.

We called Jeff Murray, a vice president for Far West Fibers, a Portland-area recycling business. Murray also sits on the board of Oregon Recyclers Association, which has come out in favor of the plastic-bag ban. He spoke to us, however, from the point of view of Far West Fibers.

We asked him to walk us through the reasons plastic bags generally get the shaft from curbside recyclers. Are they recyclable or not?

He prefaced his comments with this: ""I have learned almost anything in this world is recyclable."" But some things are easier and more cost-effective to recycle.

The deal with plastic bags, at least as far as his business is concerned, is that they clog the sorting machines and unclogging those machines is more than just an inconvenience. ""It just jams,"" Murray said. ""It breaks … sometimes it can cause fires.""

""Basically, it shuts down the efficiency of the system.""

But, Murray added, ""plastic bags are recyclable in the right market.""

That market, he said, is generally overseas, and there are a couple of caveats. The market isn’t a dependable one. ""There are times when we don’t have markets to recycle it. That was the one material we had to landfill"" when the economy soured.

Even when there is a market, the product might not get recycled, he said. ""When it gets sent overseas, I can’t tell you how much does or does not get recycled,"" Murray said. ""We have absolutely no way to guarantee or even make the slightest claim that we’re going to hold these for recycling.""

Ideally, he added, residents would know better than to put the bags in their recycling cans and they would never find their way to his facility in the first place.

Rick Winterhalter, chairman of the Oregon Recyclers Association, one of the groups supporting the plastic bags ban, says that’s the general sentiment.

""We kind of look at (plastic bags) like an invasive species,"" he said. ""We have never included them in our curbside recycling program. And yet they wind up in the curbside recycling and then they wind up at the (sorting facility).""

But Winterhalter confirmed what Murray had said, under the right conditions (and if they’re in good enough shape), plastic bags can be recycled. However, he added, the public doesn’t have many options for recycling the bags themselves. ""The opportunities for people to do that in this region are extremely limited.""

Usually those opportunities have to be provided by the grocery stores themselves. For example, Fred Meyer -- which has stopped offering plastic bags in its 10 Portland-area stores -- offers plastic-bag recycling bins at its retail locations. Those recovered bags are then sold to a company that uses the materials in its ""wood alternative"" products.

Other companies, such as Hilex Poly, which manufactures the bags in question, also take the bags back from in-store recycling programs. ""Plastic bags are 100 percent recyclable,"" says Philip Rozenski, the company’s marketing and sustainability director. ""We are one of the major buyers in the United States."" Hilex recycles old bags into new bags.

That said, the company doesn’t offer the sort of dependable buyer that local recycling centers say they need. Hilex works with a specific sort of plastic bag and wrap, and the materials collected at Oregon centers include various other bits and pieces that Hilex has no use for. Rozenski said Hilex would rather educate the public to take the plastic bags back to the stores, rather than get them from sorting centers.

So, it seems, bags can be recycled -- under the right circumstances -- but are they? We gave the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency a call to see if there are any statistics on the matter. It turns out there are. According to the agency’s 2009 Municipal Solid Waste Report, about 3,850,000 tons of ""plastic bags, sacks and wraps were generated"" last year. Of that, 360,000 tons -- about 9 percent -- were recycled. Of the portion of those plastics that are low density -- the sort used in plastic bags -- the recycling rate was closer to 13.4 percent.

In the Feb. 8 hearing, ban opponents tried to argue that plastic bags could be recycled, and Sen. Hass pushed back. He said Oregon recyclers couldn’t use the bags. Well, the issue is not that cut and dried.

In a broader sense, plastic bags are, indeed, recyclable. At the local level, though, it’s a tough sell. Oregon recycling centers can -- and sometimes do -- collect the bags and sell them to others for further recycling. But that’s not always possible; sometimes there’s just no market for the bags, sometimes the bags can’t be saved. (And state recyclers seem to agree that, ultimately, the bags are more trouble than they’re worth.)

We’ll split the difference here and rate this claim -- that Oregon recyclers can’t use plastic bags -- as Half True.

Phyllis Schlafly says broken CFL bulbs allegedly cause migraines and epileptic seizures
","
National conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, mindful of a federal law that stepped up the required efficiency of light bulbs, recently aired her qualms about the compact fluorescent light bulbs offered to consumers as more efficient alternatives to traditional incandescent bulbs.

In a column included in a Feb. 2 e-mail blast by the Texas Eagle Forum, the founder of the national Eagle Forum said: ""CFL bulbs do not work well in colder temperatures, and most cannot handle dimmer switches; broken CFL bulbs allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks.""

We’ve previously looked into CFL-related claims, so we know there are variations on this theme. For this article, we’re spotlighting Schlafly’s health claim, that broken CFL bulbs allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks.

Seeking illumination, we requested elaboration from the person who sent the e-mail blast, Pat Carlson, president of the Texas Eagle Forum. Meantime, we found what looked like Schlafly’s original column, posted online Dec. 21 at WorldNetDaily.com. From the site, we also asked Schlafly for back-up information.

Next, we searched online for news stories on CFLs touching off migraines and epileptic episodes. Google led us to an opinion column by Nicolas Loris, a research associate for the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation. In the column, posted online Nov. 10 by the Sacramento Bee, Loris writes: ""Hospitals and medical charities warn that CFL bulbs cause migraines and epilepsy attacks.""

Loris told us by e-mail that his source was a November 2009 article published by a British newspaper, The Daily Mail, which quotes ""medical charities"" saying they have been swamped with complaints that the ""flicker of compact fluorescent bulbs can trigger migraines and epilepsy attacks.""

The article continues: ""The charities are lobbying the (national) government to allow an ‘opt out’ for people with health problems so they can continue to use the older bulbs."" Stating that about one in 10 people suffers from migraines, the article quotes Lee Tomkins, of the Migraine Action Association, recommending that residents stockpile conventional bulbs and advising people who suffer from migraines to avoid using fluorescent bulbs as reading lights, or in living areas and kitchens.

Phew. Who knew?

No one in the United States, it initially appeared.

With help from the American Academy of Neurology, we reached a national expert on each affliction.

Per migraines, Stephen Silberstein, a professor of neurology at the Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, said a light flickering at a certain frequency can aggravate a headache. But, Silberstein said, there is no evidence that CFLs cause migraines. ""This is bull,"" he said.

Marc Nuwer, a professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said strobe lights--such as those in discotheques--can flicker at a rate that would touch off a seizure in about 1 in 200 people. However, Nower said, CFL bulbs flicker at much higher rates not detectable by the human eye; they don’t cause epileptic seizures.

Nuwer speculated: ""Someone is talking about some theoretical far-fetched possibility that a broken light would flash"" at the 10 times per second that can cause seizures among a few. ""Even then, that’s really different from a strobe light, which is really bright, lighting up a room.""

Nuwer said his online searches for scientific literature connecting CFLs to epileptic seizures or migraines came up empty. On our behalf, though, he contacted Graham Harding, an international expert on photo-sensitive epilepsy, a form of the disorder in which seizures are triggered by visual stimuli.

In e-mails to Nuwer, Harding said that among 174 respondents to an online survey by Epilepsy Action, 4 percent -- seven people -- reported epileptic seizures due to CFL bulbs, and 4 percent due to conventional fluorescent lights, compared to less than 1 percent due to conventional incandescent bulbs. Harding’s e-mail says the 4 percent reporting problems with CFLs referred to the lights flashing on start-up or because the bulbs were faulty.

Harding’s e-mail closes: ""So the risk (of induced seizures) is no greater than with normal fluorescent but is more than ordinary filament light bulbs."" All that said, he continued, since conventional bulbs have been phased out, with fluorescents presumably replacing many of them, the United Kingdom’s Epilepsy Action group has not reported any seizure problems to him.

Nuwer also passed along a comment from Robert Fisher, a Stanford University neurologist and director of the Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. Fisher said by e-mail that fluorescent lights in the United States and Europe flicker at a higher frequency ""than would be likely to provoke photosensitive seizures."" But a ""defective light may flicker at a lower frequency"" and such flickering ""can and has caused seizures in a few susceptible individuals... So it could happen, but it would be expected to be a rare occurrence.""

Next, we interviewed Mark Rea, director of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Lighting Research Center, who said he’s seen no U.S. study demonstrating headaches or epileptic attacks occur because of CFLs. He noted, though, that a 1989 study completed in Great Britain compared the incidence of headaches in an office under different kinds of fluorescent lighting. According to that study, the incidence of eye strain and headaches were cut in half when high-frequency lights were used.

Finally, we came across a paper on CFLs’ impact on health adopted by the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks in September 2008. The paper says: ""There is no scientific evidence that fluorescent lamps including CFL(s) induce (epileptic) seizures.""

While flickering light in general can induce migraines, the paper says, scientific ""support for aggravating symptoms by flicker from fluorescent tubes was not found."" Similarly, while there’s ""evidence showing that flicker can cause seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy,"" the paper says, "" there are no reported effects of CFL having such effects.""

Meanwhile, the Texas Eagle Forum’s Carlson relayed a defense of Schlafly’s statement from Schlafly’s son, John.

Schlafly pointed out that his mother’s use of the word ""allegedly"" signaled that she was ""not claiming she had scientific proof CFLs cause migraines or epilepsy. However, it is a fact that some people who suffer from migraines or epilepsy believe that CFLs cause or aggravate those painful and debilitating conditions, he said.

Our take: Flickering lights of various origins have been linked to migraines and epileptic seizures. But there appears to be no scientific evidence that CFLs, broken or otherwise, cause either disorder. We rate Schlafly’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA2B7C0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/05/phyllis-schlafly/phyllis-schlafly-says-broken-cfl-bulbs-allegedly-c/

U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood: 35 states have taken high-speed rail cash
","
U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood says that the decisions made by Republican governors in Ohio, Wisconsin and now Florida to refuse federal money for high-speed rail projects shouldn't overshadow the fact that the vast majority of governors and states embrace the idea of bullet trains in their backyard. 
""Thirty-five states have accepted high-speed intercity rail money. Thirty-five,"" LaHood told a March 2, 2011, meeting of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. ""There's a lot of enthusiasm and energy and very good plans around the country for high-speed, intercity rail. ... Just in the last two weeks, I probably received half a dozen or more letters from either governors or senators that are ready. They have their plans ready. If there is more money to be made available, they are ready to get in. America is ready for high-speed intercity rail. And the fact that 35 states have accepted the money is proof of it."" 
A video copy of LaHood's speech is attached to this story. His comments about rail begin about six minutes in. 
We decided to check LaHood's claim that 35 of the country's 50 states have accepted money for high-speed rail projects. 
High-speed rail has been a priority of President Barack Obama's administration, which set aside $8 billion in the 2009 federal stimulus package for rail projects and awarded an additional $2.5 billion to fund rail projects in October 2010. Florida, for instance, was offered $2.4 billion in federal money to help build the 84-mile-long corridor linking Tampa and Orlando. The total project was estimated to cost about $2.7 billion, with either the state or a private contractor picking up the remaining share. 
The Tampa-Orlando line was conceived as one of the first legs in what Obama envisioned as a nationwide high-speed rail network. A second line eventually would have connected Orlando and Miami, with future lines connecting Jacksonville to Orlando and Jacksonville to Tallahassee. Eventually, a network of high-speed rail lines would be able to carry passengers from Miami up the eastern seaboard, or as far west as Los Angeles and Seattle, linking 80 percent of the country's population. 
Florida Gov. Rick Scott rejected the money for his share of the network in an announcement on Feb. 16, 2011, joining a group of critics who believe the federal money could be better spent on state road systems, or by not being spent at all. The federal government revoked a $400 million grant to Ohio for high-speed rail after the state's new governor, John Kasich, said he would not participate. The same thing happened in Wisconsin, where the federal government pulled back $810 million to build a high-speed line between Milwaukee and Madison after newly elected Gov. Scott Walker made it clear that he would not accept the money. All three states received or spent federal dollars on their rail projects before nixing them entirely. 
Justin Nisly, a spokesman with the U.S. Department of Transportation, said that, in total, 35 states and the District of Columbia have received federal funding through the High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program either as part of the 2009 stimulus or the 2010 grant awards. 
Here's the transportation department's list of states that received money -- Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, North Carolina, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Vermont, Wisconsin, Washington and West Virginia. 
That's 35 states alright. But in going through the list, along with the accompanying grant information the Transportation Department provided (here and here), we found several caveats to LaHood's claim. 
Maybe high-speed, maybe just intercity 
First, the list is not just high-speed intercity service. 
It's high-speed or intercity service. 
That's why Kansas is on the list though it's not planning a high-speed line. Kansas is planning to possibly use an existing freight-line to move people between Kansas City and Oklahoma City. 
On top of that, the list includes three states that have loudly rejected federal funding for high-speed rail projects. Florida, Wisconsin and Ohio have combined to say no to nearly $3.6 billion in federal moneys. Each of those states did spend or receive some federal dollars before killing their projects, but not nearly enough to construct a high-speed line. 
Wisconsin has a second asterisk. While it rejected money for a high-speed line between Milwaukee and Madison, it did accept $2 million to upgrade the existing Hiawatha Amtrak line linking Milwaukee and Chicago. But that's upgrading an existing Amtrak line, not developing a high-speed rail line. 
Money for tracks, stations, tunnels 
Other states on the list are receiving money, but not for high-speed rail service. 
Four states included on the list received funding only to create broad statewide rail plans, not money to engineer or plan the feasibility of specific high-speed rail corridors. To develop the broad vision documents, New Mexico received $100,000, Idaho received $200,000, Nevada received $640,000 and West Virginia received $1 million. 
And still other states received money to renovate existing track or stations -- which would improve service -- though without creating high-speed rail lines. (High-speed rail doesn't have a singular measure, but most people agree a high-speed line should reach speeds in excess of 125 mph).  
Maryland's $70 million in funding was to plan for the replacement of two tunnels on existing rail track, and to plan for the building of a new train station at Baltimore-Washington International Airport. 
Indiana received $71 million to improve existing regular rail service between the town of Porter and the Illinois state line. It also had asked for $2.8 billion to develop a high-speed line linking Chicago and Cleveland, but was rejected. (Ohio's decision to reject a high-speed line likely makes Indiana's application moot).  
That's at least 10 states that either have rejected the idea of high-speed rail, or are receiving federal funding -- but spending on something other than you'd consider a high-speed rail project. That doesn't include another handful of states that received federal funding just to study the possibility of constructing a high-speed rail corridor. 
A study which, by no means, signals that state wants to build a line, or will (If you don't believe us, ask Florida's new governor). 
Other lists differ from LaHood's 
One more interesting point about LaHood's 35-state claim: It's not the same number used by the Federal Railroad Administration. On its website, the railroad administration keeps a ""current list of High Speed Intercity Passenger Rail project funding."" (A word of caution: You'll need to install Microsoft Silverlight to view the list. If you're having trouble, we copied the list and posted it for you to see here.) 
The list includes awards to states totaling $4.8 billion, including the first $66 million awarded to Florida as part of its Tampa-Orlando line, and $45 million given to Wisconsin and Ohio before those states pulled out of the program. Excluding Florida, Wisconsin and Ohio, the railroad administration says 15 states and the District of Columbia have been awarded some type of high-speed rail funding. They are: North Carolina, Michigan, Illinois, Colorado, Delaware, Maine, New York, Georgia, Kansas, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon, California, Vermont and the District of Columbia. 
For the record, high-speed rail corridors are still being actively planned in California, in Oregon and Washington, in Illinois, and throughout the northeast.  
Our ruling  
LaHood told transportation officials that ""35 states have accepted high-speed intercity rail money."" It seems clear that 35 states, plus the District of Columbia, have so far been awarded money for rail projects through the 2009 federal stimulus or a subsequent federal grant. And yes, the program is called High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program. 
But to say all of that money is directed for high-speed intercity rail stretches common logic. First it's really high-speed or intercity rail. Next, three of those 35 states have subsequently said no thanks. And several other states are taking the money, but not using it to develop new high-speed rail lines. 
We understand that you can make an argument that all of that money could one day result in a high-speed rail project. But based on the results in Wisconsin, Ohio, and now Florida, we're far from ready to go there just yet. 
We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE59AC0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/04/raymond-lahood/us-transportation-secretary-ray-lahood-35-states-h/

Wisconsin ad says workers get pay taken away but major corporations get tax breaks
","
Democratic groups have released a TV ad saying that Republicans in Wisconsin are waging war on the middle class by taking money from workers and giving tax breaks to corporations. The ad features workers speaking directly into the camera. 
Two workers explain how much money will be taken out of their paychecks when they have to make additional payments to pension funds and for health insurance. One says it will cost his family $400 to $500 a month in lost income; another says she’ll lose $3,000 a year from her paycheck.

""Money is being taken away from workers, and the tax breaks given to major corporations,""  says another worker in the ad. We decided to fact-check that claim.

The ad is from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Democracy for America. Both are liberal political advocacy groups; Democracy for America was founded by former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean.

First, we’ll check whether money is being taken away from workers.

Gov. Scott Walker has asked state employees to contribute 5.8 percent of their pay toward pensions and pay at least 12 percent of their health insurance premiums.

This means that workers’ overall compensation will be be lower. The estimates PolitiFact Wisconsin reviewed indicate that the changes will vary depending on each worker's particular circumstances, but that most workers would lose between 6.8 percent and 11 percent of their paychecks.

So the claim that money is being taken away from workers is true.

We should note here that union leaders in Wisconsin have said they would accept the reductions in pay. But they don’t want to accept Walker’s proposal to permanently curtail the unions’ collective bargaining rights.

Next, we’ll check whether tax breaks are being ""given to major corporations.""

We found Walker has already signed bills that cut taxes for corporations and other businesses, depending on the number of jobs they create.

Walker signed a law on Jan. 31 that said that companies that relocate to Wisconsin will not have to pay corporate taxes for two years. The law stipulates that the company must move at least 51 percent of the workers on its payroll or at least those who account for $200,000 in wages. Walker also signed into law a bill that gives small tax breaks to companies that create jobs.

Walker proposed additional tax breaks for business during the campaign for governor. PolitiFact Wisconsin documented those promises on PolitiFact’s Walk-O-Meter, a database of Walker’s campaign promises. That includes reducing taxes on employers and repealing the ""combined reporting"" requirement for business taxes, a measure that increased tax revenues and was approved in 2009.

We’re ruling on the statement, ""Money is being taken away from workers, and the tax breaks given to major corporations. ""  Money is indeed being taken away from workers who will see lower overall compensation, and particularly smaller paychecks. Also, companies that employ significant numbers of workers are getting tax breaks. But the tax breaks signed into law so far are linked to job creation, not simply whether the company is a major corporation or not. Tax breaks are being given to business in the midst of a budget crisis, though. So we rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB41080>],/factchecks/2011/mar/04/progressive-change-campaign-committee/wisconsin-ad-says-workers-get-pay-take-major-corpo/

The MacIver Institute says average annual salary and benefits for Milwaukee Public Schools teachers tops $100,000
","
Tea party Republican Rand Paul raised some eyebrows in February 2011 when he said in two national TV interviews that the average public school teacher in Wisconsin ""is making $89,000 per year.""

But the claim by the U.S. senator from Kentucky, which we ruled to be False, was not as surprising as one made nearly a year earlier by the conservative MacIver Institute.

Speaking about Milwaukee public school teachers, the Madison think tank declared in a March 3, 2010, news release:

""For the first time in history, the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools system will exceed $100,000"" in 2011.

In light of Paul’s comments, which were made during the heat of the nationally watched Wisconsin budget debate, we decided to take a closer look at MacIver’s claim. It has resurfaced in the budget debate in comments on websites such as the Huffington Post and TheNation.com.

In announcing the $100,000 figure, the institute produced a video that included brief clips of an MPS administrator reciting salary and fringe benefit numbers during a school board meeting the previous day. The average total compensation figure for teachers exceeded $100,000.

We asked MacIver spokesman Brian Farley if he had any additional evidence. He cited a February 2011 posting from the School Zone blog on JSOnline.com, which reported slightly different numbers than those in MacIver’s video.

The posting quoted MPS’ budget manager as saying that in 2011-2012 (the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2011), the average MPS teacher would receive total compensation of $101,091 -- $59,500 in salary and $41,591 in benefits.

We double-checked with MPS spokeswoman Roseann St. Aubin and she confirmed the figures.

We wanted to compare the $101,091 for MPS teachers to other teachers, but the latest figures compiled by the state Department of Public Instruction are for 2009-2010, two years earlier.

Those figures show for 2009-2010, MPS teachers earned, on average, $56,095 in salary plus $30,202 in benefits, for a total of $86,297.

That was lower than eight other school districts in Milwaukee County, including Greendale, Greenfield, Shorewood, Cudahy, Fox Point, South Milwaukee, Franklin and Nicolet, which was highest at just over $103,000.

Let’s return to the MacIver Institute claim.

The conservative think tank said the average annual compensation for a Milwaukee Public Schools teacher would exceed $100,000 in 2011. As of July 1, 2011, according to the school district, that figure will be $101,091.

MacIver’s claim is True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB410C0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/04/maciver-institute/maciver-institute-says-average-annual-salary-and-b/
"['Education', 'Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Rand Paul']","
U.S. Sen. Rand Paul says the average public school teacher in Wisconsin makes $89,000 in salary and benefits
","
Some of us might not believe Wisconsin’s budget battle had gone viral unless it was debated on national TV by, say, comedian David Letterman and, oh, a senator from Kentucky.

Lo and behold:

On the Feb. 24, 2011 edition of CBS-TV’s ""Late Show with David Letterman,"" the inimitable talk show host raised the Wisconsin controversy with U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.  

Letterman asked:

""Why don’t we just raise the taxes and let these folks have their collective bargaining, have their union representation and go back to their jobs?""

Letterman’s reference was to Wisconsin public school teachers who had skipped school to protest Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s budget-repair bill, which was introduced 10 days earlier. That measure would require most public employees to pay more for benefits, to help close a deficit in the state budget ending June 30, 2011. It would also eliminate collective bargaining rights for some public employees and sharply curtail them for others, a move Walker says is aimed at helping balance future state and local government budgets.

Paul, a freshman senator and co-founder of the Senate Tea Party Caucus, responded to Letterman’s question by saying:

""But I guess the argument is -- is, you have to look at the details and say: Have we been generous with (public school) teachers in Wisconsin? The average teacher in Wisconsin’s making $89,000 a year to work nine months.""

Is Paul right?

The $89,000 claim prompted this comment from a guy named Tom on the Wisconsin Unions page of the Facebook website: ""Holy cats, Batman, my wife is hiding $40,000 a year from her paychecks.""

Paul made a similar claim, varying his wording a little, a day earlier on ABC-TV’s ""Good Morning America."" He told host George Stephanopoulos that Wisconsin teachers ""are making $89,000 a year. Their benefits greatly exceed the private sector.""

In the Letterman interview, Paul seemed to be saying $89,000 was the average salary for a public school teacher in Wisconsin. But on ""Good Morning America,"" he seemed to suggest that the $89,000 included salary plus benefits, just as Fox Business Network anchor Eric Bolling did in making a similar claim that was assessed by our colleagues at PolitiFact National.

We left messages with two staffers in the senator’s office, asking for clarification of Paul’s statements and for evidence to back up the figure, but got no response.

In the Wisconsin budget debate, both sides have said it’s important to look at overall compensation -- pay and benefits. So, by that measure, is the average public school teacher in Wisconsin ""making $89,000 a year""?

The latest figures available are for 2009-2010, according to a state Department of Public Instruction spokesman. Public school teachers in Wisconsin earned an average of $49,816 in salary plus $25,325 in benefits for a total of $75,141.

That’s about 16 percent less than the $89,000 claimed by Paul.

The $75,141 total compensation figure, of course, is a statewide average.

The figures vary across districts, according to tallies from the Department of Public Instruction. The average total compensation ranged from just over $55,000 in the Linn Joint 6 School District in Lake Geneva near the Wisconsin-Illinois border to just over $103,000 in the Nicolet district in suburban Milwaukee.  

Time for the Truth-O-Meter.

Paul said twice on national television that the average public school teacher in Wisconsin ""is making $89,000 a year."" We’re assuming his figure isn’t just for salary, in which case his number would be too high by $40,000. But even if he meant salary plus benefits, his figure is too high by $14,000.

We rate Paul’s statement False. 
Editor’s note: On March 8, 2011, this item was changed to correct an error in information provided by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. In 2009-2010, public school teachers in Wisconsin earned an average of $49,816 in salary (not $49,093), plus $25,325 in benefits (not $25,750), for a total of $75,141 (not $74,843).",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9C9CC0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/04/rand-paul/us-sen-rand-paul-says-average-public-school-teache/

Wisconsin Democratic Party says in response to protesters Republicans have bolted shut windows at the Capitol
","
The clampdown on the protests at the state Capitol started Feb. 27, 2011, one day after a crowd estimated by some at 100,000 filled the grounds and the state’s iconic building.

Protesters who had spent more than two weeks camped inside the building were told the building would be closed for cleaning and they would have to leave. After some confusion, the sleepover was allowed to continue. But access was restricted starting the following day, and the building remained buttoned down for Gov. Scott Walker’s budget address two days later.

Visitors were told they had to use a single entrance and have an appointment to meet with a lawmaker. A contingent of about 100 sleepover protesters was allowed to remain in the building, but the Department of Administration wants them out soon.

Democrats and union leaders cried foul and sought a court order to reopen the Capitol.

The state Democratic Party also turned to the court of public opinion, citing the actions related to the building in a March 2, 2011 news release announcing a recall effort against Republican lawmakers.

""If we can recall at least three Senators and regain control of the senate, we can end the ugly games Republicans in the legislature have played in the last few days -- unplugging phone lines, bolting windows inside the Capitol shut, and withholding the paychecks of Democratic legislators,"" wrote Democratic party chairman Mike Tate on March 2, 2011.

Bolting windows? We called Tate to ask for an explanation, but he didn’t respond.

Earlier in the week we saw some pictures tweeted showing what appeared to be bolts in wooden windows. You can see them here, here and here. We e-mailed the account that sent out the pictures but did not receive a reply. We also saw an earlier blog posting from the AFL-CIO that claimed Capitol windows were being welded shut. More about that below.

So we asked the governor’s office. What’s going on with the Capitol windows?

The answer: The windows on the ground level and first floor are being secured, said Tim Donovan, a spokesman for the Department of Administration. (Donovan works for the state Department of Military Affairs and is on loan to DOA because of the crush of media calls.)

Make that re-secured.

The wooden windows were secured about 10 years ago to prevent anyone from coming into the Capitol through entrances other than doors. Wooden blocks were screwed into the window jambs ""to prevent the windows from being raised more than a few inches,"" Donovan said.

In the past week or so, officials realized some of the window blocks had been removed or otherwise damaged.

""Those found missing were replaced with tamper-proof bolts,"" Donovan said.

Specifically, Capitol facilities workers drove No. 8 wood bolts into the inside of the window frames, and then cut off the heads off the bolts so they could not be easily removed, Donovan said. As the pictures show, it’s not a fancy replacement.

""This is a temporary, quick repair,"" Donovan said.

He was unable to say exactly how many windows were done or when the work took place. It only takes a few seconds to drive a bolt into the woodwork and snap off the head.

Donovan said most of the window-securing was done in the rest rooms on the ground and first floor. It’s impossible to determine how and when those windows became unsecured, he said.

One of the windows secured was in a first floor office of a legislator, Donovan said. In that case, he said, the lawmakers’ staff filed a work order requesting that the windows be secured.

The state Democrats were not the only ones to notice the window projects.

A Feb. 28, 2011 blog  item by AFL-CIO political communications director Eddie Vale carried this headline: ""Walker Welding Capitol Windows NOW to Keep Workers from Passing Food to Those Inside."" 
His item read: ""As we speak, Gov. Scott Walker & Senate R's are literally having the windows of the capital welded shut to keep people from passing food into the building to the people inside. 
""Our attorneys are collecting affidavits from the people who witnessed this, along with people who have been illegally denied access to a public, government, building."" 
We asked Donovan about the welding charge.

His answer was simple: ""We find that wood doesn’t weld well. It burns.""

And that brings us back to the Democratic Party’s claim.

The party said Republicans have ""bolted shut"" windows at the state Capitol as part of the ""ugly games"" being used in response to protests. To be sure, tensions are running high in Madison. But the idea that windows are being bolted shut to somehow curtail protesters is off the mark.

It makes sense that windows would be secured so that people couldn’t open them from the outside. You would, no doubt, find similar safety devices on the lower level windows of many apartments in the campus area. It also makes sense that as Capitol Police and facilities staff took stock of the building after weeks of protests they found some windows unsecured.

So they fixed them. We’ll let the historic preservation folks pass judgment on the appeal of the quick-and-dirty No. 8 bolt repair. But we’ve got this to say about the Democratic Party’s claim: Pants on Fire.

And while we’re at it: Pants on Fire for the welding claim as well.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC793FC0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/04/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-response-protester/

Glenn Beck says First Lady Michelle Obama has 43 on her staff while Nancy Reagan had just 3
","Glenn Beck rekindled a falsehood about the size of Michelle Obama's staff last week, comparing the first lady to Marie Antoinette, and citing her large staff as evidence that the Obamas are ""out of control.""

On his radio program on Feb. 25, 2011, Beck asked a researcher to find out how many people are now on Michelle Obama's staff. Beck then immediately supplied his own estimate.

""It's like 43,"" Beck said.

And, Beck said, ""They just hired a personal shopper who is going to coordinate all of her purchases and look for discounts if they're available.""

""Forty-three people!"" Beck added.

""I think Nancy Reagan may have been the one who had the most people on the staff. She had three. Three!""

""The first lady's office needs 43 people? For what? These people are out of control. It is really Marie Antoinette.""

Allegations that Michelle Obama has an excessively large staff compared to other first ladies is nothing new. In 2009, FactCheck.org and Snopes.com debunked the claim circulated in a chain e-mail that Michelle Obama had an ""unprecedented"" number of staffers, with 22.

Here, Beck has upped the alleged number of staffers to 43. And he claims that when Nancy Reagan was first lady, she had just three.

We went first to the 2010 Annual Report to Congress on White House Staff, the latest online data, and did a search for anyone with the words ""first lady"" in their title. That turned up 15 staffers. We also searched ""social"" and found three more on Michelle Obama's staff.

But titles don't give the full picture. Myra Gutin, an expert on first ladies and politics at Rider University in New Jersey, said that as of 2009, Michelle Obama had 22 people on her staff. Gutin didn't have any more recent tallies, but she highly doubts it nearly doubled to the 43 cited by Beck.

Catherine McCormick-Lelyveld, a spokeswoman for Michelle Obama, told us via e-mail that Michelle Obama's staff is now closer to 25 people.

How does that stack up?

""First lady Michelle Obama’s staff is no different in size than that of her predecessor, Laura Bush -- around 25 people -- and is based on a similar staffing model,"" said McCormick-Lelyveld. ""So suggestions that our staff is larger are wrong. While every first lady approaches the job differently, the responsibilities of the office of the first lady have grown over the years to include planning and hosting hundreds of events at the White House and across the city of D.C., planning and supporting domestic and foreign travel with and without President Obama, receiving, cataloging and responding to thousands of pieces of mail, and supporting the first lady’s active schedule in support of the President -- hence the staff size for both Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Obama.""

The size of a first lady's staff fluctuates year to year. First ladies typically have several staff members each handling correspondence, press, social engagements and projects. At 25, Michelle Obama's staff is similar in size to her immediate predecessors.

According to an Associated Press story on October 6, 2009, Laura Bush had a staff of between 24 and 26 by the end of President George W. Bush's term in 2009, citing Anita McBride, Laura Bush's chief of staff.
 
And according to the Clinton Presidential Library, the size of Hillary Rodham Clinton's staff fluctuated from 13 in October 1993 to 19 by March 2000, the AP story said.

Beck singled out Nancy Reagan, and claimed she had just three employees on her staff.

Our first stop to check that was the Ronald Reagan Library, where Archivist Kelly D. Barton forwarded us a list -- based on the internal Executive Office of the President phone books -- of all the full-time staffers who worked in the first lady's office. In all, that came to 53 employees. But they weren't all serving at once, of course. So we turned to Sheila Tate, vice chair of the Washington, D.C., communications firm Powell Tate, who was Nancy's Reagan's press secretary.

By Tate's off-the-top-of-the-head count, there were 15 people on First Lady Nancy Reagan's staff. That includes four on the press team (including Tate); two in the projects office; two in the advance office; three in the social office; a personal secretary and her assistant; and the chief of staff and his assistant.

There are other people who worked in the East Wing, Tate said, including a large social and calligraphy staff that has nothing to do with changes in administrations.

Tate's not sure what jobs Beck counted to get his number for Nancy Reagan's staff (and our efforts to reach his show were unsuccessful), but by any measure, she said, the claim that Nancy Reagan had only three on her staff is ""clearly wrong.""

Stacy A. Cordery,  a history professor at Monmouth College who serves as bibliographer for the National First Ladies' Library in Ohio, said the role of first ladies has expanded over the decades, and so has the size of the staffs.

""Edith Roosevelt hired the first social secretary, Isabelle Hagner,"" Cordery told us via e-mail. ""Ever since 1901, first ladies have had assistance carrying out their duties--duties which are not defined in any job description nor laid out in any part of the Constitution.  The first lady's correspondence is massive and her obligations as the 'hostess' of the White House have not decreased over time. Once first ladies took on causes (there were some before Eleanor Roosevelt, but she fundamentally changed Americans' expectations of the first lady) then their need for help increased. Modern first ladies like Lady Bird Johnson, Rosalyn Carter, Betty Ford, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush and Nancy Reagan, have all used many more staff people than three.""

And Beck's comment that Michelle Obama ""just hired a personal shopper"" also is wrong. The claim appears to have its roots in a Feb. 21, 2011, Washington Post report that, ""according to several people with knowledge of her White House arrangement,"" Chicago boutique owner Ikram Goldman's role as ""shopper in chief"" has been taken over by Michelle Obama's longtime personal assistant, Meredith Koop.

""There has been no recent addition of a personal shopper,"" said McCormick-Lelyveld. ""Like previous first ladies, Mrs. Obama has a personal aide who is part of the residence staff and who provides general support for the first lady, including purchasing clothes when necessary.""

So to summarize, Michelle Obama has a staff of 25, not 43 as Beck claimed. Nancy Reagan had a staff of about 15 (not 3, as Beck claimed). The size of Michelle Obama's staff is similar to that of her immediate predecessors. And she did not just hire a new personal shopper. In short, Beck's outrage is based on numbers that are wildly off the mark.

Is Scott Pruitt's security spending somewhat more than predecessor? It's a lot more
","President Donald Trump came out in defense of Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator under fire for multiple ethics violations, in a tweet April 7. ""While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!"" While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job! In this fact-check, we zeroed in on Trump’s claim that Pruitt’s spending was ""somewhat more"" than his predecessor. No public records tally up Pruitt’s or his predecessors’ individual security costs. But there are many reports and Freedom of Information Act responses comparing Pruitt’s practices with his predecessors’ — and they suggest that ""somewhat more"" is not suitable to describe the grandeur of Pruitt’s expenditures. Spending on Pruitt’s security detail tallied up to $832,735.40 during his first three months in office, and a soundproof security booth in his personal office cost $24,570, U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., detailed in an Oct. 7, 2017, letter to EPA Inspector General Arthur Elkins. That’s ""nearly double what the two previous administrators spent on security over that same timeframe,"" wrote DeFazio, in his capacity as the ranking member on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. While we don’t have access to the budget breakdown, we unearthed a few details that make Pruitt’s security spending stand out. First off, Pruitt is the first EPA administrator with 24/7 security detail. Pruitt has at least double the number of security guards as Gina McCarthy, the previous EPA administrator under President Barack Obama. An Associated Press investigation found Pruitt has 20 full-time security agents. The office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., found through an Inspector General information request that nearly three dozen EPA security and law enforcement officers were assigned to Pruitt over a six-week period from mid 2017 to the beginning of 2018. The schedules obtained by Whitehouse show multiple EPA security agents accompanied Pruitt and his family on vacations, football games and baseball games, during which no EPA business was conducted. McCarthy, on the other hand, had six or seven full-time guards, according to Liz Purchia, who was McCarthy’s spokeswoman at the EPA. Those staffers accompanied her door-to-door during her workday, but did not work around-the-clock or accompany her on personal travel. EPA chiefs’ protection is normally limited to door-to-door security, explained Elgie Holstein, a current director at the Environmental Defense Fund and former Energy Department chief of staff under the Clinton administration. ""The administrator of the EPA is not a high-profile position, and especially not internationally. (During travel) there’s typically only a couple of security people, three at most,"" Holstein said. ""Not a phalanx of protection as though he were to be assaulted any moment."" But the reason for Pruitt’s security is what special agent in charge Nino Perrotta calls a ""high level of unusual interest in the administrator."" Patrick Sullivan, EPA's assistant inspector general for investigations, said Pruitt received more death threats than any of his predecessors. In the interest of Pruitt’s safety, the number of death threats is not made publicly available. The rough estimate of over 70 threats has not been updated since September, Inspector General spokeswoman Kentia Elbaum said. ""We have at least four to five times the number of threats against Mr. Pruitt than we had against Ms. McCarthy,"" Sullivan said. But in its investigation, the Associated Press found no federal or state court records of arrests or charges for death threats to Pruitt. EPA FOIA analyst Candace White told Buzzfeed senior investigation reporter Jason Leopold in response to a FOIA request that neither the EPA nor the OIG held any records relating to death threats. ""If there is a credible threat, the administrator’s protection would be leveraged by D.C. police in town, embassy guards overseas, or uniformed protection in the building,"" Holstein said. ""These existing resources are not the same thing as pulling people off superfund investigations and bringing them to Washington. This is a head scratcher."" It is tricky to compare travel expenses across various EPA administrations. In total, the EPA spent about $731,000 on McCarthy's trips and $464,000 on previous EPA administrator Lisa Jackson's trips, according to a document the EPA press office sent reporters in March. The figures lump together both travel and security costs combined for all travelers, not just the administrator. Those totals encompass the two ex-administrators’ entire tenures heading the EPA. McCarthy was in office three and a half years, and Jackson served four years. Pruitt, on the other hand, had a significantly higher price tag despite entering office in February 2017. An EPA official told the Associated Press ""total security costs approached $3 million when pay is added to travel expenses."" McCarthy’s trips cost on average less than $120,000 — the price tag a Washington Post report put on Pruitt’s June 2017 trip to Italy, where he visited the U.S. Embassy in Rome and took a private tour of the Vatican before attending a meeting of G-7 environment ministers in Bologna. Trump said Pruitt’s ""security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor."" ""Somewhat more"" is a significant understatement of the situation. By almost every measurement available, Pruitt more than doubles his immediate predecessor’s spending on security. The White House attributed the additional spending to unprecedented death threats. We were unable to obtain any details on the gravity of those threats. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC04A8C0>],/factchecks/2018/apr/10/donald-trump/scott-pruitt-security-spending-epa-predecessor/

Facts bug new Pritzker attack line on Quincy Veterans’ Home
","Gov. Bruce Rauner has faced a barrage of criticism for his administration’s response to deadly outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease at the state’s Quincy Veterans’ Home, which since 2015 have claimed the lives of 13 residents and sickened dozens of others. Now, Rauner’s re-election rival, Democrat J.B. Pritzker, is taking another Quincy-related swing at the governor following disclosure in late March by the Illinois Department of Public Health that 24 individuals at the state-run facility had been sickened by what appeared to be norovirus, a gastrointestinal illness that sometimes causes severe vomiting and diarrhea. ""After fatally mismanaging the Quincy Veterans’ Home, @BruceRauner is letting persistent health issues jeopardize the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes,"" Pritzker said in a March 30 tweet. ""This is a shameful display of failed leadership."" After fatally mismanaging the Quincy Veterans’ Home, @BruceRauner is letting persistent health issues jeopardize the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes. This is a shameful display of failed leadership. https://t.co/YIiGmT9LaE The Pritzker tweet linked to an article in the Chicago Sun-Times about the stomach bug sweeping through the Quincy facility. The article also included other tweets from Democratic state lawmakers pinning the norovirus outbreak on Rauner. Rauner, a Republican, has been the target of bipartisan criticism for his administration’s handling of Legionnaires’ at Quincy after problems were brought to light by a WBEZ investigation last December. The Chicago public radio station raised questions about how patients were treated upon falling ill and revealed officials delayed informing the public after the disease surfaced. Critics have also blasted the Rauner administration for its delay in executing a long-term solution for eradicating the disease at the facility. But is the recent emergence of an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness at the Quincy home really an example of more of the same? And is there anything Rauner could have done, or should be doing, to prevent or mitigate the impact of the severe stomach bug residents have come down with at the home? State health officials suspect norovirus is the culprit behind the latest outbreak at the home in downstate Quincy. The virus, which results in acute gastroenteritis, is the most common cause of diarrhea and vomiting both in the United States and globally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most stricken recover within days, although the illness can pose serious threats to those with compromised immune systems, with the majority of deaths occurring among the elderly. As a viral infection, no antibiotic can treat it. Individuals catch Legionnaires’ disease, on the other hand, by inhaling bacteria that thrives in poorly maintained water systems — something government management and oversight can control. The disease, which produces a severe form of pneumonia, requires treatment with antibiotics. The state health department reported on March 30 that 24 individuals, including both residents and staff, had fallen ill with stomach symptoms at the the veterans’ home, but said none of the cases were serious and that the patients were recovering. But this is general election campaign season, and both the Pritzker and Rauner camps are gearing up for a cutthroat and costly fight in which facts and nuance often take a back seat to any opportunity to raise doubt about an opponent. In that climate, stark distinctions between Legionnaires’ and norovirus can get kicked to the curb. Norovirus afflicts some 20 million people in the U.S. annually, unlike Legionnaires’, which resulted in 6,000 cases being reported to the CDC in 2015. The viral infection is spread through close contact with an infected person or by consuming food or water contaminated by an infected person, according to the CDC. It takes exposure to just a small amount of particles from an infected individual’s stools or vomit to spread the bug. That means enclosed places like nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, such as those at Quincy, as well as schools and cruise ships, are particularly vulnerable. Long-term care facilities play host to the virus more than any other location. They account for between two-thirds and three-quarters of the more than 1,000 norovirus outbreaks that occur annually nationwide, according to Dr. Benjamin Lopman, a professor at Emory University who worked as an epidemiologist with the CDC for seven years. Since 2014, Illinois has experienced 870 norovirus outbreaks, with 540 of them occurring in settings for the elderly such as Quincy, according to data from the Illinois Department of Public Health. ""Noroviruses are exclusively human pathogens,"" Lopman said, explaining that makes the goal to stop transmission from person to person by isolating those who’ve developed symptoms. But because norovirus can also contaminate the environments where people get sick, with particles landing on surfaces that others may later touch, vigilant handwashing is also a must. Beyond that, the response of a care facility is limited. We asked Lopman what, if anything, management at a facility for seniors such as Quincy could do in the way of front-end prevention. ""That is very difficult because … it’s very common in the community,"" he said. ""It’s hard to stop someone coming in,"" between visitors who don’t appear symptomatic and new patient intakes. So we asked the Pritzker campaign to explain how the norovirus outbreak at Quincy could be construed as a blot on Rauner’s leadership. A spokesman for Pritzker responded with an emailed statement that avoided the question and dwelled on the Legionnaires’ issue. ""The fact is, Rauner let the Legionnaires’ crisis spiral out of control in Quincy and is now leaving the same residents and staff to contend with both Legionnaires’ and new diseases as he fails to put forward a permanent solution that keeps veterans safe,"" the Pritzker campaign statement read. A follow-up query to Pritzker spokeswoman Galia Slayen shed no more light on the original question. ""We think our statement is pretty clear in that he has failed to do anything to address health crises at the Quincy Veterans’ Home,"" Slayen said. Pritzker’s March 30 tweet held out a recent norovirus outbreak that sickened two dozen individuals at a state-run veterans’ facility in Quincy as evidence of how Rauner had been ""letting persistent health issues jeopardize the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes."" Rauner has been under fire for his administration’s handling of deadly outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease at the facility. Yet unlike Legionnaires’, which is contracted by inhaling water vapor contaminated with the bacteria, the stomach bug state health officials suspect caused the latest Quincy health problems is spread from person to person, rendering a case for structural mismanagement something of a stretch. Norovirus spreads most frequently in closed environments like nursing homes and assisted living facilities such as Quincy. There is no specific cure for it, meaning the response from care providers is largely limited to isolating patients, casting doubt on what Rauner or his administration could have done to prevent or eliminate it. Asked how Rauner bears blame for the gastroenteritis outbreak, Pritzker’s campaign did not directly respond, instead attempting to characterize it as further evidence after the Legionnaires’ problems at Quincy that the Republican should not be trusted to handle any health issue at the state facility. That conflates two very different epidemiological challenges, and leaves an impression--disputed by experts--that more could have, and should have, been done to stop the spread of norovirus at Quincy. For that, we rate Pritzker’s claim as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC89200>],/factchecks/2018/apr/10/jb-pritzker/facts-bug-new-pritzker-attack-line-quincy-veterans/

Is Donald Trump right that China slaps a 25 percent tariff on American cars?
","President Donald Trump took to Twitter to bemoan what he considers unfair practices in the United States’ automobile trade with China. ""When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%,"" Trump tweeted April 9. ""Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE -  going on for years!""  When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years! Trump’s figures match up with international trade data. But economists raised some important details that Trump omitted from his tweet, which put his claim in a slightly different light. Trump’s numbers are drawn from American and Chinese government trade data. The United States does, in fact, pay a 25 percent tariff on cars sent to China, whereas China pays only 2.5 percent on cars coming into the United States So the numerical portion of Trump’s claim is correct. But experts said his statement leaves out context. For starters, China exports very few cars to the United States. China accounted for about 3 out of every 10,000 cars sold in the United States last year, according to Michael Hicks, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University. ""For every car we import from China, we export six to China. None of those Chinese-produced cars is branded by a Chinese company (it is mostly Volvo),"" Hicks said. ""Our auto industry is doing extraordinarily well in China, while Chinese car production limps along."" To illustrate China’s relatively low share of car exports to the United States, Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, pointed out data on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States, Mexico and Canada impose no tariffs. Here’s a side-by-side look at China, and the United States’ NAFTA trade partners:  ""China exports very few cars to the U.S. So Trump’s Tweet is once again a bit of a red herring,"" said Bown, who noted that a similar disparity exists when comparing Chinese car exports to the European Union, Japan or South Korea. Some experts suggested Trump had cherry-picked the facts by singling out ""cars"" instead of a broader category of automobiles or car parts. For instance, the U.S. tariff on light trucks from China is 25 percent. That import duty is a legacy tariff that dates back to a trade dispute in the 1960s between the United States and several European countries, according to Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. ""So by choosing ‘cars"" but not ‘trucks’ in his Twitter example, Trump is cherry-picking products and not telling the entire story,"" said Bown, of the Peterson Institute. Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute, noted that Chinese tariffs on American auto parts sent to China are well below 25 percent. For example, China places a 10 percent tariff on automobile engines. That’s significant because ""U.S. firms often ship auto parts to China to be assembled there,"" Hufbauer added. Hicks, of Ball State University, noted that the trade disparity stems in part from Trump’s decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama-era deal to lower trade barriers among a dozen countries. ""So, had he not killed the TPP, whatever tariff distortions which now exist would have been reduced,"" Hicks said. Trump said, ""When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%."" American and Chinese government trade data support the numbers in Trump’s statement. However, Trump’s tweet ignored that China makes up a relatively small share of U.S. auto imports overall, and he didn’t tell the whole story by singling out cars rather than a broader category of related imports. One expert said Trump’s own trade policies have contributed to the disparity in car import tariffs. We rate this Mostly True.

Did Nancy Pelosi vow to raise taxes if Democrats take the U.S. House?
","A headline popped up all over the Internet recently: ""Nancy Pelosi vows Democrats will raise taxes if they take back the House."" How accurate is it? Based on the accompanying article -- originally published by the Daily Caller News Foundation, a conservative online publication -- as well as by additional reporting by PolitiFact, the headline outlines a scenario that’s possible but speculative. The April 5 article that accompanied the headline was prompted by a town hall on April 4 headlined by Pelosi and her fellow House Democrat from California, Ted Lieu, in Culver City, Calif. At the event, Pelosi and Lieu criticized the tax bill that passed last December, one advanced exclusively with Republican votes in Congress. At one point, the article noted, Pelosi used a Democratic talking point that we have previously rated Half True -- that ""over 80 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent."" That figure is correct for the tax law’s impact by 2027, but through 2025, the top 1 percent’s share is much smaller -- roughly 20 percent to 25 percent. However, the Daily Caller article did not specifically quote Pelosi promising to raise taxes. Rather, it offered a more nuanced scenario. Pelosi didn’t offer specifics when asked if Democrats would re-work the bill from scratch or focus on specific portions, saying instead her party would work openly with Republicans to reach a deal. ""One of our complaints about what they did with the tax bill is they did it in the dark of night with the speed of light,"" the California Democrat said. ""We’ll sit down at the table and say … what would be a tax bill that creates growth, that creates good paying jobs as it reduces the deficit?"" she said. ""It’s not about chipping at this piece or that piece, it’s about a comprehensive look at what our tax policy should be for the future,"" she added. In other words, at the Culver City event, Pelosi said she would be willing to work with Republicans on overhauling or overturning the law in an unspecified way. Any tax hikes that result would be subject to negotiation -- and the changes could plausibly include cuts compared to current law for some Americans, rather than tax increases. Other remarks by Pelosi not included in the article reiterate this point. ""We can do, that we must do that, in a bipartisan way,"" she said. ""It’s not about chipping at this piece or that piece, it’s about a comprehensive look at what our tax policy should be for the future."" Meanwhile, the article cites an earlier and more specific remark by Pelosi: Pelosi’s comments Wednesday come after she said in February that Democrats would have to ""replace and repeal"" the GOP tax bill once retaking the House. ""It may have to be a ‘replace and repeal’ — replace them and repeal the bill,"" Pelosi said. But even this approach doesn’t guarantee tax hikes, much less universal ones. Mark Mazur, vice president for policy at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact that if you simply repeal the tax law — ""which really is impossible, since some of the provisions already have had an effect"" — you would raise revenue, or, in common parlance, raise taxes. By contrast, Mazur said, ""if you replace it, then the character of the replacement determines whether the combined package raises or loses revenue."" Pelosi's office told PolitiFact that the headline ""an inflammatory misrepresentation."" They pointed to a Pelosi press conference in December where she said any changes she'd seek ""would be bipartisan, open, transparent, and unifying as we go forward to strengthen middle class tax cuts."" Bottom line: It’s premature to say a future Democratic-led change to the tax law would definitely raise taxes. It would also be premature to say which, if any, taxpayers would see an increase under a potential Democratic bill. Democrats could vote to raise taxes in a way that keeps or expands the current cuts for lower- and middle-income taxpayers but raises taxes on the highest segment of earners. That’s an important piece of context missing from the headline. One proposal cited in the article was offered in March by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Schumer proposed raising the corporate tax rate from the newly enacted 21 percent level to 25 percent, by raising the top tax bracket back to 39.6 percent, by bringing back the alternative minimum tax, and by getting rid of the carried-interest tax loophole that benefits fund managers. The recent tax bill did not address the carried-interest provision. Each of these provisions cited by Schumer would target wealthier taxpayers. To reach the conclusion of the headline requires ""a lot of reading between the lines,"" said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. One last point: It takes more than a Democratic House to make changes to tax law. President Donald Trump has hailed the 2017 tax cut bill as one of his signature achievements. It’d be highly unlikely he would sign off on any major changes, or that Congress would be able to overturn a presidential veto. In that sense, the entire discussion is somewhat academic. A widely circulated headline in social media said, ""Nancy Pelosi vows Democrats will raise taxes if they take back the House."" While any change to the tax law passed last December risks raising taxes on someone, the headline does not reflect that it could also lower taxes on others. In reality, Pelosi has not specified what changes she would like to see in a replacement bill, so saying that she has vowed to raise taxes is an exaggeration. Meanwhile, if Schumer’s proposal ends up being the model that Pelosi pursues, that approach could easily keep or expand tax cuts for lower- and middle-income taxpayers while raising them on wealthier Americans. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB51300>],/factchecks/2018/apr/09/blog-posting/did-nancy-pelosi-vow-raise-taxes-if-democrats-take/

Does New York's budget direct 'millions in taxpayer dollars' for Start-Up NY advertising?
","Republican Assembly Leader Brian Kolb says the newly passed New York state budget earmarks millions of dollars for an economic development program that he says is not creating jobs. Start-Up NY will continue to receive money for advertising, Kolb said. ""The 2018-2019 state budget ... continues to direct millions in taxpayer dollars in advertising to the failing Start-Up NY program,"" Kolb said in a statement. Many Republicans in the New York State Legislature oppose the program, which carved out tax-free zones around public college or university campuses for new businesses. Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan, a Republican, said earlier this year that his conference wants to ""get rid of"" the program. Lawmakers were especially critical of Start-Up NY after the state spent $53 million in advertising to promote it between 2013 and 2015. The program created 408 net new jobs by the end of 2015 after launching in January 2014. Is Kolb right that this year’s budget also includes money to advertise Start-Up NY? Budget language The part of the budget Kolb referred to funds more than advertising for Start-Up NY. The bill sets aside $44.5 million to support the state’s economic development initiatives, including Start-Up NY, primarily through marketing and promotion. It also pays for the state's effort to promote New York state as a tourism destination and is also available to bolster some of the state’s other economic development programs. The Global NY program, for example, connects businesses in New York state to international companies. Empire State Development, the state’s economic development agency, has not spent money to advertise Start-Up NY for three years and has no plans to do so, said Jason Conwall, an agency spokesman. The funding line is a holdover from the 2014 budget, the first to earmark advertising money for the program. The same line has been included, almost verbatim, in each budget since. That’s not uncommon in the state budget. The document spans thousands of pages and includes 10 bills that allocate more than $160 billion. It’s routine for staff who write the bills to copy and paste language from the year before. Kolb’s view During budget votes, bills are delivered in the middle of the night with emergency ""messages of necessity"" from the governor. Members of the Assembly and Senate have to vote on the bills that are in front of them, said Michael Fraser, who’s Kolb’s director of communications. Kolb’s claim about Start-Up NY came immediately after the final budget passed, near 4 a.m., Fraser said.  ""We don’t have the luxury of getting promises from agencies about what they may or may not do,"" Fraser said. ""Frankly, what’s actually in the law far outweighs what’s said after the fact. ""What we do know is that the bill clearly mentions Start-Up NY by name,"" he said. ""It presents a very specific percentage of funds that would be used outside New York."" That is specifically written into the bill, Fraser said.   He made a comparison to school district funding. Most district are not listed by name.  ""School aid is presented as a lump-sum of money that we know will flow to every school district in the state, but that’s not explicitly spelled out,"" he said.   Our ruling Kolb said the state budget directs millions of dollars to advertise the Start-Up NY program.

California lawmaker says Coast Guard confiscates tons of illegal drugs
","U.S. Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., said that if President Donald Trump wants to make the country safer, he should focus more on funding the Coast Guard than on his promised border wall. After all, Garamendi claimed, the Coast Guard confiscates tons of contraband. ""I'm concerned about border security. I'm concerned about the Coast Guard being underfunded,"" Garamendi said in an April 2 CNN interview. ""Fact of the matter is, the Coast Guard confiscated 200 tons of contraband, heroin, and so forth. At the border they collected 20 tons. So if you want to go where the problem is, fund the Coast Guard."" Trump says a southern border wall will stop drugs from coming in and alleviate the nation’s drug overdose epidemic. Drug trade and policy experts are skeptical about that. In his first year, the Trump administration did initially explore a Coast Guard budget cut to offset costs of the southern border wall, prompting bipartisan group of senators to send a letter to the White House against it. The final proposal did not cut the Coast Guard’s budget. The Coast Guard got $12.1 billion in the omnibus spending bill that Trump signed into law in March. So, is Garamendi’s claim about Coast Guard confiscations true? He’s largely accurate about their enforcement efforts, but his remarks omit nuance and need clarification. To start, his office said he meant to highlight interdictions of cocaine, not heroin. The Coast Guard in fiscal year 2017 removed 223.8 metric tons of cocaine from non-commercial vessels in drug transit zones. Removal figures represent cocaine physically seized by the Coast Guard and cocaine discarded or destroyed by criminal organizations due to Coast Guard action. The 223.8 metric tons removed represents about 8 percent of all the cocaine estimated to have flowed toward the United States in 2017. The amount lost is ""at times, an intelligence-based estimate of the quantity of cocaine onboard a given vessel that is burned, jettisoned, or scuttled in an attempt to destroy evidence when Coast Guard presence is detected,"" said a January 2018 report from the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Homeland Security. In addition to the cocaine removed, the Coast Guard told PolitiFact that in 2017 it also removed 31,190 pounds of marijuana, 6 kilograms of heroin and other opiates, and 168 kilograms of methamphetamines. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in September 2017 commended the Coast Guard for setting a new record. ""This record-breaking year by our Coast Guard saw the arrest of more than 500 suspected drug traffickers and kept nearly half a million pounds of dangerous drugs from getting to our streets — and ultimately to our neighbors, friends, and families,"" Sessions said. The Coast Guard in an October 2017 blog post also said its crews and interagency partners’ 2017 record stopped over 455,000 pounds of cocaine worth over $6 billion wholesale. ""Annually, the Coast Guard interdicts more than three times the amount of cocaine seized at our borders and within the U.S. combined,"" the blog post said. Now let’s look at the border. Garamendi’s remark that ""at the border they collected 20 tons"" also made it sound as if ""they"" still referred to the Coast Guard. While the Coast Guard is not responsible for land border interdictions, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that in fiscal year 2017, its field officers and Border Patrol agents seized about 66,000 pounds of cocaine (about 30 metric tons). ""Interdictions at the land border average around 20 metric tons with another 20 metric tons by law enforcement inside our borders,"" said Eric Olsen, Garamendi’s press secretary. In a story about the Coast Guard’s record year, the Washington Post quoted Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, the Coast Guard commandant, as saying that he looks at a border wall ""as a goal-line defense."" ""The fact is that we have awareness of these drug movements and actually are attacking because we know where they’re at, and just don’t have enough attackers,"" Zukunft said, according to the newspaper. ""The border really is your last-stop measure."" Garamendi in a CNN interview said, ""The Coast Guard confiscated 200 tons of contraband, heroin, and so forth. At the border they collected 20 tons."" Garamendi’s office said that the congressman meant to highlight interdictions of cocaine, not heroin.  The Coast Guard in fiscal year 2017 removed 223.8 metric tons of cocaine from non-commercial vessels in drug transit zones. Not all of that is ""confiscated"" —  it includes cocaine physically seized by the Coast Guard and cocaine discarded or destroyed by criminals in attempts to eliminate evidence. It collected substantially smaller amounts of heroin by comparison. CBP officers and Border Patrol agents seized about 30 metric tons of cocaine in fiscal year 2017. Garamendi’s comparison is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC93B680>],/factchecks/2018/apr/09/john-garamendi/california-lawmaker-says-coast-guard-confiscates-t/

Can taxpayers expect card-sized tax forms next year, as Donald Trump says?
","If you are struggling to finish and file your taxes right now, something President Donald Trump said during a recent visit to West Virginia probably sounds like a godsend. ""This will be the last time — April — that you’re going to (fill out) that old-fashioned, big, lots of pages, complicated tax form,"" Trump said during his April 5 visit. ""Because next April you’re going to, in many cases, (file) one page, one card. It’s going to be very, very different. Very, very different."" Trump was focused on this point, saying at another occasion during the event, ""You’ll have a nice, simple form next year. This will be the last year. So take pictures of it and enjoy it. This is the last time you’ll have to file a very complex and big tax form. It will be much easier starting next April."" But Trump’s assurance is dubious. There isn’t an option today for filing taxes on a ""card"" — and there’s nothing in the new law that would create one. The idea for this popped up in November. House Republicans touted their plan as one that could be accommodated by a postcard-sized form. The president liked the idea so much that he held one up and kissed it for the cameras when meeting with lawmakers at the White House. ""It's going to make life very simple,"" he said Nov. 2, 2017. ""The only people that aren't going to like this is H&R Block. They're not going to be very happy. That's probably one of the only companies in the country that's not going to be thrilled."" In the end, the bill didn't require this. There is already a pretty easy way to file your tax returns, the 1040EZ form. It looks like this, with just one page to fill out:  ""While it’s not postcard-sized, it’s pretty simple, and whatever they end up with in the future will probably look a lot like that currently does,"" said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us in December. The 1040EZ is also popular. According to IRS statistics for the 2015 tax year, 23.3 million tax filers used the 1040EZ. That’s about one of every six filers. Could the number of people using the 1040EZ increase in 2019 due to the tax bill’s passage? When we checked with the White House, they told us that Trump was referring to increases in the standard deduction and the curtailment of the alternative minimum tax for many taxpayers, results that should simplify tax filings for many Americans. Before the new law took effect, about 70 percent of filers used the standard deduction, said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation. ""With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in place, we estimate that could increase to about 90 percent of filers,"" he said. ""Using the standard deduction rather than itemizing certainly makes filing taxes a simpler process."" However, Buhl added, ""the basic forms and process for submitting a return either with the standard deduction or with itemized deductions will not change much. So we aren’t at the point of just needing a postcard."" Meanwhile, some filers could actually see greater complexity than in the past, Buhl said. ""There are new pass-through business deduction rules looming that could provide an additional tax cut for some, but likely make their filings more complex,"" he said. Joseph Rosenberg, senior research associate at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has told us that the number of 1040EZ users might increase on the margins, but added that ""there are relatively few people who currently itemize who have a simple enough situation"" to shift to the 1040EZ. Trump said, ""This will be the last time — April — that you’re going to (fill out) that old-fashioned, big, lots of pages, complicated tax form. Because next April you’re going to, in many cases, (file) one page, one card. It’s going to be very, very different. Very, very different."" There is no new card- or postcard-filing option in the pipeline due to the law passed last December. As it happens, simpler filing options already exist and are widely used — but tax experts do not expect a surge in their use as a result of the tax bill in April 2019. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACC9200>],/factchecks/2018/apr/09/donald-trump/can-taxpayers-expect-card-sized-tax-forms-file-nex/
"['Economy', 'Pennsylvania', 'Paul Mango']","
Paul Mango's negative economic portrait of Pennsylvania is backed up
","In his primary bid for Pennsylvania governor, Pittsburgh-area businessman and Republican candidate Paul Mango says the Commonwealth’s economy is stalled and lagging behind those in most states across the country. ""Today, we have higher unemployment and lower job growth than most,"" Mango says in a three-minute-long online campaign video that was released in May 2017. Mango is one of three Republicans running in next month’s primary. Incumbent Gov. Tom Wolf will be on the November ballot. While it’s accurate that Pennsylvania’s economy has not rebounded as quickly as some following the Great Recession, is it true that its unemployment is higher and job growth ""lower than most""? Unemployment  Mango’s campaign video was released in May 2017, the same month he formally declared his candidacy for governor. At the time the ad was released, Pennsylvania’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.8 percent and higher than the rates in roughly 40 other states, according to data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The national unemployment rate in May of 2017 was 4.3 percent. The same holds true today. Per Bureau of Labor Statistics data for Feb. 2018, Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate remained at 4.8 percent and higher than the unemployment rates of roughly 44 other states. The national rate was 4.1 percent last month. Job growth That brings us to the subject of job growth in Pennsylvania. It’s true that the Commonwealth’s economy did not rebound as quickly as some others following the Great Recession. But Antony Davies, an associate economics professor in Duquesne University’s Palumbo Donahue School of Business, said it’s also worth noting that Pennsylvania didn’t suffer as badly as many states during the recession, and therefore didn’t have as far to go in climbing out. ""In 2009, unemployment nationwide was around 10 percent,"" Davies said by phone. ""In Pennsylvania at that same time, it was around 8.4 or 8.5. We haven't improved as much as the rest of the country, but we didn’t start off as bad either."" In his ad, Mango cites a 2016Philly.comarticle for his claim that Pennsylvania’s job growth remains unusually sluggish. That article says Pennsylvania job growth ""has not been sufficient to keep up with the growth in the labor force."" Matt Beynon, a spokesman for Mango’s campaign, said the campaign relied on news reports but also substantiated the claim with source data put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ""Using either total employment or non-farm employment, Pennsylvania is in the bottom half of all the states when it comes to job growth during the Wolf administration from Jan 2015-February 2018,"" Beynon said by email. ""Additionally, it is also true that total employment in Pennsylvania has dropped each month now over the last ten months, as Pennsylvania’s economy continues to fall further behind other states."" Frank Gamrat, a senior research associate with the Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, a Pittsburgh-based conservative think tank, said Pennsylvania actually hasn't had a decrease to its private jobs count since May of 2010 but showed slower private employment gains than the nation did as a whole between 2016 and 2017. (Again, Mango’s ad was released in May of 2017.) And jobs continue to be added here. In February, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) monthly payroll survey reported 10,400 jobs were added in Pennsylvania and ranks that ahead of 37 other states and the District of Columbia. These same figures were cited in a release from the office of U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico and ranking member of the Senate’s Joint Economic Committee, which said Pennsylvania added 82,800 public and private sector jobs since February of last year, more than 43 other states in that time. Additionally, the Economic Policy Institute in March reported that the number of jobs added in Pennsylvania in the last 12 months is on par with the growth seen in most other states. Our ruling  Mango is right that Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate remains higher than the rates of most other states, according to federal data. It’s also true that Pennsylvania job growth has generally lagged behind the national rate — although that appears to be correcting some. But his claim that Pennsylvania has lower job growth ""than most"" gives the impression that most states are seeing stronger job creation. The national rate and individual state rates are not the same thing. The national rate is skewed by states like California with larger populations and larger workforces than most, Davies said. It’s also important to note that some states with greater post-recession job growth suffered greater recession-era job losses than Pennsylvania, as Davies also pointed out. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACC4E00>],/factchecks/2018/apr/09/paul-mango/paul-mangos-dire-economic-portrait-pennsylvania-mo/
"['Abortion', 'Federal Budget', 'North Carolina', 'Robert Pittenger']","
Pittenger says bill doesn't designate money for Planned Parenthood
","The recent federal spending bill has become a point of contention in the Republican primary for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District seat. Incumbent Rep. Robert Pittenger faces a challenge from Rev. Mark Harris, who lost the 2016 primary against Pittenger by only 134 votes. The duo has traded barbs over Pittenger’s voting record, whether Harris worked to stop Donald Trump from becoming president and now over the omnibus bill that Congress passed and Trump signed in March. Harris thinks Pittenger should’ve opposed the bill since it didn’t fully fund a border wall, among other reasons. Pittenger, meanwhile, has touted its benefits. One of the bill’s positives, Pittenger said in a recent newsletter, is that the bill ""does not designate a single dollar for Planned Parenthood."" When asked about the newsletter, Pittenger’s staff pointed to a breakdown of the omnibus bill that was circulated by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chair of the House Republican Conference. Her summary of the bill, emailed to House Republicans, says ""there has never been a line item for Planned Parenthood in the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill."" The Pittenger campaign also pointed out a congratulatory letter he received from the National Right to Life organization – which the campaign included in its statement about Planned Parenthood funding. National Right to Life is an anti-abortion group that has endorsed Pittenger and gives him a 100 percent ""pro-life"" voting record. Funding remains The group’s letter supports Pittenger’s claim that the bill doesn’t include any ""line item"" money specifically for Planned Parenthood. But, the NRL letter notes that Planned Parenthood affiliates ""are able to tap into funds from the various long-standing health programs."" ""The greatest amount of federal money to Planned Parenthood flows through so-called ‘mandatory spending programs,’ mostly Medicaid,"" the letter says. Indeed, recent estimates show that the organization about 40 percent of its funding from the government. Planned Parenthood receives more than $500 million in combined state and federal government funds. If a Medicaid patient comes to Planned Parenthood, the organization can bill the organization for services the patient chooses. Another portion can come through the government’s Title X Family program, which subsidizes birth control and tests for sexually-transmitted diseases. But Congress and President Donald Trump last year passed a law that allows states to withhold that funding for groups like Planned Parenthood. Pittenger voted for that law. Lawrence Shaheen, a spokesman for the Pittenger campaign, argued that the newsletter isn’t deceptive because it included the National Right to Life letter explaining that Planned Parenthood still receives funding through other means. Some tried to cut all funds So the omnibus bill doesn’t end funding for Planned Parenthood, even if the health organization isn’t specifically mentioned as a funding recipient. But it wasn’t for a lack of trying by some Republicans in Congress. Some House Republicans – including several from the House Freedom Caucus – tied their support for the spending bill to cutting federal funding to Planned Parenthood, according to Politico. However, the effort died largely because the bill wouldn’t garner enough support in the Senate to pass, according to Vox. Planned Parenthood's continued eligibility for federal funding prompted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to tout the bill as a victory for Democrats. ""We don’t have the House. We don’t have the Senate. We don’t have the presidency,"" Schumer said, ""but we produced a darn good bill for the priorities that we have believed in."" While the omnibus bill gives no new funding to Planned Parenthood and doesn’t designate money for the organization by name, it does allow Planned Parenthood to continue receiving money from the federal government. Our ruling Pittenger said the spending bill ""does not designate a single dollar for Planned Parenthood."" Technically, in the very literal sense of the word ""designate,"" Pittenger is right. The bill doesn’t specifically direct funding to Planned Parenthood by name. But the federal government continues to pay for Planned Parenthood’s services through Medicaid and other programs. And since voters are more likely to care about whether their tax dollars go to an organization – not whether the organization is specifically named in legislation – we rate Pittenger's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC0D200>],/factchecks/2018/apr/06/robert-pittenger/pittenger-says-bill-doesnt-designate-money-planned/

No proof of Trump's conspiracy theory that millions voted many times
","In a speech in West Virginia that was billed as being about tax reform, President Donald Trump continued his refrain about widespread voter fraud by stating that millions of people vote multiple times. ""In many places, like California, the same person votes many times,"" he said. ""You probably heard about that. They always like to say 'oh that's a conspiracy theory.' Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people, and it's very hard because the state guards their records. They don’t want to see it."" Is there evidence that millions and millions of people have voted many times? No, there's not. But we will summarize the research on this topic. National experts have said that voter fraud is isolated and rare -- and the same holds true for voting multiple times, a phenomenon called double voting. Double voting -- a person casting more than one ballot in an election -- is not the same thing as a person being registered in more than one state, which often happens when people move. Pew found in 2012 that approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state. But as we’ll see, that doesn’t mean that 2.75 million people actually voted more than once. We contacted Trump’s spokesman to ask for evidence and didn’t get a reply. A group of experts in computer science and political science from Stanford and University of Pennsylvania published a paper in 2017 that estimated the prevalence of double voting in the 130 million ballots cast in the 2012 presidential election. The researchers estimated that 33,000 votes, or .02 percent of the votes cast, could have been double votes, but they called that an upper-bound estimate. ""We would expect to estimate there were around 33,000 double voters even if there were no actual double votes cast,"" they wrote. The paper concluded that there was almost no chance that double votes could affect the outcome of a national election. The researchers explained in an essay in Slate that double voting is hard to detect because voting records cannot be easily linked across state lines. Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state of Kansas, who helped lead Trump’s now defunct voter fraud commission, promotes the Interstate Crosscheck Program, an ongoing program that coordinates the collection of registration records across states. As of 2014, 28 participating states provided the program with their registration records. The states received a list of registrations in their own state that matched the first name, last name, and date of birth recorded on a registration in another member state. In the 2012 election, Crosscheck flagged more than 1.4 million registrations as potential duplicates that member states should further scrutinize. But the key word there is potential. ""In a country where 130 million votes are cast in a presidential election, there is a surprisingly high chance that two ballots cast under the same first name, last name, and date of birth actually belong to two different people,"" the researchers wrote. ""While it is unlikely that any two randomly selected vote records would share a common first name, last name, and birthdate, a sizable number of these cases will occur once we aggregate over the 10 quadrillion pairs of vote records in the population. This phenomenon is what statisticians call the birthday paradox."" There have been some investigations into double voting, some of which led to prosecutions, but they are rare -- far, far less than millions of votes. The conservative Heritage Foundation keeps a voter fraud database which said it showed 1,071 proven instances of fraud including 961 criminal convictions between the 1980s and 2017. Using the database, we counted 80 criminal conviction cases for duplicate voting between 2001 and 2017. (In a few cases, two individuals were convicted.) The California Secretary of State was investigating 56 allegations of double voting as of March 2017, according to its response to a public records request by CALmatters, a nonprofit journalism venture. The New Hampshire Department of State and Department Safety said in the fall of 2017 that 196 people were being investigated as possibly having voted in New Hampshire and one other state. This information is still under view, and the state expects to announce findings in June. News 21, a national investigative reporting project, found that there had been 13 cases in Arizona prosecuted for double voting, according to a 2016 report. In North Carolina, Verna Roehm, 77, pleaded guilty to voting twice after she admitted that she fulfilled her dying husband’s wish to vote for Mitt Romney in 2012. Voting experts such as Loyola law professor Justin Levitt said that no research backs up Trump’s statement. ""There is zero evidence for President Trump’s claim that there are millions and millions of double voters,"" he said. ""Zero."" Trump said, ""In many places, like California, the same person votes many times. You probably heard about that. They always like to say 'oh that's a conspiracy theory.' Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people. They don’t want to see it."" While there have been some investigations into multiple voting allegations, including some convictions, they are rare. We found no evidence that the amount of double voting is anywhere close to millions. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

"['Baseball', 'PunditFact', 'Snapple']","

Are there only 18 minutes of action in a baseball game?
","  With the new major league season under way, we thought we’d take a break from fact-checking trade wars and immigration disputes and turn our gaze toward greener pastures. Our subject: A self-styled ""real fact"" printed on the underside of a Snapple bottle cap. The drink company puts hundreds of bits of trivia on its bottle caps on a rotating basis. This bottle cap said, ""There are only 18 minutes of total action in an average baseball game."" (As it happens, Snapple just inked a partnership with Major League Baseball.) Is that right? Let’s acknowledge — ahem — right off the bat that not everyone agrees that this is an enlightening factoid. ""I have seen such numbers attributed to various sports, including baseball, but I never delved further, as this seems a singularly stupid calculation, as if baseball in particular were a sport of more or less continuous action, like soccer or hockey or basketball,"" Major League Baseball’s official historian, John Thorn, told PolitiFact. That said, the statistic appears to come from a study published by the Wall Street Journal in 2013. The author and study designer, Steve Moyer, had a long career in baseball statistics before his death on March 1. Based on a sampling of three games that he painstakingly stopwatched and coded, Moyer found that, on average, ""a baseball fan will see 17 minutes and 58 seconds of action over the course of a three-hour game. This is roughly the equivalent of a TED Talk, a Broadway intermission or the missing section of the Watergate tapes."" That’s also more action than a similar Wall Street Journal study found for pro football in 2010 -- just 11 minutes. (Basketball, hockey and soccer don’t break down as easily into action and non-action segments.) Moyer counted two types of action that together totaled 17 minutes and 58 seconds: • Balls in play or runners advancing: five minutes, 47 seconds • Other action (such as pitches, foul balls and pickoffs): 12 minutes, 11 seconds In addition, Moyer broke down different types of inaction. One was the time between batters (33 minutes, 39 seconds). This included ""knocking the weighted donut off the bat, announcing the batter, the walk-up song, cleaning the cleats,"" Moyer wrote. Another was the time between innings (42 minutes, 41 seconds). But easily the biggest chunk of dead time was time between pitches (one hour, 14 minutes, 49 seconds). This, Moyer explained, ""includes the unstrapping and re-strapping the batting gloves, sleeve adjusting, helmet adjusting, practice swings, plus the pitcher doing whatever it is he does as well. … Sometimes the pitcher will walk around or pick up the rosin bag, sometimes more than one sign will be necessary, sometimes the batter calls time and the whole process starts over."" Because stopwatching an entire ballgame -- much less several of them -- is taxing, the experiment hasn’t been done very often, so it’s hard to know if the sample of games is skewed in some way. We found one additional study by Fox Sports that looked at a pair of major league games in 2010. Fox Sports found 14 minutes of action -- not precisely the same as what the Journal found, but an amount that was ""in the ballpark,"" Grant Brisbee, who writes on baseball for the sports site SB Nation, told PolitiFact. (Yes, Grant, we got the pun.) We contacted Brisbee because he had taken his own look at a related question for SB Nation in 2017. Brisbee was trying to puzzle out the main reason why major league games have become so long in recent years. Time has become an increasing issue for baseball, a sport that is famously not run according to a clock. In recent years, major league games have run longer and longer. In 2017, the average length of games hit a full-season record of three hours, five minutes. Using data from baseball-reference.com, we plotted out the inexorably lengthening duration of the average major league game, from a little over two hours right after World War II to a little over three hours today. As a result, time has become a serious concern at Major League Baseball headquarters. For 2018, officials instituted several new rules that were designed to speed up the game, including a limit on the number of visits that managers, coaches or players can visit the mound every nine innings, and changes designed to speed up video reviews of umpires’ calls. Officials also kept in place rules that had been enacted in recent years, such as limits on when players can leave the batter’s box between pitches, and on how quickly pitchers have to get ready between innings. (A pitch clock -- now being used in some minor leagues -- was considered, but deferred.) So, back to Brisbee’s question: Why are major league games getting longer? To answer the question, he decided to stopwatch two games -- one from 1984 and one from 2014. Going into the project, Brisbee figured that commercials -- primarily between-inning time -- would account for the longer game time. As it turned out, he did find an increase, but it wasn’t dramatic. Instead, the culprit was the time between pitches, Brisbee found. He zeroed in on what he called ""inaction pitches"" -- balls, called strikes, or missed swinging strikes that didn’t result in the end of an at-bat or the advancement of a runner. Brisbee found that 146 inaction pitches were thrown in the 1984 game, with 144 such pitches in the 2014 game -- an almost identical amount. What wasn’t identical was the time those inaction pitches took up. In the 1984 game, inaction pitches accounted for 32 minutes and 47 seconds. In the 2014 game, they accounted for 57 minutes and 41 seconds. That’s nearly an 80 percent increase. ""Pitchers don’t get rid of the ball like they used to,"" he wrote. ""Hitters aren’t expecting them to get rid of the ball like they used to. It adds a couple minutes to every half-inning, which adds close to a half-hour."" It’s worth noting that there is technically a rule to curb this — and there has been for more than a century. ""Since 1901, baseball has mandated that a pitcher must deliver the ball to a batter within 20 seconds after receiving it from the catcher,"" Moyer noted in his study. But ask any baseball fan if they’ve ever seen that rule enforced and the answer will surely be no. Of course, long games can have their charms ""My perspective is that something is always happening in baseball even when the action on the field has come to a stop,"" said Thorn, the historian. ""Indeed it is the interstices between plays that to me are most valuable, as they permit conversation or reflection."" The Snapple cap said, ""There are only 18 minutes of total action in an average baseball game."" One credible study found just shy of 18 minutes of action, while another study was close, finding 14 minutes. That said, the number of stopwatched games is low due to the difficulty of the task -- only a half-dozen or so that we could find -- meaning that it’s hard to rule out a skewed statistical sample.

No, USPS doesn't lose $1.46 on every Amazon package
","Conservative pundit Eric Bolling joined in on the Amazon-USPS firestorm President Donald Trump initiated recently, putting a price tag on the post office’s purported losses. ""USPS loses $1.46 (on) each Amazon package it delivers,"" Bolling tweeted. Big Banana:Cable newsers claim “none of that is true” (@realDonaldTrump re: Amazon use of USPS)An Apple:1) The US Postal Service is, in fact, taxpayer “backed”An Apple:2) USPS loses $1.46 each Amazon package it delivers*Big AppleTrumpDerangementSyndrome thrives in media Is the Postal Service losing $1.46 on each Amazon parcel? No. This number is a suggestion from a detailed report of how much more the post office should charge to increase its revenues. It doesn't represent losses. For the record, Bolling acknowledged that Amazon wasn’t even the cause of the Postal Service’s losses. ""Without Amazon, @usps would owe us a ton more $$ than they already do,"" Bolling tweeted. Bolling pointed us to Wall Street Journal and Washington Examiner op-eds that cited the same April 2017 Citigroup study as the source of the $1.46 number. The study focused on how to make the post office break even, given they have lost $65.1 billion since 2007. The Postal Service reported a net loss of $2.7 billion for 2017. Citigroup acknowledges much of the red ink is due to a 2006 law requiring the Postal Service to pre-fund future retirees’ health benefits. Citigroup came up with two responses. One was increasing competitive package deliveries; the other was increasing prices on them. (Competitive packages are those USPS delivers for private companies like Amazon.) They focused only on competitive products, which they determined to be the Postal Service’s main hope for solvency. The report recommended the post office increase prices on package deliveries by $1.46, and that’s where Bolling got his number. That number was arrived at using theoretical pricing models, given that shipping rates for competitive products are kept private between the Postal Service and the company. Another issue is that the price increase was suggested for all of the Post Office’s competitive products clients, not just Amazon. That’s crucial, as the rates the Post Office charges private companies varies depending on the deal each strikes. The Postal Regulatory Commission, which audits these deals, currently mandates that at least 5.5 percent of the Postal Service’s overhead costs be covered by competitive products. USPS factors in overhead costs when charging companies for shipping their packages. We don’t know the actual cost USPS passes onto its individual clients, because those contracts are kept under wraps. UPS, a primary competitor, believes the Postal Service should be charging higher rates, according to a complaint UPS filed to the Postal Regulatory Commission. UPS said the overhead costs were outdated, as they were determined in 2006, when packages comprised a much smaller fraction of the Postal Service’s operations. UPS instead suggested the Postal Service charge a minimum of 24.6 percent to calculate overhead costs. This represents the average share of competitive products in the Postal Service revenue in 2012-14. The Postal Regulatory Commission didn’t see the merit in that calculation in response to UPS. It did, however, propose a higher floor rate that is under review. ""Such an approach, which would allocate institutional costs to products based on those products’ relative shares of total attributable costs, has long been rejected by the Commission and by economists in general as being inherently arbitrary,"" the report reads. In order to arrive at the $1.46 price tag, Citigroup subtracted the price they assumed USPS was charging clients if they only had to cover 5.5 percent of overhead costs from the price USPS would have to charge clients if they had to cover 24.6 percent overhead costs. But 5.5 percent is a floor, not a ceiling rate. We don’t know how much USPS charges clients, just how much the law mandates they charge at a minimum. In fact, in 2017, competitive products covered 22.9 percent of the Postal Service’s overhead costs. That’s after accounting for their individual attributable costs (which are the ones the postal commission determines wouldn’t exist if USPS didn’t have a deal with that company). Citi had suggested 24.6 percent. Competitive prices, then, would only have to increase by 10 cents to contribute the 24.6 percent target in fiscal year 2017. Bolling said ""USPS loses $1.46 each Amazon package it delivers."" The $1.46 figure comes from an April 2017 Citigroup analysis, but Bolling cites the figure inaccurately. The number is what Citigroup suggested the post office charge if it wanted to make more money by using a new pricing formula. The report made no suggestion that the post office was losing that much money on current, actual deliveries. Bolling’s statement is not accurate and we rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA976240>],/factchecks/2018/apr/06/eric-bolling/usps-amazon-lose-146-every-package-delivers/

Gabrielle Giffords group claims gun-rights backer Paul Ryan has blocked all gun-control measures
","After the Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, news reports said U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan had thrown cold water on, and shown little interest in, new proposals for gun control. But an attack on the Wisconsin Republican by Giffords PAC, a political action committee named for Gabrielle Giffords, went much further. Ryan ""has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws,"" Giffords PAC claimed in an online ad released March 13, 2018. As the House speaker since October 2015, Ryan holds one of the most powerful positions in Washington, although other lawmakers, such as committee chairs, have influence over the fate of legislation. And all, of course, is an extreme word. So, let’s see what the record shows on Ryan and gun laws during his time as speaker. Giffords PAC Giffords is a former Democratic U.S. House member from Arizona. In 2011, she was shot while meeting with constituents in Tucson. The shooter killed six people and wounded 13 others. Giffords PAC describes itself as backing elected officials and candidates ""who step up to fight the gun violence epidemic."" Two weeks before releasing the Ryan ad, the PAC launched a campaign that included Ryan as one of six lawmakers on a #VoteThemOut list. Two Democrats are running for the southern Wisconsin seat held by Ryan, who hasn’t yet announced whether he will run for re-election in November 2018. The PAC’s evidence To back its attack on Ryan, Giffords PAC cited a dozen pieces of gun legislation that were pending since Ryan became speaker. Here are five, each of which was referred to a House committee, but was not voted out of that committee for a vote by the full House: Bill Key provision HR 1217 Reauthorize grants for improvements to the criminal history record system HR 2216 Prohibits sale of gun to person who is subject to restraining order HR 3130 Makes it crime to knowingly give/sell gun to person convicted of misdemeanor stalking HR 1475 Prohibits giving false or misleading material information in connection with a firearm purchase or transfer HR 1478 Ends prohibition on U.S. Department of Health and Human Services using federal funds to promote gun control Giffords PAC argues that the bills were blocked by Ryan by virtue of the fact that the main power of the House speaker -- as explained by a Washington Post primer on House leadership -- ""derives from his or her ability to determine what bills come to the floor for debate and a vote."" But the PAC provided no evidence that Ryan actually took steps to block the bills. And bills can be blocked by other lawmakers, such as committee chairs. Now to whether there are gun measures that Ryan has not blocked. Ryan’s response To refute the attack, Ryan’s campaign organization cited three measures that passed the House: Measure Key provisions HR 2646 More beds for people with mental illness who need short-term hospitalization HR 4909 Grants to improve school security, including with metal detectors, and to fund training, threat assessments, school and police coordination HR 38 Let people with concealed carry license bring guns across state lines; strengthen National Instant Criminal Background Check System The first two bills make no reference to guns, even if the school measure is aimed at fighting gun violence. The other bill, however, did strengthen background checks, even if it it would also permit additional transportation of guns across state lines. Ryan’s campaign also argued that Ryan has not stood in the way of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from banning bump stocks -- which accelerate a gun’s firing speed -- with regulations using existing law. But it’s not clear that ATF could do so without new legislation; indeed, the Justice Department has said it does not have the legal authority under current law to do so. And Ryan has indicated that the House would not take up a bill that would explicitly allow a ban. Our rating Giffords PAC says: ""Paul Ryan has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws."" The anti-gun violence political action committee cited a dozen gun-control measures that didn’t get to a vote in the House. So, it’s clear that Ryan did not move to bring those measures to the floor. But that’s not the same as Ryan himself blocking the measures, given that other lawmakers, such as committee chairs, also have such power. Also, a bill that would strengthen background checks did pass the House -- although it also expanded gun rights, by making it legal for licensed concealed carry holders to bring guns across state lines. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB26E40>],/factchecks/2018/apr/06/giffords/gabrielle-giffords-group-claims-gun-rights-backer-/

Do Republicans in Congress want to take away Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid?
","It’s been a time-tested Democratic attack line: Republicans are going to take away your Medicare, or maybe your Social Security. We gave a variant of the line our 2011 Lie of the Year. Now the talking point has re-emerged, in a March 29 tweet, from Oregon’s Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee: ""#TrumpTax was only the beginning. After giving massive tax giveaways to wealthy & powerful shareholders, Republicans in Congress are plotting to take away Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."" 🚨 #TrumpTax was only the beginning. After giving massive tax giveaways to wealthy & powerful shareholders, Republicans in Congress are plotting to take away Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.https://t.co/9YTuAYnOWw In reality, the notion that congressional Republicans are scheming to ""take away"" Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security is inaccurate. The Democratic news release The first piece of evidence undercutting the tweet’s message is actually linked in the tweet itself. An accompanying Senate Democratic press release, dated March 27, starts by saying, ""It’s only been a few months since Republicans jammed through their massive giveaway to corporate executives and wealthy shareholders. Now they’re planning on paying for it with huge cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, despite President Trump’s promises that he wouldn’t do so."" ""Huge cuts,"" the phrase used in the press release, sounds scary. But it’s not the same as saying the Republicans will ""take away"" the programs. The release goes on to cite specific comments by Republican leaders. These comments focus on changes to ""entitlements,"" the wonky term for federal programs that automatically allocate benefits to qualified recipients, rather than being dependent on Congress appropriating enough money every year. Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for the largest share of the federal budget. The Senate Democratic release includes two separate comments from House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in December 2017 talking about returning to entitlement reform in 2018. The release quotes Ryan at a subsequent press conference on March 20, 2018, saying, ""The House passed the biggest entitlement reform bill Congress has ever considered last year, and regrettably the Senate did not follow suit. So we’re just going to have to keep at it on entitlements."" These quotes suggest the Republican in charge of the House continues to seek overhauls of the entitlement system. However, none of the proposals being weighed by Republican lawmakers would eliminate the programs. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., does not share Ryan's zeal for taking up entitlement changes. For Medicaid, Republican-proposed cuts could lead to specific individuals losing their coverage. That was the case with GOP proposals to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Under these prior proposals, other beneficiaries might have experienced cutbacks in their Medicaid coverage. But the program itself wouldn’t have been taken away. The argument that Medicare or Social Security could be eliminated is even weaker. Even if cuts to these programs are proposed — usually through limiting inflation-adjustment formulas, raising taxes on benefits, or raising the retirement age — we’ve seen no plan that scraps the programs. Wyden’s staff tacitly confirmed that cuts are the GOP’s goal. They pointed us to President Donald Trump’s 2019 budget proposal, which calls for $15.3 billion in Medicare cuts and $6.5 billion in Medicaid cuts in just the first year. Wyden’s office added that Republicans have made no secret about their desire to ""voucherize"" Medicare (by giving beneficiaries a limited amount to purchase private insurance) and to raise the eligibility age for Social Security. Still, such ideas fall well short of what the tweet said. ""Obviously the devil is in the details but reform does not equal ‘take away,’"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""And clearly there needs to be some changes to get these programs on fiscally sound footing."" AshLee Strong, Ryan’s spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that ""no one has ever proposed taking away these programs. This kind of hyperbole is what keeps our important entitlement programs on an unsustainable trajectory."" The House already passed a bill that would have curbed Medicaid, but it died in the Senate. And the Senate -- where Republicans have just a 51-49 edge in a chamber that requires 60 votes for most legislative business -- is expected to be a graveyard for legislation to rein in Medicare and Social Security. Indeed, McConnell, R-Ky., said during his year-end press conference on Dec. 22, 2017, that he does not plan to bring up entitlement reforms in the current environment due to a lack of bipartisan agreement on the sensitive issue. ""We had a missed opportunity during the Obama years, when you had divided government, like you did with Reagan and Tip O'Neill, to address the long-term unsustainability of some of our most popular programs, who currently don't meet the demographics of the country in the future,"" he said. Wyden said, ""Republicans in Congress are plotting to take away Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."" Some key Republicans, including Ryan, have long argued in favor of overhauling entitlement programs such as these by reducing the amount of money spent on them. However, no Republican proposal has been made to ""take away"" any of the three programs cited in the tweet. In addition, Wyden glosses over just how far away from passage even a more modest overhaul would be. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAABA200>],/factchecks/2018/apr/05/ron-wyden/do-republicans-congress-want-take-away-social-secu/
