Donald Trump backer Sean Duffy links attacks on police to Black Lives Matter visit with Barack Obama
","Nine days after the presidential election, a discussion about protests against Donald Trump led a Wisconsin congressman to lash out at Black Lives Matter and President Barack Obama. The attack was made on the Nov. 17, 2016 edition of ""The O’Reilly Factor"" talk show by Republican Sean Duffy, a Trump transition team member who has been mentioned as a potential challenger to Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in 2018. Fox News Channel’s Eric Bolling, who was filling in for host Bill O’Reilly, asked whether Obama should take ""a more forceful stand"" on demonstrations over Trump’s victory that, in some cities, such as Portland, Ore., turned violent. Duffy responded by saying that Obama ""might not be instigating these rallies, but he’s not shutting them down."" Then he shifted to Black Lives Matter, which formed after a Florida jury in 2013 found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teen. ""And frankly, Eric, you know, Black Lives Matter, who are attacking law enforcement officers, he (Obama)  had them to the White House. You have to recognize what President Obama is doing by not shutting down the violence that’s coming from the left-wing extremists in his party."" So, Duffy is saying that Obama, in ""not shutting down violence,"" invited members of Black Lives Matter to the White House even though members of the group ""are attacking law enforcement officers."" Attacking officers Duffy’s congressional office referred us to news reports on two incidents. August 2015: More than a year before Duffy made his statement, protesters in a Black Lives Matter march in Minnesota were captured on video yelling ""pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon."" September 2016: A Dallas police officer filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter, Obama and others, alleging they ""incite people to violence and cause violence"" against law enforcement officers, including including five Dallas officers killed in an ambush two months earlier. Duffy spokesman Mark Bednar told us: ""To incite violence, especially against a specific group of people -- in this case, law enforcement officials -- is a form of attack."" There have been isolated incidents of physical attacks against officers at Black Lives Matter events. Here are three examples from July 2016: Chicago: A well-known activist was charged with striking a police commander and trying to disarm another during a Black Lives Matter protest of fatal shootings by police in Louisiana and Minnesota. St. Paul, Minn.: 21 officers were injured after protesters blocked I-94. A Black Lives Matter St. Paul leader said the protesters throwing things at police were not from his community. But Black Lives Matter Minneapolis posted on Facebook: ""We shut down 94 for Philando,"" a reference to Philando Castile, who was shot dead days earlier by a suburban Minneapolis officer. Baton Rouge, La.: A police officer said he sustained injuries during a protest and in turn he filed a lawsuit against a prominent Black Lives Matter activist. He accused the activist of having ""incited the violence,"" but did not allege that the activist was the one who attacked him. So, there have been isolated incidents of attacks on officers during Black Lives Matter events, but it’s not always clear who is responsible. Visit to the White House The second part of Duffy’s claim refers to a forum Obama held at the White House in July 2016 involving three dozen people. News reports said Obama met for more than four hours with the group, which included two Black Lives Matter leaders, other activists, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and other elected officials, law enforcement officials and community leaders. So, this wasn’t a personal audience with the president for leaders of Black Lives Matter -- it was a large gathering of people representing diverse interests. Moreover, Obama, while defending the Black Lives Matter movement, has condemned those who advocate violence. For example, while in Madrid in July 2016, he said: ""Whenever those of us who are concerned about fairness in the criminal justice system attack police officers, you are doing a disservice to the cause."" Our rating In saying Obama is ""not shutting down violence,"" Duffy claimed: ""Black Lives Matter, who are attacking law enforcement officers"" -- Obama ""had them to the White House."" There have been isolated incidents of law enforcement officers being attacked during Black Lives Matter demonstrations, although it’s not always clear whether members of the movement are responsible. Two leaders of the movement were at a White House event with Obama, but so were some three dozen other people representing a wide variety of organizations. And Obama, while defending Black Lives Matter, has condemned attacks on police officers. For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

Clinton did co-sponsor legislation a decade ago to jail flag burners
","One thing has become apparent in the world of President-elect Donald Trump -- no incendiary tweet goes to waste. Just this week, Trump lobbed an early-morning zinger across the globe, opining on Twitter:  ""Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!"" The chattering class lit up the morning talk shows. Even some key Republicans said Trump had gone too far. Experts pointed out that flag burning, no matter how distasteful, is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled it is free speech and a legal form of protest. Some media outlets complained that Trump was being treated unfairly in the firestorm of criticism that followed. After all, they stated, Democrat Hillary Clinton had also once proposed jail time for flag burners. ""For Clinton supporters, I’m sorry to say you don’t have the high ground again; then-Sen. Clinton co-sponsored the Flag Protection Act of 2005, which carried a 12-month jail sentence to anyone who desecrates the American flag to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace,"" Matt Vespa wrote on the conservative online site Townhall.com. PolitiFact decided to look into that bit of political history. As it turns out, Clinton did back flag-burning legislation more than a decade ago. The site Congress.Gov states the Flag Protection Act of 2005 was introduced in the U.S. Senate in October 2005 as Senate Bill 1911. The site summarizes the bill this way: ""Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding desecration of the flag to prohibit: (1) destroying or damaging a U.S. flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace; (2) intentionally threatening or intimidating any person, or group of persons, by burning a U.S. flag; or (3) stealing or knowingly converting the use of a U.S. flag belonging to the United States, or belonging to another person on U.S. lands, and intentionally destroying or damaging that flag."" The bill sets a fine of up to $100,000 and jail time of up to a year for burning a U.S. flag and higher penalties for stealing or damaging one on federal property. Then-U.S. Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah, a Republican, sponsored the bill. Clinton is listed as one of four co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where it died. Political scientists point out that Republicans and Democrats have used the flag-burning issue to their benefit. The courts have ruled, but it still plays well in the court of public opinion where voters reside. ""Both parties have used the flag issue, mostly as political posturing, because everyone knows it is ‘settled law’ and the prospects for change are extremely remote,"" said political scientist Kerwin Swint of Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta. ""It's usually a Republican issue for the GOP base, but in this instance, Hillary Clinton, and other Democratic legislators, got into the act."" In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court first established flag burning as a protected First Amendment right in Texas v. Johnson. Back in 1984, Gregory Lee Johnson burned a flag at the Republican National Convention in Dallas in a protest against presidential candidate Ronald Reagan. Johnson was arrested and charged with breaking a state law. The Supreme Court voted 5-4 in favor of Johnson and against the state of Texas. Johnson’s actions, the majority argued, were symbolic speech, political in nature, and could be expressed even if it upset those who disagreed with him. ""The decisions remain controversial to the present day, and Congress in 2006 attempted to pass a joint resolution to propose an amendment to the Constitution to prohibit flag desecration, which failed by just one vote in the Senate,"" states the blog Constitution Daily. Our ruling The online site Townhall.com said Hillary Clinton co-sponsored legislation in 2005 that would jail flag burners. Clinton did indeed co-sponsor a bill that would have done just that. Republicans have backed similar legislation in the past, even though the courts have ruled flag burning is legally protected. We rate the Townhall.com statement True.  ",/factchecks/2016/dec/02/blog-posting/clinton-did-co-sponsor-legislation-decade-ago-jail/

Illinois tax burden among highest, but not in Top 5 in U.S.
","With Illinois entering its 17th month without a state budget as Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan continue their epic stalemate, Republican legislative leaders repeatedly talk about the need for a property tax freeze. They suggest the freeze, which Rauner has made a prerequisite for any budget negotiation, is particularly necessary, as the state will need to raise other taxes to cover its growing bill backlog when a budget is signed into law. Rauner has called for daily meetings with Madigan and the state’s three other legislative leaders as the state’s stopgap spending authority expires at year’s end. As the legislative leaders began those closed-door meetings in their six-day fall veto session, both Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno and House Republican Leader Jim Durkin again made the case for a property tax freeze by saying Illinois has one of the worst tax burdens nationwide. Radogno said, ""People in this state right now are suffering because they don’t have jobs. We have the fifth-highest tax burden in the country. People are moving out of their homes because of the property tax burden. These are issues that have to be addressed and have to be addressed now."" This is a claim we’ve often heard for years in Illinois, and it seems various groups are releasing rankings daily. So we decided to check this one out. Patty Schuh, press secretary to the Illinois Senate GOP staff, said the source for the fifth-worst tax burden claim was a January release of rankings by the Tax Foundation. Indeed, the nonpartisan foundation did issue rankings of the 50 states’ tax burdens that showed Illinois at No. 5 for its overall burden. But that’s not the entire picture. Measuring the rankings What does the Foundation’s overall burden measure? And is that the best, most relevant measurement? Jared Walczak, a policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, noted there are many ways to measure tax systems and rates and burdens. A state’s own tax structure can play a big part in how it ranks compared to others. For instance, he said Alaska derives a lot of its tax revenue from oil sales, but Alaskans pay relatively little of those taxes, which are paid by all of us who use gasoline, Walczak said. The Tax Foundation does measure the overall tax burden of the people paying taxes in a state, but that overall metric includes both taxes that return to Illinois and those that are paid outside of Illinois, Walczak said. Annette Nellen, a professor in and director of San José State University's graduate tax program, agreed, noting that people need to understand how the rankings are calculated and what they mean. ""I think it gets to that legislator using that information incorrectly. A legislator should look at what’s paid and what the rates are in Illinois"" if she is trying to make the argument that Illinois taxes are too high, she said. They should look at the rate in the state for income and sales and property taxes and how much does the middle quintile of taxpayers pay for various taxes within Illinois, Nellen added. The Tax Foundation’s own website notes, ""Tax collections are useful for some purposes and cited frequently. However, dividing total taxes collected by governments in a state by the state’s total income is not an accurate measure of the tax burden on a state’s residents as a whole because it does not accurately reflect the taxes that are actually paid out of that state’s income."" Walczak, the Foundation analyst, said Illinois actually ranked seventh-highest in taxes residents paid to their own state and the fifth-most overall when taxes paid outside of Illinois are included. The ranking of taxes paid by residents in their state is a more accurate reflection of the state’s tax structure and burden on residents, experts agreed. But there’s one more thing to consider. The Tax Foundation rankings were released in January but were calculated using census data from 2012, the bureau’s most recent release of that particular data. John Frendreis, a Loyola University political science professor, said the Foundation’s work was sound, but noted the income tax rate in 2012 was higher than it is now. The rate then for individuals was 5 percent but dropped in January 2015 to 3.75 percent. As a point of comparison, during the two fiscal years preceding FY 2012, the total state tax burden was 10.5 percent, which dropped Illinois several places in the ranking, Frendreis noted. Still, he said, ""In general, Illinois’ total tax burden puts it into roughly the top quarter of states on a regular basis."" Our ruling Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno said Illinois has the fifth-highest tax burden in the country. It’s a statistic she and other Republicans cite often as they argue for a property tax freeze as one of several changes they want made before they will agree to a budget with Madigan and Democrats. While independent experts say the No. 5 rank for Illinois issued by the Tax Foundation for overall tax burden is accurate, the overall burden includes taxes paid outside of Illinois and is not the best metric for the burden taxpayers carry as a result of tax policy and structure and those taxes paid within the state. Illinois actually is No. 7 nationwide by the measure that best reflects in-state tax policy set by lawmakers. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f500e006-4c6e-49cb-b6c3-eada6c7ee46a  ",/factchecks/2016/dec/02/christine-radogno/illinois-tax-burden-among-highest-not-top-5-us/
"['Taxes', 'Texas', 'Dan Patrick']","
Dan Patrick mostly right Texans pay nation's sixth-highest property taxes
","After Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick saluted legislation potentially giving voters more sway over local property taxes, we wondered afresh about how Texas ranks nationally in terms of property tax burden. Patrick, talking up a proposal hatched by fellow Republicans led by Houston state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, said in a Nov. 29, 2016, press release: ""Texans pay the sixth-highest property tax in the nation, and Texans have told us loud and clear that common-sense property tax reform legislation is long overdue."" In January 2016, we found Mostly True the same claim by a Bexar County legislative aspirant. The business-oriented Tax Foundation, a national group, drew on 2013 Census Bureau data to map the average amount of residential property tax paid as a percentage of home value state by state. By that metric, the Texas rate of 1.9 percent proved higher than the rates in 44 states; it was topped by the rates for Wisconsin, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Illinois and No. 1 New Jersey at 2.38 percent. Still, we noted, property taxes in Texas are levied locally in Texas, resulting in ample differences in the burden depending on where taxpayers live. Rankings yet to be updated Not a lot has changed since we reached that conclusion. For starters, the rankings — showing Texas with the sixth highest ""mean effective property tax rate on owner-occupied housing"" — haven’t been updated, the foundation’s Jared Walczak said to our inquiry. Yet, Walczak also told us by email, ""this does not make Texas a high-tax state. Texas has chosen to rely more heavily on property taxes, and less heavily on other taxes, than many peer states, foregoing some altogether. The state's tax structure is an important part of its economic success, and it is inevitable that, when a state foregoes an individual income tax, some other tax will be somewhat higher than it might otherwise have been."" In fact, the foundation has previously reported that in 2012 Texas ranked 46th in state-local taxes per resident. Why property taxes can be high Property taxes might be higher here because unlike most states, Texas levies no state income tax. Notably too, unlike in some states, Texas’ property tax rates are set locally, not by the state, according to the Texas state comptroller, with government units spending the revenue to provide local services including schools, streets and roads, police and fire protection and many others. Moreover, the state lacks the constitutional authority to levy a property tax, as the Texas Legislative Council noted in a 2002 overview of local taxes statewide. Generally under the current system, a county appraisal district does an annual property valuation, then each area city, county, school and special district (like hospital and road districts) sets the respective tax rate necessary to raise the money needed to fund the related adopted budget. And according to Census data, property taxes in 2013, the latest year of available data, were the source of 81.6 percent of local tax revenue in Texas (the national average for this figure was 46.7 percent). Updated information is to be posted Dec. 9, 2016, bureau spokesman Sean Patrick told us by email. Regional differences When we looked into this topic before, advocates including Dick Lavine of the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities and Dale Craymer of the business-backed Texas Taxpayers and Research Association suggested we consider a comparison study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy showing that property owners in the biggest cities of Texas, especially Houston and San Antonio, had some of the highest property taxes in 2014 compared with large cities in other states. That remained so the next year, according to a June 2016 institute study indicating, for instance, that El Paso homeowners in 2015 ranked No. 3 among the country’s 50 most populous cities in homestead property taxes on a $150,000 property or $300,000 property. Among the 50 cities, homestead taxes in large Texas cities including Austin, Dallas and San Antonio ranked No. 5 (Fort Worth) to No. 13 (Houston), according to the report. The disparity between property taxes by county comes through in real-dollar terms, although measures of taxes in terms of dollars paid can be distorted by the difference in home prices from county to county. A Tax Foundation map shows in real dollars just how much property taxes vary from county to county based on IRS data reflecting the amount of real estate taxes deducted from federal taxes. In 2013, Texas counties with residents paying the most were Travis ($7,553), Kendall ($6,916) and Fort Bend ($6,813), while those paying the least are Dickens ($1,325), Stonewall ($1,425) and Hudspeth ($1,450). Another factor to think about when considering the property tax burden for the average Texan is the rate of home ownership. The Tax Foundation map showing Texas tied for sixth-highest in property taxes considered the percentage of home value that’s paid in property taxes on owner-occupied housing. In 2015, 61.1 percent of Texas housing was owner-occupied, tying the state with Oregon for the nation’s sixth-lowest rate, according to the Census Bureau. Our ruling Patrick said: ""Texans pay the sixth-highest property tax in the nation."" While it may be true that on average, Texas property taxes are the sixth-highest in the nation, the actual taxpayer burden on residents can vary greatly by locality, making the average less representative.

Lady Gaga did not say she would cover her face until Trump is 'fired from office'
","A story about recording artist Lady Gaga announcing she would cover her face until President-elect Donald Trump is out of office appears to be masking the truth. A Nov. 25, 2016, post on TheRightists.com claimed that Gaga — née Stefani Germanotta — revealed her protest plan on a CBS Sunday Morning interview. The original post, with the headline ""Lady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again ‘Until Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More,’"" was temporarily missing after the interview aired, but has reappeared. The story also was posted practically verbatim on several other sites. After a brief synopsis of Gaga saying she lamented losing her privacy to the paparazzi as a pop singer, the post quoted her as saying she was opposed to a Trump presidency. ""I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House,"" the story quoted her as saying. She allegedly told CBS correspondent Lee Cowan that she had moved past ""wearing a mask"" as she had done with elaborate costumes earlier in her career. She thought Trump was a real monster who would drive her back to the practice, whether it was with makeup or an actual mask. ""I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,"" the story quoted her as saying. ""Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask."" While Gaga did appear in a CBS Sunday Morning segment on Nov. 27, the idea that she announced a new kind of poker face turned out to be a bald-faced lie. She said no such thing in the nine-minute interview. We also could find no mention of it on her profiles at Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, or her website. (Our inquiries to her Interscope Records label and CBS News went unanswered.) Gaga, a Hillary Clinton supporter, did make a number of moves after Election Day, protesting Trump’s victory in front of Trump Tower, signing a Change.org petition asking Republican electors to switch their votes to Clinton and recently admonishing Melania Trump’s ""hypocrisy"" for the future first lady’s plans for an anti-bullying campaign. ❤️🇺🇸I want to live in a #CountryOfKindness where #LoveTrumpsHate pic.twitter.com/Eni145YgW1 .@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for ""anti-bullying"" is hypocrisy. Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed. Gaga also really discussed with Cowan how she felt trapped in a bad romance with her public persona, unable to freely express herself outside of her own home: ""I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line, I’m not free anymore. As soon as I go out into the world, I belong, in a way, to everyone else. It’s legal to follow me. It’s legal to stalk me at the beach. I can’t call the police or ask them to leave. And I took a long, hard look at that property line, and I said, ‘Well, you know, if I can’t be free out there, I can be free in here.’"" The Nov. 25 story on TheRightists.com used similar, but not identical, wording before launching into the alleged Trump tirade. It’s possible the site was able to lift the initial gist of the interview before it aired thanks to a Nov. 23 preview of the segment on CBSNews.com. The site bills itself as a ""HYBRID site of news and satire,"" and that ""part of our stories already happens, part, not yet."" It also admits that ""NOT all of our stories are true!"" There was no indication which part of the Gaga story might be true and which part was not. Other sites that posted the story didn’t specify, either. That gives us a million reasons to find their claims unreliable. Our ruling Bloggers said Lady Gaga announced she would cover her face ""until Trump gets fired from office."" The original post, which has been taken down, was on a site that billed itself as a hybrid of news and satire, and referenced a real interview on CBS Sunday Morning. There was no indication of what was real and what was made up in the story, and it was copied by several other sites that also didn’t identify the fabricated portions. Although Gaga has spoken out against Trump, there’s no mention of him in the CBS interview — nor did she announce a plan to shield her face out of grief. Bloggers may have been looking to garner applause for this one, but Gaga’s supposed mask appears to be made out of whole cloth.

New York City mayor says president can't defund sanctuary cities 'across the board'
","New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio isn’t backing away from policies that protect immigrants living illegally in the country, even if that means cuts to his city’s budget. President-elect Donald Trump has said he will block federal funds to cities with policies or laws that limit their assistance to immigration authorities. New York is among jurisdictions considered a ""sanctuary city."" The Democratic mayor was asked on WNYC’s The Brian Lehrer Show how funding would be affected if Trump follows through on his promise. ""I think the first thing is to recognize that from what I know so far because of a decision by the Supreme Court, no president's in a position to cut off funding across the board. It has to be very specific to the matter at hand,"" de Blasio said. ""If we disagree in one particular policy area, there may be opportunities for the federal government to say, ‘well we are not going to fund you in that policy area,’ but not across the board."" As other mayors across the country stand behind their immigrant-friendly policies, we wondered about de Blasio’s comment on how much is at stake. Can funding be restrained in certain areas but not ""across the board,"" as de Blasio said? A key Supreme Court case The mayor’s press office told us he was referring to the 1987 landmark case South Dakota vs. Dole, which the mayor’s press office concluded ""that federal conditions have to be reasonable and related to the programs they are attached to."" South Dakota vs. Dole examined whether Congress exceeded its spending powers and violated the 21st Amendment (allowing states to regulate alcohol) by setting conditions for states to receive federal highway funds. Congress in 1984 enacted legislation that allowed the secretary of the Transportation Department to withhold 5 percent of federal highway funds from states where the minimum drinking age was below 21. South Dakota allowed 19-year-olds to buy alcohol. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court determined that Congress within constitutional bounds ""acted indirectly under its spending power to encourage uniformity in the states' drinking ages."" The court also said spending power must be in pursuit of ""the general welfare."" Conditions set by Congress for the disbursement of funds must also be unambiguous, related to the national project or program, not lead to unconstitutional actions and not be coercive, the court affirmed. Constitutional law experts told us de Blasio’s comment is generally sound, but noted that the Dole case is specifically about congressional spending power, not presidential authority. ""If Trump was referring to the possibility of congressional legislation that would make continued funding contingent on cooperation with federal immigration policy, then we have a possible Dole situation,"" said Christopher W. Schmidt, a law professor and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology. Imposing across-the-board spending cuts for ""sanctuary cities"" would run afoul with at least one of the criteria set in the 1987 Supreme Court case — that conditions on spending be related to the national program that Congress is seeking to advance, said Franita Tolson, a professor at Florida State University College of Law. For instance, if the federal government gives New York money for mass transit, and New York doesn't want to participate in a federal initiative for education, the federal government can't in turn threaten the mass transit funds, said Richard Primus, a law professor at the University of Michigan. Trump’s administration ""can’t cut off any federal grants to sanctuary cities unless it can show that those grants were clearly conditioned on cooperation with federal deportation policies,"" Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, wrote in an opinion piece published by the Washington Post. Conditions for funds also cannot be so great that the threat of losing federal money amounts to coercion, Primus said. Scholars pointed to the 2012 Supreme Court case National Federation of Independent Business vs. Sebelius, in which seven of the nine justices said it would be unconstitutionally coercive for Congress to withdraw Medicaid funds from states refusing to participate in the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. ""One might argue that the larger the amount of money at stake (or the ‘broader’ the threatened cut), the more coercive the condition, but there are other factors to be taken into account as well,"" said Lana Ulrich, associate in-house counsel at the National Constitution Center. In the case of sanctuary cities, spending power might be interpreted differently, Ulrich said. At issue might be the extent to which Congress may condition grants or whether Congress has the discretion to withhold funds for cities that are not in compliance with federal law,"" Ulrich said. Trump has not outlined extended details on his sanctuary city proposal, but he said that cities that refuse to assist federal authorities ""will not receive taxpayer dollars."" Our ruling In a discussion about Trump’s plans to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities, de Blasio said, ""because of a decision by the Supreme Court, no president's in a position to cut off funding across the board. It has to be very specific to the matter at hand."" It’s not as settled by law as de Blasio makes it sound, but experts say generally that the mayor is correct. The Supreme Court, in South Dakota vs. Dole, concluded that Congress could not coerce local governments to act based on the threat of withholding federal funds. Also, any funds that are withheld must be germane to the reason they are being withheld. The court ruling dealt with Congress, however, and not the executive, and there is ambiguity about both what tactic Trump might pursue and the legal precedence behind it. De Blasio's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Reports that CNN showed pornography instead of Anthony Bourdain were based on single Twitter user
","Following this year’s Thanksgiving dinner, a lone Twitter profile alleged that CNN was serving up something difficult to stomach — a half-hour of hardcore pornography. Apparently starved for content, the media ate it up. Around 10:30 p.m. ET on Nov. 24, 2016, Twitter user @solikearose tweeted from Boston that the scheduled episode of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown was not appearing on CNN. She said there was an explicit sex scene showing on the network, instead. The user shared several images with TiVo digital programming information included, tagging from Boston-area cable provider RCN.  (Image via Mediaite) Twitter being Twitter, rumors of explicit sex on a cable news channel spread quickly. Other users included the hashtag ""#BourdainPorn"" while sharing the images and discussing the alleged incident. By 9:54 a.m. ET the next day, cable provider RCN responded to the tweets. They said there had been no similar reports of pornography shown on CNN.  At some point, major media outlets picked up on the subject and started posting stories based on @solikearose’s tweets. It’s not exactly clear what media outlet first wrote up a story, because so many have since edited their postings. (The Verge contends it was the U.K.’s Independent, which was then sent out by The Drudge Report with a tweet that read, ""CNN accidentally airs 30 minutes of trans porn…"") CNN accidentally airs 30 minutes of trans porn... https://t.co/PWvbSRk6ZB Other outlets that wrote posts about the supposed network nookie included the Daily Mail, Fox News, The Wrap, Esquire, Maxim, the New York Post, the New York Daily News and more, on down to smaller sites like Sputnik News and RT.com.  The porn star in the photos, whom Twitter users identified as Riley Quinn, acknowledged the alleged exposure on Twitter. Hey @CNN thanks for the free airtime. Variety even quoted a CNN representative as saying the event indeed happened. ""The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation."" But while the story was shared far and wide in less than a day, it appeared by Friday evening that no one else had witnessed the same thing @solikearose had. On Friday evening, BuzzFeed News posted an interview with the purported original Twitter user, whom they only identified as a Boston woman named Rose. ""I initially posted because I wanted to see if anyone else in Boston had been affected,"" she said. ""I think it was a broadcasting error that affected only my house."" The person BuzzFeed News interviewed assured the site that the incident was real, and that she had conversed with a customer service representative who advised her to restart her digital cable converter. The pornography then stopped, she said. She said had made her Twitter account private because she had been harassed online. BuzzFeed News quoted RCN Boston general manager Jeff Carlson as saying there had been no other complaints about the event. The account @solikearose has since been deleted, and most of the posts on the incident have since been updated, many of them calling the incident a ""hoax."" When we contacted CNN, the network gave us the same response it gave other outlets on Nov. 25: ""Despite media reports to the contrary, RCN assures us that there was no interruption of CNN’s programming in the Boston area last night."" CNN also noted to us that while many media outlets referred to the network airing the footage, the CNN feed is the same nationwide. That means every market gets the same programming, and any difference would be through the local cable provider. Shortly after the BuzzFeed News interview was posted, RCN wrote on their Facebook page about the flap. When we contacted RCN, they referred us to the same statement, attributing it to Carlson. Our ruling Bloggers said CNN accidentally aired 30 minutes of pornography in Boston on Thanksgiving night. Every account of this incident, which undoubtedly would have given thousands of viewers indigestion, relies on tweets from a single Twitter user. Media accounts appear to have spread based on the same information, despite no other reported complaints to the cable provider. The single customer’s cable equipment may have malfunctioned somehow, the provider said, but the person’s account is working properly. Media outlets that repeated the story have since backtracked on their single-source posts.

Fox's Eric Bolling exaggerates shortcomings of Barack Obama's stimulus
","President Barack Obama will soon hand over the keys to the White House to one of his biggest critics. But the outgoing president’s 2009 stimulus bill -- officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- still drives some of his opponents to distraction. During a commentary on Nov. 26, 2016, Fox News host Eric Bolling called the stimulus measure Obama’s ""biggest failure."" ""President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (was) a fancy name for almost a trillion-dollar spending bill,"" Bolling said. ""The ARRA was supposed to fix our crumbling roads and bridges. Remember shovel-ready jobs? Well, guess what: I recall union thug head Richie Trumka laughing, saying, 'I guess those shovel-ready jobs weren't shovel-ready. Ha ha ha.' Not funny, Trumka. That's hard-working Americans handing over their well-deserved, hard-earned money to the government, only to have it wasted on you and your union thug friends. Really, really not funny, Richie. President Obama spent a trillion of your tax dollars and we have absolutely nothing to show for it."" Bolling’s description of the stimulus didn’t match up with what we remembered about the bill, so we decided to take a deeper look. We found Bolling exaggerated several key points about the legislation -- its main purpose was not to fix crumbling roads and bridges. An effort to contact Bolling through Fox News was unsuccessful. Some of the law’s shortcomings In 2009, as the country was reeling from the Great Recession, Obama signed into law a stimulus package that ultimately cost just over $800 billion. (Earlier estimates had been higher, so we won’t quibble with Bolling’s calling it a $1 trillion bill.) Even observers who see some value in the act acknowledge that it was far from perfect. Michael Grabell, a journalist with the investigative project ProPublica, wrote a book, Money Well Spent? The Truth Behind the Trillion-Dollar Stimulus, the Biggest Economic Recovery Plan in History. He concluded in a 2012 op-ed that a lesson of the stimulus is that ""government can create jobs — it just doesn’t often do it well."" Grabell wrote that ""money was spread far and wide rather than dedicated to programs with the most bang for the buck. ‘Shovel-ready’ projects, those that would put people to work right away, took too long to break ground. Investments in worthwhile long-term projects, on the other hand, were often rushed to meet arbitrary deadlines, and the resulting shoddy outcomes tarnished the projects’ image."" In addition, some economists, primarily from the center-left, have argued that the infrastructure investment was doomed because it was too small to be effective. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said that the federal expenditures on infrastructure ended up having less of an impact than expected because they were dwarfed by pullbacks in infrastructure spending by states and private companies during the same time span. ""The net effects on employment are hard to determine,"" Burtless said. Even as stimulus dollars were circulating through the economy, ""there was a huge decline in private construction of structures -- homes, apartments, shopping centers, factories, office buildings,"" along with severe cutbacks in infrastructure projects funded by cash-strapped states. Meanwhile, many conservative economists blame the stimulus for the relatively weak recovery. ""Usually the debate about whether we have ‘anything to show for it’ has to do with growth and jobs,"" said Daniel Mitchell of the free-market Cato Institute. ""And by both measures, it is very fair to say we got nothing. Indeed, we probably got negative consequences, with an abnormally weak recovery and expansion:"" That said, most of the experts we contacted said that Bolling overstated his case. The stimulus was not primarily an infrastructure bill The ""shovel-ready"" aspects of the stimulus tended to attract a disproportionate share of attention. But officially, that was only one of the act’s goals, and if you look closely at how the funds were allocated, only a fraction of the total was ever intended to go to infrastructure. According to the Council of Economic Advisers’ final report to Congress on the stimulus, which was current through February 2014, about 35 percent of the expenditures went for tax cuts for individuals and businesses; about 18 percent went for aid to cash-strapped state governments to offset cuts to health and education programs; and about 14 percent went for ""safety net"" expenditures paid to individual Americans, such as added unemployment payments. That leaves 34 percent of expenditures going to ""public investment"" -- hardly a trivial amount in an $804.6 billion bill, but still a distinct minority of the total outlay. And the amount actually spent on metal-and-concrete infrastructure was even smaller than that, since the ""public investment"" category also covers spending on such things as Pell grants, education for disabled students and scientific research. In his book, Grabell estimated that only about $80 billion, or roughly one-tenth of the act’s spending, was devoted to what people would normally think of as ""infrastructure,"" and of that, only about $27 billion was spent specifically on roads and bridges. So roads and bridges accounted for just over 3 percent of all spending under the act. So by the numbers, it would be at least as accurate to call the stimulus a tax cut bill as it would be to call it an infrastructure bill.  It’s wrong to say that ""we have absolutely nothing to show for"" the money spent First, while the impact of the tax cuts and individual payments are harder to envision than a highway or a bridge, they were an unsung success of the stimulus, Burtless said. ""The tax cuts, income and payroll, and the increases in government transfer payments largely succeeded in cushioning American households’ net after-tax incomes from the drubbing they would have received in the absence of the stimulus,"" Burtless said. In the meantime, the infrastructure spending in the stimulus, despite their shortcomings, did build things. ""The notion that the New Deal built bridges and dams while all the stimulus did was fill potholes isn't entirely true,"" Grabell wrote in his book. ""Generations from now, there will be countless projects that communities can point to as the enduring legacy of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The $80 billion for roads, runways, waterworks, rails, federal buildings, and parks was one of the largest investments in the nation's infrastructure since President Eisenhower established the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s."" Just to cite a few of the bigger projects, the Recovery Act helped push to completion the $1 billion DFW Connector highway in Dallas-Fort Worth; a $650 million elevated truck route to the Port of Tampa; a new Cleveland Innerbelt Bridge; a tunnel connecting Oakland and Contra Costa County, Calif.; new light rail lines in Salt Lake City and Dallas; a courthouse in Austin; a hospital at Camp Pendleton in California; a veterans' facility at Fort Bliss in Texas; and new headquarters for the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard. And the list of projects funded by the act runs to nine pages in his book, even though that’s just a partial accounting. Of course, even though the act produced tangible results, it’s reasonable to question whether it did so in the most efficient way possible. ""If you want to interpret (Bolling’s) statement very narrowly, I’m sure you can find a few infrastructure projects that otherwise would not have taken place,"" Mitchell said. ""But even with this narrow interpretation, keep in mind that the normal test for a positive outcome involves cost-benefit analysis. Dumping a bunch of money into the maws of state and local governments is highly unlikely to generate good results."" And Grabell said it’s important not to oversell the impact of the stimulus’ reach. ""Despite the historic investments and endless list of projects, the Recovery Act in the end created not a crater but a dent in America's overwhelming infrastructure needs,"" he wrote. ""It replaced or repaired more than 1,000 deficient or obsolete bridges, but America has more than 150,000 bridges in such conditions."" Our ruling Bolling said the stimulus was ""a fancy name for almost a trillion-dollar spending bill. The ARRA was supposed to fix our crumbling roads and bridges,"" but now, ""we have absolutely nothing to show for it."" Infrastructure efforts under the stimulus can fairly be critiqued for shortcomings in efficiency and for their relatively modest impact on promoting job growth and reducing the backlog in needed repairs and expansions. However, Bolling seriously overstates his case. Contrary to what he said, the actual expenditures in the stimulus bill on infrastructure were dwarfed by a combination of tax cuts and safety-net payments. And both these tax cuts and individual payments and the infrastructure projects funded by the bill undermine his assertion that ""we have absolutely nothing to show for"" the act. We rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6e0e521a-4147-4ad5-9506-1544a02138b9",/factchecks/2016/nov/29/eric-bolling/foxs-eric-bolling-exaggerates-shortcomings-stimulu/

Seeking recount in Donald Trump win, Jill Stein says Wisconsin uses 'outlawed' voting machines
","Capitalizing on voter discontent and perhaps looking to broaden her political base, Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein raised millions of dollars over the Thanksgiving holiday to pay for presidential election recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. On Nov. 26, 2016, a Saturday evening, Stein explained the effort on her weekly broadcast on Facebook -- and made a provocative claim about Wisconsin and the election here. ""Hello, good evening, Facebook friends, revolutionaries, citizens of the planet and of America,"" the Massachusetts activist and physician began on the video. Later, she declared: ""Wisconsin uses voting machines that have been outlawed. They are illegal to use them because they are so prone to tampering and hacking. They are an invitation, really, for malfeasance. Those are used in the state of Wisconsin."" It seems like something more serious than a recount would be under way if outlawed voting machines had been used to help Republican Donald Trump win, if not in a landslide, the White House. Stein’s campaign told us the candidate was actually referring to California banning electronic, touch-screen voting machines, but acknowledged that the machines are not banned in Wisconsin. Hmmm. Legal in Wisconsin In 2004, California’s secretary of state banned the use of a particular brand of electronic voting machines because of security and reliability concerns and decertified others until steps could be taken to upgrade their security. Part of the concern was the touch-screen machines didn’t provide a paper trail at the time of voting. In Wisconsin, the vast majority of voting machines are optical readers. Voters fill out a paper ballot and feed it into the machine, which then electronically records the vote. A small percentage of votes in Wisconsin are cast on touch-screen machines -- but those in use here do generate a paper record for each ballot cast. All voting equipment in Wisconsin has been approved by the Wisconsin Election Commission (or one of its predecessors), Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin’s former elections director, told us. And in order to be approved, the equipment had to first pass national testing standards. Before 2006, the equipment was tested under the auspices of the National Association of Election Directors (NASED). Since 2006, testing has been done under the auspices of the U.S Elections Assistance Commission, a federal agency. There are no federal requirements that states must use certain machines, said Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. In other words, each state decides what’s legal. Our rating Stein said: ""Wisconsin uses voting machines that are outlawed, they are illegal."" California banned electronic, touch-screen machines. But the touch-screen machines that are used by a distinct minority of voters in Wisconsin are approved by the Wisconsin Election Commission. They’re legal. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, we rate Stein’s claim Pants on Fire.

Trump's Pants on Fire for claiming 'serious voter fraud' occurred in Virginia
","President-elect Donald Trump has peppered his Twitter account with a charge that the presidential election was marred by voter fraud in Virginia and two other states that he lost. ""Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn’t the media reporting on this? Serious bias,"" Trump said in a Nov. 27 tweet. It was the last in a series of 13 tweets in which Trump, without evidence, claimed ""millions of people"" across the nation voted illegally on Nov. 8, robbing him of a plurality of popular votes - even though he won the crucial majority of Electoral College votes. The latest returns show Democrat Hillary Clinton drew about 2.3 million more popular votes than Trump, a Republican. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National looked into Trump’s claim that millions voted illegally and rated it Pants on Fire. We investigated Trump’s claim about Virginia, to see whether ""serious voter fraud"" occurred in the state. Clinton won Virginia, garnering 1.98 million votes compared with Trump’s 1.77 million, according to tallies posted by the Virginia Department of Elections. In other words, she got about 210,000 more votes than Trump. We emailed Trump’s campaign and his transition team to learn the basis of his fraud claim but did not get a response. As news of Trump’s comments swirled, the Virginia Department of Elections issued a prepared statement from Commissioner Edgardo Cortes batting down the president-elect’s statement. ""The claims of voter fraud in Virginia during the November 8 election are unfounded,"" Cortes said. ""Virginia's election was well administered by our 133 professional local registrars, with help from hundreds of election officials and volunteers who worked to guarantee a good experience for eligible Virginia voters. The election was fair and all votes cast by eligible voters were accurately counted."" Martin Mash, a policy adviser for the Department of Elections, told us in an email that the department has not received any specific allegations of vote fraud during the Nov. 8 election. Vote-fraud allegations would be forwarded to law-enforcement officials, he said. Michael Kelly, a spokesman for Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring, said in an email that his office has not received any reports of illegal voting in this election. We contacted John Fredericks, who was chairman of Trump’s Virginia campaign. He said on Election Day that officials from from Trump’s campaign and the state GOP set up a call center in Richmond to take reports of voting irregularities. Although the center received hundreds of calls, nothing caused great concern, he said. Fredericks told us he is not aware of any ""massive voter fraud on Election Day"" beyond ""many isolated incidents"" of people voting without having proper identification who wanted provisional ballots. Fredericks added that flaws in the state’s election system allow avenues for illegitimate ballots and that there are ""real examples of real potential voter fraud or the groundwork for voting fraud being laid."" For example, Fredericks pointed to a well-publicized case from Harrisonburg where 18 to 20 people who died ended up on voter rolls. The FBI is probing that case of potential voter fraud. But it should be noted that that this irregularity was discovered in September - well in advance of Election Day. Another case being prosecuted in Alexandria involves what appears to be a relatively small number of fake voter registration applications, and it was also found before Election Day, the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted in an article this week. We also emailed the Republican Party of Virginia for its take on Trump’s ""serious voter fraud"" claim. GOP Chairman John Whitbeck said state Republicans are deferring to the incoming White House administration for a response to Trump’s claim. A final note: Our colleagues at PolitiFact New Hampshire and PolitiFact California also gave Pants on Fire ratings to Trump’s claim of serious voter fraud in those states. Our ruling Trump said there was ""serious voter fraud in Virginia"" during this presidential election. The top state election official in Virginia says the charge is ""unfounded."" The former chairman of Trump’s Virginia campaign says he’s unaware of any ""massive voter fraud on Election Day."" There’s a burden on Trump to prove his sensational claim, and the president-elect offers no evidence.

Ted Cruz says political arrests in Cuba have increased
","The son of a Cuban immigrant, Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said that he hoped President-elect Donald Trump could press for change for Cubans following Fidel Castro’s death. But in a Nov. 27 interview on ABC’s This Week, Cruz expressed some skepticism that anything will be better under Castro’s brother Raúl Castro, who began taking over in 2006. ""What the Obama administration has done is strengthen Raúl Castro. Raúl is the dictator now,"" Cruz said. ""You know, I asked my dad at dinner last night, what do you think happens now that Fidel is dead? And he shrugged and said Raúl has been in power for years. The system has gotten stronger. ... You know, in 2015 roughly 10,000 political arrests occurred in Cuba. That is five times as many as occurred in 2010, when there were only about 2,000."" We were interested in his statistic, so we contacted Cruz’s office. Spokesman Phil Novack told us the senator slightly misspoke, but his point is still basically accurate. Political arrests in Cuba Novack told PolitiFact Florida that Cruz meant to compare the number of political arrests in Cuba in 2010 to 2016 rather than 2015. Cruz’s primary source was the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. Based in Havana, the commission is the island’s oldest and most respected non-government, human-rights monitoring group, according to the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner. The commission reported 2,074 politically motivated detentions in 2010. That escalated to 8,600 in 2015 and then to 9,125 through October 2016. The commission predicts the number of political arrests ""will exceed the level of 10,000 detentions"" through the end of 2016. Experts on Cuba say the commission founded by Elizardo Sánchez has the most reliable source of data and sometimes use it in combination with other sources. That said, the data comes with caveats. ""It's very hard to work with exact numbers in Cuba,"" said Pedro Alcántara, spokesman for the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba, based in Miami. ""Not only are we fighting very strong repression, but sometimes the data changes every day."" The Cuban regime uses a revolving door for arresting political prisoners — most being held for hours or sometimes a couple of days and often facing violence while detained. In some cases, the prisoners are released without being charged. The commission has been able to report on short arrests, said Florida International University political science professor Eduardo Gamarra. ""However, the accuracy of his data is also arguable since there is no 'official' acknowledgment that political prisoners exist in Cuba,"" he said. ""Having said that, it is quite possible that the number of short-term arrests is higher or that it is quite lower.""   Some pro-regime groups criticize the list of the commission, alleging it contains multiple arrests of the same individuals within the same year. Carlos Ponce, director of Latin America programs at the watchdog group Freedom Press, said he doesn’t know if that is true or not since it is impossible to audit the list. The commission was founded by Elizardo Sánchez, a Cuban human rights campaigner. ""But at the same time, the list only covers the cases reported to Elizardo's group, so you can say that there are many cases unreported,"" he said. There is some dispute about how to define political prisoners, raising questions of overcounting. In 2010, for example, the Associated Press vetted a list of 167 political prisoners by the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. About 50 people on the list ""were convicted of terrorism, hijacking or other violent crimes, and four are former military or intelligence agents convicted of espionage or revealing state secrets,"" according to the AP. Why arrests have increased While settling on a precise figure of political arrests each year is a daunting task, experts agreed that in general the numbers have risen since 2010. Obama’s announcement in 2014 that the United States would reopen ties with Cuba did not lead to less political repression on the island. Sánchez, the creator of the commission’s list, told Miami Herald columnist Andrés Oppenheimer in July that that the civil and political rights situation had worsened over the past year.   ""In terms of (Cuba’s) domestic politics, the reestablishment of ties hasn’t had any positive impact,"" he said. More Cubans feel emboldened to express their discontent with the regime, even as the government sends more dissenters behind bars, said Marselha Gonçalves Margerin, advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International, a group that was last allowed into Cuba in 1989. Unless the criminal code is changed, which is unlikely to happen any time soon, the strengthened crackdown will continue, she said. ""We are seeing people going out on the streets that didn’t go before,"" she told PolitiFact Florida. Sebastian A. Arcos, associate director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, said there was a shift in the Castro regime from targeted, long-term, politically motivated imprisonment to more frequent and often violent short-term detentions lasting from hours to days. ""The obvious goal is to avoid the international condemnation that follows long-term political prisoners, and to prevent dissident public activities to escalate into larger demonstration,"" Arcos said. ""As they say, the revolution cannot afford to lose the streets."" Our ruling Cruz said, ""In 2015 roughly 10,000 political arrests occurred in Cuba. That is five times as many as occurred in 2010, when there were only about 2,000."" Cruz’s point about the rise of political arrests happening amid improved diplomacy with the United States is basically right. He would have been on more precise ground had he referred to 2016 and not 2015, as a spokesman said he intended to do. And while the source of his figures is widely considered to be reliable, experts said it is hard to track and label every arrest for political reasons. Because his point requires additional explanation but is largely accurate, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94293748-11b2-474a-82f0-7754db784836",/factchecks/2016/nov/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-political-arrests-cuba-have-increase/

Trump claims 'serious voter fraud' in New Hampshire
","Two weeks after winning the 2016 election, President-elect Donald Trump is back on the voter fraud attack -- claiming millions of people voted illegally, thereby robbing him of the popular vote. On Sunday night, Trump unleashed a barrage of tweets claiming - without evidence - that he would have won the nation’s popular vote ""if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."" By the latest tally, Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton won the country’s popular vote by more than 2 million votes, but lost the Electoral College contest that decides the election. Trump followed up with a second tweet alleging ""serious voter fraud"" in Virginia, California and New Hampshire, three states that voted for Clinton on Nov. 8. While our friends at PolitiFact national have examined whether millions of people voted illegally, here in New Hampshire we wanted to look into whether ""serious voter fraud"" existed in the state. Voter fraud in N.H.? To get right to the point, top election officials in the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s Office, New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office and U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Hampshire all said they have received no complaints of voter fraud in the most recent election. On Monday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller cited a national study done by the Pew Research Center showing that approximately 24 million voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or inaccurate. However, no one from Trump’s office has offered any evidence of ""serious voter fraud"" in New Hampshire. While New Hampshire is not without election day fraud, it has not happened on a widespread scale. In New Hampshire, the attorney general’s office has prosecuted two criminal fraud cases, one civil fraud case and investigated other complaints since 2012, Assistant Attorney General Brian Buonamano said. Buonamano told the Associated Press he has no evidence to back up Trump’s claims. Buonamano said his office is looking into fewer than five complaints that involve possible voter fraud since 2012 and none so far this election. (He didn’t provide an exact number.) About 729,000 people voted on Nov. 8 in New Hampshire, according to the Secretary of State’s office. Historically, instances of voter fraud-- even allegations -- have been scant in New Hampshire, according to Secretary of State Bill Gardner, the state’s top election officer. ""I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it,"" Gardner said earlier this month. State law requires voters to show a valid ID at the polls. If they don’t have one, their picture is taken and they have to sign an affidavit swearing they are who they say they are. After the election is over, the Secretary of State’s office will send out confirmation letters to those people to check their identities. ""If you’re someone who shouldn’t be voting, you’re probably not going to want your picture taken,"" Gardner said in an interview Monday. ""We’ve done a lot to protect the integrity of the election process."" Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Zuckerman said his office received no complaints of voter fraud in the most recent election. Zuckerman has served as the district elections officer in New Hampshire for the last 10 years. ""Local election officials, from what I can see, take their responsibility very seriously and undertake to run as transparent and trouble free elections as they can,"" Zuckerman said. ""We haven’t seen those incidents occur."" Eyes on the polls Because of speculation of voter fraud leading up to the election, both Republicans and Democrats employed volunteer poll watchers to monitor the voting process. One of those watchers was Chip Fagan, a Willis, Mass. resident who volunteered to observe the polls in the town of Bow for the New Hampshire Republican Party on election day. ""Everything here is pretty well organized,"" Fagan said on Nov. 8. ""They’ve got backup systems for backup systems. They’re really well organized, from the traffic direction to the set up. We want to make sure everyone has the chance to vote."" Nashua City Clerk Tricia Piecuch said she noticed nothing out of the ordinary on Election Day in the state’s second largest city, located on the border with Massachusetts. Though the lines were long, she said, things ran smoothly. ""We did not receive any reports of any issues,"" Piecuch said. ""The hype with this election is you always are prepared for the worst and hope for the best. We were prepared."" Piecuch said she had learned the news of Trump’s tweet on a thread with other local election officials in New Hampshire, who were talking about the president-elect’s latest allegation. ""They would like to see the proof,"" Piecuch said. New Hampshire receives so few election complaints that the Attorney General’s Office currently has one part-time attorney dedicated to them. But that doesn’t mean they’re all dealt with swiftly. The office recently asked for more money to fund an additional employee to help investigate a backlog of about 50 election-law complaint investigations that are still open. Some date back to 2012. Trump’s claim is similar to one made by Governor-elect Chris Sununu in the final weeks of the November election. He claimed New Hampshire Democrats were rigging elections by busing in Massachusetts residents to vote on election day. New Hampshire’s election officials said just three voter fraud cases have been prosecuted in the last four years, and Sununu could offer no evidence of Democrats busing out-of-state voters in on Election Day. Politifact NH rated that claim Pants on Fire. Our rating Trump claimed ""serious voter fraud"" existed in New Hampshire and two other states on election day, Nov. 8. Those in charge of overseeing New Hampshire’s elections and investigating election complaints said any instances of voter fraud in the state have historically been extremely rare. The most recent election was no exception, with no complaints of voter fraud filed in an election in which more than 728,000 ballots were cast. It’s a reckless claim with zero evidence.

Pants On Fire for Trump's claim about 'serious voter fraud' in California
","Grabbing the attention of the Golden State, President-Elect Donald Trump claimed in a recent tweet there was ""serious voter fraud"" in three states won by Hillary Clinton during the General Election, including California. Here’s his tweet:  Trump made this claim on Sunday during a flood of tweets about voter fraud. The president-elect also said he would have won the popular vote if not for ""the millions of people who voted illegally."" PolitiFact national examined that claim and rated it Pants on Fire. We decided to fact-check Trump’s eye-opening claim about ""serious voter fraud"" in California. Our research Trump offered no evidence about California voter fraud in his series of tweets. On Monday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller cited a national study done by the Pew Research Center showing that approximately 24 million voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or inaccurate. However, no one from Trump’s office has shown evidence of ""serious voter fraud"" in California. Trump may be drawing on an unsupported claim that 3 million ""illegal aliens"" cast votes in this year’s election. That allegation was made on Twitter by Gregg Phillips, who has worked for the Republican Party and has a voter fraud reporting app. PolitiFact reported that Phillips has not released any corroborating evidence and noted that public information undermines his statement. It rated his claim False. On Nov. 8 in California, there were reports of election glitches, such as the wrong names being placed on some absentee ballots and long lines at some polling places. But state and local election officials, along with independent observers, say there have been no reports of widespread voter fraud in the state. ""His allegations are completely unfounded,"" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in an interview. ""I think it’s a big disservice to our country and to our democracy to continue to raise these doubts. If anything, a message back to Mr. Trump is, if you have proof, if you have evidence, please bring it forward. Procedures are in place to investigate any real voter fraud. But as the evidence has shown, the cases of voter fraud across the country are statistically minimal if you go back decades."" Padilla’s office could not immediately say how many voter fraud complaints it’s received for this and past general elections. Hillary Clinton held a 3.9 million vote lead over Trump as of Nov. 28, a margin that’s grown substantially as California continues to count the state’s many absentee ballots. 'Broad brush allegations' Dean Logan, president of the California Association of Clerks and Election Officials and the top elections official in Los Angeles County, said in a statement responding to Trump’s tweets, that the state has ""a history of accurate and accountable elections."" Logan described Trump’s voter fraud claims as ""broad brush allegations."" Logan added in an email to PolitiFact California that: ""Quantifying complaints or allegations of voter fraud is not a specific data set that we track.  That alone probably gives you a sense of the frequency, but there is no indication that the rate of concern on this issue was higher in this election cycle than in any other."" He added that there are legal avenues for challenging a voter’s eligibility. But none were used before or after the election, he said. ""And I think that sort of goes to the point that there’s nothing to back up those allegations,"" Logan said. Sacramento County’s Assistant Registrar of Voters Alice Jarboe said of the more than 530,000 county voters that turned out on Election Day, none has made a complaint about voter fraud. Jarboe, who’s worked at the department for 18 years, said no complaints are ""the norm"" for elections in her county. ""I’ve never seen anything (related to voter fraud) that would affect the outcome of an election -- ever,"" she added. Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit voter advocacy group, said she’s not seen evidence of serious voter fraud. ""No system is perfect -- people do make mistakes,"" Alexander said. She added, however, that California’s voter verification laws are among the most robust in the country. Each county, she noted, is automatically required to perform a recount a fraction of its ballots by hand. The state also prohibits paperless electronic voting, a type of voting that makes audits nearly impossible, she said. Trump’s unsupported claim about voter fraud in California may also draw on misinformation about two recent state laws: AB 60, which allows undocumented immigrants to obtain state driver’s licenses; and the New Motor Voter Act, which by mid-2017 will automatically register citizens to vote when they obtain or renew a driver’s license. The automatic registration only applies to citizens who are already eligible to vote, not to undocumented immigrants. Padilla, California’s secretary of state, has said the new system would require potential voters to show identification such as a birth certificate or passport to reflect their citizenship before they are registered. California voters, in most cases, are not required to show identification at their polling places. Our ruling Donald Trump claimed ""serious voter fraud"" took place on Election Day in California. He offered no evidence backing up his statement and his press team did not respond specifically to a request about fraud in the state. Elections officials and nonpartisan observers in California said there were no widespread reports of voter fraud. The state has some of the most stringent voter verification laws in the country. Allegations of fraud are so rare that Los Angeles County, the state’s largest county, does not track them. PolitiFact New Hampshire examined Trump’s claim that the Granite State also experienced ""serious voter fraud."" It described Trump’s statement as ""reckless claim with zero evidence,"" and rated it Pants On Fire after finding  there were ""no complaints of voter fraud filed in an election in which more than 728,000 ballots were cast."" Trump’s claim about California voter fraud is equally reckless and without substantiation. We rate it Pants on Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Post comparing U.S. police training and fatal shootings with Nordic countries lacks context
","As protesters of police brutality call for police reforms that include defunding the police, some social media posts seek to compare U.S. training policies with those in other countries. One post features an image with pictures of three smiling law enforcement officers above a photo of a fourth officer aiming an assault rifle. It suggests the three happy uniformed officers are from Norway, Finland, and Iceland, while the one who is aiming a weapon is from the U.S. The image explains differences in the amount of police training each nation requires compared with the numbers of people killed by law enforcement in each place: ""Cops in Norway: require 3 years of training, 4 people killed since 2002. Cops in Finland: require 2 years of training, 7 people killed since 2000. Cops in Iceland: require 2 years of training, 1 person killed since ever. Cops in the U.S.: require 21 weeks of training, 8,000+ people killed since 2001."" This post was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s been around for at least a couple of years; Snopes checked this same claim and image in 2018. We looked at training and gun-related deaths and found that while the numbers for the Nordic countries are largely accurate, the numbers fall apart when we get to the U.S. statistics. And while the overall claim that the U.S. has less police training and more civilian deaths at the hands of police is accurate, this idea falls short in that it presumes a direct link between police training and fatal civilian encounters and does not take into consideration additional factors like each country’s gun culture. The U.S. has more gun violence than any other large, wealthy country and ranks the 28th-highest rate of gun violence in the world, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The U.S. also has the highest concentration of guns owned by civilians, with 120.5 guns for every 100 residents. The second highest rate of gun ownership is in Yemen with 52.8 guns for every 100 residents. Iceland and Finland are in the top ten gun-owning countries, with a little over 30 guns for every 100 residents.  Finland has the 11th highest rate of intentional homicides in Europe, which is considered average compared to other European countries but high for a Nordic country. However, in 2017, the U.S. homicide rate was four times the homicide rate in Finland. And, as of 2015, the U.S. gun-related homicide rate was more than four times Finland's. Iceland hasn’t had a gun-related civilian murder since 2007. And while Norway is known for having a high gun-owning rate, it has a low rate of gun violence compared to the rest of Europe. In a Washington Post article on police shootings, leading criminologist Geoffrey Alpert described how researchers struggle to pinpoint why the U.S. has had so many fatal police shootings.  ""We’ve looked at this data in so many ways, including whether race, geography, violent crime, gun ownership or police training can explain it,"" he said. ""But none of those factors alone can explain how consistent this number appears to be."" George Washington Law Professor Cynthia Lee in the 2018 University of Illinois Law Review wrote that ""only a multiplicity of reforms"" will reduce fatal police shootings and lead to ""lasting structural changes in policing.""  The claim that Norway requires three years of training and has had four people killed since 2002  is accurate. According to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which calls itself the world’s largest regional security organization, basic police training in Norway includes a three-year college education at the Norwegian Police University College. Trainees study at the college in their first and third years and spend their second year in on-the-ground training. The Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs releases annual reports on police encounters they have investigated and articles on policing trends. In 2014, the report included an article on police shootings. In all 15 police shootings the bureau had investigated ""16 persons have been injured… and, in two of these cases, the injuries resulted in death."" A European news network called The Local reported in 2016 that there had been a fatal police shooting in 2015 and another in 2016 that marked ""the fourth time that police in Norway have been involved in a fatal shooting since 2002.""  The Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs’ most recent report was from 2018 and it doesn’t list any fatal shootings. Searching recent news, we couldn’t find another story on fatal police shootings in Norway from 2019 or 2020. The claim that Finland requires two years of training and has seven people killed since 2000 is a bit off. The country’s police training program takes more than two years, and there is a little more information to be considered when calculating the number of deaths. Like Norway, Finland’s Police University College has a policing bachelors program. It requires students to complete 180 credit points, which usually takes three years to complete, not two like the post claims. Snopes reviewed and shared a list of 2000-18 police-related fatalities from the Finland National Police Board. Contacted by PolitIFact, Liisa Haapanen, the board’s senior communication adviser, verified the accuracy of the list and said that the numbers have not changed. The list details nine police-related fatalities, including a 2012 case in which a person died after an officer deployed a Taser; the report says it is unclear how electric shocks contributed to his death. The report also includes a 2010 incident in which a security guard was fatally shot after a police officer ""accidentally discharged"" their weapon. The post’s claim that Iceland requires two years of training and that one person has been killed is right. Iceland has very little violent crime. Iceland’s police university, the University of Akureyri, offers a bachelor's degree for police and law enforcement that has a two-year schedule. In 2013, Iceland’s first-ever fatal police shooting generated a lot of media coverage. The police department apologized to the victim’s family. The Reykjavík Police chief said the event would be thoroughly investigated and the police officers involved received grief counseling.  Ásgeir Sverrisson, The National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police, verified with PolitiFact that the 2013 shooting was the only fatal police shooting in Iceland’s history but that there have been instances in which citizens died in police custody or following police confrontations.  This Facebook’s most misleading claims come when it summarizes police training and officer-involved fatalities in the U.S. It says the U.S. requires 21 weeks of training and has experienced ""8,000+ people killed since 2001."" The best data suggest a number far higher than 8,000. Where the post has a point is that initial U.S. police training requirements are shorter than in these Nordic countries. U.S. police academies vary. A 2016 Bureau of Justice Statistics review found that from 2011 to 2013, most academy training lasts ""an average of about 840 hours, or 21 weeks.""  Nearly all police officers completed a mandatory field training after their basic training according to that 2013 report. About 37% of field training programs are organized by academies that require an average of 500 additional hours, or over 12 weeks, to complete field training. Based on these numbers, police officers have an average of 33 weeks of training. Based on that 2016 report, U.S. police officers are trained for almost eight months, and about three months of that training is in the field. The bigger problem in analyzing the post is that there are only estimates for the number of people killed by police.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics recorded arrest-related deaths from 2003-09. During that seven-year period, there were 4,813 reported deaths from ""law enforcement personnel attempting to arrest or restrain"" citizens. About 60% of those deaths, 2,931 of them, were ruled a homicide. There is no data in the report that indicates how many of these were gun-related. Though the FBI in 2019 launched the National Use-of-Force Data Collection effort, law enforcement agencies are not required to participate and the FBI has not yet released any findings. The Washington Post in 2015 started recording fatal shooting victims and found that police have shot and killed about 5,400 people in the five years since — roughly 1,000 people a year.  Fatal Encounters, a database created by a journalist, tracks deaths of people killed by law enforcement with crowd-sourced information and paid researchers, using public records and news reports. The database lists over 28,000 people who have been killed while interacting with law enforcement since 2000. About 20,300 were the result of firearms. A Facebook post compared the number of fatal gun-related police encounters and the length of police training in three Nordic countries and the U.S. ""Cops in Norway: require 3 years of training, 4 people killed since 2002. Cops in Finland: require 2 years of training, 7 people killed since 2000. Cops in Iceland: require 2 years of training, 1 person killed since ever. Cops in the U.S.: require 21 weeks of training, 8,000+ people killed since 2001."" The numbers in this claim were partly accurate. Finland’s police training takes longer than two years, and it had two more police-related deaths. The claims about U.S. policing were the most inaccurate. Police academies and departments usually require more than 21 weeks of training and estimates for fatal police shootings point to about 20,000 deaths in the past 20 years. What’s missing most from the post, however, is context. The rate of gun violence and gun ownership is higher in the U.S. than in these other countries. Research has also shown that fatal police shootings are the result of a combination of factors and are not limited to time spent in police training alone. Experts say there needs to be structural U.S. policing reform, not just more time spent intraining. We rate this claim Half True. Correction, June 22, 2020: Finland has a high homicide rate compared to most Nordic countries, but it does not have the highest homicide rate in Europe. Homicides in the U.S. are four times as high as in Finland's, according to 2017 data. An earlier version of this story was incorrect on these two points.",/factchecks/2020/jun/16/viral-image/post-comparing-us-police-training-and-fatal-shooti/

Fact-checking Rep. Tlaib’s claim on Detroit’s police, health spending
","Protests across the country against police brutality following the death of George Floyd have accelerated a national debate on police reform. Many have called for ""defunding"" police departments, and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., took to Twitter to explain the demand. ""When we say #DefundPolice, what we mean is people are dying and we need to invest in people’s livelihoods instead,"" Tlaib wrote on June 4. ""EXAMPLE: Detroit spent $294 million on police last year, and $9 million on health."" When we say #DefundPolice, what we mean is people are dying and we need to invest in people's livelihoods instead.EXAMPLE: Detroit spent $294 million on police last year, and $9 million on health.This is systemic oppression in numbers. pic.twitter.com/oPe0GD3D6p Tlaib’s claim reflects the Detroit Police Department and the Detroit Health Department’s spending from Detroit’s general fund, the city’s pot of money for general governmental operations during the 2019 fiscal year. The data she cites comes from the city’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for fiscal year 2019 which shows Detroit Police Department expenditures from the general fund totaled about $293.7 million and Health Department expenditures were about $9.3 million.  Jessica Byrd, communications manager for the city’s chief financial officer, says that the numbers from the annual financial report are slightly off, but essentially correct: $294.9 million for the Police Department and just under $9 million for the Health Department in the 2019 fiscal year. (Byrd says that the city is working to improve its financial reporting.) So the disparity in funding is a bit larger than Tlaib said.  However, the general-fund allocations to the two departments do not accurately reflect the total funding devoted to local law enforcement activities and health care programs that serve Detroit residents, since the city’s police and health departments are funded in very different ways.  Generally speaking, city governments are the primary funders of local law enforcement, while they fund a far smaller share of the cost of health care for residents. In the 2019 fiscal year, the Detroit Police Department budget totaled about $310.9 million, 97% of which came from the general fund. Only 31% of the Health Department’s $39.9 million budget, on the other hand, came from the general fund.  Byrd notes that most of the Health Department’s budget is funded from grants not reflected in the general fund budget and expenditures. During the 2019 fiscal year, the department spent $25.6 million from grants, Byrd said. ""The total amount of health-related benefits provided to Detroit residents is much larger than the city of Detroit's expenditures on health programs,"" says Joelle Abramowitz, a University of Michigan economist. Here's a chart showing five years of expenditures for the department, beyond the general fund:  The Detroit Health Department offers health services ranging from administering immunizations to operating a clinic for STD screenings. In the 2013 fiscal year, the city outsourced its health department as a cost-cutting measure during the bankruptcy, but in recent years contributions from the general fund to the department have grown substantially in an effort to rebuild the city agency.  In addition to services provided through the city’s Health Department, programs like the Healthy Michigan Plan — the state’s Medicaid plan funded jointly by the state and federal governments — provide health insurance to thousands of Detroit residents.  In surrounding Wayne County, 276,201 people received health coverage through the Healthy Michigan Plan, and Wayne County enrollees accounted for 28% of the state’s total number of enrollees. So Michigan’s $24.8 billion Department Health and Human Services budget offers significant support by providing health insurance for thousands of Detroit residents. Money from the county government also supports health programs for Detroit residents. Byrd notes that the majority of the Detroit Wayne County Mental Health Authority’s $800 million budget is spent in Detroit.  Given these additional sources of funding, Abramowitz said, ""Focusing only on the city of Detroit's health expenditures does not provide a full picture of public spending on health in Detroit."" In a statement, Tlaib acknowledged that ""Detroiters receive some additional state and federal support for health needs,"" but maintained that ""a city’s budget reflects its priorities."" Detroit’s Police Department is primarily funded through the city’s general fund, but the agency also receives some federal funding. It received a $1.85 million federal grant in 2017 through the U.S. Department of Justice. The federal agency’s contributions have declined over time, notes Alexander Weiss, a public-safety consultant who has conducted numerous assessments of police departments and made recommendations for reforms.  ""There is funding for equipment and sometimes funding for training, but these represent relatively small fractions of the budget,"" he says. Weiss argues that the department’s budget is a ""valid way to look at the city’s commitment to public safety."" The Detroit Police Department has seen an increase in its budget in recent years.  Still, the department has said it is having to do more with less. In 2015, it employed 2,260 officers, compared with 4,243 in 2002. Even accounting for Detroit’s shrinking population, the ratio of police officers to residents has generally declined over time. Today, Detroit has fewer uniformed police  than before its 2013-14 municipal bankruptcy.  Weiss says that a change in staffing levels ""may reflect a change in the work. It may reflect a change in the demographics of the city."" In recent years, the city has seen a proliferation of private security companies patrolling its streets in response to the departures of many officers after the bankruptcy.  Weiss said he welcomes the debate on defunding police departments, noting ""It doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. I think you can reduce the costs of policing through efficiency measures and divert some of those reduced costs to other service providers.""  Tlaib said, ""Detroit spent $294 million on police last year, and $9 million on health.""  The statement roughly reflects what Detroit’s Police and Health departments spent from the city’s general fund, but it does not represent what the departments spent in total in 2019 (about $316 million on police and about $35.8 million on health). The figure also does not fully reflect the significant contributions made by federal, state and county governments toward healthcare programs serving Detroiters.  Tlaib’s statement provides just one illustration of the gap in funding and looks exclusively at police and health department expenditures from the city's general fund, where the gap in spending is about $286 million.  But taking into accounting other funding sources, the disparity between police and health spending is still large, about $280.6 million.  We rate the statement is Mostly True.  Clara Hendrickson fact-checks Michigan issues and politics as a corps member with Report for America, an initiative of The GroundTruth Project.

No, a helicopter transporting U.S. soldiers was not recently shot down
","When a national tragedy happens, it’s not uncommon for social media users to post requests for thoughts and prayers. It’s puzzling, however, when there is no record of the recent tragedy.

(Officials said none involved in the raid died in the helicopter attack.) So it really happened, but not ""yesterday."" This request for prayers has been circulating for years. Back in September 2017, the fact-checking organization Snopes.com explained that a nearly identical social media post was based on an outdated event.

A history of hoaxes: Fake Craigslist ads that solicit minority actors for Trump rallies

Claim that N95 masks can’t stop COVID-19 particles due to size is nonsense
","As many states and communities ease restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the debate over mask usage has intensified. Businesses, churches and governments have implemented all manner of policies — some requiring masks, some leaving it up to each person, some even banning masks. That has spurred many armchair epidemiologists to weigh in, including a Facebook page with nearly 1 million followers. A June 4, 2020, post from Why don’t you try this? went a step beyond the homemade mask debate to claim that even the N95 masks used by healthcare workers are pointless in the face of COVID-19. ""COVID 19 virus particle size is 125 nanometers (0.125 microns); the range is 0.06 microns to .14 microns,"" the post said. ""The N95 mask filters down to 0.3 microns. So, N95 masks block few, if any, virions (virus particles)."" In other words, the post asserts the virus is smaller than the filter on the N95 mask, so the N95 mask doesn’t work. But that’s ridiculous. Experts say this claim flies in the face of numerous studies and reflects a failure to grasp fundamental principles of how viruses behave and how face masks work. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Here’s what we found. The science of mask functionality gets really small, really fast. The unit of measurement here is microns — 1/1000th of a millimeter. The size-based argument against N95 laid out in this claim assumes mask filtering works something like water flowing through a net — particles in the water smaller than the net opening pass through, while larger items don’t. But the physics involved don’t work like that at all. The COVID-19 particle is indeed around 0.1 microns in size, but it is always bonded to something larger. ""There is never a naked virus floating in the air or released by people,"" said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who specializes in airborne transmission of viruses. The virus attaches to water droplets or aerosols (i.e. really small droplets) that are generated by breathing, talking, coughing, etc. These consist of water, mucus protein and other biological material and are all larger than 1 micron. ""Breathing and talking generate particles around 1 micron in size, which will be collected by N95 respirator filters with very high efficiency,"" said Lisa Brosseau, a retired professor of environmental and occupational health sciences who spent her career researching respiratory protection. Health care precautions for COVID-19 are built around stopping the droplets, since ""there’s not a lot of evidence for aerosol spread of COVID-19,"" said Patrick Remington, a former CDC epidemiologist and director of the Preventive Medicine Residency Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But that’s not the only logical flaw in this claim. The N95 filter is indeed physically around the 0.3 micron size. But that doesn’t mean it can only stop particles larger than that. It works well for particles above that size, and actually snares particles below that size better than those at exactly the 0.3 level. ""N95 have the worst filtration efficiency for particles around 0.3,"" Marr said. ""If you’re smaller than that those are actually collected even better. It’s counterintuitive because masks do not work like sieving out larger particles. It’s not like pasta in a colander and small ones don’t get through."" N95 masks actually have that name because they are 95% efficient at stopping particles in their least efficient particle size range — in this case those around 0.3 microns. Why do they work better for smaller ones? There are a number of factors at play, but here are two main ones noted by experts: The first is something called ""Brownian motion,"" the name given to a physical phenomenon in which particles smaller than 0.3 microns move in an erratic, zig-zagging kind of motion. This motion greatly increases the chance they will be snared by the mask fibers. The second is the N95 mask itself uses electrostatic absorption, meaning particles are drawn to the fiber and trapped, instead of just passing through. ""Although these particles are smaller than the pores, they can be pulled over by the charged fibers and get stuck,"" said Professor Jiaxing Huang, a materials scientist at Northwestern University working to develop a new type of medical face mask. ""When the charges are dissipated during usage or storage, the capability of stopping virus-sized particles diminishes. This is the main reason of not recommending the reuse of N95 masks."" A Facebook post said the ""N95 masks block few, if any"" COVID-19 particles due to their size. This claim — attempting to disprove a fundamental piece of protective gear used by healthcare professionals around the world — is nonsense. The COVID-19 virus itself is indeed smaller than the N95 filter size, but the virus always travels attached to larger particles that are consistently snared by the filter. And even if the particles were smaller than the N95 filter size, the erratic motion of particles that size and the electrostatic attraction generated by the mask means they would be consistently caught as well. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2020/jun/15/facebook-posts/claim-n95-masks-cant-stop-covid-19-particles-due-s/

New York’s nursing home policy was not fully in line with CDC
","New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, facing criticism for how the state handled COVID-19 in nursing homes, has said his administration followed guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Approximately 6,000 nursing home residents in New York have died from the virus, and Cuomo was asked on May 20 about calls for a federal probe into how the state handled nursing homes, and in particular, a March advisory that sent COVID-19 patients from hospitals to nursing homes.  ""I’m not going to get into the political back and forth, but anyone who wants to ask, why did the state do that with COVID patients in nursing homes? It’s because the state followed President Trump’s CDC guidance,"" Cuomo said.  Is Cuomo correct? We looked at federal guidance at the time of the state's March 25 order, as well as other state Health Department actions at that time.  Before the state Health Department sent its controversial March 25 advisory, which has since been withdrawn, the CDC released guidance for nursing homes. The CDC cited two ""key factors"" to consider when deciding whether to discharge a patient with COVID-19 to a long-term care facility, said Kristen Nordlund, a CDC spokesperson. First, is the patient medically ready for discharge to a long-term care facility? And second, is the selected long-term care facility able to safely care for a patient recovering from the virus by implementing all recommended infection control procedures? These directives were in place on or before March 23, two days before the state issued its advisory.  One week before the state's advisory was released, the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Report looked at a facility in Washington State. The report’s authors recommended that ""in the context of rapidly escalating COVID-19 outbreaks in much of the United States, it is critical that long-term care facilities implement active measures to prevent introduction of COVID-19.""  The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal regulator of nursing homes known as CMS, also issued COVID-19 guidance.  The top administrator at CMS, Seema Verma, pushed back on Cuomo’s claim that the state followed federal guidance. She  cited a March 13 CMS document, which says that nursing homes should only accept those patients for which they can care.   The CMS memo also states: ""Per CDC, prompt detection, triage and isolation of potentially infectious residents are essential to prevent unnecessary exposures among residents, healthcare personnel, and visitors at the facility. Therefore, facilities should continue to be vigilant in identifying any possible infected individuals.""  It was a week after the Cuomo order, on April 2, that the CMS said new long-term care patients and residents ""should be screened for COVID-19 through testing, if available.""   CMS guidance also states that if possible, nursing homes should dedicate a unit or wing exclusively to residents returning from the hospital, where they can remain for 14 days without symptoms.   The state was clear about why it issued its March 25 advisory to nursing home administrators, directors of nursing and hospital discharge planners: There was an ""urgent need"" to free up space in hospitals for seriously ill coronavirus patients.  The advisory said all nursing homes ""must comply with the expedited receipt of residents returning from hospitals to"" nursing homes, and that hospitals must declare residents medically stable before they are sent back to the nursing homes.   The next directive, where ""NH"" is ""nursing home"" (emphasis by the Department of Health): ""No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission."" It also stated: ""As always, standard precautions must be maintained, and environmental cleaning made a priority, during this public health emergency."" In other communications in March, the state told nursing homes to isolate infected residents in their rooms or to consider grouping them in a dedicated unit, as well as to stay current with CDC guidelines in preventing the spread of the disease.  To support Cuomo’s claim, the administration pointed us to longstanding state and federal regulations that predate the pandemic, which require nursing homes to only accept patients for which they can care.  ""This is business in a nursing home: Take them if you can care for them,"" said state Department of Health spokesperson Gary Holmes.  Holmes also pointed us to the March 13 CMS memo, which states that when a resident who was diagnosed with COVID-19 is coming from a hospital, nursing homes ""can accept"" them, as long as the facility can follow CDC infection control measures.  The CMS memo also states: ""Nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present."" Nursing homes felt pressure to accept coronavirus patients following the March 25 order.   The AMDA-Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine issued a statement on March 26 opposing the order: ""We find the New York State Advisory to be over-reaching, not consistent with science, unenforceable, and beyond all, not in the least consistent with patient safety principles."" A joint statement by that organization and others in long-term care three days later reinforced their objections: ""a blanket order for every nursing home in the state to accept all admissions from hospitals is not sound policy.""   On April 9, the head of a Brooklyn nursing home asked state health officials if COVID-19 patients could be transfered to the Javits Center or the Navy hospital ship, and was denied permission, the Associated Press reported.   In late April, when reporters questioned Cuomo about the directive that nursing homes accept coronavirus patients, Cuomo repeatedly said that nursing homes should find other beds for these patients if they cannot care for them, or turn to the state to do so. He also said that the facilities ""don’t have the right to object"" to the state’s policy.   On April 23, State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said no nursing home had asked the state to take any patients it couldn’t handle. On April 29, after the state's policy had been under intense scrutiny, Zucker wrote a letter to nursing homes, telling them to alert the state if they have patients for which they cannot care.  In recent weeks, three facilities have asked the state for help, Holmes said.  The March 25 advisory has been removed from the state website, and the state’s directive to nursing homes is now much different. Cuomo issued an executive order on May 10, which states that hospitals ""shall not discharge a patient to a nursing home, unless the nursing home operator or administrator has first certified that it is able to properly care for such a patient."" The order also requires that a patient must be tested for COVID-19, and the test must be negative.  Though the state's actions have been criticized, it’s unclear what was the biggest source of infection in nursing homes, whether it was incoming residents, or health care workers and visitors unaware they had the virus.  The CDC's guidance at the time of the March 25 state order was that COVID-19 patients who are medically stable can be discharged from a hospital to a nursing home, but only if the nursing home can implement all recommended infection control procedures. CMS, a federal agency that regulates nursing homes, issued similar guidance, and also said that preferably, coronoavirus patients should be cared for in a dedicated unit.  Like CDC and CMS, the state Health Department said only those patients who are medically stable can be discharged, and also recommended that nursing homes consider dedicated units, if possible. The Health Department prohibited nursing homes from requiring a COVID-19 test before admitting a resident, while CMS said new residents should be tested, but did not require it.  The Cuomo administration points to state and federal regulations that predate the pandemic, which require facilities to accept only those patients they can care for. In addition, earlier state communications encouraged nursing homes to stay current with CDC guidance. But once the state issued its March 25 advisory, nursing home operators said that they felt they had no choice but to accept residents who were either known to be infected or suspected to be. That’s because the March 25 memo did not say anything about making sure that a nursing home can care for a patient before making an admission decision, and said they ""must comply with the expedited receipt of residents."" In the month following the memo, nursing homes pleaded for relief from the order.  We rate his statement Mostly False.   ",/factchecks/2020/jun/13/andrew-cuomo/new-yorks-nursing-home-policy-was-not-line-cdc/

Fact-checking claims about Robert E. Lee’s position on slavery, secession
","Presumably timed to coincide with President Donald Trump’s opposition of removing Confederate names from current military assets, social media users are sharing posts that claim the Confederate Army’s famous general, Robert E. Lee, opposed slavery. We previously fact-checked a post that used the same claim to question the removal of confederate statues and monuments. We rated it False.  Now, there’s another post about Lee’s position on slavery — and secession — on Facebook. It reads: ""Here’s the irony: Robert E. Lee was the most decorated soldier in the U.S. Army. He was a man of unimpeachable integrity. Lincoln offered him command of the Union Army, but Lee refused only because his loyalty was to Virginia. Lee opposed both secession and slavery. And yet to the historically illiterate left, a man who opposed both slavery and secession has come to symbolize both slavery and secession."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  It’s accurate that Lee was offered to command the Union Army and turned it down despite his desire for the country to remain intact, citing loyalty to his home state of Virginia. Lee made some mixed statements about his feelings toward slavery, particuarly nearing the end of the war, but his actions and political positions contradict the idea that he opposed it. ""Robert E. Lee did oppose secession. On that point, there is no dispute. Lee's attitudes toward slavery, however, are more complex than the statement that ‘he opposed slavery’ suggests,"" W. Fitzhugh Brundage, professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, told PolitiFact in an email.  ""What is clear is that Lee did not oppose slavery to the degree that he was willing to take any meaningful steps against the institution. Finally, during the Civil War Lee used his army in various ways to bolster and sustain the institution of slavery. So while Lee never endorsed slavery as a positive good (a la James Henry Hammond) he got no further than wringing his hands over the institution and lamenting its existence. After the Civil War he displayed clear hostility to black equality of any kind."" Lee personally enslaved people who he inherited after his mother died in 1829. Then, in 1857, following the death of his father-in-law, Lee assumed command of 189 enslaved people working between the two estates. Interestingly, Lee’s father-in-law specified in his will that all the family’s slaves be freed within five years of his death.  Sean Kane, the American Civil War Museum’s former interpretation and programs specialist, wrote in an article that Lee, as executor of the will, ""drove his new-found labor force hard to lift those estates from debt,"" and, concerned it would take longer than five years, ""petitioned state courts to extend his control of enslaved people."" That didn’t happen, as Lee freed them in accordance with the will in 1862 (and three days before the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect).  While his actions and slave-owning practices suggest he supported slavery, some of Lee’s writings offer a more muddled view.  Prior to the Civil War, on Dec. 27, 1856, Lee wrote to his wife: ""In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages.""  But he goes on to say that slavery was ""a greater evil to the white man than to the black race"" and ""while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former."" Lee wrote that African Americans were ""immeasurably better off"" in the U.S. than in Africa and that the ""painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race."" Eric Foner, a Civil War historian and Columbia University professor, referred us to a passage he wrote on Lee’s connection with slavery in the New York Times Book Review:  ""During his lifetime, Lee owned a small number of slaves. He considered himself a paternalistic master but could also impose severe punishments, especially on those who attempted to run away. Lee said almost nothing in public about the institution. His most extended comment, quoted by all biographers, came in a letter to his wife in 1856. Here he described slavery as an evil, but one that had more deleterious effects on whites than blacks. He felt that the ‘painful discipline’ to which they were subjected benefitted blacks by elevating them from barbarism to civilization and introducing them to Christianity. The end of slavery would come in God's good time, but this might take quite a while, since to God a thousand years was just a moment. Meanwhile, the greatest danger to the ‘liberty’ of white southerners was the ‘evil course’ pursued by the abolitionists, who stirred up sectional hatred. In 1860, Lee voted for John C. Breckenridge, the extreme proslavery candidate (a more moderate southerner, John Bell, carried Virginia that year)."" ""I would not say that this qualifies Lee as ‘against slavery,’"" Foner added in the email.  John Reeves, author of ""The Lost Indictment of Robert E. Lee"" wrote a post on some of the most popular myths attributed to the general — the first being Lee’s opposition to slavery. Reeves explains that after losing the war, Lee attempted to present himself as always being against slavery. In an interview after his surrender, Reeves says, Lee said that ""the best men of the South"" were eager to do away with it, and in a testimony in 1866 he had ""always been in favor of emancipation — gradual emancipation."" But Reeves writes that the historical record doesn’t support these statements, as Lee and his family owned and managed slaves for decades and benefited ""tremendously"" from the institution. A Facebook post says Robert E. Lee opposed both secession and slavery. It’s accurate that Lee publicly opposed secession and wished for the country to remain intact. However, citing loyalty to his home state of Virginia, he assumed the command of the Confederate Army, which fought in favor of secession and in the defense of slavery.  Lee made statements at the end of the war that he was eager to do away with the institution of slavery. But his actions as a slave owner and his political positions contradict the claim that he opposed it. We rate this Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2020/jun/12/facebook-posts/fact-checking-claims-about-robert-e-lees-position-/

Conservative pundits share false claim about Black Lives Matter, ActBlue
","Since protests over the death of George Floyd erupted in late May, donations to civil rights organizations have surged. But some conservative commentators say not all the money is going toward the cause. In a since-deleted June 11 Facebook post (archived here), Ryan Fournier, co-founder of Students for Trump, claimed that donations to Black Lives Matter were actually being funneled to Democratic campaigns. ""All money donated to Black Lives Matter goes directly to ActBlue, a Democrat Super PAC that then feeds the money to Democrat candidates,"" he said. ""Congratulations, you played yourself."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Fournier deleted the post after we reached out to him, but the Twitter version remained posted. (Screenshot from Facebook) Other conservative commentators, such as Candace Owens and the Hodgetwins, Instagram posts have made similar allegations. So we looked into them. The post is inaccurate. ActBlue is a platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns and other causes like Black Lives Matter. It passes along donations to organizations that use its fundraising platform — it doesn’t pocket the money itself.  We reached out to Fournier for the source of his claim and haven’t heard back. His assertion appears to stem from a video circulating on social media.  The video shows a screen recording of an Instagram story from a user in Miami. He attributed the information to a conservative Instagram account called ""Telerevela,"" which started posting in February and publishes conspiratorial posts about the coronavirus pandemic and protests over police brutality in Spanish. Telerevela posted an identical video, albeit in Spanish, on Facebook around 1 a.m. on June 11. The video, which has nearly 2 million views on Twitter, lays out a false trail for Black Lives Matter donations. In it, the user tries to donate to Black Lives Matter. When they tap the donate button on the movement’s website, they’re directed to a web address that has ActBlue in it. The donation page also has a disclosure about the nonprofit. (Screenshot from Twitter) Then, they open up a page from OpenSecrets.org — the website of the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics — to see how ActBlue spends its money. They highlight what appear to be several multi-million dollar contributions to Democratic presidential candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. ""And that my fellow Americans is how ‘white collar’ money laundering is done,"" reads some text at the end of the video. ""BLM is just another corrupt arm of the (Democratic National Committee)."" The video misrepresents what ActBlue does, as well as where donations to Black Lives Matter actually go. Black Lives Matter is using ActBlue’s fundraising platform to take donations. But ActBlue isn’t pocketing the money. ActBlue told us in an email that it passes along contributions from its fundraising platform directly to the 501(c)(3) charities or 501(c)(4) nonprofits that asked for them. Its function is similar to PayPal or Stripe, which are conduits for online purchases. OpenSecrets also clarified that point in a tweeted response to Candace Owens’ post, saying that ""a donation to BLM through ActBlue goes just to BLM, not any other group."" ActBlue is a fundraising platform used by Democrats & progressives. Like WinRed on the right, many candidates use it to process donations but that money isn't pooled to be shared across candidates or groups. A donation to BLM through ActBlue goes just to BLM, not any other group. https://t.co/rb5sF7VbwA OpenSecrets compared ActBlue with WinRed, a fundraising platform for Republican campaigns and causes that was launched in 2019 to compete with ActBlue. Both organizations facilitate fundraising for aligned political groups. Despite being classified as political action committees by the Federal Election Commission, ActBlue and WinRed have ""non-contribution accounts,"" meaning they have separate bank accounts that ""will not be used to make contributions, whether direct, in-kind or via coordinated communications, or coordinated expenditures, to federal candidates or committees,"" according to the FEC. Democratic and Republican presidential candidates are listed as ""top vendors/recipients"" on ActBlue and WinRed’s OpenSecrets pages not because the organizations have directly donated to them, but rather because the organizations act as ""middle men"" between the donors and the candidates. For example, if you were to go to Biden’s donation page, you would be redirected to a page on ActBlue’s fundraising platform to complete the transaction. Similarly, if you tried to donate to President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, you’d be redirected to a page from WinRed.  RELATED: ‘Defund the police’ movement: What do activists mean by that? As the Center for Public Integrity reported when WinRed was launched, the idea is to make it easier for political campaigns to fundraise small-dollar donations. ""Take the 2018 midterm elections, when Democratic House and Senate candidates outraised Republicans more than two to one in contributions from individuals,"" the center wrote. ""Republicans pointed to ActBlue, which helps donors more easily give money to Democratic candidates and liberal political groups, as a big reason why."" The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc., the organization that operates the Black Lives Matter website, is fiscally sponsored by the nonprofit Thousand Currents. That means Thousand Currents is handling Black Lives Matter’s finances as the organization seeks its own tax-exempt status. The Internal Revenue Service stipulates that 501(c)(3) organizations are ""absolutely prohibited"" from making contributions to political campaigns, which would apply to Thousand Currents. A popular claim on social media asserts that donations to Black Lives Matter go directly to ActBlue, which uses them to fund Democratic campaigns. It’s wrong. ActBlue is a nonprofit technology organization that provides a platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns and causes. Black Lives Matter and Democratic presidential candidates use the platform to fundraise. ActBlue does not pocket donations that are facilitated by its platform — it routes donations to organizations in a similar way to the Republican fundraising platform WinRed. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False. Correction, June 16, 2020: A previous version of this article stated that the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. is a nonprofit. In fact, it is in a fiscal sponsorship with a nonprofit. It is not yet its own 501(c)(3) organization. ",/factchecks/2020/jun/12/ryan-fournier/conservative-pundits-share-false-claim-about-black/

Masks for COVID-19 are effective, as a six-part Facebook takedown fails
","A Facebook user declared, ""I’m starting a public movement called TAKE IT OFF,"" in attempting a six-point takedown of facial coverings and how effective they are in fighting COVID-19. The post features an image labeled ""Face Mask Safety — Know The Facts Before You Wear One."" The image makes this six-part claim about masks: ""Decreases oxygen intake; increases toxin inhalation; shuts down immune system; increases virus risk; scientifically inaccurate; effectiveness not studied.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""Well, that all sounds like a lot of dangerous nonsense,"" Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist Ben Neuman told PolitiFact. As we’ve reported, facial coverings are not in themselves totally effective in fighting the coronavirus and there is a need for more study. But health officials largely agree that wearing any kind of face mask, coupled with social distancing and frequent hand-washing, is more protective than going unmasked.  While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t recommend masks for children under age 2 or for people who are unconscious or have breathing conditions, it generally recommends wearing masks in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. As the CDC puts it: ""Your cloth face covering may protect them. Their cloth face covering may protect you."" Here’s a rundown on why each part of the post is wrong. ""Breathing through a mask decreases the amount of oxygen we need to live & be healthy, increases blood acidity & makes breathing difficult."" A mask does not reduce oxygen intake nor does it make blood more acidic, virologist Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia University, told PolitiFact. Neuman said a mask ""will add some resistance to the breathing process, meaning it may feel like it takes a bit more work to take a breath, but it won't materially change the makeup of air that comes through the mask.""  ""Toxins that we normally exhale as we breathe become trapped in the mask and re-inhaled into the lungs, increasing symptoms.""  Repeated, long-term usage of the same unwashed mask could potentially lead to bacteria accumulating on the inside, which is why paper masks shouldn’t be reused and cloth masks should be laundered with soap between uses, Rasmussen said. ""However, there’s no reason to worry about ‘toxins,’’ she said. ""The only potentially toxic molecule that you routinely exhale is carbon dioxide, which is only toxic when it displaces oxygen,"" and it easily passes through the mask.  Neuman also said carbon dioxide would not be trapped by a mask. ""Decreases oxygen intake, increases carbon dioxide & toxin intake putting body under stress, releasing cortisol & shutting down immune processes."" Not true. ""There’s no decreased oxygen or increased carbon dioxide from normal breathing while wearing a mask, and no evidence that masks have any effect on the immune system or immune function,"" Rasmussen said. Inhaling high levels of carbon dioxide is dangerous, but this is very unlikely to happen from wearing a cloth face mask — especially if you’re only wearing it for short periods of time, according to the Cleveland Clinic.   There are studies that show that medical N95 respirators may result in increased carbon dioxide, which can lead to headaches and fatigue. This is one reason they're not recommended for home use,"" University of San Francisco research scientist Jeremy Howard told PolitiFact. ""Cloth masks, on the other hand, have excellent breathability and the same problems have not been demonstrated with them."" A USA Today fact-check said a similar claim, that masks weaken the immune system, was false. ""Encourages triggering & infection from dormant retro viruses already in the body, taking advantage of a weakened immune system due to mask wearing."" Masks can be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 because COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, according to the CDC. The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.  ""It’s absurd to think that masks would ‘trigger’ their activation and cause disease, especially since mask-wearing has no effect on immune system function,"" Rasmussen said. ""Virologists measure COVID-19 to be 80-140nm in size making the weave of material masks to be the equivalent of a chain-link fence to a mosquito."" (NM is a reference to the nanometer measure of diameter.) Rasmussen said virus particles are much smaller than the weave of masks, but infected people do not shed individual virus particles into the environment — they shed them in respiratory droplets. Masks prevent most, but not all, of these respiratory droplets from being dispersed into the environment. ""In addition, although we don’t know how many virus particles it takes to cause an infection, it’s almost certainly more than one. So you have to be exposed to enough respiratory droplets containing enough virus to establish an infection to actually become infected. Reducing droplet dispersal by wearing a mask greatly reduces this exposure risk, though it does not eliminate it completely,"" she said. Neuman said there is a growing number of research papers that demonstrate the effectiveness of surgical face masks in preventing transmission of a range of viruses, or demonstrate the effectiveness of face covering in limiting the novel coronavirus spread. ""Absolutely no peer-reviewed studies have been carried out of mask effectiveness within a social environment to control, prevent or eliminate the spread of disease."" Both papers cited by Neuman are published and peer reviewed. One was published in April by the journal Nature and the other on June 11 by the National Academy of Sciences. In terms of being ""within a social environment,"" 246 individuals provided exhaled breath samples in the first study, roughly half with masks and half without; the second study was a review of coronavirus mitigation efforts undertaken in Wuhan, China, Italy and New York City. Said Rasmussen: ""It’s true that to my knowledge masks have not been subjected to a large, randomized clinical trial, but a growing body of evidence does suggest that masks substantially reduce droplet spread."" A Facebook post claimed that wearing masks for the coronavirus ""decreases oxygen intake, increases toxin inhalation, shuts down immune system, increases virus risk, scientifically inaccurate, effectiveness not studied.""  There is no evidence to back any of the six parts of the claim.

Social media posts smear Buffalo protester shoved by police with unsubstantiated attacks
","Friends and acquaintances described the 75-year-old man whom police shoved to the ground in Buffalo, N.Y., as a peaceable activist. But baseless posts on social media accuse Martin Gugino of having a very different background.  One Facebook post claimed, without evidence, that Gugino is a lifelong criminal. ""This is the ‘kindly old man’ who was ‘pushed’ in Buffalo,"" the June 9 post said, alongside a photo that shows Gugino with a U.S. Park Police officer. ""Mr. Gugino had been previously arrested 300 times. 82 times for incitement. Riots is what he does for a living."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has since been removed. The photo in the post is real, said photographer Justin Norman, who confirmed to PolitiFact that he snapped it on Jan. 12, 2012, during a peaceful demonstration outside the White House.  But the caption is another story. Kelly V. Zarcone, Gugino’s attorney, said the post is ""just making things up."" ""The statements in that Facebook post are preposterous,"" added Vicki Ross, executive director of the Western New York Peace Center and a friend of Gugino’s.  Gugino has worked on causes around Buffalo and is involved in Catholic peace activism and nuclear disarmament, according to the Buffalo News. He remains hospitalized from the June 4 push that was captured on video and left him bleeding from his ear. We found no evidence he has been arrested anywhere close to 300 times. The record we could verify matches the one Gugino provides on his personal blog: four arrests and zero convictions. On his personal blog, Gugino says he’s been arrested four times: in 2009 in California’s Orange County, in 2012 and 2013 near the White House, and in 2016 outside the U.S. Capitol. We confirmed that each of those arrests took place through publicly available information.  Gugino was found not guilty of a misdemeanor charge for trespassing in 2009, for example, according to online case records from the superior court in Orange County, Calif. The photo in the Facebook post shows Gugino’s 2012 arrest. The caption on Flickr, an image hosting service, says Gugino was ""arrested for peacefully protesting against the Guantanamo detention center in front of the White House.""  The demonstration was organized by Witness Against Torture, a group that protests the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, and Gugino was arrested as part of a larger group for trespassing, said Norman, the photographer.  At the time, the group said that more than 30 activists wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits and holding signs were arrested after occupying a sidewalk in front of the White House for more than three hours. Gugino was arrested a third time in 2013 for demonstrating without a permit on a White House sidewalk, said Sgt. Eduardo Delgado, the public information officer for the U.S. Park Police. He was one of 19 protesters arrested for failure to obey lawful order under the district’s regulations. Delgado said the U.S. Park Police transitioned to a new database in 2013, so he could not find a record of Gugino’s 2012 arrest, which Norman’s photo shows was handled by the Park Police. Gugino’s fourth arrest came in 2016, during an afternoon protest on the rotunda steps of the U.S. Capitol, said Eva Malecki, public information officer for the U.S. Capitol Police. Gugino was one of 35 protesters arrested for unlawful demonstration, a misdemeanor. He was processed and released that same day. We found no public information to suggest Gugino has other arrests on his record. There could be records that were expunged or that we didn’t find, but 296 more would be a stretch. We searched Google, Nexis and the Internet Archive for news records of events involving Gugino. We checked PACER, which keeps case and docket information for federal courts.  We also queried online databases, contacted courts or called police departments for each of the places where Gugino has lived, according to Whitepages. That includes cities and counties in Ohio, Wisconsin, California and New York — including Buffalo, where he lives now. ""This is a Catholic worker,"" said Ross, the Western New York Peace Center’s director, who said she has known Gugino for 10 years and likely been with him hundreds of times at meetings, events and protests. ""These people could not be more self-sacrificing and nonviolent."" ""I personally have never seen him make unnecessary trouble,"" added Sage Green, the former program manager of PUSH Buffalo, an economic and environmental justice group. Social media users who encountered posts claiming Gugino had been arrested 300 times might have been suspicious, and rightfully so.  The Facebook post was uploaded without any supporting evidence, and it was removed shortly after we reached out to the poster for a response.  In a reply to other comments questioning the post’s veracity, the poster said they tried to find proof that the claims were accurate but hadn’t ""been able to back it up."" ""If it’s so fake, I’m just wondering why Facebook hasn’t fact-checked me yet,"" the user wrote. A Twitter user who spread the same claim also cited no supporting evidence, instead claiming he got his information from a confidential FBI information system for law enforcement agencies. The Twitter user offered no additional evidence when we contacted him but suggested we run Gugino’s name through the same system — a move we’re not legally authorized to do. He did not answer when we asked why hundreds of alleged arrests were not showing up elsewhere. The FBI declined to comment on the accuracy of the claims about Gugino. A Facebook post said, ""Gugino had been previously arrested 300 times. 82 times for incitement. Riots is what he does for a living."" We found no evidence that Gugino has been arrested more than the four times he mentions on his personal blog, let alone 300 times. Friends describe him as a peaceful protester. We rate this statement False. PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.",/factchecks/2020/jun/12/facebook-posts/social-media-posts-smear-buffalo-protester-shoved-/

League of Conservation Voters ad oversimplifies Trump’s position on PFAS clean up in Wisconsin
","For years, states across the country have waged a battle against the ""forever chemicals"" that have leached into water used for drinking.  The technical term is per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances -- or, in the political lexicon, PFAS. Federal lawmakers have been pushing for regulation of the chemicals, despite indications that President Donald Trump may veto a bill that would designate the chemicals as hazardous substances and regulate their cleanup. That became the target of a television ad, which began airing in mid-May 2020, from the League of Conservation Voters. The ad features Elizabeth Neary, a pediatrician and public health advocate, standing in front of a backdrop featuring trees and a body of water. The ad features news clippings from Wisconsin publications and maps of contamination sites, while she says, in part: ""Toxic chemicals that cause cancer are in the water right here. There are dozens of water danger zones like it that put Wisconsin at risk. The plans to clean it up were opposed by Donald Trump. … Donald Trump has real consequences for our health.""  So, does Trump oppose such cleanup plans? It’s more complicated than it seems. He could well block the current bill, but in December 2019 signed a bill that included legislation on PFAS.  Let’s dig in. ""Forever"" chemicals remain in the environment and the human body and don’t break down over time, hence their nickname, according to an April 27, 2020 article from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  There are more than 5,000 of the compounds, linked to cancer or other health issues, that collect in the human body, either through the consumption of food or water containing the chemicals.  PFAS are used for their water- and stain-resistant qualities, in products such as clothing and carpets, nonstick cookware, packaging and firefighting foams. Though PFAS are generally no longer in use, they remain in the environment, and cause contamination issues.  When we asked the League of Conservation Voters for comment, they provided citations for all of the claims in the video, including several sources that pointed to the evidence of the chemicals in the state.  One of the most notable PFAS sites in Wisconsin is near Marinette, where Johnson Controls/Tyco tests fire fighting foams. The company stopped testing the foams outdoors in 2017, and now has a system to ensure that the foam is not flushed into sewers or bodies of water after tests. PFAS have also been found in Madison and Milwaukee near airports where military units use fire fighting foam containing PFAS.  There is really no dispute PFASs are there and need attention. Thus, the focus of this fact-check is on the League’s claims about Trump’s position.  H.R. 535, also known as the PFAS Action Act, was proposed in January 2019, according to congress.gov and passed 247-159 by the U.S. House in January 2020. The yes votes were primarily Democrats, while the no votes were primarily Republicans.  There has been no action scheduled on the bill in the U.S. Senate, where it waits in committee. If the Republican-controlled Senate passed the bill, it would go to Trump. But the Trump administration has already signalled opposition to the bill. Indeed, in the ad, a news clipping is shown, referring specifically to the bill, and the administration’s response letter.  In a Jan. 7, 2020 statement of policy, the administration says the bill would create significant risk of lawsuits, set unreasonable timelines and precedents and impose hefty costs on federal, state and local governments.  The statement suggests that decisions regarding the regulation of PFAS be left to the Environmental Protection Agency:  ""The regulatory process works best when EPA and other agencies are free to devise regulations based on the best available science and careful consideration of all the relevant facts.""  So, Trump’s administration has stated opposition to this bill. But is it the only piece of PFAS-related legislation? No. In December 2019, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, which included action on PFAS.  The law requires companies where PFAS are manufactured or used to track and collect data on the chemicals and establishes some limits for them, in addition to requiring testing of drinking water wells, according to the EPA website.  The act also added some types of PFAS to the Toxic Release Inventory, which is a public database of toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities reported by companies. The act directs that PFAS contamination be addressed in both communities and near military bases, a common source of the chemicals, according to a March 20 Bloomberg Law analysis.  In an ad that aired in Wisconsin, the League of Conservation Voters claimed Trump has opposed plans to clean up ""toxic chemicals that cause cancer (that) are in the water …. (and) put Wisconsin at risk."" Trump’s administration is opposed to the pending PFAS Action Act, and the ad made clear that is the measure it was referring to. That said, he has signed another measure that addresses the chemicals. Indeed, some parts of the proposed law overlap with what was signed. We rate the claim Half True.

Fact-checking coronavirus infection rates in western New York
","As New York state began implementing a regional approach to reopening after coronavirus-related shutdowns, a lawmaker from western New York complained that many of his constituents faced a longer wait to reopen because they were geographically linked to more hard-hit counties.  State Sen. George Borrello, who made the comments in a statement on May 11, represents New York’s 57th district, which includes three less-populated counties — Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua — south of more heavily populated regions near Buffalo (Erie County) and Niagara Falls (Niagara County). ""While infection rates in Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our linkage with Erie County and its higher infection rates means that we don’t meet the metrics for reopening, and our hurting, rural economies must remain shut down for at least another two weeks,"" Borrello said in the statement. The state’s reopening plan allowed regions to begin Phase 1 of the reopening process on May 15 as long as they met seven metrics established by the state. The Western New York Region subsequently met all seven metrics on May 18 and entered Phase 1 the following day. But we wondered whether Borrello was correct in his May 11 statement that the infection rates in the three rural counties was substantially lower than those of the more urbanized counties to the north, and consistently among the state's lowest. We used the county-by-county infection tallies posted on Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s pressroom page and converted them to a rate per 10,000 residents. We ranked the counties from the highest to the lowest for each week from March 30 to mid-May, when Borrello made his statement. We found that, as Borrello had said, Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties ranked low in infection rates consistently over that period, while Erie and Niagara started higher and continued to rise: Our analysis found that Chautauqua never ranked higher than sixth from the bottom for infection rates among the 58 New York counties for which data was available, and Chautauqua had the lowest rate of any county for much of the period. Allegany and Cattaraugus ranked marginally higher than Chautauqua, but well below Erie and Niagara.  Overall, the three small counties usually ranked in the bottom one-third of counties in the state, and by the time Borrello made his statement, they were all in the bottom one-fifth of counties. By contrast, Erie and Niagara were consistently in the top half of counties as measured by infections per capita. New York City (including all five boroughs) ranked at or near the top for the entire period. The state reopening plan mirrored what many other states are doing, with certain types of non-essential businesses opening in phases in each of 10 regions, as long as certain health measurements are met in the region. Borrello said in an interview that he just wants sensible reopening policies that are implemented ""fairly and equitably."" ""Even though the infection rates are higher in Erie County than the rest of the region, we’re still talking about keeping those same precautions and ensuring that they’re being adhered to,"" he said. Borrello said that ""infection rates in Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state."" A look at the data from the end of March to mid-May confirms that the infection rate in each of the three counties was usually in the bottom one-third of counties in the state, and by the time Borello made his statement, they were all in the bottom one-fifth of counties. By contrast, Erie and Niagara were consistently in the top half of counties as measured by infections per capita.

No, Nancy Pelosi doesn't demand to fly on a 200-seat Boeing 757 jet with taxpayer money
","A claim that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi uses an expensive Boeing 757 jet to shuttle her between California and Washington, D.C., each week has been circulating for more than a decade. But it’s no more true today than it was in 2008, when FactCheck.org first vetted it. A March 25 Facebook post shared thousands of times claims that Pelosi, D-Calif., insists on flying in a 220-seat Boeing 757 to her home state, costing taxpayers nearly $5.8 million annually.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post states that Pelosi ordered the Boeing 757 jet because the smaller Air Force C-20B jet that’s normally made available to the House speaker could not make it across the country without stopping to refuel.  Did the speaker order this? And are taxpayers really paying almost $5.8 million annually for her to travel to and from work? The answer is no. A spokesperson for Pelosi told PolitiFact, ""Speaker Pelosi travels by commercial air. This is false.""  Pelosi did have acess to a 12-seat Gulfstream V during her first stint as speaker, spokesperson Drew Hammill said, from 2007 to 2011, due to security precautions set in place following the Sept. 11 terror attacks. After that, however, she began routinely flying commercial flights. She became speaker again in January 2019. The speaker has been spotted flying on commercial airlines recently. In July 2019, CNN’s senior Washington correspondent, Jeff Zeleny, tweeted a photo of Pelosi sitting in coach on a Delta plane in Detroit.  Speaker Pelosi was negotiating the fine print of this budget deal from her aisle seat of a delayed Delta flight from Detroit. She’s had the phone pressed to her ear for much of the last three hours. For those wondering, she’s in coach. https://t.co/0W7xyy71qE pic.twitter.com/gYWs1gwtss This isn’t the first time this particular rumor was spread about Pelosi’s flying habits.  When FactCheck.org reported on this claim in 2008, it found that the rumor dates back to 2007, when Pelosi first became speaker. Bill Livingood, then the House sergeant-at-arms, asked the Air Force and the Defense Department for a plane that could transport Pelosi across the country without stopping to refuel. The House sergeant-at-arms is the chamber’s top law enforcement and security official. Pelosi’s predecessor, Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., had access to an Air Force C-20B, a small 12-seater that he used to travel to his home district, as well as a larger plane — a C-32, a military version of a Boeing 757 — that was made available to him following 9/11. But FactCheck.org found that while Livingood inquired about a plane that could fly across the country without stopping, Pelosi herself didn’t request this larger jet — nor did she use it, Hammill said. In 2010, FactCheck.org and PolitiFact also debunked claims of Pelosi raking up a $100,000 bar tab on her plane rides. A viral post on Facebook claims that Nancy Pelosi ordered a 200-seat Boeing 757 jet to fly from Washington, D.C., to San Francisco, costing taxpayers $5.8 million annually.  Pelosi did not request such a plane. And the post leaves out important context that would explain why the U.S. government provided a larger plane for the speaker of the House. It also ignores the fact that Pelosi flies on commercial airlines.  We rate this statement False.  Correction (July 1, 2020): Pelosi had access to a 12-seat Gulfstream V aircraft during her first term as speaker. An earlier version of this story incorrectly suggested she had access to and occassionally flew on a larger plane. This story has been updated to reflect that change. The ruling stands.",/factchecks/2020/jun/12/facebook-posts/no-nancy-pelosi-does-not-fly-200-seat-boeing-757-j/

NFL is not planning to fly a Black Lives Matter flag at games
","On the same day that NASCAR announced it was banning the Confederate flag from its races, Facebook users started to share rumors about another race-related change at sporting events. A June 10 text post claims that the NFL is planning to fly a ""‘Black Lives Matter’ flag under the American flag at games.""  ""Your thoughts?"" asks the post, which was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The rumor was published as tens of thousands of Americans across the country peacefully protest against police brutality and discrimination against black Americans. The protests began after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. (Screenshot from Facebook) We reached out to the original poster for their evidence, but they didn’t supply any. Instead, they deleted the post. (We found several similar posts from conservative Facebook pages.) While NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a recent statement that ""black lives matter,"" there is no evidence that the league is planning to fly a flag associated with the movement at football games. On June 5, the NFL released a video of Goodell talking about ""racism and the systematic oppression of Black People."" ""We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier, and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,"" he said. ""We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter. I personally protest with you and want to be part of the much-needed change in this country."" We, the NFL, condemn racism and the systematic oppression of Black People. We, the NFL, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest. We, the NFL, believe Black Lives Matter. #InspireChange pic.twitter.com/ENWQP8A0sv The video was a nod to Colin Kaepernick, a civil rights activist and former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, though Goodell did not mention him by name. Kaepernick, who led the 49ers to the Super Bowl in 2013, returned to the spotlight during the 2016 season for choosing to sit or kneel during the pregame national anthem in protest of police brutality and discrimination against black Americans — a move that the NFL did not endorse.  Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since that season. His 2017 grievance against the league, alleging that NFL teams colluded to keep him off their rosters, was settled in 2019. Nowhere in Goodell’s statement did he say that the NFL would fly a Black Lives Matter flag at football games. We could find no such promise on the league’s Twitter page, its website or reported in the media. We reached out to the NFL for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. The Facebook post is inaccurate.

Congressional candidate stretches Cuomo’s remarks on education
","Beth Parlato, a Republican candidate for Congress in New York’s 27th District, recently took a shot at Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Twitter. In a May 7 tweet, Parlato shared a video she had made as part of her ""Table Talk"" series. In it, she spotlighted comments Cuomo had made about education during a May 5 press conference.  According to Parlato, Cuomo ""said gone are the days when we have one classroom with a teacher in the front. With all the technology we have, we don't need actual classrooms. He said we have the internet to teach our kids.""  Table Talk: Have you heard @NYGovCuomo on NYS Education?! pic.twitter.com/fmvMNaXuoK Parlato, a lawyer and former judge, is running in the Republican primary for a seat in the suburbs of Buffalo and Rochester that was vacated in 2019 by Republican Chris Collins. Did Cuomo say what Parlato said he did? He said something close. But Parlato exaggerated some of his comments, and Cuomo later amended them. During Cuomo’s May 5 daily press briefing, he addressed the effect the coronavirus pandemic was having on traditional education methods.  ""The old model of everybody goes and sits in the classroom and the teacher is in front of that classroom and teaches that class and you do that all across the city, all across the state, all these buildings, all these physical classrooms — why, with all the technology you have?"" Cuomo said the internet has changed education and that traditional teaching practices may need to be reevaluated, especially considering how unprepared many districts were for online learning.  Cuomo spoke about working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to ""reimagine"" education in New York state given the need for online learning during the pandemic. (Parlato also mentioned this in her video.) And on May 6, Cuomo asked Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt, to help lead a new commission to redesign the state’s educational systems. So Parlato had a point that Cuomo was envisioning a future in which brick-and-mortar classrooms were less important. But she exaggerated somewhat. Cuomo didn’t explicitly say he wanted to rule out traditional learning tactics or that ""we don’t need actual classrooms.""  In fact, Cuomo talked about reopening schools in New York state once the pandemic has subsided enough to ensure safety.  ""It’s not about just reopening schools,"" Cuomo said in the May 5 press conference. ""When we are reopening schools, let’s open a better school and let’s open a smarter education system.""  Cuomo’s May 5 comments sparked a backlash from teachers, students and parents, with many interpreting Cuomo’s message in the same way Parlato did. And in the weeks after Parlato sent her tweet, Cuomo backed off his comments. ""‘Reimagine education’ means let's go through, let's look at what happened,"" Cuomo said on May 20. ""What can we learn that’s positive? I would agree with the teachers who say, ‘There is no substitute for classroom teaching.’ There is no substitute."" Instead, he said, ""what happened to us here was you couldn’t do the classroom experience, because of the coronavirus, etc., so you have to go to remote learning. I don’t believe every school district was ready for this abrupt shift to remote learning. And how could they be? Nobody was ready for this abrupt shift of this coronavirus."" Cuomo’s office confirmed statements made at his May 5 and May 20 press conferences and didn’t comment further on Parlato’s video. Parlato said Cuomo had said that ""with all the technology we have, we don't need actual classrooms."" That’s close to what Cuomo said during his May 5 press conference, although Parlato left the impression that Cuomo was opposing reopening brick-and-mortar schools once the coronavirus pandemic is over, which is incorrect.  Cuomo later walked back his comment amid a backlash from teachers, students and parents. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/jun/12/beth-parlato/congressional-candidate-stretches-cuomos-remarks-e/
