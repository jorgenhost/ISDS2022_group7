Is a police officer assaulted every 10 minutes in the United States, as Donald Trump said?
","President Donald Trump lamented the number of assaults on police officers at a ceremony honoring fallen officers on Capitol Hill. ""In 2016, an officer was assaulted in America on an average of every 10 minutes, can you believe that?"" Trump said on May 15, 2018. ""It's outrageous, and it’s unacceptable. We must end the attacks on our police, and we must end them right now. We believe criminals who kill our police should get the death penalty. Bring it forth."" Is that true? Trump’s numbers are based on data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But factoring in the growing population of Americans and police shows the rate isn’t as constant as Trump made it sound. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! The FBI reported that 57,180 officers were victims of line-of-duty assaults in 2016. With 525,600 minutes in a year, that breaks down to an assault every 9.19 minutes. Adjusting for the 10 percent of agencies that didn’t report any data, that’s an officer assaulted every 10.3 minutes. Some of the actions that legally count as an assault may not have resulted in pain inflicted on the officer, such as a drunk person shoving an officer. A shove carries the same weight as a stabbing by this measure. Of the 57,180 officers who were victims of assault, 28.9 percent (or 16,535 officers) sustained injuries. About three-quarters of the assaults did not involve a weapon other than hands, fists, or feet. Firearms were used in 4.2 percent of incidents and knives in 1.9 percent, according to the FBI. The rate of police deaths is much lower. In 2016, 52 law enforcement officers died in accidents and 66 were deliberately killed, according to the FBI. Those numbers have been decreasing over the past few decades. Trump called out one kind of assault in particular during his speech: ""One of the most alarming crimes taking place against our police are ambush attacks. Think of that! Ambush attacks!"" But ambush attacks are rare, according to Safiya Jafari Simmons, communications director at the Center for Policing Equity. Ambush attacks were responsible for 270 of the 57,180 officer assaults. Most assaults resulted from officers intervening in disturbances, effectuating arrests, or transporting prisoners. Trump’s use of the rate of assaults per minute, known as the crime clock, isn’t a sound practice, said James Fox, Lipman Family Professor of Criminology, Law, and Public Policy at Northeastern University. The statistic divides the number of minutes, not police officers, by attacks. But as the general and police populations grow, the clock still has the same number of minutes. Also, Trump’s statistic isn’t an average of different regions but an aggregate of national assaults. The frequency of assault, then, would change depending on the area. A single city has fewer total police assaults than the country, but the clock has the same number of minutes; the frequency would be lower even in the cities with most assaults. Dividing assaults by total police officers is more telling, Fox said. By that measure, on average, an officer has a 9.8 percent chance of being assaulted per year. Trump said a police officer is assaulted every 10 minutes in 2016. That math works out if you divide the number of minutes in a year by the FBI’s count of line-of-duty assaults. There are a few points to remember about this particular statistic. This count doesn’t just isolate incidents where a wound was inflicted, such as a shooting and stabbing, so incidents such as shoving and kicking are also considered an assault. Also, a criminologist warned that the ""crime clock"" method does not really tell you that much, because it does not factor in the growing U.S. and police populations. Trump's statement is accurate but requires additional context. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/may/15/donald-trump/police-officer-assaulted-every-10-minutes/

Patrick Morrisey cherry-picks Joe Manchin's votes on Trump Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch
","Fresh off a primary victory in West Virginia’s U.S. Senate contest, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey took a shot at his opponent in the general election in a radio interview with Breitbart, saying Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin too often stands against President Donald Trump. Referring to Trump’s appointee to the Supreme Court, Morrisey said, ""If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge (Neil) Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote"" in the Senate. Morrisey went on to say, ""Whether we're talking judicial picks, whether we're talking Trump tax cuts, whether we're talking unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare ... Joe Manchin has not stood with President Trump."" Manchin’s support for Trump (or lack thereof) is likely to be a major campaign wedge for Morrisey, since Trump is more popular in West Virginia than any other state, according to state-by-state approval ratings released by Gallup in January 2018. Morrisey is right that Manchin voted against the tax bill supported by Trump and most Republicans. But he isn’t really right about Manchin’s position on Gorsuch. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! Here, we’ll look at Manchin’s actions on the Gorsuch nominations; we looked at his positions on Obamacare in a separate fact-check. Bottom line: When it counted, Manchin voted with Republicans to advance Gorsuch’s nomination. Morrisey’s camp pointed to three votes on April 6, 2017, during the back-and-forth over Gorsuch when Manchin voted with most Democrats. In two cases, Manchin voted in favor of efforts by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to adjourn before voting on the Gorsuch nomination or to postpone it. (Both failed along party lines.) In the third vote, Manchin voted not to invoke the ""nuclear option,"" which is a procedural move to lower the number of votes required to advance to a final vote from 60 to a simple majority. In this case, too, Manchin voted with all Democrats and against all Republicans. However, citing only these three votes paints a misleading picture of Manchin’s actions. In the most important votes for securing Gorsuch a floor vote, Manchin sided with Gorsuch and Republicans — and he’d telegraphed it. Before the final showdown began, Manchin on March 27, 2017, became the first Democratic senator to publicly break with others in his party and say he’d side with Republicans by committing to vote in favor of proceeding to Gorsuch’s nomination. By announcing his intention to support a vote for Gorsuch a full 10 days before the final action, he sent a signal to other Democrats who still might have been deciding on what to do. And Manchin stuck to his word: On April 6, Manchin was one of only four Democrats to vote to invoke cloture and proceed to a final vote on Gorsuch’s nomination. After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., successfully invoked the ""nuclear option,"" the Senate once again voted on cloture, this time needing only a simple majority. Once again, Manchin voted to proceed to Gorsuch’s nomination on April 6, this time becoming one of only three Democrats to side with every Republican on the vote. Finally, on the actual vote on Gorsuch’s nomination on April 7, Manchin voted in favor, once again making him one of just three Democrats to back Gorsuch in the final vote. Senate specialist Gregory Koger of the University of Miami said Manchin has the better argument than Morrisey in this case. ""Ordinarily I would place real weight on procedural votes, such as adjournment and on the nuclear option precedent,"" he said, ""but I think there were extenuating circumstances, at least on the precedent vote, and the early public support for Gorsuch more than compensates for these procedural votes."" Morrisey said, ""If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote."" Manchin did side with Democrats on certain procedural votes during the showdown over Gorsuch. But he broadcast his support for a vote on Gorsuch early enough to persuade fence-sitters, and on the main votes, he broke ranks with his party, siding with Republicans to secure Gorsuch a vote and ultimately confirm him to the court.

Patrick Morrisey says Joe Manchin won't budge on Obamacare, ignoring bipartisan efforts
","As the general election for the seat held by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., heated up, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey took a shot in a radio interview with Breitbart, saying Manchin too often stands against President Donald Trump, who remains popular in the state. Referring to Trump’s appointee to the Supreme Court, Morrisey said, ""If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge (Neil) Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote"" in the Senate. Morrisey went on to say, ""Whether we're talking judicial picks, whether we're talking Trump tax cuts, whether we're talking unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare ... Joe Manchin has not stood with President Trump."" Morrisey is right that Manchin voted against the tax bill supported by Trump and most Republicans. But he isn’t really right about Manchin’s positions on Gorsuch and modifying Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. We’ll look at the Obamacare assertion here; we separately fact-checked the part about Gorsuch in another item. Bottom line: Despite voting against the major Obamacare overhaul that most Republicans supported, Manchin has been open to making incremental changes to the law. Manchin voted against the major Obamacare overhauls that most Republicans supported in 2017. When the Senate took up three varieties of bills to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Manchin voted against all three bills, siding with all other Democrats. All three failed, due to Republican defections. However, it is wrong to say that Manchin was unwilling to ""change"" the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, Manchin told West Virginia’s MetroNews radio that he had told Republican leaders that he's ""happy to sit down with you to see if we can find a pathway forward"" on Obamacare, Politico reported. Six months later, Manchin repeated that sentiment, telling MetroNews’ Talkline that he was still willing to work toward fixes for Obamacare, even as he objected to the Republican plan for a thorough overhaul. ""If they want to say, ‘Okay, Joe, we can’t pass this thing. Will you sit down and work with us?’ I’m there tonight with them and I’ll get six or seven or eight other very like-minded Democrats,"" Manchin said. Manchin then organized a bipartisan health care policy meeting. Perhaps most important, Manchin was one of 24 original supporters — 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans — of a bill written by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., that was touted as a way to fix rather than scuttle Obamacare. The measure would have granted flexibility for states to allow a wider variety of insurance policies while temporarily continuing certain Obamacare payments that were at risk under a repeal. (It remains pending.) Manchin also expressed public support for efforts by Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., to modify Obamacare short of repeal, which crystallized as S. 1835, which would allow states to apply for funding for a reinsurance program or high-risk pool program. The Morrisey camp pointed to several votes, including a number of Republican attempts to either repeal Obamacare entirely or make sweeping changes to it. But Morrisey’s use of the word ""change"" suggests something more measured than those bills offered, so we won’t consider them as evidence of Morrisey’s claim. Of the other votes Morrisey’s campaign cited, three concerned one narrow provision of the law: the ""Cadillac"" tax on high-cost health care plans. This provision has been controversial ever since the passage of the law, and the effective date has regularly been pushed back by Congress. Manchin declined to push back the effective date on at least three occasions, sometimes alongside Republicans. On one such vote in December 2015, Manchin was joined by six other Democrats and three Republicans. On another vote that same month, Manchin was joined by 26 Republicans and six other Democrats or Democratic-aligned Independents. The third vote, in July 2017, was largely along party lines. Morrisey’s campaign mentioned other Obamacare-related votes on taxes, including a 2013 amendment to repeal Obamacare tax increases that hit ""middle-income Americans."" These included the tax penalty for not purchasing health insurance, the ""Cadillac"" tax, expense deductions and penalties for withdrawing funds from health savings accounts. This amendment failed on a party-line vote. These comprise the strongest piece of evidence for Morrisey’s position, but they mostly involve relatively narrow tax provisions affecting how the law is funded. It’s worth noting that Manchin has also pursued his own efforts to tweak the bill narrowly, such as exempting volunteer first responders from the tax for not having health insurance; to delay the individual mandate penalty; and to redefine who counts as a full-time employee under the law. Morrisey said Manchin displayed an ""unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare."" Manchin did oppose the various Republican-led repeal efforts, but he has worked actively to promote incremental changes to Obamacare — not only rhetorically but also by backing bipartisan bills intended as efforts to modify Obamacare without scuttling it.

Headline exaggerates appointment of undocumented immigrant in California
","A headline exaggerates about a state appointment of an undocumented immigrant in California.

Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. While the story itself has some accurate information, the headline is misleading. An undocumented immigrant, Lizbeth Mateo, did receive an official appointment by the state of California. But the headline creates a misleading impression by omitting key information about the nature of her post. She is serving in an unpaid position on a 12-member advisory committee, and she wasn’t the first undocumented immigrant to get such an appointment. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! Mateo, a 33-year-old Los Angeles attorney, is a well-known immigrant activist. In 2013, she participated in a group called the Dream 9, comprised of undocumented immigrants from Mexico who were raised in the United States. The group left for Mexico and then tried to re-enter the United States by seeking asylum as a protest. Mateo was held at a detention center in Arizona before she was released. We found no contact information on the website of The Breaking Dawn, a site that is supportive of President Donald Trump and includes several stories raising alarm about ""illegal aliens."" In March, the California Senate Rules Committee appointed Mateo to the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, known as Cal SOAP. The committee advises the California Student Aid Commission on efforts to increase college access for poor students. Mateo didn’t respond to an email and message from PolitiFact, but she told the media in a March statement that ""while undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made."" Appointees serve at the pleasure of the Senate Rules Committee, so she will serve until she is replaced or steps down, said Dan Reeves, chief of staff to Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León. Mateo was appointed one day after Trump visited California and slammed the state’s sanctuary policies. The Sacramento Bee reported that Mateo was born in Oaxaca, Mexico, and came to the United States with her parents when she was 14. She graduated from Santa Clara University School of Law in 2016 and passed the California bar exam the next year. (Undocumented immigrants are allowed to apply for the bar in California.) The Senate initially announced that the appointment was a first for the state, but Senate officials later clarified that, in 2016, Gov. Jerry Brown named a student in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to the California State University Board of Trustees. Reeves said that he believes Mateo is the first undocumented immigrant not protected by DACA to receive a statewide appointment.   Mateo told NPR that when she applied for DACA, the Obama administration wanted her to explain why she left the country during the Dream 9 protest. She said the administration denied her DACA application. Some California lawmakers want to increase civic participation of undocumented immigrants. If it passes, SB 174 would allow for all California residents, including undocumented immigrants, to receive appointments to state and local boards and commissions that are not merely advisory.  Mateo was appointed to an advisory committee, so SB 174 would not affect that appointment, said Michael Soller, spokesman for state Sen. Ricardo Lara, a sponsor of the bill. A headline said, ""It begins: California appoints first illegal alien to state office."" Mateo is an undocumented immigrant and did receive a state appointment. But the headline doesn’t fully capture her role: she will serve in an unpaid position on a 12-member advisory committee about improving college access for poor families. Also, although the state Senate initially said Mateo’s appoint was a first, it later found that the governor had appointed another undocumented immigrant to a state board in 2016. The other immigrant had federal protection from deportations, while Mateo does not.

Rosen misleads on Heller Yucca Mountain vote
","Yucca Mountain is a hot-button issue in Nevada. The idea of storing up to 110,000 metric tons of highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants has few fans inside the state. President Donald Trump supports the plan and put $110 million into his proposed budget to move it forward. With broad bipartisan support, the House voted overwhelmingly May 10 to have the Energy Department plan and build out the storage site. Democrat Jacky Rosen’s Senate campaign fired off a press release tying incumbent Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., to the House vote. ""Heller couldn’t even stop his close friend of more than a decade, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, from bringing the Yucca Mountain bill to the floor for today’s vote,"" the press release said. ""Heller has voted for a GOP budget that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain, and he voted to confirm President Trump’s pro-Yucca budget director last year."" We decided to look at the statement that Heller voted for a Republican budget that advanced the Yucca Mountain waste repository. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! The Rosen campaign’s press release linked to an April 12, 2011, article in the Las Vegas Sun. The story said a House budget provision that would have revived the Yucca Mountain proposal had died in the Senate. There’s a lot of history here. With the prospect of waste building up at nuclear power plants across the country, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. In 1987, it amended the act to make Yucca Mountain the only option for Energy Department planning. Jump forward to 2009. The site had met the safety requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but the Obama administration, citing broad opposition in Nevada, put things on hold. In 2011, House Republicans added a rider to their budget that barred the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from doing anything to close the Yucca Mountain site. The formal text was: ""No funds ... may be used by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct closure of adjudicatory functions, technical review, or support activities associated with the Yucca Mountain geologic repository license application."" So, while the bill didn’t specify any particular sum to open the site, this rider denied money to roll back the planning process. The rider was part of an appropriations package that reached virtually every government agency. The bill funded defense, health and human services, agriculture, and more. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the total price tag was $1.3 trillion. Heller, then a House representative, voted for the bill, which passed pretty much down straight party lines. Every Democrat and only three Republicans voted against it. The Rosen press release singles out the element related to Yucca Mountain, but as is always the case with budget bills, they are about much more than just one issue. It’s also true that Heller tried to remove the Yucca Mountain rider. He offered an amendment that would have prevented any money going toward the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository. That amendment failed on a voice vote. Stewart Boss with the Rosen campaign said they stand by their press release. ""When a partisan budget bill with a controversial Yucca Mountain funding provision came to a vote in 2011, Senator Heller weakly tried and failed to remove the funding,"" Boss said. Heller is on the record as opposing the facility. In 2017, he testified before a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee, saying ""This ill-conceived project would not only cause significant harm to the well-being of my home state and all Nevadans, but also poses a national security risk that is too great to ignore."" Heller has continued to argue against Yucca Mountain funding in letters to appropriators, including this one in April. The Rosen campaign said that Heller ""has voted for a GOP bill that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain."" The GOP bill that got Heller's vote didn’t provide money so much as it barred the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from spending money to roll back the licensing process for the waste repository site. Heller floated an amendment that would have barred spending any money on the site at all. Offering an amendment is not the same as waging a knock-down, drag-out fight, but Heller’s amendment would have stymied the intent of the Republican language. Back then and today, Heller’s official policy is to oppose the Yucca Mountain plan. All of this took place in the context of a massive spending measure. To focus on a single element in a $1.3 trillion bill amounts to legislative cherry-picking.

Does detaining an immigrant for a year cost 4 times federal spending on a child in public school?
","Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., challenged the Department of Homeland Security’s spending practices, saying the agency is ""unnecessarily detaining people,"" such as pregnant women. Murray offered a comparison of federal dollars that go toward the detention of immigrants with money spent to educate children in public schools. ""As you know, detention is really expensive,"" Murray said during a May 8 Senate subcommittee hearing for the department’s 2019 budget request. ""Each year (U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement) detains someone, it costs taxpayers over $50,000. For comparison, by the way, that's four times the amount the federal government spends on each child in our public schools."" We found that Murray’s math contains some truth, but needs clarification and additional information. Based on the current rate to house an adult detainee per day, it would cost slightly over $50,000 to keep a person detained for a year. That’s roughly four times the approximate $13,000 public schools received per student. However, a year's detention is not realistic, as most detainees are held an average of 40 days. Also, most school funding is at the state and local levels, not federal. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! Murray’s office said her $50,000 estimate was an annualized calculation of the current daily bed rate for immigrant detention, $137.19, multiplied by 365 days (a total of $50,074.35). The bed rate is the national average cost to house one adult detainee for one day. In recent years, the average bed rate has been around $130. That $50,000 is likely a conservative estimate of the detention costs. From fiscal years 2014 through 2017, ICE underestimated the actual bed rate, said an April 2018 U.S. Government Accountability Office report, flagging ""inconsistencies and errors"" in ICE’s calculations for immigration detention costs. Since ICE had not received an appropriation for fiscal year 2018 during the time of GAO’s review, GAO did not assess 2018’s budget projection compared to actual costs. Still, GAO said ICE’s 2018 request included a multiplication error that resulted in ICE requesting less funds for adult beds. It would cost more than $50,000 to keep one immigrant in detention for a year based on the current bed rate. But so far in fiscal year 2018, the average length of detention has been 40.5 days, according to ICE spokeswoman Danielle Bennett. The average length of detention from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 was about 33 days, according to the ICE budget overview for fiscal year 2018. The average length of detention for immigrants apprehended at the southwest border was about 27.4 days in fiscal year 2017, and increased to 51.5 days for immigrants apprehended in the interior of the country, the budget overview said. It also said that ""due to a revived focus on ensuring public safety by increasing interior enforcement"" detention of criminal immigrants ""may be significantly higher when compared to prior years."" Even so, there are reports of some immigrants being in detention for several months and even years. The U.S. Supreme Court in February said that individuals in immigration detention are not entitled to periodic bond hearings, even if they have been detained for months or years. The case centered on immigrants in the United States legally whom the government seeks to deport after being convicted of crimes, asylum seekers, and immigrants seeking admission on other grounds. Murray’s office used data from the National Center for Education Statistics for her point about the cost of public school education. The center’s website said ""total expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools in the United States in 2013–14 amounted to $634 billion, or $12,509 per public school student enrolled in the fall (in constant 2015–16 dollars)."" Multiplied by four, the total slightly overtakes the $50,000 estimate for detaining on immigrant for a year. However, the per-student estimate includes all levels of funding, not just federal. ""The word federal was inadvertently included, and will be corrected in the committee record so there is no confusion going forward,"" said Murray’s spokeswoman Kerry Arndt. Officials at the National Center for Education Statistics provided us updated data for 2014-15 that showed total expenditures per-student were $13,100 (or about $2,400 more than the immigrant detention estimate when multiplied by four.) The federal government contributes billions to educating U.S. students. But the bulk of costs are picked up by state and local sources. Schools use federal funds for specific school programs and students, such as school lunches and support for children with disabilities. Public schools received $56 billion from the federal government for the 2014-15 school year, said Tom Snyder, director of annual reports and information staff at the National Center for Education Statistics. Broken down to the number of students in public schools that school year (about 50 million), schools received $1,122 per student (adjusted to 2016-17 dollars), Snyder said. Murray said, ""Each year ICE detains someone, it costs taxpayers over $50,000. For comparison, by the way, that's four times the amount the federal government spends on each child in our public schools."" The current bed rate to house one adult detainee multiplied by 365 days is $50,074.35.  The most recent per-student expenditure total multipled by four comes to $52,400. The numbers alone don't capture the full story. It's important to note that not all immigrants spend a year in detention. Also, schools' major sources of funding are local and state governments, not the federal government. Murray’s statement is partially accurate and needs additional information.

The percentage may have changed somewhat following the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but experts said they did not expect there to have been a dramatic shift. Here’s the full breakdown: As for long-term care costs as a share of Medicaid spending, it’s quite a bit less than the two-thirds Pelosi cited. In 2016, various types of long-term care accounted for 21.4 percent of all Medicaid spending.     Pelosi said, ""Two-thirds of the people who use Medicaid are poor children, but two-thirds of the money is for long-term care for seniors, whether in a facility or at home.""

","President Donald Trump called the nation’s immigration laws a ""disgrace"" and pointed the finger at Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, for the policy he calls ""catch and release."" ""You've seen catch and release,"" Trump said. ""You catch them and then you release them, okay? That's what it is. This is a Democrat rule, Sherrod Brown, this is a Democrat rule, catch and release. You catch them, you release them."" Trump said that the undocumented immigrants then wait a year for a hearing and don’t show up in court. Trump made his comments at a tax roundtable in Cleveland on May 5, a few days before U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci won the GOP primary to challenge Brown in November. We found Trump’s talking point that ""catch and release"" is a ""Democrat rule"" wrong. In fact, the underlying policy has continued under his own administration. ""For decades, across both Democratic and Republican administrations, many immigrants apprehended while trying to enter the country (by land or sea) have been released from custody while their legal right to remain in the United States was being resolved by the courts,"" said Adam Cox, a New York University law school professor.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! ""Catch and release"" refers to immigration authorities detaining undocumented immigrants but releasing them while they wait to appear before an immigration judge. The practice didn’t start during a Democratic administration, said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a George Mason University political science professor. On the contrary, the roots can be traced back to a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2001 during the Republican administration of George W. Bush. The court ruled in Zadvydas vs. Davis that the government couldn’t indefinitely hold individuals beyond six months if it’s unlikely that ICE can actually deport them soon. The Bush administration eventually responded to the court order by increasing detention bed space and expanding ""expedited removal,"" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Under expedited removal, apprehended undocumented immigrants are detained and quickly go before an immigration agent. But in reality, the policy of releasing immigrants awaiting hearings didn’t end. Senate Republicans made attempts to stop the practice during Obama’s administration, but the process continued. Two key groups that have been exempted from expedited removal are those seeking asylum and undocumented minors. Those two groups soared during Obama’s tenure. A bill signed by Bush, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, codified the process for the treatment of undocumented minors. In January 2017, Trump signed an executive order to terminate ""catch and release."" In reality, it didn’t change actual policy. In an October Senate hearing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said ""catch and release"" was not official policy but was still happening due to a long backlog of cases and a shortage of immigration judges. ""It's just the reality that there are so many people claiming and being entitled to hearings that we don't have the ability to provide those hearings, and they are being released into the community, and they're not coming back for their hearings,"" Sessions said.   The White House said that as a result of existing law, more than 107,000 unaccompanied minors had been released since fiscal year 2016. The White House blamed Congress for not providing enough money for detention space. Trump singled out Brown, likely because Trump was speaking in Ohio, but we found no statements by Brown about ""catch and release."" During the wave of unaccompanied minors in 2014, Brown called for ""comprehensive immigration reform."" Earlier this year, Brown supported amendments to boost border security and provide legal status for Dreamers, but the amendments didn’t draw enough support in the Senate to proceed. Brown’s campaign spokesman said that he has never voted or publicly commented on ""catch and release."" Trump said the policy called ""catch and release"" is ""a Democrat rule, Sherrod Brown, this is a Democrat rule."" Trump was referring to the practice of releasing apprehended undocumented immigrants while they await a hearing before an immigration judge. Trump misleads by labeling the policy a ""Democrat rule"" because it dates back to at least Republican President George W. Bush. Under Trump’s Republican leadership, the practice continues. A few factors are at play here, including lack of detention space and the laws about unaccompanied minors. But those factors aren’t in the hands of Democrats alone. Trump also singled out Brown, the Ohio senator, with no evidence that he played any role in the policy.

Mike Pence uses outdated figure in claiming large drop in illegal border crossings
","The security of the U.S. border with Mexico remains a hot-button issue. On April 4, 2018, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum to deploy the National Guard, a move aimed at improving border security. ""The security of the United States is imperiled by a drastic surge of illegal activity on the southern border. Large quantities of fentanyl, other opioids, and other dangerous and illicit drugs are flowing across our southern border and into our country at unprecedented levels, destroying the lives of our families and loved ones,"" the memorandum says. In line with this initiative, Vice President Mike Pence, during a April 25, 2018, speech at the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee said: ""Our president also promised to secure our borders and enforce our laws. … As I stand before you today, illegal crossings at our southern border have been cut by over 40 percent."" The 40 percent decrease figure is often bandied about by administration officials. Is it accurate? The evidence In January 2018, the Department of Homeland Security announced the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s apprehension numbers for the previous year. ""The final border apprehension numbers of 2017, specifically at the southern border, undeniably prove the effectiveness of President Trump’s commitment to securing our borders,"" said Tyler Q. Houlton, acting press secretary, in the release. ""This administration has overseen a 40 percent decrease in 2017 compared with the last year of Obama’s presidency. U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions in Fiscal Year 2017 were at the lowest level in 45 years."" But untangling the numbers is not so easy. Let’s step back. According to the Department of Homeland Security figures, in Fiscal Year 2017 the U.S. Border Patrol caught 303,916 people crossing the southern border, down from 408,870 in 2016 -- a drop of 25.6 percent. That’s not 40 percent. We turned to the vice president’s office, but they did not respond to our requests for comment. Meanwhile, a public affairs officer with the Department of Homeland Security said the 40 percent figure is correct and told PolitiFact Wisconsin to ""Google it."" The officer also cited an earlier fact check by our colleagues at PolitiFact National, which checked this March 13, 2017, claim from Trump: In the first full month of my administration following the issuance of my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border fell by an unprecedented 40 percent. Politifact National rated the claim Mostly True.   It found that according to a Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2017 chart, apprehensions by border patrol along the U.S.-Mexico border decreased about 40 percent, from 31,576 in January 2017 to 18,754 in February 2017. But that 40 percent decrease refers to a one-month drop. And the figure is greatly outdated -- there is now more than a year of data to work with since Trump took office. The spokesman also sent us a link to a Dec. 5, 2017, National Public Radio article, which noted arrests for illegal border crossings had hit a 46-year low. That article also references a drop, but it reports one much smaller than 40 percent. ""Border officers apprehended 310,531 people for being in the country illegally in fiscal 2017, a 25 percent decrease from the year before"" the article states. And it provides a slightly skewed picture: The 310,531 apprehensions in 2017 is a nationwide figure. According to the Homeland Security report ""CBP Border Security Report, Fiscal Year 2017,"" of the national total, 303,916 were along the southern border. In any case, that brings us back to the percentage drop we started with. But the fiscal year measure is not a perfect one. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1, so Fiscal Year 2017 takes in the final few months under President Barack Obama. So, let’s try a few other ways. Trump took office in January 2017, when the monthly apprehension figure was at 31,576. A year later, in January 2018, monthly apprehensions were at 25,978 -- a drop of about 18 percent (less than half the boasted about 40 percent). What’s more, the situation flips when you use subsequent months to make the same comparison. That is, monthly apprehensions were higher in February 2018 than February 2017; higher in March 2018 than March 2017, and higher in April 2018 than April 2017. A look at the most recent month-to-month changes -- the approach Trump used in his initial boast -- shows that from February 2018 to March 2018, there was an increase of nearly 40 percent. And from March to April, there was an increase of about 2.3 percent. Our rating Pence said ""Illegal crossings at our southern border have been cut by over 40 percent."" The most recent official fiscal year numbers show a much smaller drop of about 26 percent. And the latest month-to-month numbers show an increase, not a decrease in apprehensions.

Gavin Newsom's Half True claim on reducing San Francisco’s homeless ‘street population’
","Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed San Francisco dramatically shrunk its homeless street population, implying the change took place under his leadership.    ""In San Francisco, we were successful in reducing our street population 40 percent. We got 12,000 people off the street,"" Newsom said during a gubernatorial debate in San Jose on May 8, 2018. The event was broadcast statewide on NBC and NPR stations. Newsom is a Democrat and California’s lieutenant governor. He was San Francisco’s mayor from January 2004 through January 2011. Before that, he served eight years on the San Francisco County Board of Supervisors starting in January 1997. Polls show Newsom is currently the favorite in the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown. Whoever becomes California’s next governor will be faced with a growing homeless crisis, one made worse by a lack of affordable housing. Homelessness in the state shot up nearly 14 percent in 2017, as it remained flat nationwide, according to federal data and our recent fact check on the topic. Given the importance of the issue, we wanted to know whether Newsom got his facts right. We set out on a fact check. Our research  We started by examining Newsom’s claim about a 40 percent reduction in the city’s ""street population,"" which includes people living outside, in abandoned buildings, tents, cars and storage structures. It’s a subset of the city’s overall homeless population, which includes people living in emergency shelters and transitional housing. Some might interpret Newsom’s statement as meaning the city’s overall homeless population dropped significantly during his time in office. That’s not the case. But because Newsom twice referenced ""street population,"" we examined that category. Though he doesn’t give a timeframe, we assumed Newsom was speaking mainly about his tenure as mayor. Nathan Click, Newsom’s campaign spokesman, said the candidate’s statement is supported when comparing street population totals from 2002 to 2009, or two years before he became mayor to two years before he left that office. A 2009 San Francisco Homeless Count and Survey does show the total dropped 40 percent, from 4,535 individuals to 2,709.  By 2011, however, the city’s street total climbed to 3,100, a gain of about 400 people over Newsom’s final two years as mayor, according to the city survey from that year. Trent Rhorer, who served as Newsom’s homeless czar, has worked as executive director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency since 2000. He said the increase during the last part of Newsom’s tenure took place ""in the context of a massive recession"" that forced many onto the streets. Rhorer said it was also driven by the shuttering of several nonprofit homeless programs, including two drop-in centers, a shelter and a treatment program when private landlords sold buildings housing those services. Even considering the uptick in the last two years of Newsom’s term, the city’s unsheltered total still decreased by 31 percent from 2002 to 2011, he noted. The executive director added that the city’s overall homeless population held steady from 2009 to 2011, hovering near 6,500. ""Is homelessness solved? Absolutely not,"" Rhorer said, but Newsom ""got results."" 12,000 people off the streets?  Rohrer also explained the 12,000 figure. He said it represents the total number of people removed from the streets through two strategies from January 2004 through November 2010, a period that nearly spans Newsom’s time as mayor. The city placed about 7,000 in permanent housing programs, while the remainder left the streets with a bus ticket through Homeward Bound, a program that’s been criticized by some homeless advocacy groups as simply moving the problem to another city. Chris Herring, a doctoral candidate of sociology at UC Berkeley who studies homelessness, told The San Francisco Examiner in June 2016 the program ""should not be used as a policy to boost up numbers or some vision that San Francisco is ending homelessness."" Rohrer described Homeward Bound as a well-vetted and voluntary program that connected homeless street people with caretakers who agreed to take them in. It included three follow-up phone calls by city officials, he said. Overall homeless numbers Newsom’s statement does not reflect the slight increase in San Francisco’s overall homeless population during his time as mayor. The first available report during his tenure, from January 2005, shows a total of 6,248. By January 2011, Newsom’s final month in office, that number was 6,455. San Francisco’s most recent overall count, from June 2017, places the total at 7,499. While the homeless crisis continues in San Francisco, Newsom has been credited as a leader on the topic. A 2010 San Francisco Chronicle article said Newsom had ""moved more homeless people into supportive housing in his seven years in office than any other mayor in the city's history - and has one of the best track records of any mayor in the country on that score."" ""Yet many of San Francisco's neighborhoods,"" the article continued, ""remain plagued with panhandlers, and residents and tourists alike complain of feeling scared or just plain disgusted."" Our rating Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed at a gubernatorial debate that, ""In San Francisco, we were successful in reducing our street population 40 percent. We got 12,000 people off the street."" His campaign spokesman pointed to a city homeless survey that shows for one selective window of time, 2002 to 2009, San Francisco reduced its homeless street population by 40 percent. But that report ignores the last two years of Newsom’s tenure as mayor. Looking at those years, we found San Francisco’s homeless street population jumped by 400, diminishing the reduction Newsom described at the debate. We interpreted his statement as reflecting his full tenure as mayor, not part of it. Newsom also spoke of just one segment of the homeless population -- those on the streets, but not the overall total including people in shelters. The overall total has gone up, not down. His claim that ""We got 12,000 people off the street,"" is supported by statements from his former homeless czar. It’s important to note, however, that the city used Homeward Bound, a bus ticket program, to move about 5,000 of those people out of San Francisco. Newsom’s overall statement is partially accurate. But the first portion uses a cherry-picked timeframe that ignores the last quarter of Newsom’s term as mayor. The second part of his claim leaves out some key context. We rate Newsom’s claim Half True.

In fact, the last time that service members didn’t receive an annual pay increase was in 1983. And that was only because of a one-time technical quirk. Trump was ""totally incorrect,"" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The military has gotten a pay raise each and every year."" The full historical rundown is available in Table 5-12 here. We summarized those figures in this chart: The increase of 2.4 percent in 2018 represented the biggest bump since 2010. But there have been increases every year since then, ranging from 1 percent to 2.1 percent. For 2019, the White House is proposing a 2.6 percent increase; the bill to enact that pay raise is working its way through Congress. So how about that missing increase in 1983? That was the year Congress began starting pay raises on Jan. 1 of the new year, rather than the first day of the government’s fiscal year in October. So service members received their pay at the start of the fiscal year a few months earlier, just not during the calendar year, Harrison said. Beyond that, you have to go back to 1961 to find a calendar year without a military pay increase. Trump said that recent legislation ""includes raises for our military. First time in 10 years."" That’s wrong. Depending how you count it, the most recent year without a military pay raise was either 35 or 57 years ago — not 10.

No, Trump didn't vote for death penalty for gay people
","A vote at the United Nations on a resolution about the death penalty has led to some inaccurate headlines about President Donald Trump. ""Trump votes for death penalty for being gay,"" said a May 7 headline on the WashingtonSources website. The story, which repeats a claim circulating for months, said that the vote put the United States in the same category as China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the United States voted against a resolution that called for an overall ban on the death penalty, not a ban specific to gays and lesbians. The United States has said formally that it opposes the death penalty for people in same-sex relationships. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! While the story said that the vote ""just"" took place, it actually happened several months ago. On Sept. 29, the UN Human Rights Council voted on a broad resolution about the death penalty. Among other things, the resolution condemned imposing the death penalty ""as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations, and expressing serious concern that the application of the death penalty for adultery is disproportionately imposed on women."" The resolution also stated that the Secretary General had found discriminatory use of the death penalty, including based on sexual orientation. The four-page resolution includes a long list of arguments against the death penalty, and said that states that have not abolished the death penalty should ""consider doing so."" The United States was one of 13 countries to vote against the resolution, while 27 nations voted in favor and seven abstained. (The story said that Trump took the vote, but technically U.S. voting decisions are reached through internal discussions involving senior officials.) The U.S. statement about the vote made no specific mention of same-sex individuals. Instead, it said that the United States opposed the resolution because the resolution advocated for the outright abolition of the death penalty. ""The United States is disappointed that it must vote against this resolution. As in previous years, we had hoped for a balanced and inclusive resolution that would better reflect the position of states that continue to apply the death penalty lawfully. We reaffirm our longstanding position on the legality of the death penalty, when imposed and carried out in a manner consistent with a state’s international obligations."" The Trump administration faced a barrage of negative headlines about the section of the resolution pertaining to people who are gay.   Days after the vote, U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert reiterated that the U.S. was against a broad condemnation of the death penalty, but also spoke up about the portion that pertained to people who are engaged in same-sex relations: ""The United States unequivocally condemns the application of the death penalty for conduct such as homosexuality, blasphemy, adultery, and apostasy. We do not consider such conduct appropriate for criminalization."" Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, also pushed back against the headlines. She tweeted Oct. 3: ""Fact: There was NO vote by USUN that supported the death penalty for gay people. We have always fought for justice for the LGBT community."" After Nauert’s statement, some gay rights activists remained critical of the vote. The Human Rights Campaign stated that it ""welcomes this clarification but continues to be concerned about the Trump/Pence administration’s engagement on the human rights of LGBTQ people abroad. It is disturbing that leadership in this administration did not discuss this position in their original explanation for the ""no"" vote."" According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, as of 2017 there were six countries (eight if we count the parts of Syria and Iraq still occupied by ISIS) where the death penalty is implemented for same-sex relations. There were also five where it is technically allowed (if not actually invoked), and one where it has not yet been implemented. John Fisher, Geneva director of Human Rights Watch, an organization that opposes the death penalty, told PolitiFact that the United States made clear that it's vote against the resolution was not based on the reference to same-sex conduct. The United States has traditionally had issues with death penalty resolutions at UN forums, said Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at Human Rights Watch. ""HRC resolutions have political power in that they are expressions of a key collective body, the UN’s top human rights body,"" he said. ""But they’re not legally binding in the way that Security Council resolutions can be."" A headline by WashingtonSources said, ""Trump votes for death penalty for being gay."" In September, the United States voted against a four-page resolution about the death penalty that included a provision condemning the imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for ""consensual same-sex relations."" But the U.S. had another reason to vote against the resolution: The United States still uses the death penalty, and this resolution broadly condemned it. Days later, the State Department went on record stating that it ""unequivocally condemns the application of the death penalty for conduct such as homosexuality.""

State worker fires back at Gov. Rick Scott, says workers have gone years without raises
","
Some of the more than 100,000 faceless state workers that Florida Gov. Rick Scott has targeted as ways to slash government spending are standing up and pushing back.

Scott has proposed cutting the state government payroll by roughly 10 percent over two years, wants employees to redirect 5 percent of their salary to retirement benefits, and is asking employees to accept cuts to their health care benefits.

""If you work in the private sector, here's the things you have to do: Your overhead has to come down each and every year as a percentage of revenues. Every year,"" Scott said in defense of his budget proposal for 2011-13. ""That has not happened in state government.""

But state government workers already have been asked to sacrifice plenty, some say.

On Feb. 21, 2011, during a meet-and-greet with Department of Corrections workers in Tallahassee, Scott faced a pointed question from a corrections department employee about the proposed cuts.

""You said to hold you accountable,"" the employee, speaking from the audience, said to Scott. ""State employees have seen, since the Bush administration, a reduction in state employees. I have been with this agency for many years. And I've seen where our staff has been significantly cut. We are required to do more with less. State employees haven't received a raise in five or six years. You're asking us to contribute to our pension plan and contribute more to our insurance. My question is simple: What have you required for the wealthiest Floridians to contribute to the state revenues?""

Scott didn't directly answer the question in his response, according to the St. Petersburg Times, and instead offered a quick lesson in capitalism. You can listen to the exchange here.

The plight of state employees certainly has been an issue in Wisconsin, where Republican Gov. Scott Walker is trying to remove collective bargaining rights for many state workers, resulting in massive protests and counter-protests. The issue hasn't reached such a fever pitch in Florida, but Scott's proposals are being met with resistance from union groups and many legislators.

Here at PolitiFact Florida, we plan to spend significant time checking claims about state workers, their benefits, and Scott's and the Legislature's plans. In this case, we wanted to check the claim by the state worker -- who was not identified in news stories -- that ""state employees haven't received a raise in five or six years.""

The answer comes from the Florida Department of Management Services, which in effect serves as the state human resources agency. The department tracks general pay raises for state employees as part of its annual workforce report.

State workers received a 3 percent general pay adjustment on Oct. 1, 2006, their last general wage increase.

State workers did receive a $1,000 lump-sum bonus on Nov. 1, 2007, and eligible Florida Highway Patrol law enforcement employees received a 5 percent raise effective Oct. 1, 2008. There were no pay adjustments included in the 2009-10 or 2010-11 budget.

Employees remain eligible for possible merit pay increases.

As of June 30, 2010, the Department of Management Services reported that of the 105,031 people working in the state personnel system, more than 74,000 -- about 70 percent of them -- worked at a yearly salary of less than $40,000.

A state employee asking a pointed question about Scott's proposal to cut benefits for state workers noted that state workers haven't received a raise in ""five or six years."" The last general pay adjustment for state employees occurred on Oct. 1, 2006, almost four years and five months ago. And state employees did receive a lump-sum $1,000 bonus in 2007, though that did not affect their salary rate. Those two details add more context to the worker's claim.

Barack Obama says his budget will bring deficit to lowest level since Eisenhower
","
In his remarks at the opening session of a small business forum in Cleveland on Feb. 22, 2011, President Barack Obama made the following claim about the budget proposal he released eight days earlier.
   
Saying that government should live ""within its means,"" Obama told the audience, ""And that's why I've designed a budget that freezes spending for five years and will help reduce the deficit by $400 billion over the next decade to the lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower was president.""
   
The part that caught our eye was that Obama’s proposed budget ""will help reduce the deficit by $400 billion over the next decade to the lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower was president.""
   
This is different than what he said in a speech to unveil his budget plan in Baltimore on Feb. 14, 2011. In that event, Obama said that his budget ""would cut the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, bringing this kind of spending -- domestic discretionary spending -- to its lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president."" He said something similar in his State of the Union address.
   
Discretionary spending refers to funds appropriated by Congress annually, rather than determined by a formula, and we discovered that there are a variety of definitions of ""domestic discretionary spending.""
   
In our fact-check, published on Feb. 16, 2011, we looked at all the possible definitions and concluded that Obama was justified in saying that by 2015, domestic discretionary spending would be at the lowest levels as a percentage of GDP since the early 1960s at least. However, we downgraded Obama to Half True because those numbers used at least one accounting technique that some economists consider a gimmick.
   
In Cleveland, though, the president said something different -- that the overall federal deficit would be lower by the end of the next decade than it’s been under any president since Eisenhower. Could that be true?
   
Before we go further, we’ll make one general caveat: The president’s numbers refer to his preferred policies -- which are merely the opening gambit in what is sure to be a drawn-out fight over the federal budget. In addition, the numbers are based on economic projections as far as 10 years in the future that may or may not come to pass.
   
Using the summary tables from Obama’s budget proposal, we found that the deficit for fiscal year 2011 is expected to be $1.645 trillion, while in 2021 -- the end of the decade-long span the president referenced in Cleveland -- the projected deficit is $774 billion. So the president actually underestimated the size of the decline in the deficit -- it’s actually set to fall by $871 billion over the 10-year period rather than by $400 billion.
   
As for the Eisenhower comparison, there are at least two obvious ways to look at this -- by the size of the deficit in dollars and by the size of the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. The latter calculation takes into account the size of the economy, which has grown dramatically over time, enabling fairer comparisons across long periods of time, such as the 50 years since Eisenhower left office.
   
To make these comparisons, we looked at the historical tables included with the president’s budget.
   
Using dollar amounts, Obama projects a deficit of $774 billion for 2021. From 1961 to 2011, the dollar amount of the deficit (not adjusted for inflation) was lower than that in every single year except for 2009, 2010 and 2011. So using this measure, the president’s comparison is way off.
   
Using deficits as a percentage of GDP. Obama's budget projects that the deficit in 2021 will represent 3.1 percent of GDP. From 1961 to 2011, the percentage was lower than 3.1 percent in 32 out of the 51 years. So by this measure, too, Obama’s comparison is way off.
   
In fact, in five years -- one under President Richard Nixon and four under President Bill Clinton -- the federal government ran a surplus. So those years alone would have made the president’s claim incorrect.
   
When we showed this comment to economists on the left and right, they agreed that the president was so far off that it was hard to believe he meant the comment as he said it. And indeed, the White House confirmed to us that the president had intended to make the same comparison he had made in Baltimore.

In fact, about an hour and a half after we initially contacted the White House, Obama changed his statement when he made his closing comments in Cleveland.

‘We’ve also got to get our fiscal house in order,"" he said, ""and that’s why I’ve put forth a budget that includes a five-year spending freeze that will help reduce the deficit by $400 billion and will get annual domestic spending down to the lowest levels since Dwight Eisenhower.""
   
So where does this leave us? The president meant to say something different and then rephrased the statement several hours later. Still, most people in the room or watching on television who didn’t see his closing remarks would think that Obama was referring to the deficit, which would be incorrect. To set the record straight, we give his initial statement in Cleveland a rating of False.",/factchecks/2011/feb/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-his-budget-will-bring-deficit-lo/

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s budget repair bill asks “everyone to tighten their belts”
","
Under Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed budget repair bill, there is no question that teachers and many other public employees would pay more for their pensions and health care.

The plan, especially provisions that would curtail collective bargaining rights for public employee unions, has drawn massive protests in Madison.

As the debate was heating up, newly named Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus -- former leader of the Wisconsin GOP -- offered his support for Walker in a Feb. 18, 2011, e-mail statement. He argued sharing the cost in the face of a deficit was the least that state employees could do.

""Gov. Walker is showing he, like so many Republicans across the country, has the courage to have the adult conversations our country wants and deserves,"" Priebus said. ""He is showing that no stone goes unturned as he asks everyone to tighten their belts so we can get our fiscal train back on the tracks.""

The debate in Madison has many facets -- and we’ve been tracking statements from all sides.

We rated as True a Walker statement from his January 2011 ""state of the state"" speech that state workers could pay twice as much for health care and it would still be half the national average. We rated as Pants on Fire Walker’s statement that his plan leaves collective bargaining rights ""fully intact.""

This item is about a different piece of the debate.

Is Priebus right when he says Walker is asking ""everyone to tighten their belts""?

Let’s start with the plan itself, which clearly treats some groups of public employees differently.

For starters, the bill specifically does not apply to police, firefighters and state troopers. Those public safety unions would continue to bargain for benefits under current laws, while other unions would lose the right to bargain on benefits and working conditions.

Critics say those unions are being rewarded for their support of Walker, but this PolitiFact item found the picture is more complicated. The governor says the differing treatment is necessary, to ensure government can function in an emergency.

Priebus’ office didn’t respond to a request to discuss his statement or what he meant when he said ""everyone"" is being asked to tighten belts.

Some may read it as meaning everyone in the state, not just state employees.

That, too, clearly is not true. The bill does not directly affect pay, benefits or negotiating rights for anyone outside state and local government.

Indeed, Walker has pledged not to raise taxes and has argued the changes are needed precisely so individual taxpayers do not pay more.

It is too soon to say, though, what will happen when the next two-year budget -- for the period starting July 1, 2011 -- is in place. Cuts in aid to schools and local government could push some extra costs onto local taxpayers, if the governing bodies choose to raise taxes and fees to recoup any loss in state aid.

Let’s return to the original statement:

Priebus argued Walker is asking ""everyone to tighten their belts."" But the proposal clearly exempts some public employee unions from any changes. Walker himself has said the differing treatment is necessary and justifiable.

Wisconsin state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, says like Hitler, Gov. Scott Walker is abolishing unions
","
Some explosive rhetoric followed the political grenade that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker lobbed Feb. 11, 2011, when he proposed rolling back collective-bargaining rights for public employees as part of a budget-repair bill.

Much of it, we have found, missed the mark.

Wisconsin doesn’t have a budget deficit, it’s on track for a surplus: False.

Walker’s proposal would leave collective bargaining for public employees ""fully intact"": Pants on Fire.

Madison protests against the plan have led to riots: Pants on Fire.  

Now comes a statement comparing the Republican governor to one of history’s  most evil despots.

""The history of Hitler,"" Wisconsin state Sen. Lena Taylor told a reporter on Feb. 15, 2011, ""in 1933, he abolished unions, and that’s what our governor’s doing today.""

The Wisconsin Republican Party said it videotaped the Milwaukee Democrat’s statement and a similar one she made the same day at one of the many Madison rallies called to protest Walker’s plan.

Signs at some of those demonstrations compared Walker to Hitler, but Taylor’s claims stand out.

The eight-year state lawmaker, who lost a bid to unseat Walker as Milwaukee County executive in 2008, also wrote Feb. 17, 2011, on the Twitter social networking website: ""LIKE HITLER in 1933, WALKER is busting unions.""

So, is Walker trying to abolish unions in the manner Hitler did?

We asked Taylor for evidence. In an e-mail, she cited several points that she said show Walker has a ""legislative goal of union busting in the coming years, if not in this (legislative) session.""

Taylor pointed out that Walker’s budget-repair bill -- which contains the collective bargaining changes -- limits public employee unions to negotiating wages, not fringe benefits and other matters, and requires them to be re-certified each year through employee votes.

Taylor also pointed out that as a state lawmaker, Walker supported right-to-work legislation, which prohibits unions from negotiating contracts with employers that require employees to pay union dues or fees.  

To be sure, the bill curtails collective-bargaining rights, and many opponents say it would effectively cripple unions that represent state, local government and public school employees. It does not, however, ""abolish"" unions as Taylor claims. Indeed, some public employee unions -- those covering public safety -- are exempt. And it does not affect private-sector unions, which are created under federal law.

In defending her statement about Walker, the only reference Taylor made to Hitler’s actions was that he abolished German unions on May 2, 1933.

Let’s look more closely at what Hitler did that year.

Reviewing a transcript of the opening statement of the chief U.S. counsel in the Nuremberg Trials, we found the Nazis: 
So, Hitler abolished all unions and collective bargaining by decree, not with legislation. And he used force to liquidate the unions that did exist.   

The sheer scope of all of Hitler’s actions, not just those affecting unions, led the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation to condemn ""the hyperbolic use of Nazi and Holocaust references"" by protesters in the budget repair bill debate.

While some protesters outside the Wisconsin Capitol have used images of the German dictator, the more pervasive cry has been chants of: ""This is what democracy looks like.""

Indeed, the changes in Madison are the direct result of Wisconsin voters making a historic change in who controls state government -- turning over the governor’s office, as well as control of the Senate and Assembly, to Republicans.

In response to Walker’s targeting of collective bargaining, groups are considering recalling some of the GOP senators, while other groups are eyeing a recall of Democratic senators. That, too, is part of the democratic process.

And Taylor and the other Democrats who went to Illinois to prevent a Senate vote on the bill have not been brought back to Madison by force. They argue they are simply using a tool available to them in the democracy.

Let’s return to the statement.

Taylor said Hitler abolished unions ""and that’s what our governor’s doing today."" Walker has not proposed abolishing any unions. His budget-repair bill would prohibit some government workers from joining unions and it would curtail the collective bargaining rights of most public employees.

But Walker cannot order any of the changes; they would have to be approved by the Legislature, put in place by voters in November 2010. Hitler, by fiat, not only ended all collective bargaining, he abolished all unions, seized their funds and sent their leaders to concentration camps.

Taylor’s comparison is ridiculously extreme.

It deserves our most extreme rating: Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/feb/22/lena-taylor/wisconsin-state-sen-lena-taylor-d-milwaukee-says-h/

Virginia Senate Democrats say House of Delegates budget cuts $50 million from education spending
","
Numbers are flying around state Capitol this week as legislators try to hammer out a budget agreement and adjourn their 2011 session on Saturday.

The Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-run House of Delegates have sharply different ideas on how dollars should should be spent. Each chamber is trying to win public sentiment for its proposals. 

In a Feb. 10 press release, the Senate Democratic Caucus said the Senate had ""introduced a balanced budget restoring funding cuts to education, public safety and health care,"" while saying the House ""introduced a budget that cuts $50 million from education, and reduces funding from other core areas.""

We checked the $50 million claim.

Keiana Page, communications director for the Senate Democratic Caucus, said the number comes from a Feb. 17 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The story indeed said the House budget would cut K-12 spending by $50 million. That’s the roughly the amount the House wants to reduce an education budget recommended by Gov. Bob McDonnell in December.

We reviewed the numbers and found the House pared overall public education spending by $50.8 million. But that didn’t make the caucus' claim a slam dunk.

Almost all of the reduction -- $43.2 million -- stems from lowered estimates of the number of students who will be enrolled in Virginia schools during the coming fiscal year. The remainder of the savings is coming from higher than expected sales tax revenue. When localities reap more money from their portion of the sales tax, the state pays less to support schools.

Del. M. Kirkland Cox, R-Colonial Heights and vice chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said there are 8,000 to 9,000 fewer students attending Virginia schools than originally projected, with a total enrollment this school year of just over 1.2 million. Cox, a high school teacher, maintains the cuts are ""technical,"" not changes to policies.

The House plan would hold per-pupil spending roughly flat. The current budget provides state spending of $5,166 per pupil, according to Robert Vaughn, staff director of the Appropriations Committee. The proposed House changes would lead to per-pupil spending of $5,161 next school year. The Senate wants to spend $5,242 per pupil next year.

Despite the lower-than-expected student numbers, the Senate bill would increase current spending levels, using the new money mainly for textbooks, English proficiency programs and remedial summer school classes.

The House has one other key proposal that would alter education spending. It wants to shift $89.8 million largely invested in instruction to the Virginia Retirement System for teachers’ pensions. The money would help make up for past shortfalls in retirement funding and lay the groundwork for the higher contributions that will be needed in future budget cycles.

The cash would come from $55.4 million in promised payments to 97 localities that lost money last year when the state rejiggered its allocation formula to school systems. The rest of the pension payment comes from $34.4 million currently funding resource teachers in middle schools. Vaughn said the state currently pays for resource teachers in grades K-7, while state law only requires funding those teachers up through fifth grade.

Under current rules, state contributions into the pension system are matched by school districts. Vaughn said the House decided not to require matching payments on the $89.8 million because localities had not planned for these payments when building their budgets.

House budget writers say that since the money is going towards teacher pensions, it’s an education expense. But critics argue the pension payment would consume money that could otherwise have gone into classrooms.

Jim Regimbal, a former Senate Finance Committee staffer who now runs consulting company Fiscal Analytics, said the extra pension payments mean ""less on-the-ground spending for teaching kids.""

To review, the Senate Democratic Caucus says the House of Delegates is pushing a budget ""that cuts $50 million from education."" They are basing this on the overall dollar figures proposed by the governor and largely adopted by the House of Delegates.

Much of the reduction in funding is due to student population being lower than expected. Spending on a per-pupil basis would remain relatively constant. But the House budget also removes $55.4 million in education funds that localities could use at their discretion and invests it in teacher pensions. That would likely result in less money going into classrooms, which sounds like a cut to us.

We rate the claim True.

Wisconsin state Sen. Jon Erpenbach claims there is no urgency to pass budget repair bill
","
Hanging over the standoff on union rights in Wisconsin is the question: How long will Democratic state senators continue their out-of-state boycott in an effort to delay a vote and get a compromise with Republican Gov. Scott Walker?

The 14 Democrats are holed up in Illinois to avoid being forced to return to Madison for a vote. Their absence means the Senate lacks a quorum to vote on spending measures.

And that means a delay on Walker’s plan to solve a $137 million budget shortfall – in part by forcing most public employees to pay more for their pensions and health care. It also would sharply curtail collective bargaining rights. That budget year ends June 30, 2011.

The next two-year budget, which begins July 1, 2011, has a much larger projected deficit, one that tops $3 billion.

So, how long will the Democrats stay away?

State Sen. Jon Erpenbach answered that question Feb. 17, 2011, as a guest on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow show.

Erpenbach, a Democrat from Middleton near Madison, suggested there was no quick timetable, noting June 30 is the key date.

""This budget doesn’t need to pass right now,"" Erpenbach told Maddow. ""And keep in mind it’s not the big budget, it’s just a minor budget repair bill that’s totally porked up with all sorts of things that Gov. Walker wants – it’s a huge power grab. There’s no rush on this thing. We have time to deliberate, we have time to debate, we have time to change it, we have time to make it better.""

So, amid all the talk of a state budget ""crisis,"" is it true there is not much urgent about it?

We asked Erpenbach to explain.

He said his point was there is no urgency on the portion of Walker’s repair bill that severely limits collective bargaining – because that policy move has no fiscal impact on the state budget.

Walker could drop his demand on collective bargaining and the repair bill still would be fully funded, Erpenbach contended.

However, in making the statement, Erpenbach made no such distinction. Rather, he spoke of the budget repair bill as a whole.

Let’s take a look.

The non-partisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau analyzed Walker’s repair bill funding plan.

The main source of funds is a debt-restructuring plan that saves money in the short term by pushing principal payments into the future. The other, much smaller, source is the $30 million from a plan to impose the higher health care and pension co-payments on state employees.

That piece represents about 22 percent of the overall shortfall.

The fiscal bureau paper notes the Walker plan to eliminate collective bargaining rights for public employees over fringe benefits and working conditions, and limit wage negotiations, would have no fiscal impact in the current budget year.

So Erpenbach is correct the math of Walker’s budget repair bill does not hinge on the controversial union rights provision.

However, as we noted in a previous item, the short-term deficit is real.

And it is based on some pending shortfalls in key programs, and that clearly adds urgency to the proceedings.

Debt restructuring: The Walker administration says the debt-restructuring plan must be approved within days – by Feb. 25 or 26, 2011 – to make sense financially. Fiscal Bureau Director Robert Lang is trying to confirm that, but Erpenbach and other Democratic staff members we talked to said they did not dispute it.

Medicaid funding: There’s also a projected $153 million shortfall in state Medicaid-funded programs for the needy. The state could run out of cash as soon as April 1 to keep Medicaid funds flowing, Lang told us.  Walker said some Medicaid providers might not get reimbursed if the money isn’t there. 
Meanwhile, the changes to force more in health and pension payments from state employees also have a ticking clock.

According to Lang, the savings figure will start to drop if those cuts can’t be put in place by March 13 payrolls. Walker said the deadline was April 1 if the full $30 million in savings was to be realized.

So far, Democrats have not offered their own plan for closing the deficit, though they have signaled a willingness to accept the higher employee contributions for pensions and health care.

So they cannot argue that the deadlines on debt restructuring and employee givebacks are not in play.

Erpenbach argued that Walker could simply rescind the $140 million in business tax breaks the Legislature approved earlier in 2011 at his urging.  That, he said, could be used to finance the budget repair bill.

But as we noted in a recent item, those tax cuts don’t kick in until the next two-year budget. So they have no impact on the immediate shortfall. Erpenbach is wrong on that point.

There is an interesting historical footnote regarding Erpenbach’s claim about the repair bill moving too fast. In 2009, when Democrats were in charge, Erpenbach was in the party-line majority that approved a budget fix that raised taxes by $290 million.

It got exactly one day’s review by the state Senate and no public hearing.

Let’s get to the bottom line.

In answering a question about when he and other Democrats would return to the Capitol, Erpenbach said there was no sense of urgency surrounding the vote on the budget repair bill. The collective bargaining changes – the most controversial part of the measure – do not have a fiscal impact in this bill. Erpenbach said that’s what he meant, though he did not say it that way.

But the entire budget bill – as currently constructed – is not something that can wait as long as summer. A Medicaid shortfall is projected to hit the state by the end of March. The pension and health care contributions lose some of their impact on the budget if not approved within weeks. And the bill is reliant on a debt plan that apparently must be approved within days.

The PolitiFact definition of Barely True is ""the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""

That’s our rating of Erpenbach’s statement, Barely True. 
(Editor's note: After this item was published, Lang clarified his statement to say Medicaid money would run out to April or May. Also, on Feb. 24, 2011, Gov. Scott Walker put the projected date as ""mid-May."")",/factchecks/2011/feb/22/jon-erpenbach/wisconsin-state-sen-jon-erpenbach-claims-there-no-/

National Republican Senatorial Committee raps Sherrod Brown for Ohio's unemployment, says stimulus failed
","
Out of work? Angry? Want to blame somebody? 
Assigning blame to politicians appeared to work for Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections, just as it did for Bill Clinton, a Democrat, when he ran for president in 1992. And if the current economic recovery isn’t robust enough, it could be a political liability in 2012, too.

That’s when U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, is up for re-election. So it came as no surprise that on Feb. 17, the second anniversary of the $787 billion economic stimulus bill, Republicans highlighted Brown’s vote for the bill.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee, or NRSC, picked out a number to attach to Brown’s name: 9.6. That’s Ohio’s latest unemployment rate -- 9.6 percent -- and it is higher than the 9.1 percent unemployment rate that Ohio had when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 passed.

""The Obama White House projected that their massive stimulus spending would cap national unemployment at 8 percent, and Brown promised Ohioans that it would ‘go a long way toward putting Americans back to work and our economy back on track,’ even claiming last September that the stimulus has worked,"" the NRSC said in a news release. ""But since Brown and the Democrats rammed the bill into law on a party-line vote, Ohio's unemployment rate has risen to 9.6 percent, above the national average.""

Brown’s office doesn’t dispute those numbers, nor did we when we looked on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website.

But Brown’s office cites an array of other numbers -- if the NRSC can pick some, then so can Brown -- that tell a different story. We checked out some additional numbers ourselves. The bottom line: 


The problem is, the national rate then had a healthy decline for two straight months while Ohio had only a small decline. That difference explains why Ohio’s unemployment rate, which was even with the nation not long ago, is above the national rate again.

So we go back to the NRSC claim: that since Brown and Democrats ""rammed the bill into law on a party-line vote, Ohio’s unemployment rate has risen to 9.6 percent, above the national average.""

The vote was not entirely along party lines, since two Republicans in the Senate (Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine) voted for it on final passage, as did independents Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. And it’s unclear how Brown did any ramming.

On the House side, the vote was along party lines. Not a single Republican voted for passage.

The Truth-O-Meter says a statement is Half True if it leaves out important details or takes things out of context. The NRSC claim gives too much credit to Brown for ""ramming.""  And it suggests that Ohio’s unemployment rate has risen above the national average since the stimulus bill passed. With the brief exception of last November, you’d have to go back to 2002 to find a time when Ohio didn’t lag the nation in employment. And it ignores that Ohio’s unemployment rate has fallen for nine straight months.

Context is important here because numbers can be cherry-picked too easily. And these facts are important for a listener to put the statement in proper context. That’s why we say the NRSC’s claim is Half True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/22/national-republican-senatorial-committee/national-republican-senatorial-committee-raps-sher/

Phil King says 40 percent of family incomes goes to taxes
","
State Rep. Phil King, R-Weatherford, recently advised a newspaper in his district that the Republican-dominated Legislature won’t raise taxes to balance the 2012-13 state budget, adding that conservatives believe in ""living within our means,"" the Jan. 13 Azle News reported.

""We’re going to have to do what businesses and families do,"" the newspaper quoted King saying. ""You don’t spend what you don’t have – and you don’t go out and borrow. We’re not the federal government.""

King added that families already pay out 40 percent of their income to taxes. ""Taxpayers just can’t afford to pay any more,"" King said.

Forty percent of family income goes to the tax man?

Responding to our inquiry, King said: ""I use the 40 percent figure because it is a safe, low estimate for the total cost of government on citizens. I believe this indisputable.""

King noted that according to a 2010 report by the Center for Fiscal Accountability, about 63 percent of income went to taxes that year. The center is tied to Americans for Tax Reform, a Washington group that collects pledges from officeholders not to raise taxes,

King traced the higher-than-40-percent to the center’s 2010 ""Cost of Government Day"" report, which says the average family worked until Aug. 19 last year -- 241 days or 63 percent of the year -- to earn sufficient income to cover their share of the costs of government. In Texas, the report says, residents had to work 225 days, 62 percent of the year, to cover such expenditures.

We failed to land an interview on the study methodology, but according to an online post by the center, it calculates the cost of government to include federal, state and local expenditures as well as an estimate of the cost of state and federal government regulations. The total cost of government is divided by an estimated Net National Product, the post says, to determine the percentage of national income consumed by government. The post says that a 2005 report for the U.S. Small Business Administration by W. Mark Crain, a Lafayette College economics professor, ""provided the framework for determining the cost of regulations.""

For more expertise, we touched bases with the liberal-leaning Washington-based Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and the non-partisan Washington-based Tax Foundation. We also circled back to another study noted by King and asked a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs for her preferred approach to gauging taxes against family income.

James Horney, the center’s director of federal fiscal policy, said in an interview that based on information in an appendix to President Barack Obama’s 2010 budget request, total state, local and federal government receipts accounted for 25 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product in 2009. He said, though, that families earning well above the national income median would likely have paid a greater percentage of their income in taxes. While GDP is not the same as family or personal income, Horney said, it’s a reasonable barometer of income.

Horney said the share of income supporting government has been higher in the past, exceeding 30 percent in 2000 and approaching 29 percent as recently as 2007. The recent national downturn depressed tax receipts, he said.

Tax Foundation spokesman Richard Morrison said by e-mail that the foundation estimates that in 2010, Americans had to work until April 9, through 27 percent of the year, to cover their state, local and federal tax burdens, though April 5 was ""tax freedom day"" for Texas residents.

A foundation economist, Kail Padgitt, said by e-mail that the ""Cost of Government Day"" report stressed by King is ""not an accurate measure of the taxes paid by a family because it also attempts to take into account the cost of regulation.""

To buttress his statement, King also pointed us to a December 2006 study by Boston University economists Laurence J. Kotlikoff and David Rapson. King singled out a table in the study estimating marginal tax rates, which Padgitt later described as the tax rates workers pay on the next dollar they earn--which are, in some cases, high enough to discourage the work from happening. In the United States’ progressive tax system, a worker’s marginal rate tends to increase with income.

The BU study says: ""With the exception of certain very low-earning households, we find high to very high marginal net tax rates – ranging from 24 to 45 percent.""

We reached Kotlikoff, who cautioned against concluding his study means that 40 percent of family income goes to taxes. ""It’s another politician who doesn’t know what they’re talking about,"" Kotlikoff said of King’s statement. ""The way he said it is wrong.""

Finally, we asked Shama Gamkhar, an associate professor at the LBJ School, to speak to the share of family income that goes to taxes. She said the percentage can be pegged at different levels depending on which taxes and how much of a family’s income stream is taken into account.

She pointed out a March 2000 Tax Foundation report that took into account the impact on family incomes of hidden taxes such as corporate taxes, which can brake worker salaries. In 1998, the study says, taxes accounted for 39 percent of the median income in two-earner U.S. families. That was down from 41 percent in 1996, thanks to congressional adoption of tax relief, but up from 32 percent in 1975.

Median income is a reasonable marker, the study says, because half of all families have incomes that exceed that of the median family and half have incomes that are less than the median family’s.

""After adjusting for inflation (to 1998 dollars), the taxes paid by the two-earner family are 4.9 times greater in 1998 than in 1955,"" the study says. ""For the one-earner family, taxes are 3.4 times greater than they were in 1955.""

Gamkhar also noted a table in the foundation’s 2010 ""tax freedom day"" report showing how the share of U.S. income that goes to taxes has escalated since 1900, when it was 6 percent, reaching 27 percent in 2010, down from 32 percent for 2001. Historical nugget: World War I more than doubled the nation’s tax burden.

All told, King overstates the family income that typically goes to taxes. Even if his statement is taken as a reference solely to marginal rates--there’s no indication in the newspaper account of that--marginal rates around 2006 ran from 24 percent to 45 percent, according to the BU study.

King broaches a valid point about taxes absorbing a substantial share of income. But that share approaches 30--not 40--percent. We rate his statement Barely True.

Georgia can bring in big bucks by ending booze ban, group says
","
Each year, a new round of a seemingly age-old debate takes place at the Georgia Capitol, and 2011 has been no exception.

Should Georgia lawmakers end the Sunday ban on the sale of alcohol in stores?

After Gov. Sonny Perdue and his threatened veto of Sunday sales legislation left office in January, supporters of the change took heart. But last week, state Senate leaders said there wasn’t enough support in the Republican-led chamber to end the ban. Some lawmakers oppose ending the ban for moral reasons. Proponents of ""takeout ""alcohol sales hope to persuade lawmakers Wednesday with a rally at the Gold Dome.

One group that wants to end the ban made its case to legislators in a recent op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a Washington, D.C.-based group that says it represents many of the nation’s leading liquor manufacturers, says Georgia can add millions of dollars to its coffers from the sales taxes it would collect from people buying alcohol on Sundays.

""Georgia stands to generate $3.4 [million] to $4.8 million in additional state tax revenues per year simply by repealing this outmoded ban,"" wrote the group’s vice president, Ben Jenkins.

A PolitiFact Georgia reader was dubious that there would be an increase in liquor sales on Sunday since Georgians are already trained to make their purchases on Saturdays. He asked us to check out the council’s math.

Georgia collects about $170 million a year in alcohol beverage taxes, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report in 2009. Alcohol can be consumed at many sports events, restaurants and bars on Sundays, but it can’t be sold in grocery or liquor stores. Connecticut and Indiana are the only states that currently ban Sunday sales of all three types of alcohol: beer, wine and liquor.

The Georgia Department of Revenue has not studied the potential economic impact of ending the Sunday takeout ban, a spokesman said.

Mark Stehr, an associate professor of economics at Drexel University in Philadelphia, has done several studies on the subject in recent years. His research shows there is a spike in all forms of alcohol sales on Sundays.

""In most cases, people will plan around [a Sunday ban],"" he said, ""but some people forget or may be doing something with their kids and can’t buy on Saturday.""

The Distilled Spirits Council produced a four-page report that breaks down how it came up with its estimate. First, its study looks only at sales of liquor, not beer or wine. It used data from four states that relaxed their Sunday alcohol sales to help estimate the potential increase in Georgia. Those states, Delaware, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania, experienced statewide increases in sales between 5.8 and 9.5 percent. In order not to oversell the potential economic benefit, the council went with a 5 to 7 percent estimate.

Using that 5 to 7 percent estimate, the council concluded there would be an increase of between 181,250 and 253,750 9-liter cases sold in Georgia a year. The council used Georgia’s 4 percent sales tax rate and added several state and local taxes to estimate that Georgia’s revenue from liquor sales would rise $3.4 million to $4.8 million a year.

So what about this estimated 5 to 7 percent increase in sales? Is it correct? We asked around.

Texas has studied the potential economic impact of allowing off-site consumption of alcohol. Its data shows the increase would be about 3.6 percent a year. Colorado lawmakers lifted a decades-old ban on Sunday liquor sales in 2008, boosting the state’s excise tax by 7 percent, USNews.com reported.

A 2007 study for the National Tax Journal by Stehr reported the average state saw a per capita increase in the sales of beer and spirits of 4.1 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, after repeal of a Sunday sales ban. The council sent us that report to support its conclusion.

Stehr, however, has since updated his estimate, based on additional data from states that have eased their Sunday rules. He found that states experience about a 3 percent increase in liquor sales when a takeout ban is lifted.

""I think it’s unlikely,"" Stehr said of the council’s 5 to 7 percent estimate, ""but it’s not completely out of the realm of possibility.""

The studies we found all show alcohol sales increase after a repeal. Some reports show a 5 to 7 percent increase in liquor sales is within the range of possibility, but Stehr believes it would likely be a bit lower. Other states, like Texas, also use lower estimates. With that caveat, we’ll be cautious about the council’s estimate that ending the takeout ban will result in an annual increase of $3.4 million to $4.8 million in taxes in the state of Georgia. It appears safe to say sales tax revenue would increase; the only question is by how much. Therefore, we rate the claim as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/22/distilled-spirits-council-united-states/georgia-can-bring-big-bucks-ending-booze-ban-group/

George Will says Wisconsin governor's benefits proposal would still leave workers better off than those in private sector
","With national attention focused on a showdown in Wisconsin over Gov. Scott Walker's proposal to reduce state worker benefits, the issue led to some spirited back-and-forth between union-backer Donna Brazile and conservative columnist George Will during the round-table discussion on ABC's This Week.

Brazile called the workers who have flooded the state capitol to back union workers an ""organic movement.""

""Just like the Tea Party went out there and grabbed the microphone, what you have is grassroots people out there saying, 'No more,' no more budget cuts on the back of working people."" Brazile said.

Will responded, ""Donna, what you call the grassroots is a tiny minority of this tiny minority of Wisconsin people who work for the government. Three hundred thousand public employees in Wisconsin went to work -- while the teachers were clutching their little signs that say it's all about the kids, they're abandoning their classrooms, lying to their supervisors, saying they were sick, and going off to protest in defense of perquisites, which if the governor cuts them as much as he plans to do, would still leave them better off than their private sector"" counterparts.

We decided to check Will's claim that perks or non-wage compensation such as health and retirement benefits) -- if cut as much as Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has proposed -- would still leave public employees ""better off"" than those in the private sector.

Walker's plan would require state workers to pay 5.8 percent of their pension contributions and to double their share of health premiums to 12.6 percent.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin have been all over many of the issues in this contentious debate, and back on Feb. 8, they fact-checked a claim Gov. Walker made in his first ""state of the state"" address, that most state employees could pay twice as much toward their health care premiums, and it would still be half the national average.

Here's some of what our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin found:

* A Kaiser Family Foundation study that concluded that employees nationally -- public and private -- pay an average of 29 percent of the cost of the premiums. Among just state and government workers nationwide, the average was 25 percent for family coverage.

* A U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010 health care benefits survey that put the employee share at 32 percent for family coverage. It’s 21 percent for single coverage.

* A study by The Segal Co., a private benefits firm, that looked just at state government workers and found that a majority pay between 20 percent and 60 percent of their premium costs for family coverage.

In other words, no matter how you slice it, the 12.6 percent share of health care premiums that Walker proposes employees pay is well below what most pay in the private -- and public -- sectors.

That gets us halfway there. The second piece is pensions. Again, Walker's plan would require state workers to pay 5.8 percent of pension contributions. This one is a little more difficult to compare. Most public employees have a pension plan. But fewer than one in five private-sector employees has access to a pension plan. And those who do typically don't contribute anything to it. Much more often, private employees have access to employer-sponsored retirement benefits (such as 401(k) plans), rather than pensions. And a third of the private sector workforce has no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan at all.

""The 401(k) has become the de facto retirement benefit in the private sector,"" said Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.

Typically, Brainard said, employers will match about 3 percent to 5 percent of an employee's salary. Employees may contribute to their 401(k), but they aren't required to contribute.

So Wisconsin public employees may be required to contribute more to the their retirement plan than those in the private sector, but that doesn't mean they're at a disadvantage compared to the private sector. In fact, experts say they will be better off.

According to a survey prepared by Brainard in October 2009, ""The retirement security of working Americans presently appears shaky outside the public sector, due not only to the nation’s heavy use of a retirement plan model that has been found to be undependable in its ability to provide reliable retirement income, but also due to low relative rates of participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans. ""

Conversely, ""For most states and local governments, retirement security of retired workers is a policy that is being achieved.""

As always, Brainard said, there are exceptions, such as for those government employees who don't work long enough to become vested in a pension.

But Will's comment, as it relates to pension is ""largely accurate,"" Brainard said. ""Overall, the retirement plan typically provided to Wisconsin public employees --whether or not they are contributing 5.8 percent -- provides a larger retirement benefit than private sector employees get.""

We'd like to cite one more survey, one by the Wisconsin Legislative Council which found that even among major public employee retirement systems, most required employee contributions of more than 5 percent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""for government workers with a required plan contribution, the average contribution is 6.3 percent of earnings."" So Walker's proposal is in line with the norm for government workers.

Now, we'd like to drop one big disclaimer into this whole analysis. Many experts contend that while state workers get better benefits, they get paid less than folks in the private sector. PolitiFact Wisconsin took a closer look at that issue here. The point is that it's important to consider an employee's total package of wages and benefits when comparing public and private sector compensation. But that's not the issue before us here. Will clearly stated that he was talking about just the benefits side of the equation. And with regard to the changes Walker has proposed -- requiring greater employee contributions to pension and health care -- Will is right that they would still leave public employees ""better off"" than those in the private sector. We rate Will's comment True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/21/george-will/george-will-says-wisconsin-governors-benefits-prop/

Donna Brazile says that unions that supported Scott Walker are exempt from restrictions on collective bargaining
","The ongoing budget crisis in Wisconsin got pundits George Will and Donna Brazile debating on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.

Will said that changes proposed by Gov. Scott Walker were reasonable and necessary given budget constraints. Brazile countered that the governor was using the excuse of a budget battle to destroy collective bargaining rights for public employee unions.

""And, look, what we're talking about is that the governor has cherry-picked what public workers he will subject to this so-called removal of their collective bargaining rights,"" Brazile said. ""The firefighters, the policemen and others who supported him in his election bid, well, guess what? They don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights.""

Brazile implied that this was political payback, and we want to be clear that we’re not checking Walker’s motivations. We’re looking only at whether ""the firefighters, the policemen and others who supported him in his election bid ... don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights.""

Our first stop was checking Walker’s proposal. It asks state workers to pay more for their pensions and health insurance, which reduces take-home pay. But it also sets limits on collective bargaining power for the public sector unions.

In a letter to public workers, Walker explained that his proposal would limit bargaining only to base pay, which means unions could not bargain for improved health insurance, working conditions or pension benefits. Pay increases would be limited to increases in the cost of living, using the Consumer Price Index, unless voters approved other pay increases via a referendum. Union members would have to vote to stay unionized each year, and contracts could only last only a year, among other limitations.

Walker concluded the list of changes by noting, ""Local police and fire employees and State Patrol Troopers and Inspectors are exempted from these changes.""

So Brazile is right that police, firefighters and others are exempt. Our next question was, are these the groups ""who supported him in his election bid""?

During the campaign last November, leaders of the Milwaukee Professional Firefighters Association and Milwaukee Police Association appeared in an ad supporting Walker and blasting his opponent, Democrat Tom Barrett. Walker also won endorsements from the West Allis Professional Police Association and the Wisconsin Troopers Association

Walker didn’t get the endorsements of two statewide unions, the Wisconsin Professional Police Association and the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin, which both backed Barrett.

For the record, the governor told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the charge that he was exempting police and firefighters was ""ridiculous."" He said he didn't recommend changing the rules for police officers and firefighters because he didn’t want public safety work disrupted.

We then contacted the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, the statewide union that endorsed Walker's opponent last year. Executive director Jim Palmer said the statewide organization is much larger than the local Milwaukee police union that endorsed Walker. The state group has approximately 11,000 members versus Milwaukee’s roughly 1,400, he said.

Similarly, the state firefighters association has more than 3,000, compared with the Milwaukee union’s 875.

The state police union is opposed to the changes Walker is proposing for other public sector workers, which include county jailers and police dispatchers, Palmer said. The statewide firefighters' union also opposes the proposal.

Palmer said he believes that Walker exempted police and firefighters not for political payback, but because they are the public workers who are most popular with the public. ""And in that way, it’s very political,"" he said.

Brazile said, ""The  firefighters, the policemen and others who supported (Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker) in his election bid ... don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights."" It’s true that Walker won the endorsement of Milwaukee police and firefighter organizations, and they won’t lose collective bargaining rights if Walker’s proposal succeeds. But not all unions supported Walker. In fact, the two significant statewide organizations endorsed his opponent, and they too would be exempt from restrictions on collective bargaining. Because the statement leaves out the fact that the police and fire unions broke ranks on whether or not to support Walker, we rate this statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/21/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-says-unions-supported-scott-walker-a/

Tom Scott says a 2005 vote against gay pride events didn't involve discrimination
","
With two seemingly divergent votes on gay rights, Tampa mayoral candidate Tom Scott is facing heat from both liberals and conservatives.

Gay rights groups lambaste Scott for his 2005 vote as a Hillsborough County commissioner to ban the county from acknowledging or promoting gay pride events. Conservative groups condemn the city councilman for voting in 2009 to add transgender protection to Tampa’s human rights ordinance.

Asked about the apparent contradiction during the St. Petersburg Times-Bay News 9 debate on Feb. 8, 2011, Scott said the 2005 vote ""had nothing to do with discrimination. I oppose any kind of discrimination in any form.""

We asked him again on Feb. 11 about the vote. ""The issue was spending public dollars to advocate or advertise gay pride,"" he said.

Scott is trying to make a distinction between issues like housing or employment discrimination and support for gay pride events. He highlights his recent vote and says he wants to be a mayor who represents everyone.

We wanted to dig deeper into Hillborough's policy. Does it have anything to do with discrimination?

It began in 2005 when then-County Commissioner Ronda Storms saw a display at a county library promoting Gay Pride month. Storms, who is now a state senator, worried about passing the display with her kids and having to explain it to them.

On June 15, 2005, Storms made the following motion at a county commission meeting: ""I move that we adopt a policy that Hillsborough County government abstain from acknowledging, promoting or participating in gay pride recognition and events, little g, little p.""

Scott seconded the motion. It passed 5-1. Storms followed up with a second proposal that the policy can only be rescinded with a super-majority vote and a public hearing.

The lone 'no' vote came from Kathy Castor, now a Democratic congresswoman. During the brief discussion of the proposal, she said, ""I think it's inappropriate for government to promote discrimination.""

We asked Nadine Smith, director of the gay rights group Equality Florida, if she thought the policy has anything to do with discrimination.

""The vote in 2005 was simple, mean-spirited bigotry,"" she said. ""It was indefensible.""

She added: ""Were he to ask for my advice, I would tell him you should just apologize for what they did. Say, 'What we did was wrong. We singled out one class of citizens to be treated differently.'""

County Attorney Renee Lee interprets the policy as banning county funds from going to gay pride events. Participation as a board is also prohibited, though individual commissioners can do as they like. The policy also means the board cannot acknowledge a gay pride event with a resolution or proclamation.

""We have not had any recent instances where the board has had to invoke the use of that policy,"" Lee said.

Lee deferred to Scott when asked if the policy was discriminatory.

Hillsborough's refusal to support gay pride events is not legal discrimination. Federal and state laws prohibit unfair treatment in housing, employment and public accommodations based on a person's race, national origin, religion, gender, disability, age or martial status.

Neither federal nor Florida anti-discrimination laws include a sexual orientation provision.

The gay pride policy was challenged in federal court by strip club owner Joe Redner. The two sides settled in 2007, agreeing to update the policy so it shall not ""be construed to prevent citizens from exercising their First Amendment rights in an appropriate forum.""

So the policy is unquestionably legal. But does it involve discrimination?

Let's check out a few definitions:

The Florida Commission on Human Relations: ""The unfair treatment of a person or group on the basis of prejudice and without regard to individual merit.""

Webster's New World Dictionary: ""A showing of partiality or prejudice in treatment; specifically action or policies directed against the welfare of minority groups.""

The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says discrimination involves treating someone ""unfavorably"" because they are a member of a protected class of people. (Once again, federal law doesn't include gay people as a protected class.)

Basically, it's differential treatment of a person or group — not based on merit but because the person belongs to that group.

Hillsborough County issues scores of resolutions each year lauding groups and community leaders. It also supports several so-called ""pride"" events each year. A 2006 county newsletter reads in part, ""Every year, Hillsborough County helps recognize Hispanic Heritage month…"" The county is also listed as the top partner of the upcoming Asia Fest 2011.

The county in 2007 issued a proclamation honoring the bicentennial birthday of Confederate commander Robert E. Lee. But the 2005 policy precludes the county from issuing a similar commendation of a gay pride event.

""The difference would be you're talking about a race or culture versus a sexual orientation,"" Scott said. He noted the county doesn't promote heterosexual pride events.

Added Tampa family values activist David Caton: ""Being Hispanic is not a changeable position. There are, however, people who have left the homosexual lifestyle. There’s a huge difference in recognizing a group of people based upon their lifestyle.""

Whether homosexuality is a lifestyle choice is, itself, also a topic of continuing debate. In an online fact sheet, the American Psychological Association says, ""no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.""

We understand gay rights is a tough political issue. It touches on religious and cultural beliefs that run the gamut from liberal to conservative to somewhere in between. Reasonable people have legitimate disagreements on the topic.

Regarding the 2005 vote, many parents were uncomfortable with a gay-themed book display in a public library. Many people think the vote is good public policy. According to federal and state laws, the policy is not discrimination.

But Scott is wrong in casting the 2005 issue as being just about ""spending public dollars"" and ""had nothing to do with discrimination."" The county won't even recognize gay pride with a resolution or proclamation as it does for other groups. The policy does involve discrimination. A group of people is treated differently. They aren't treated differently because of individual merit. They're treated differently because they belong to that group.

Wisconsin Republican Party says doctors were handing out phony sick notes to “striking union members” during protests in Madison
","
Among the thousands of government workers who demonstrated against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker over collective bargaining rights were men and women wearing white lab coats and carrying clipboards. Some had stethoscopes around their necks.

According to the Wisconsin Republican Party, they were doctors who wrote excuses for the protesters to explain their absence from work.

""Phony sick notes passed out to excuse striking union members,"" the GOP charged in a news release issued Feb. 19, 2011. 
As a result of teachers calling in sick, several school districts have had to close their doors during the ongoing protests, including Madison for four days and Milwaukee for one. The GOP argues that amounted to a strike, because the closings occurred after the state’s largest teachers union called on all Wisconsin residents to attend the Madison rallies.

However, no state, local government or public school employees -- all of whom would be affected by Walker’s plan to curtail collective bargaining rights -- have formally declared a strike. 
But what about the rest of the GOP’s claim? 
Did doctors roam the crowds outside the state Capitol handing out phony sick notes to government workers who missed work to protest?

The GOP news release cited a YouTube video posted Feb. 19 by the MacIver Institute, which describes itself as a Madison-based ""think tank that promotes free markets, individual freedom, personal responsibility and limited government.""

One of the women dressed in medical garb -- her name is not given -- tells the interviewer, ""We are writing sick notes for anybody who needs them.""

""Who’s sick?,"" the interviewer asks.

""Everybody is sick of Scott Walker,"" the woman says.

Another woman identifies herself as being one of a ""group of doctors representing ourselves, not necessarily our workplaces, providing work excuses for teachers and other union members who need them.""

The interviewer also confronts a man, apparently a doctor, who was filling out forms and asks if what he was doing was fraud. ""We’re not handing out anything. We’re assessing people and dealing with them appropriately in the privacy of their own medical consultations,"" the man replies.  

We found other evidence that doctors were handing out notes to public workers to give to their employers: 
Asked on camera if she thought she could get in trouble for issuing the notes, Oriel replied:  

""Certainly. We think it’s worth the risk to support the people and we feel very strongly that these are professionals who really would like to be in school, they would like to be in school with our classes, but they’re put in a position where they really have no choice.""

We tried calling Sanner and Oriel but were referred to a medical school spokeswoman. We also called two other doctors at the medical school who have been linked to the sick notes. Their offices referred us to a phone number -- (608) 890-9220 -- that offers a recorded message saying the medical school ""will thoroughly investigate these allegations and take appropriate actions as indicated.""

That phone line allows callers to record a comment and says people wishing to comment also can send an e-mail to [email protected].

Meanwhile, Milwaukee Public Schools officials have also promised an investigation, saying teachers who were ""absent without leave or who called in sick since the protests started in Madison"" could face disciplinary action.

After days of protests, the state’s largest teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said Feb. 20, 2011, that if teachers are not otherwise off, they should report back to the classroom. (Some districts were off Feb. 21, 2011 for Presidents Day.)

That’s enough for our checkup.

The Wisconsin Republican Party claimed that doctors passed out ""phony sick notes"" to ""excuse striking union members."" It’s clear that doctors outside the Capitol were distributing notes that public employees attending demonstrations could use in an attempt to explain their absence from work. None of the public employees, however, have gone on strike.

Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder says small businesses create three of four jobs
","
The term ""small business"" covers a range of seven different size categories, ranging from a two-person mom-and-pop grocery store to a factory with nearly 500 employees.

Which is why researchers at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics chuckled when we asked them about a statement Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder made about small businesses creating new jobs.

Appearing on WCPN 90.3 FM’s ""Sound of Ideas"" program, Batchelder noted the importance of small businesses in Ohio’s economy.

""Seventy-five percent of the jobs created in the state of Ohio are created in small business. They are not created by huge corporations and those who are very wealthy,"" Batchelder said.

PolitiFact Ohio thought that sounded interesting and we put the Truth-O-Meter to work.

We started by contacting the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Researchers there cited statistics that showed 99 percent of all private sector companies in the United States are considered small businesses, according to the definition used by the Small Business Administration. It categorizes any firm that employs 499 or fewer people as a small business.

Traditionally, the number of people employed by small businesses has been about the same as the number who work for businesses of 500 people or more, said Brian Headd of the SBA’s Office of Advocacy. That category would include large factories, like auto plants and steel manufacturers.

As of last year, the majority of workers had tipped toward small businesses, which employed just under 55 percent of the nation’s workforce, the BLS’s most recent statistics showed.

We also checked with Batchelder’s office about the source of the speaker’s statement. Spokesman Mike Dittoe gave us two: The National Federation of Independent Business’s Ohio office in Columbus, and a March 2010 report prepared by Headd titled, ""An Analysis of Small Business and Jobs.""

Roger Geiger, NFIB/Ohio’s executive director, both confirmed Batchelder’s statement and also referred us to the Headd report.

Headd also echoed Batchelder’s sentiment that small businesses are important to the nation’s economic health. He points out how one in five employees at small firms work part-time, and how a greater percentage of Hispanics, high school students, disabled, elderly, and rural employees work at small businesses.

Headd also noted that more than half of all companies start out small, stay small and close after a few years, accounting for 85 percent of job turnover in the country -- which is not necessarily a bad thing. Headd considers the hefty job changes experienced in small businesses to be beneficial and a natural outgrowth of a healthy economy.

""Although job turnover can be an emotional roller coaster for individuals, small firm job flows are a boon to the economy,"" Headd wrote in his report. ""This churning represents the economy’s constant evolution from outmoded processes and industries to more productive ones,"" a process he calls ""creative destruction.""

Headd sees small businesses as key to the nation’s recovery from the recession of 2009.

""With the labor market struggling in recent years, small businesses are a logical group to look to for job recovery as they have such a large role in net job creation,"" he wrote.

BLS researchers confirmed that their most recent statistics indicated that 75 percent of all new hires nationwide were made by small businesses in the second quarter of 2010. Over the past eight years, small businesses made 65 percent of all new hires in the United States, they said. And of small business job creation, nearly three out of four new workers were hired at companies with less than 20 employees.

But what about Ohio? Do the state’s small businesses mirror the national trend?

Benjamin Johnson of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services had data from the federal government on the most recent statewide breakdown, by county, of the total number of workers employed in Ohio, but could not provide specific information to verify Batchelder’s claim that ""75 percent of the jobs created in the state of Ohio are created in small business.""

Geiger, in the Ohio office of the National Federation of Independent Business, didn’t have Ohio-specific data either.

And the BLS told us they didn’t track that data, either. But researchers there made a point of saying they were sure Batchelder’s statement was essentially correct. As one pointed out: 99 out of 100 employers are classified as small businesses, so saying 75 percent of all new jobs in Ohio are created by small businesses is hardly different than saying ALL businesses create ALL jobs.

So the experts who deal with labor statistics back up Batchelder’s claim, but we also note that the absence of specific data on Ohio jobs is a point that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter we rate Batchelder’s statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/21/bill-batchelder/ohio-house-speaker-william-g-batchelder-says-small/

State Rep. Dan Flynn says Texas students spend no time studying the U.S. Constitution
","
In a recent column criticizing the Mansfield school district’s plans to introduce an Arabic program to its schools, state Rep. Dan Flynn, R-Canton, wondered why Arabic culture is a priority ""at a time when our children do not spend any time in school learning our own U.S. Constitution.""

We wondered whether Texas students spend no time studying the Constitution, as Flynn says in the opinion piece published Feb. 14 on the North Texas Navigator news website.

When we contacted the representative’s office, Flynn’s chief of staff, David Erinakes told us ""there is no dedicated class on the U.S. Constitution as early as first grade, and (Flynn’s) implication is that he believes all Texas school children should have a class on the U.S. Constitution while they’re in school at least one time.""

Erinakes said that while the Constitution is written into the state’s curriculum standards for the public schools, ""there isn’t very much time spent on it."" Erinakes said Flynn based this conclusion on conversations with teachers who have recently visited the representative’s office.

We turned next to the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for social studies, curriculum standards outlining what students must be taught in Texas classrooms. In an online post of the standards now in place — an update takes effect in 2011-12 — we spotted about 35 references to teaching students about the constitution.

According to the standards, students are introduced to the U.S. Constitution in fifth grade when they must identify ""the important ideas in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution"" and ""examine fundamental rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights."" Seventh graders should be able to ""explain the influence of the U.S. Constitution on the Texas Constitution."" Eighth graders are supposed to study ""the creation and ratification of the U.S. Constitution.""

History and government comes under the heading of social studies until high school, when specific courses in those subjects are offered. In a course in U.S. history since the Reconstruction, students are expected to ""identify and analyze methods on expanding the right to participate in the Democratic process, including... amendments to the U.S. Constitution."" A ""significant focus"" of the state’s mandatory high school U.S. government class is on ""the U.S. Constitution, its underlying principles and ideas and the form of government it created.""

Next we looked at online versions of the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills tests annually administered to students from grades 3 to 11. Fifth- and eighth-graders must pass the reading and math tests, and 11th-grade students must pass all portions of test, which include social studies, to graduate.

Searching for ""constitution"" in the social-studies portion of the 2009 test for eighth-graders, we found four references, including one question asking students to identify how the 13th Amendment changed the Constitution (B. Abolished slavery).

We found five references to the Constitution in the tenth-grade test, including a question about what principle the Constitution’s establishment of the executive, legislative and judicial branches reflects.

And in 11th grade? Two references to the U.S. Constitution.

Debbie Ratcliffe, an education agency spokeswoman, told us that local educators determine how much time is spent on the Constitution, but she pointed out that each grade is required to observe Celebrate Freedom Week, which falls on the week of Constitution Day — Sept. 17. The standards going into effect in 2011-12 reflect the observance. According to the pending standards, third through eighth grade classes, for example, must include ""appropriate instruction concerning the intent, meaning and importance of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution"" during Celebrate Freedom Week, or during another full school week as determined by each school district’s board of trustees.

Andy Welch, a spokesman for the Austin school district, told us that Austin teachers teach what the state standards require.

Richie Escovedo, a Mansfield district spokesman, told us: ""We definitely do teach the Constitution."" He pointed us to the district’s curriculum specifying that students study the Constitution in fifth, seventh and 12th grade. Also, Escovedo noted, district third-graders study questions such as, ""Why was a new Constitution needed after the American Revolution?"" and ""How does the Bill of Rights protect you, even as a child?""

When we told Flynn that we couldn’t find evidence to support his claim, Erinakes responded: ""You are correct that it is in the standards, but as to the time spent it seems to be minimal at best... Relative to the amount of time spent on other subjects, ‘our children do not spend any time at all learning about the U.S. Constitution.’""

Flynn’s statement, though, was absolute. Lacking back-up information from his end or any other evidence that either schools are flouting the state’s curriculum standards or students aren’t being held to them, the statement more than fails.

This one smelled cheesy to us.

Georgia Congressman Lynn Westmoreland was trying to make a point and brought up a claim that was too tasty to pass up fact-checking.

Westmoreland believes the federal government is too heavily involved in regulating American business. The Coweta County Republican offered this up in a Feb. 11 press release after voting for a bill aimed at examining the impact of government regulation on jobs and economic growth.

""Over the last two years, the federal government has gotten out of control,"" he said. ""I mean, the government actually regulates how large holes in Swiss cheese can be. That’s just absurd. More government does not mean better government.""

Does Uncle Sam really regulate the size of the holes in Swiss cheese?

Others, like the conservative-leaning Peach Pundit political blog, also wondered about this claim. Were there holes in this story? (Sorry, we couldn’t resist.) The congressman’s office quickly shared a 15-page federal report titled ""United States Standards for Grades of Swiss Cheese, Emmentaler Cheese."" Emmentaler is a form of cheese.

The report refers to the holes in Swiss cheese as the ""eyes."" On Page 3, the report says the eyes ""shall"" be ⅜ to 13/16 inch in diameter.

Sounds like regulation to us, Westmoreland’s spokeswoman, Leslie Shedd, told us in a telephone interview.

We looked for the big cheese at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to explain all of this to us. USDA spokesman Michael Jarvis was our cheese wiz and offered to help. He said that the federal agency has a voluntary program to examine Swiss cheese in a number of categories, including the size of its eyes. Jarvis said cheese manufacturers pay the federal government to examine their Swiss cheese in order to get rated on the USDA’s grading scale. The grades range from A, which is the best, to C. Manufacturers, Jarvis said, do not have to obtain a USDA rating to sell Swiss cheese. He said the practice is similar to countless foods, such as eggs, fruit or even chicken wings.

""This is a voluntary program for Swiss cheese standards, which was created at the request of cheese makers and buyers that is paid for by industry, not government,"" Jarvis said.

For the curious cheese lovers, an A grade goes to Swiss that is white to light yellow, smooth, round and firm, with oval-shaped eyes and has just the slightest degree of mold.

The cheese industry paid the USDA about $11,000 to grade 3,905,923 pounds of all forms of cheese in 2010, Jarvis said. It invoices the industry for all grading costs, Jarvis said.
The USDA could not provide a cost breakdown for grading Swiss cheese.

The holes in Swiss cheese come from the microbes or bacteria that are added to the milk that is used to make the product. The bacteria give Swiss cheese much of its distinct flavor, while the carbon dioxide in the cheese creates bubbles that result in the holes that make this food distinct.

Shedd, the Westmoreland spokeswoman, defended her boss’s point with several news articles that used the word ""regulation"" to describe the Swiss cheese grading system. Some of the reports noted the USDA’s argument that it is voluntary. One incorrectly reported that the grading is at taxpayer expense.

""While, yes, the company can continue to make Swiss cheese without complying with these specific regulations, failure to garner that USDA seal will absolutely affect their ability to have success,"" she said. ""If you were given the option of two kinds of Swiss cheese and one had the USDA approval and one didn’t, more likely than not, you would select the one with the approval because you would assume that it’s better.""

The effort by the cheese industry to create Swiss cheese standards dates back to the mid-1940s, said Jarvis, the USDA spokesman. The rules -- including hole, er, eye size -- were last changed in 2001 at the request of the cheese industry, according to an ABC News article provided by Westmoreland’s office.

We understand the larger point Congressman Westmoreland was trying to make. His staff recently found the 15-page document about Swiss cheese and thought it was a classic example of government overreach. However, the congressman’s statement gives an impression about Swiss cheese grading that does not completely convey how this works. The Swiss cheese grading is done by the federal government.

But this is regulation the cheese industry seeks -- not regulation foisted upon them.

Rick Perry says some in Congress are trying ""to create a separate government for those with a drop of Native Hawaiian blood.""
","
In his book Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America From Washington, Gov. Rick Perry envisions a time when ""race-based thinking is relegated to the bigot in the corner and not embraced by our nation's laws."" 
Among the examples of ""race-based thinking,"" he writes, is ""the mind-boggling effort of some in Congress to create a separate government for those with a drop of Native Hawaiian blood (just Google it — it's unbelievable)."" 
Alrighty. We typed ""Native Hawaiian government"" and ""drop of blood"" into Google. That led us to websites and opinion articles critical of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, known as the Akaka Bill after Democratic U.S. Sen. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, who has been proposing the legislation in Congress since 2000. 
Among the critiques was a Feb. 17, 2009, letter from retired college professor Kenneth Conklin to President Barack Obama urging him to oppose the legislation. Conklin, who maintains a website opposing the legislation and has written a book, Hawaiian Apartheid — Racial Separatism and Ethnic Nationalism in the Aloha State, says in the letter: ""The whole purpose of the Akaka Bill is to divide the lands and people of Hawaii along racial lines, to declare that the descendants of natives should be a hereditary elite with a racially exclusionary government walling out all who lack a drop of the magic blood."" 
That's not what Akaka says on a Web page promoting his proposal. The page, titled ""Native Hawaiian Federal Recognition,"" says his legislation outlines ""a process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity for the purpose of establishing a federally recognized government-to-government relationship with the United States, consistent with U.S. policy towards its indigenous peoples."" 
The site also says ""the federal policy of self-governance and self-determination has not yet been formally extended to Native Hawaiians"" and that his proposal is intended to achieve parity among indigenous American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians. 
A Dec. 22 Associated Press news article says: ""Native Hawaiians are the last remaining indigenous people in the United States that haven't been allowed to establish their own government, a right already extended to Alaska Natives and Native American tribes."" 
There have been many versions of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act over the years, though Akaka spokesman Jesse Broder Van Dyke told us its main goal — federal recognition and self-governance for Native Hawaiians — hasn't changed. We looked at the legislation that was in the congressional pipeline when Perry was writing his book last year. After passing the House in February 2010, it stalled in the Senate. 
Would anyone with ""a drop of Native Hawaiian blood"" be subject to the proposed new government, as Perry claims? 
Turns out, the bill doesn't set a minimum percentage of native blood for those who would qualify to be a member — the equivalent of a citizen — of the new entity. Such details will be decided during the drafting of the entity's governing documents, which would be subject to federal certification. 
However, the legislation does set an ancestry requirement for those who want to join the ""roll"" of Native Hawaiians who will help set up the entity, including by taking part in the writing of the governing documents; they would have to be ""direct lineal descendants"" of Hawaii's indigenous people. 
According to Black's Law Dictionary, a lineal descendant is a blood relative in the direct line of descent — children, grandchildren, and so on. Out of 317 federally recognized tribes, 98 have no blood requirement and instead determine membership by lineal descent, according to ""Changing Numbers, Changing Needs: American Indian Demography and Public Health,"" a research volume published in 1996. 
According to a provision that Van Dyke says was added to the legislation in late 2009, members of the roll must also demonstrate that they have ""a significant cultural, social, or civic connection to the Native Hawaiian community."" 
Finally, we looked at whether the Native Hawaiian governing entity would operate as a ""separate government,"" as Perry says. 
Akaka says on his Web page that members of the entity would be subject to the jurisdiction of state and federal courts, as well as state regulation, taxation and legislative authority. The legislation doesn't create a reservation in Hawaii or authorize private lands to be taken, the page says. The entity could enter into negotiations with the federal government and State of Hawaii over land transfers, but resulting agreements would need federal and state authorization to become effective, according to the page. The entity could not create its own military nor secede from the United States. 
Testifying before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on Aug. 6, 2009, Sam Hirsch, deputy associate attorney general in the U.S. Justice Department, said that ""in recognizing a Native Hawaiian sovereign entity, Congress would in effect determine that Native Hawaiians constitute a distinct community as it has done with Indian tribes."" 
According to an October 2005 Congressional Research Service analysis of the proposal: ""That tribes are governments having rights over their land and populace is a foundational element in the federal government’s relationship with Indians."" 
But some question whether Congress has the authority to equate Native Hawaiians with American Indians. 
Most tribes have long lived together under tribal governments, said Stuart Benjamin, a professor at Duke University School of Law, in his testimony before the Senate committee. But Native Hawaiians are a more diverse, loosely connected — and dispersed — people, he said, quoting U.S. Census Bureau data indicating that more than 40 percent of the population lives outside the state. ""No tribe has ever had the paucity of connections that exist among Native Hawaiians,"" Benjamin said. 
In a Dec. 7 letter to Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. senators, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights reiterated its 2006 opposition to the Akaka measure or any legislation that would ""discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide the American people into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of privilege."" 
So how does Perry's Google-it statement shake out? 
The proposal would authorize a separate government for Native Hawaiians, one that proponents say would give the group the same right to self-governance extended to other indigenous people. However, the legislation doesn't specify ancestry requirements — drops of blood or otherwise — for those who would ultimately be represented by the proposed government.
