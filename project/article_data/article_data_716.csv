Looking at the ideologies of the Whitmer kidnapping plot suspects
","On Oct. 8, federal and state officials in Michigan announced they were charging 13 men accused of terrorism, conspiracy and weapons crimes in connection with an anti-government group.  At least six in the group had plotted to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, investigators said — surprising news that generated wide national coverage at a time when fears of civil unrest are already in the spotlight. But some social media claims suggest that journalists lost interest in this headline-grabbing case after they discovered the suspects were sympathetic to Black Lives Matter and antifa. Antifa, which stands for ""anti-fascist,"" is a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists that’s been around for decades. ""Notice how the Whitmer kidnapping story disappeared after we found out the perps were ANTIFA and BLM anarchists,"" one post says.  ""13 Antifa members arrested for plotting to kidnap a governor,"" another post says. ""13 Antifa members ARRESTED for trying to KIDNAP Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to START A CIVIL WAR."" Both posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First, the case is still very much in the news. But it’s also continuing to unfold, so there’s a lot we don’t know. However, there is no evidence that the kidnapping suspects are antifa activists. And we found that of what is now a total of 14 suspects, only one is known to have attended a Black Lives Matter protest. Another suspect criticized the movement. On Oct. 9, the day after the kidnapping plot was disclosed to the public, the New York Times published a story titled, ""What we know about the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan’s governor."" The article doesn’t mention Black Lives Matter or antifa, except for a reference to a tweet from President Donald Trump, who, criticizing Whitmer, said Democrats ""refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities."" The FBI named Adam Fox was the leader of the kidnapping plot. Fox reached out to members of an anti-government group known as the Wolverine Watchmen for help, according to the Times.  Seven members of the Wolverine Watchmen were arrested and state authorities accused them of threatening to start a civil war and collecting the addresses of police officers to target them. In addition to Fox, the names of the other men facing federal charges are Kaleb Franks, Brandon Caserta, Ty Garbin, Daniel Harris and Barry Croft.   The federal criminal complaint against these men frequently references a Michigan based ""militia group."" It does not mention antifa or Black Lives Matter.  The names of the men charged by the state are Paul Bellar, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison. The state later arrested an eighth man: Brian Higgins. The state affidavit in support of the criminal complaint against these men does not mention antifa or Black Lives Matter either. Rather, it describes the Wolverine Watchmen as an ""anti-government, anti-law enforcement, militia group."" The affidavit reads: ""Members of Wolverine Watchmen periodically met for ""field training exercises"" (FTXs) on private property in remote areas where they engaged in firearms training and tactical drills to prepare for the ‘boogaloo,’ a (term) referencing a violent uprising against the government or impending politically-motivated civil war.""  Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel told NPR that multiple white supremacist and anti-government groups acted ""in concert based on shared extreme ideology.""  Some of the suspects appeared at protests supporting different causes before their arrest, but of the 14 we only found evidence of one person attending a Black Lives Matter event. The individuals were aligning themselves with other causes. The Null brothers both attended a protest against Whitmer’s executive orders to slow the spread of the coronavirus, according to the Times. They were photographed there carrying long guns. A sheriff in Barry County, Mich., has also said that he met William Null several years ago when he came to his office to vent about the Black Lives Matter movement, according to the Washington Post. The sheriff said Null wanted to start his own cause — ""My Life Matters"" — which he eventually turned into what he called the Michigan Liberty Militia, according to the Post. Later, Null told the sheriff that he drove to Flint during the city’s water contamination crisis to pass out water bottles alongside Black Lives Matter activists, the Post said. At least one of the suspects, Daniel Harris, did attend a Black Lives Matter protest, said Amy Cooter, a Vanderbilt University lecturer who studies militias in the United States. Harris who was quoted in the Oakland County Times saying he was upset about the killing of George Floyd and police violence.  A video clip shows another suspect, Brandon Caserta, standing in front of an anarchist flag saying Trump is a ""tyrant.""  Cooter, who recently dug into this issue on Twitter, told us she’s seen ""zero evidence that (the suspects) are antifa."" She speculated that some people are conflating anarchy and antifa to try to divert attention away from the suspects’ militia connections.  But anarchy is more closely related to the Boogaloo movement — an extremist effort aimed at overthrowing the government — than antifa, she said. Antifa activists tend to include communists, socialists and anarchists who protest against white supremacy and other far-right causes. Experts say that while they sometimes turn violent, the bulk of antifa organizing is nonviolent. Many militia members are opposed to racism, Cooter said, and they expressed genuine outrage over the death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis in May after a police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck. But she said their support for Black Lives Matter protests are rooted in ""notions of anti-governmentalism, a more right-wing concept."" JJ MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has also tweeted about the case. She criticized ""Right-wing Facebook"" for ""trying to reframe the Michigan militia kidnaping plot as a left-wing extremist conspiracy."" More recently, she described the defendants as ""a mix of Boogaloos and militants."" The Facebook post claims that the suspects in the kidnapping plot are ""ANTIFA and BLM anarchists."" We haven’t found anything to support the claim that the suspects are antifa activists. We looked for news coverage, court documents or expert opinion that could corroborate that and came up empty.  At least one of the suspects attended a Black Lives Matter protest. But to paint the group as a whole as antifa and BLM activists is disingenuous, and discounts the vast reporting from the media and state and federal officials on the militia and anti-government ties of the men arrested.  We rate this post Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/oct/21/viral-image/looking-ideologies-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-suspect/

Yes, you can vote with an expired photo ID, with one caveat
","Can you vote in Wisconsin using an expired photo ID? That was the claim from U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, speaking at a virtual get-out-the-vote rally with Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and other Wisconsin politicians. Urging people to head to the polls, Moore said in the Oct. 20, 2020 call that voters can use an ID ""even if that ID is expired or you’ve moved."" Anyone voting in person Nov. 3 will have to show a photo ID in Wisconsin. Typically voters use a driver’s license, state-issued identification card, military ID or passport. Some kinds of school IDs are also allowed, but employee IDs or membership IDs are not, according to the Wisconsin Election Commission. With Election Day fast approaching, let’s see what the commission says about Moore’s address and expiration claims. Photo IDs can indeed be expired, but with a key caveat. The commission says expired IDs are allowed as long as they were valid as of the last general election — that is, Nov. 6, 2018. An ID that expired before that date would not be acceptable to vote. On the address side, we again have a largely accurate claim with one caveat. Here’s what the commission says: ""An acceptable Photo ID for voting does not have to include a current address. You only prove your address when registering."" So previously registered voters only need to worry about whether the ID is active, and didn’t expire before November 2018 — not the address. But voters who haven’t yet registered need to provide documentation with a current address as proof of residence. That could be the same as the ID card — using a state driver’s license or ID card — or a separate document such as a real estate tax bill, utility bill, bank statement or paycheck. Moore said you can vote in Wisconsin with an ID ""even if that ID is expired or you’ve moved."" There’s a caveat for both halves of that claim. The ID can be expired, but for the Nov. 3 election it can’t have expired before Nov. 6, 2018. And it’s OK if the address is wrong, as long as the voter is already registered or provides some other document as proof of residence. So this statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That’s our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/oct/21/gwen-moore/yes-you-can-vote-expired-photo-id-one-caveat/

Dr. Anthony Fauci didn’t blame masks for 1918-19 flu deaths
","In an attempt to cast masks as more harmful than helpful, posts online are pointing to research on the 1918 influenza pandemic. They claim that masks inadvertently caused the majority of the deaths, and that the government’s leading epidemiologist, Dr. Anthony Fauci — who has urged mask wearing to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus — was the one who wrote about the link.  The post features a screenshot of a tweet that says, ""The unmasked buried the masked in the ‘Spanish flu.’ What did the people in #masks die from? Bacterial pneumonia. Who knew this and wrote about it in 2008? Dr. Anthony Fauci."" A caption from one user who shared the post on Facebook reads, ""Dr Fauci wrote a paper regarding the Spanish Flu and stated that the majority of deaths in 1918-1919 was because of bacterial pneumonia from wearing masks."" This is wrong. The report makes no mention of masks. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  A 2008 study, co-authored by Fauci, found that most of the deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic were not caused by the virus acting alone, but came when victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following infection. Researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci heads, published their report in October 2008 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. ""The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs,"" a summary of the report said. ""In essence"" Fauci is quoted in the report as saying, ""the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch."" The report doesn’t blame masks. And yet, opponents of masks, who have circulated false claims that link them to bacterial or fungal infections, interpreted the study to mean that long-term mask wearing caused the deadly pneumonias. That is not the case. Secondary bacterial pneumonias have long been associated with severe influenza in human and animal studies. Experts told us that historians and other researchers have assumed for decades that a significant portion of the 1918-19 pandemic deaths were due to secondary bacterial pneumonia infections, and more recent studies have supported this thesis. In fact, when discussing the 1918-19 pandemic death toll, researchers have consistently used the term ""P&I deaths,"" that is, deaths attributed to both pneumonia and influenza.  J. Alexander Navarro, assistant director at the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and co-editor in chief of the ""American Influenza Epidemic of 1918-1919"" digital encyclopedia, called the claim that masks caused bacterial pneumonia ""absolutely preposterous."" ""They don’t, and no infectious disease expert of Dr. Fauci’s caliber would ever claim that,"" Navarro told PolitiFact. ""If masks did cause pneumonia, we’d see major pneumonia cases developing in clinicians who wear masks for long periods of the day, or even in tradespeople and others who work in dusty conditions and who routinely wear respirators to help prevent dust particles from entering their respiratory tracts. Mask wearing is routine in many Asian countries, even before the COVID pandemic, and there are no widespread pneumonia outbreaks as a result.""  Posts online claim Fauci wrote a 2008 study blaming the majority of deaths in the 1918-19 influenza pandemic on bacterial pneumonia from wearing masks. Fauci never wrote that. In the paper he co-authored, researchers found that secondary bacterial pneumonia caused a majority of deaths in the pandemic. This is a well-documented side effect of severe influenza infections, and has nothing to do with masks.

Fact-checking claims about charities linked to Hunter Biden and the Trump children
","A popular liberal Facebook page is pushing back against attacks on Hunter Biden with uncharitable claims about the children of President Donald Trump. ""Hunter Biden was chairman of the World Food Program, which just won the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Left Action said in an Oct. 20 post. ""Eric Trump, Donald J Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump are banned from ever operating a charity again because they stole donations to children with cancer."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s been shared more than 5,200 times. Left Action is a popular Facebook page that’s part of a series of online liberal advocacy properties called the Left Action Network. We reached out to the page for evidence to back up its post, but we haven’t heard back. We’ve previously fact-checked claims about the Trump children being disallowed from operating charities, but we wanted to take a fresh look at the facts. The Facebook post is wrong to say that the Trump children aren’t allowed to operate charities, and it paints a misleading picture of Hunter Biden’s connection to a nonprofit that fights global hunger. (Screenshot from Facebook) World Food Program USA is a 501(c)(3) charity based in Washington, D.C. Its mission is to support the World Food Programme, a United Nations-affiliated humanitarian organization that delivers food assistance in dozens of countries around the world. The World Food Programme won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize — not World Food Program USA. While the two organizations share a common mission, and the U.S. group frequently donates to the international one, they are separate entities, as evidenced by public tax records. Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, was on the World Food Program USA board of directors from 2011 to 2017 and served as chairman from 2011 to 2015, according to the nonprofit’s annual reports. Randy Russell is the current chairman. So Hunter Biden is not a former chairman of a Nobel Prize-winning humanitarian organization, as the Facebook post claims. But what about the Trump children? We reached out to the White House and Trump’s re-election campaign for more information. A spokesperson for the campaign pointed to an October 2019 PolitiFact fact-check about a Facebook post that claimed the Trumps were ""disallowed from operating any charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity."" We rated that claim False. Left Action’s recent Facebook post is also misleading. In June 2018, the New York attorney general filed a lawsuit against the president and three of his children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump. The Donald J. Trump Foundation, whose board the Trump children served on, was also named in the lawsuit. The suit claimed that for more than a decade, the foundation violated state and federal laws related to charities in New York state. As a result, it sought to dissolve the foundation and to temporarily prohibit the Trumps from future service as officers or directors in New York charitable organizations. In November 2019, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced a settlement under which the state Supreme Court ordered the president to pay $2 million ""for improperly using charitable assets to intervene in the 2016 presidential primaries and further his own political interests."" The settlement also required training for the three Trump children and imposed restrictions on the president if and when he joined another charity as director. RELATED: Trump family ‘disallowed’ from operating charities in New York? No. The lawsuit had nothing to do with a charity for children with cancer, as the Facebook post claims. Forbes reported in June 2017 that Eric Trump’s own foundation gave donors the impression that all the money it raised at an annual golf event went to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, when in reality more than $500,000 went to other causes. Eric Trump resigned from the foundation in December 2016. That scrutiny was separate from the New York attorney general’s lawsuit against Donald J. Trump Foundation, which agreed to dissolve in 2018. And Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump can still operate charities under the terms of the settlement. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2020/oct/21/left-action/fact-checking-claims-about-charities-linked-hunter/

No, viral photo doesn’t show Biden next to a man seen in a sex sting video
","A two-part Facebook post wrongly attempts to connect Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden with a man captured in a video purportedly trying to solicit sex from a minor.  The post shared thousands of times includes both a photo and a video. The photo depicts Biden facing a young girl with his hands on her lower arms. A red arrow points to a man in the background and identifies him as Matt Trowbridge, a former Democratic candidate for the Massachusetts State House of Representatives.  The video shows what appears to be an amateur ""sting"" operation of a man trying to solicit sex from a young boy. The post implies the man in the video is the same man in the photo with Biden. ""So Joe Biden, why’s this guy on your team?"" the caption reads.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because it’s wrong. The man in the photo near Biden isn’t Matt Trowbridge, but a man named Jared Maher, whose then 11-year-old daughter sang at a 2018 event in Grand Forks, N.D., where Biden was a keynote speaker.  Reached by phone, Maher confirmed he was the man in the photo and directed us to a written statement he sent to the Duluth News Tribune about the distress the image’s use on social media has caused his family:  ""We are processing it as a family, attorneys are involved and the fact that the picture involved our then-11-year-old daughter has us very upset,"" it reads.  The photo was taken after the 2018 North Dakota Democratic-NPL convention, where Maher’s daughter sang a mash-up of ""Danny Boy"" and ""America the Beautiful,"" according to the Duluth News Tribune. After the event, Biden met Maher and thanked his daughter for the performance. The video in the Facebook post was uploaded to YouTube on Oct. 2 by a vigilante group called Predator Poachers Massachusetts, which runs sting operations on sexual predators. The group claims the footage shows a man attempting to solicit sex from a minor. In the video, the group identifies the man as Matt Trowbridge. Despite the video, we found no evidence that a Matt Trowbridge in Massachusetts has been charged. We could not reach him to talk about the claim. But we searched news archives and local news and found no coverage of such an event. Police in Charlton, Mass., where public records indicate Trowbridge has lived, told us that they don’t have a file on anybody by that name. An official with Dudley District Court, which services Charlton, told us that they don’t have records of a criminal or civil case involving anyone by that name.  Because a commenter on the YouTube video suggested Trowbridge lives in Norton, Mass., we contacted police there, who told us they have no record of a charge or arrest. An analysis from Storyful, a social media research firm, found that the Predator Poachers video was picked up by right-wing websites, some of which have spread disinformation in the past.  One of these sites references a 2009 article in the Sun Chronicle, a daily newspaper in Attleboro, Mass., about Trowbridge, who said he planned to run against state Rep. Betty Poirier in 2010. But he dropped out in April 2010 citing personal issues, according to the Sun Chronicle, and we found no record of him running for office since. State elections information shows Poirier ran uncontested in the general election that year. Given that more than a decade has passed since the photograph in the Sun Chronicle was taken, Storyful couldn’t confirm whether Trowbridge and the man in the video are the same person.  There is also no evidence that Trowbridge is affiliated with the Biden campaign.  A Facebook post claims to show Biden standing next to a man who it says is shown in a video attempting to solicit sex from a minor. That’s wrong. The man in the photo is the father of a young girl who sang at a political event in 2018.  The video in the post was uploaded by a YouTube account that claims to catch people as they try to solicit underage sex. While the video identifies the man as a former candidate for state office in Massachusetts, we find no conclusive evidence to support that claim.  We rate this Pants on Fire!

Email threat to Florida Democrats falsely says 'we will know which candidate you voted for'
","Update, Oct. 22: In an evening press briefing on Oct. 21, U.S. intelligence officials announced they believed Iran was behind the email threats that were spoofed to appear from a Proud Boys account. Read more about their announcement and what questions remain in this story. Threatening emails sent to multiple Florida Democrats falsely says that the sender will find out if the voters don’t cast ballots for President Donald Trump. Law enforcement officials in Alachua County, a Democratic-leaning county and home to the University of Florida, say the email is ""purported to be from the Proud Boys,"" a far-right male-only group with a history of violent confrontations. However, who actually sent the email is under investigation by local and federal law enforcement. While it’s not yet clear who sent the emails, what is clear is that it contains false information. The email message states that the writer is in possession of the voter’s information including email and address and telephone number. Then it states: ""You are currently registered as a Democrat and we know this because we have gained access to the entire voting infrastructure. You will vote for Trump on election day or we will come after you. Change your party affiliation to Republican to let us know you received our message and will comply. We will know which candidate you voted for. I would take this seriously if I were you."" A voter’s registration information, including their name and address, are typically a public record, said David J. Becker, executive director for the Center for Election Innovation & Research. However, the actual ballot itself showing if the voter chose Trump or Joe Biden or someone else is private, Becker and election officials say. ""Nobody can know who somebody else voted for,"" said Gerri Kramer, a spokesperson for the elections office in Tampa’s Hillsborough County.  ""In no state is the record of how an individual voted on their ballot public,"" Becker said. ""In fact, ballots are stored in such a way and separated from all identifying information, that (it) would be impossible to identify how someone voted."" The email further claims that the recipients should change their voter registration. But a voter’s party affiliation doesn’t matter for the Nov. 3 general election. Whether a voter is a registered Democrat, Republican or with another party or no affiliation at all, each voter can decide whether to cast a ballot for any presidential candidate. The elections office in Alachua County received dozens of complaints starting on Oct. 20 from Democrats who said they received the email, said elections spokesperson TJ Pyche. Steve Orlando, a spokesperson for the University of Florida, said 183 students, staff or alumni also received the emails. The Alachua County sheriff’s office said on Facebook that the email appears to be a scam. Sgt. Frank Kinsey, a spokesperson for the sheriff, told PolitiFact that the email was sent from [email protected] address. Nothing else in the email mentioned the Proud Boys. Kinsey said that law enforcement will investigate the origin of the email. He pointed to a digital forensics investigation by CBS as an example of what law enforcement will do. CBS wrote that a review of the source code shows the message originated from IP addresses linked to servers located in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Estonia.  CBS interviewed Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and former chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. He told CBS that the IP addresses don't establish that the senders are based in those countries, since the messages could have been routed through the servers from nearly anywhere. The officialproudboys.com internet address was offline Tuesday. CBS reported that domain records show the site's owner initiated a domain transfer to a new web host on Monday.  News reports and interviews by PolitiFact show that voters in at least a few other counties in Florida received the email. On Florida’s east coast, Brevard County Supervisor of Elections Lori Scott told PolitiFact that a small number of Democratic voters in her county have received emails.  ""Although Florida’s very open public record laws have prompted the personal information of these voters to be used in this fashion, no one can find out how they voted,"" Scott said. ""There isn’t anything on a ballot that identifies or links it back to the voter."" A spokesperson for the Collier County Supervisor of Elections, a Republican-leaning county in southwest Florida, told PolitiFact that the office is aware of multiple instances of voter intimidation via email. The Charlotte County Supervisor of Elections, Paul A. Stamoulis, told PolitiFact that the matter was reported to local and federal law enforcement.  Fresh Take Florida, a news service operated by the University of Florida, reported that Democrats in nearby Clay County also reported receiving the emails.  Fresh Take Florida reported that Enrique Tarrio, chairman of the Proud Boys, said his group didn’t send the emails. ""We don’t do mass emails,"" Tarrio said. ""This is definitely, definitely not us."" Tarrio told the Washington Post that his group was moving away from the domain name used in the emails. Tarrio told the Post that he had already spoken to the FBI about it. We asked the FBI if the emails had been sent to other states as well and didn’t get a response. However, Alaska Public Media reported that the same emails were sent to voters in their state. Alaska is typically not considered competitive in the presidential race, though it is more so this year and the state has a competitive race for U.S. Senate. Gail Fenumiai, elections director for Alaska, told PolitiFact that it was aware of the emails. An email says ""we will know which candidate you voted for."" While information on a Floridian’s voter registration, such as their party affiliation and name, is a public record, their actual ballot is private. That means that the authors of the email will not know whether the voters cast ballots for Trump or Biden. We can’t say for certain who wrote the emails, which are under investigation. But the statement that the author can find out who the voter cast a ballot for is wrong.

Trump says he prevented 2 million COVID-19 deaths. Where does he get that number?
","President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed to have saved 2 million lives from COVID-19 through his actions to combat the disease. He made the assertion again during the NBC News town hall on Oct. 15 that replaced the second presidential debate. ""But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who are respected by everybody, 2,200,000 people,"" Trump said. ""We saved 2 million people,"" he added. He mentioned the same ballpark figure during a Sept. 15 ABC News town hall and posted a tweet about it on Oct. 13. Others in the Trump administration have also pointed to the 2.2 million figure. Vice President Mike Pence referenced it during the vice presidential debate on Oct. 7. So did Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar during a Sept. 20 ""Meet the Press"" television interview. Where did this number come from? And is there any truth to the idea that Trump is responsible for saving 2 million lives from COVID-19? Since Trump continues to use it to claim success, we decided to look into it. The White House and the Trump presidential campaign did not respond to our request for evidence supporting the idea that roughly 2 million lives were spared because of the administration's actions. The figure appears to have been mentioned by the president first during a March 29 White House coronavirus task force press briefing, when Trump and Dr. Deborah Birx, task force coordinator, explained they were asking Americans to stay home from mid-March through the end of April, because mathematical models showed 1.6 million to 2.2 million people could die from COVID-19.  The warning stemmed from a paper authored by Neil Ferguson, an epidemiology professor at Imperial College London. He modeled how COVID-19 can spread through a population in different scenarios, including what would happen if no interventions were put in place and people continued to live their daily lives as normal. In the paper, Ferguson wrote, ""In total, in an unmitigated epidemic, we would predict approximately 510,000 deaths in [Great Britain] and 2.2 million in the US."" Ferguson did not respond to our request to talk through the study with him. But in a July email interview with HuffPost, he said Trump’s boast of having saved 2 million lives isn’t true, because the pandemic isn’t over. Andrea Bertozzi, a mathematics professor at UCLA, said it was important to remember the 2.2 million figure was derived from a modeling scenario that would almost certainly never happen — which is that neither the government nor individuals would change their behavior at all in light of COVID-19. The study didn’t mean to say 2.2 million people were absolutely going to die, but rather to say, ""Hold on, if we let this thing run its course, bad things could happen,"" said Bertozzi. Indeed, the results from the study did cause government leaders in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom to implement social distancing measures. Experts also pointed out that the U.S. has the highest COVID-19 death toll of any country in the world — more than 220,000 people — and among the highest death rates, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. ""I don’t think we can say we’ve prevented 2 million deaths, because people are still dying,"" said Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In some instances when using the 2 million estimate, Trump and others in his administration cited the China travel restrictions for saving lives, while other times they’ve credited locking down the economy. We’ll explore whether either statement holds water. Trump implemented travel restrictions for some people traveling from China beginning Feb. 2 and from Europe on March 11. But experts say and reports show the restrictions don’t appear to have had much effect because they were put in place too late and had too many holes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first cases of coronavirus in the U.S. arrived in mid-January. So, since the travel bans were put in place after COVID-19 was already spreading in the U.S., they weren’t effective, said Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the KFF. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.) A May study supports that assessment. The researchers found the risk of transmission from domestic air travel exceeded that of international travel in mid-March. Many individuals also still traveled into the U.S. after the bans, according to separate investigations by The New York Times and the Associated Press. Based on all this, experts said there isn’t evidence to support the idea that the travel restrictions were the principal intervention to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. On the other hand, the public health experts we talked to said multiple global and U.S.-focused studies show that lockdowns and implementing social distancing measures helped to contain the spread of the coronavirus and thus can be said to have prevented deaths. However, Trump can’t take full credit for these so-called lockdown measures, which ranged from closing down all but essential businesses to implementing citywide curfews and statewide stay-at-home orders. On March 16, after being presented with the possibility of the national death tally rising to 2.2. million, the White House issued federal recommendations to limit activities that could transmit the COVID-19 virus. But these were just guidelines and were recommended to be in effect only through April 30. Most credit for putting in place robust social distancing measures belongs to state and local government and public health officials, many of whom enacted stronger policies than those recommended by the White House, our experts said. ""I don’t think you can directly credit the federal government or the Trump administration with the shutdown orders,"" said Lessler. ""The way our system works is that the power for public health policy lies with the state. And each state was making its own individual decision."" Some studies also explore the potential human costs of missed opportunities. If lockdowns had been implemented one or two weeks earlier than mid-March, for instance, which is when most of the U.S. started shutting down, researchers estimated that tens of thousands of American lives could have been saved. A model also shows that if almost everyone wore a mask in the U.S., tens of thousands of deaths from COVID-19 could have been prevented.   Despite these scientific findings, Trump started encouraging states — even those with high transmission rates — to open back up in May, after the White House’s recommendations to slow the spread of COVID-19 expired. He has also questioned the efficacy of masks, said he wouldn’t issue a national mask mandate and instead left mask mandate decisions up to states and local jurisdictions.  President Trump is claiming that if not for his efforts, there would have been 2 million more deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19. But that 2 million number is taken from a model that shows what would happen without any mitigation measures — that is, if citizens had continued their daily lives as usual, and governments did nothing. Experts said that wouldn’t have happened in real life. And while lockdowns and social distancing have indeed been proven to prevent COVID-19 illness and deaths, credit for that doesn’t go solely to Trump. The White House issued federal recommendations asking Americans to stay home, but much stronger social distancing measures were enforced by states. Travel restrictions implemented by Trump perhaps helped hold down transmission in the context of broader efforts, but on their own, they don’t seem to have significantly reduced the transmission rate of the coronavirus.

No, the boilermakers union didn't endorse Joe Biden
","When asked to prove his support for fracking is genuine, Joe Biden said last week that he’d won the backing of the boilermakers, a union whose members depend on the natural gas industry and passionately support the controversial drilling technique.  ""The boilermakers union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went into great detail with leadership [about] exactly what I would do,"" Biden said Thursday in Philadelphia during a nationally televised ABC News town hall.  That’s not true.  Biden hasn’t been endorsed by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers — which represents 50,000 people across the country who work in heavy industry, manufacturing, and related sectors — or Local 154, the Pittsburgh-area chapter mentioned at the event.  The international union states clearly on its website that it hasn’t endorsed a candidate for president this cycle.  ""The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers has not endorsed any U.S. Presidential candidate for the 2020 Election, and the information contained on this webpage in no way serves as an endorsement by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers for any U.S. Presidential candidate."" A note on the website continues: ""As a union boilermaker, your vote is a personal decision. You have the right to vote for candidates and issues as you so choose. Your vote can make a difference in electing the representatives and policymakers who support labor issues and advocate for the work boilermakers do."" Local union lodges aren’t bound by what the larger umbrella group does, and in September, Local 154 endorsed President Donald Trump.  ""The other day I'm watching the debate and I see Joe Biden tell everybody that the boilermakers endorsed him and that is not true,"" said John Hughes, Local 154’s business manager. ""He said he talked to somebody. I'd like to know who he talked to in the boilermakers because anybody I talk to did not endorse him."" Asked for evidence that Biden spoke with members of the boilermakers union, Andrew Bates, the Biden campaign’s director of rapid response, provided none. Instead he listed several other Pennsylvania unions Biden met with and won endorsements from while campaigning, such as Teamsters Local 249, United Association of Plumbers Local 27, and Pennsylvania AFL-CIO.  Bates added that the boilermakers ""endorsed Joe Biden twice.""  He’s talking about the 2008 and 2012 election cycles, when the union endorsed President Barack Obama, and Joe Biden was his running mate.  But an Obama endorsement doesn’t automatically count as a Biden nod.  The Democratic nominating contest was still in full swing in February 2008 when the boilermakers union threw its support behind Obama. Not only had Obama not yet named Biden as his running mate, but Biden was still seeking the nomination himself and had been passed over for the endorsement.  The endorsement the boilermakers made in 2012 when Obama was running for reelection could more plausibly be described as support for an Obama-Biden ticket. The boilermakers union came up at the town hall when Pittsburgh resident Michele Ellison asked Biden to describe his vision for the energy sector in Southwestern Pennsylvania, where fracking has lifted the economy and employed plenty of boilermakers but also sickened some residents who live near the wells that extract natural gas from miles beneath the Earth’s surface.  Before answering the question, Biden emphasized, as he has said repeatedly, that he does not want to ban fracking. He wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public land but would otherwise allow existing fracking operations to continue, with environmental safeguards in place. He went on to say that he wants to invest in renewable energy and the battery technology needed to store it.  Biden said ""the boilermakers union has endorsed me."" There are several things wrong with this statement.  First, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers hasn’t endorsed a candidate for president this cycle.  Second, Local 154, the Pittsburgh area chapter mentioned during the town hall, endorsed Trump.  Third, the boilermakers did not endorse Biden twice in the past as his campaign said.  And fourth, the Biden campaign provided no evidence that he ""sat down"" with the union’s leaders as he said.  Biden’s statement is not accurate.

Fact-checking false claims about debate moderator Kristen Welker of NBC
","As she prepares to moderate the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker faces unfounded accusations on social media that claim she’s biased toward Democrats. Welker has not donated thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates, registered as a Democrat or ""spent Christmas"" at the White House with President Barack Obama, despite what an Oct. 17 Facebook post claims. ""Kristen Welker, of NBC, the next debate moderator chosen by the ‘unbiased’ presidential commission, gave thousands of dollars to Obama, Clinton and Biden, is registered as a Democrat (and) her family spent Christmas with the Obamas at the White House,"" the post, featuring photos of Welker and her family, says. ""Her mother is an activist for Biden!"" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  President Donald Trump has leveled similar complaints alleging bias, tweeting that Welker has ""always been terrible & unfair"" and calling her a ""dyed-in-the-wool, radical-left Democrat."" In January, Trump congratulated Welker for landing a weekend anchor position with NBC. The Facebook post’s claims appear to have derived from an Oct. 17 report from the New York Post. The article said Welker’s parents have donated to Democrats and suggested that a photo of Welker at a White House holiday reception in 2012 was evidence of partisan bias. Federal Election Commission records don't show any donations to political candidates from Welker, let alone ""thousands of dollars"" to Obama, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and Bill or Hillary Clinton. An NBC News spokesperson confirmed that she hasn’t donated. Welker isn’t registered to vote as a Democrat, either. According to the District of Columbia Board of Elections, Welker has been registered in Washington, D.C., with no party affiliation since 2016. She had previously registered as a Democrat in 2012, the board’s records show.  The New York Post wrote that she was also registered as a Democrat in Rhode Island in 2004.  Welker’s parents have given money to Democratic candidates, including Biden, according to the Federal Election Commission's records. But Welker’s mother, Julie Welker, told PolitiFact that she does not have a role with the Biden campaign. ""I am in no way an activist for Joe Biden,"" she said. ""I am busy with my full-time job."" The Facebook post’s claim that Welker and her family ""spent Christmas with the Obamas at the White House"" is also inaccurate, as scores of journalists and pundits pointed out on Twitter. The claim is rooted in a photo Welker uploaded to Facebook on Dec. 13, 2012. The photo shows Welker and a man the New York Post identified as ""family"" posing for a picture in a room full of Christmas decorations with Barack and Michelle Obama.  The photo was snapped at a White House holiday press party attended by the White House press corps, the NBC News spokesperson said. Welker attended a similar reception hosted by Trump in 2017. Trump canceled the gathering in 2018. Generations of media members have attended such events, which predate Obama by decades and often include lines for photos. Similar photos show the Obamas with conservatives, including media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who owns the New York Post. Steven Thomma, executive director of the White House Correspondents Association, an organization of journalists who cover the White House, said he’s attended most of the White House’s holiday receptions for the press since 1993, when Bill Clinton was president. Invitees are typically allowed to bring one guest, Thomma said, and the White House has often split the press between one reception primarily for TV and another for print and wire services. ""Guests are asked to go to the ground level, where they wait in line for a quick photo with the president and first lady,"" Thomma said in an email to PolitiFact. ""Staff is very strict about limiting time spent on small talk to less than 1-2 minutes, to keep the line moving.""  ""The photo is taken by the White House photographer, and sent to every guest several days later,"" Thomma said. ""Guests commonly post them on Facebook and other social media."" A Facebook post says Welker ""gave thousands of dollars to Obama, Clinton and Biden, is registered as a Democrat & her family spent Christmas with the Obamas at the White House."" The claims in the post are wrong or exaggerated.  First, FEC records don’t show any political contributions from Welker. Second, Welker is registered to vote in Washington, D.C., with no party affiliation.  Third, Welker did not take her family to spend Christmas with the Obamas. She posed for a photo at a White House reception hosted for the press in 2012.

Fact-checking a claim about when your mail ballot is due
","The United States is expected to break records for voting by mail this year and that’s creating a deluge of claims on social media about deadlines. Some are accurate, some are not. ""15 days left to vote BUT if you are voting by mail, you need to vote TODAY,"" reads one popular Instagram post. ""USPS says it needs a 14 day roundtrip to be counted on election day."" reads. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)   The post is a screenshot of an Oct. 19 tweet by singer-songwriter Finneas Baird O'Connell, brother of singer Billie Eilish. Finneas’ Twitter profile photo is of the Biden/Harris campaign logo, but he has no official role with the campaign. The post wrongly creates the impression that there is a national deadline to vote by mail. It’s also a confusing message: the first sentence says voters must send it mail ballots 15 days ahead of time while the second sentence says the post office needs a 14-day roundtrip, suggesting that a voter can mail it in seven days ahead of time. Here’s what you should know: The Postal Service did recommend in a national postcard in September that voters request the mail-in ballot at least 15 days before Election Day, Nov. 3, and return it at least seven days before Election Day. But this Instagram post omits the fact that states set their own laws about deadlines for receiving mail ballots. What’s more, many states have options for voters to bypass the mail to return their ballots in an official ballot drop box or drop off site. Since the deadlines to return mail ballots vary by state, the best advice for voters is to check in with their local elections officials for information about when they must return their ballot, and their options for how to return it. RELATED: Fact-checking the controversy over the USPS voting mailer Also, some states are automatically sending ballots to voters and therefore they don’t have to request them. A spokesperson for the post office reiterated their previous advice, but also encouraged voters to check their state’s requirements.  An Instagram post states ""15 days left to vote BUT if you are voting by mail, you need to vote TODAY. USPS says it needs a 14 day roundtrip to be counted on election day."" The post is unclear and omits important context. USPS said in a postcard in September that voters who want to have their ballots counted in the Nov. 3 general election should request the mail-in ballot at least 15 days before Election Day and return it at least seven days before Election Day. But states set deadlines for receiving mail ballots, and many jurisdictions allow voters to bypass the mail and return ballots in official ballot drop boxes or drop off sites. It’s a good idea to return a ballot as soon as you can, but if you want to know the actual deadline for your state, check in with your state or local elections office. If you want to find out if your city or county has a place where you can drop it off, check in with your local elections office which typically posts that information on their website.

4chan users spread false information about Oregon’s election website
","A thread on a fringe internet forum falsely says that anyone with basic biographical information about an Oregon voter can go on the state elections’ website and change the way that person voted. One claim in a YouTube video states that ""4chan just changed Portland Or. Mayor Ted Wheeler’s vote to Donald Trump using the voter registration exploit."" Wheeler is a Democrat and has clashed with Trump, so the idea that he would cast a ballot for Trump seems ludicrous. A spokesperson for Wheeler said that he hadn’t voted yet. Similar claims were flagged by CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. A thread on 4chan featured users claiming, with screenshots, that they could go in and change people’s votes by using names and addresses. This quickly went viral on social media platforms, despite debunking on Twitter and Reddit. 4chan is a forum that allows anyone to post anonymously. It is a known source of online disinformation, hate speech and conspiracy theories. State and local elections officials in Oregon told us that people can’t go on to the state website and change voters’ ballots. ""No votes can be cast or cancelled online through MyVote,"" said Andrea Chiapella, spokesperson for the Oregon Secretary of State. Oregon is a long-time vote by mail state. Military and overseas voters  as well as voters with disabilities can download their ballot, but there are protections in place to prevent someone from casting a ballot on behalf of another voter. The misinformation on social media centers around the ""mark my ballot"" field on the state elections website.  ""The mark my ballot tool helps voters with disabilities and military and overseas voters to mark their ballot,"" Chiapella said. ""They still must return the ballot with the proper identifying information, including their signature, which will be compared against the voter’s signature in the voter registration file before being accepted to count."" We tested out the ""mark my ballot"" tool by entering the name and date of birth of Oregon Secretary of State Bev Clarno. The website showed that Clarno was sent a ballot on Oct. 14 in Deschutes County. Then we clicked on the ""mark my ballot"" option and the top of the page said ""only for use by military, overseas and voters with disabilities.""  The online form then allows a voter to mark their selections by clicking on boxes next to the names of candidates they choose. Afterward, the voter can review her ballot, showing only the selections she made. The instructions state that the voter has to then print the page and return it to their county election office.  While we could theoretically fill out the form online, that doesn’t mean we could actually submit it (and we didn’t try). In fact, that would be a crime, and there are protections in place to prevent that from happening.  Altering someone’s voter registration or attempting to vote another person’s ballot are both crimes in Oregon. It is a felony punishable with up to 5 years in prison and a $125,000 fine, Chiapella said.  The voters still must return the ballot with the proper identifying information, including their signature, which will be compared against their signature in the voter registration file before being accepted. If someone attempted to sign the ballot on behalf of another voter, ""odds are pretty thin they would know what the voter’s signature looks like"" and not returning it in the appropriate envelope would also flag that ballot, said Nancy Blankenship, county clerk for Deschutes County. Voters who are in the military or overseas can mail back their completed ballots in the return identification envelopes that are provided. If they choose to return their ballots by fax or email, there is an additional secret ballot waiver form they must submit.  Disabled voters enclose their ballots in provided secrecy envelopes and then place them in the return identification envelopes, which they must sign before they put it in the mail or a ballot drop box. Zane Sparling, a reporter for the Portland Tribune, tweeted that ""simply clicking these buttons does not create a vote. The form must be submitted by fax or email, and the form does not work unless you have been granted absentee ballot status by an elections official."" RELATED: How to make sure your ballot is counted this fall A thread on 4chan said if you know someone's name and date of birth you can change their votes on Oregon’s voting website. The state elections website does not allow voters to cast ballots online. If you can’t vote online, you certainly can’t change someone’s vote online. Military and overseas voters  as well as voters with disabilities can download their ballot online, but they must return the ballot with the proper identifying information, including their signature. Their signature will be compared against their signature in the voter registration file before being accepted.

Fact-checking unproven claims about Hunter Biden and child pornography
","Two weeks until Election Day, social media is rife with attacks on Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden.  A New York Post story about a recovered computer hard drive led to attacks about the Biden son’s business dealings. Facebook and cable news have gone further to suggest new and unsupported theories about what’s on the hard drive. One text post says, ""Hunter Biden had 25,000 pics of him torturing and raping children under age 10 in China on his laptop!""  Claims like this were amplified by websites like Natural News and InfoWars. Facebook has long banned the sites for posting anti-vaccine misinformation and hate speech, but we found one InfoWars video on Facebook with more than 173,000 views. It claims Trump ""has footage of Hunter Biden raping and torturing little girls."" These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar posts have been shared tens of thousands of times, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.  We can’t say for certain what is or isn’t on a hard drive. But there is no evidence to support allegations that it contains thousands of images of Hunter Biden abusing children in China. (Screenshot from Facebook) The unproven claim has roots on a fringe internet forum that’s a known source of online disinformation, 4chan. On Oct. 15, Chanel Rion, the chief White House correspondent for One America News Network — a pro-Trump cable TV network — tweeted that she had seen the contents of the hard drive at the center of the New York Post story. ""Drugs, underage obsessions, power deals,"" she said in the post. ""Druggie Hunter makes Anthony Weiner's down under selfie addiction look normal."" The tweet, which was shared more than 53,000 times, then made its way to 4chan, where users anonymously speculated that it meant the FBI was investigating Hunter Biden. One user posing as Rion affirmed that speculation, saying the hard drive contained child pornography. The real Rion tweeted Oct. 16 that she did not write the posts.  ""For the record: I do not post on chat forums,"" she wrote. ""I understand there are hoaxers posing as me."" But it was too late. Social media users dedicated to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that claims Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic, left-leaning pedophiles, took the 4chan posts as evidence that the FBI was investigating Hunter Biden for potentially possessing child pornography.  By Sunday, the conspiracy theory had made its way to Fox News. ""Sunday Morning Futures"" host Maria Bartiromo noted that a name written on the back of a federal subpoena included in the Post’s story appears to belong to Joshua Wilson, an FBI agent who has worked on child pornography cases.  ""Connect the dots: If an FBI agent is working on child pornography issues for five years, why is he subpoenaing the laptop of Hunter Biden? Is there a connection here?"" Bartiromo asked Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. Johnson did not give a direct answer. ""Well, I think you just made the connection,"" he said. ""Again, this is what the FBI, I think, has to come clean about."" Later that day, a tweet from Wayne Allyn Root, a conservative radio host who has pushed false claims about former President Barack Obama’s birthplace and the identity of the 2017 Las Vegas shooter, claimed to have breaking news. ""My sources-as high up as it gets- watched videos on Hunter’s laptops TODAY. Just told me point blank...no rumor...they saw Hunter raping & torturing little Chinese children,"" he tweeted. When asked in an email for evidence to support his claims aside from anonymous sources, Root did not provide any. There’s a lot we still don’t know about the hard drive at the center of the New York Post coverage.  The story about Joe Biden and a Ukraine meeting relies on information from a computer hard drive that the tabloid said it received from Trump’s personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. The computer was supposedly left unclaimed at a Delaware computer shop, the owner of which called the FBI and a Giuliani associate after noticing a sticker for the Beau Biden Foundation on the laptop. The emails cited in the Post’s article, which we are not able to verify, do not establish that a meeting between the elder Biden and a Ukrainian businessman ever occurred.  Nowhere in the Post’s story is Hunter Biden linked to child pornography. We reached out to the FBI for more information, but it declined to comment due to its practice of ""neither confirming nor denying the existence of an investigation."" RELATED: Looking at claims about Hunter Biden, and the Senate GOP report that helped fuel them Remember these points as you see claims about the laptop and stories around it. It's unclear if the name on the back of the subpoena actually belongs to Joshua Wilson, or if there’s more than one FBI agent who goes by that name. It’s also unconfirmed if the subpoena in the Post’s story was for the laptop. Federal investigators are looking into whether emails found on the laptop could be linked to a foreign intelligence operation to discredit Joe Biden. (More than 50 former intelligence officials told Politico they appear to be. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe says they’re not.) Staffers at the Post expressed concerns about the story’s credibility before it was published. Fox News passed on the story until the emails could be properly vetted. The owner of the computer repair shop told reporters that, while he couldn’t confirm it was Hunter Biden who dropped off the laptop because he is ""legally blind,"" he also said he didn't see child pornography on the computer. No other news organizations have seen or corroborated the data supposedly on the laptop's hard drive.  We reached out to the Biden campaign for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Several Facebook posts claim ""Hunter Biden had 25,000 pics of him torturing and raping children under age 10 in China on his laptop."" There is no evidence to support that.  The allegation originated on an anonymous internet forum that’s a known source of online disinformation, and conspiracy websites that reported the claims relied on anonymous sources to back them up. The New York Post’s story about Hunter Biden’s laptop is unconfirmed — but it also does not mention child pornography. The owner of the computer repair shop where the laptop came from told reporters he didn’t see child pornography on it. Without information to support the allegations, we rate the posts False.

No, Hugo Chavez’s family does not own Dominion Voting Systems
","A viral Facebook video rehashes conspiracy theories about Dominion Voting Systems to make unproven allegations of voter fraud in Arizona.  In the video, a man speaks to the camera, claiming to be a Biden voter who initially doubted the Trump campaign’s allegations of voter fraud. He says that an Arizona press conference held Nov. 30 by Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis caused him to reevaluate his belief in the legitimacy of the election results. Citing statements from the meeting, the man claims that Dominion Voting Systems, which makes software and hardware for election officials to use around the country, is owned by Hugo Chavez, the deceased former president of Venezuela.  ""Hugo Chavez’s family still owns the company,"" reads the headline of the video.  The post, which has been viewed more than 74,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s wrong. There is no evidence to support the claim that the Chavez family owns Dominion.  Dominion was founded in 2003 in Toronto, Canada, not Venezuela. In 2018, the company was acquired by Staple Street Capital, a private equity firm based in New York.  In an April letter to the House Committee on Administration, Dominion CEO John Poulos said that Staple Street Capital owns a 75.2% stake in the company. Poulos, a Canadian citizen, wrote that he holds a 12% stake and that no other investor owns more than a 5% stake, according to the Associated Press.  ""Dominion is not and has never been a front for communists. It has no ties to Hugo Chávez, the late dictator of Venezuela,"" Poulos wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. ""It has never been involved in Venezuelan elections."" The speaker’s claim about Dominion echoes a baseless conspiracy theory that we have debunked in the past.  The thrust of the theory is that Smartmatic, a separate firm that builds electronic voting systems, is a Venezuelan company with close ties to Hugo Chavez.  The founders of Smartmatic were born in Venezuela, but the company itself was founded in Boca Raton, Fla.  Smartmatic says it has no affiliation with Chavez, who died in 2013, or with the current Venezuelan government.  According to the company’s website, Smartmatic is run by its two founders, Antonio Mugica and Roger Piñate; 83% of its shares are held by SGO, a London-based company owned by the Mugica and Piñate families. An additional 10% of its shares are held by employees, and 7% by outside investors.   Smartmatic voting systems have been used in elections around the world, including Venezuela. In 2017, the company said that its technology was manipulated to report a skewed vote total during a Venezuelan election. The company accused the Venezuelan government of election fraud, and it stopped its work there the following year. Smartmatic has claimed that the incident was an anomaly likely due to the lack of election monitors.  Smartmatic technology was not used in any of the battleground states won by Biden where Trump allies are disputing the results.  In order to draw a link between Smartmatic and the 2020 U.S. election, Trump supporters have baselessly alleged that the company owns its competitor Dominion, which was used to tabulate votes in key battleground states. But both Dominion and Smartmatic have issued statements denying that they are affiliated with each other. The companies have also denied that they use each other’s software.  Eddie Perez, a voting technology expert, told the Associated Press that there was no reason to believe that Dominion and Smartmatic have ties to each other or to Venezuela.  A Facebook video claims that ""Hugo Chavez’s family still owns"" Dominion Voting Systems. According to Dominion, 75.2% of its shares are owned by Staple Street Capital, a New York-based private equity firm, and 12% of its shares are owned by John Poulos, its CEO. No other investor holds more than a 5% stake in the company.  The claim — which is tied to other baseless conspiracy theories that we have debunked —  is not accurate.

Northam is right about about racial disparities in pot arrests and convictions
","Virginia will go to pot next year if Gov. Ralph Northam has his way. The Democrat says he will have legislation introduced this winter that would make Virginia the 16th state - and the first in the South - to legalize marijuana. One of his main reasons, he says, is to end a racial injustice. ""People of color and those of not, they use marijuana at the same rate. People of color are three times more likely to get arrested and convicted,"" he said during a Nov. 20 radio interview on WAMU in Washington. We fact-checked his statement. Marijuana use by race The first part of Northam’s claim, that Black and white people use pot at the same rate essentially holds up, according to a 2018 national survey on drug use by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: 18% of Black respondents and 17% of whites said they had used marijuana during the last year;  12% of Black respondents and 10% of whites said they had used it in the last month. A 2017 survey by HHS showed showed nearly identical results: 17% of Black respondents and 16% of whites said they had used marijuana during the last year; 12% of Black respondents and 10% of whites said they had used it in the last month. In Virginia, the 2018 survey found 7% of Black respondents and 6% of whites said they had used marijuana in the last month; 12% of Black respondents and 11% of whites said they had used it in the last year. Marijuana arrests Reports show a racial discrepancy in marijuana-related arrests in Virginia and across the nation. The Virginia General Assembly’s watchdog agency - the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) - issued a draft report in November  with data on the state’s pot arrests from 2010 through 2019. It found 1 people per 1,000. In other words, Black people in Virginia were 3.5 times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana. That’s very similar to findings in a study issued by the American Civil Liberties Union on April 20, 2020. The study said Black peoples were 3.4 times more likely than white people to be arrested in Virginia for marijuana crimes in 2018. Virginia ranked 27th among 49 states that provided data to the ACLU, which wants marijuana to be legalized (Florida did not cooperate). Nationally, Black people were 3.6 times more likely than white people to be run in for marijuana between 2010 and 2018, according to the ACLU. . JLARC found that, from 2015 through 2019, Black people were more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana in each of 88 Virginia localities from which there was enough data to draw a conclusion. The largest discrepancy was in Carroll County, where Black people were 40.4 times more likely than white people to be run in for pot. In Hanover County, Black people were 14.8 times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana. The racial disparity was 6.4 times higher for Black people in Richmond, 5.2 times higher in Henrico County, and four times higher in Chesterfield County. According to JLARC, Virginia averaged 22,000 marijuana arrests a year during the last decade. ""The vast majority...have been for possession of small amounts of marijuana,"" the agency wrote. ""There were about 10 times as many arrests for marijuana possession as for distribution or other marijuana offenses.""  Marijuana convictions JLARC found that Black people in Virginia were four times more likely than white people to be convicted on marijuana charges from 2010 to 2019. Four Black people per thousand were found guilty, compared to one white person per thousand.  According to JLARC, 58% of all state marijuana arrests in 2018 resulted in convictions, the vast majority of them winding up with ""fines, court fees and driver license suspensions."" Forty percent of the cases were dismissed by prosecutors or judges, and 2% resulted in not-guilty verdicts. JLARC found Black people were more likely to be prosecuted on pot charges in each of 83 localities where there was enough data to draw a conclusion.  Our ruling In his bid to legalize pot in Virginia, Northam said, ""People of color and those of not, they use marijuana at the same rate. People of color are three times more likely to get arrested and convicted."" Surveys show Black people and white people do use pot at just about the same rate in Virginia. But Black people are 3.5 times more likely than white people to get arrested in Virginia for marijuana offenses, and four times more likely to get convicted. If anything, Northam has slightly understated his case, but we don’t usually penalize for that.

The Pants on Fire claim that a Dominion rep in Georgia manipulated data
","A Georgia elections official called on President Donald Trump and the state’s two Republican senators to condemn death threats against election workers that are being fueled by misinformation. ""Someone’s going to get hurt,"" said Gabriel Sterling, the state’s voting system implementation manager, during a Dec. 1 press conference. ""Someone’s going to get shot. Someone’s going to get killed. And it’s not right."" One worker who has faced threats is the subject of a Facebook post about a contractor for Dominion Voting Systems, which makes software and hardware used by elections workers in multiple states: The post says that the Dominion representative at a Gwinnett County elections office downloaded data to a USB flash drive from the election management server and plugged it into a laptop to ""manipulate the data."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Neither the video nor the Facebook post provides any proof that the worker manipulated the data. Although it’s not possible to tell what the representative is doing as he works on computers, the narrators leap to conclusions and portray his actions as nefarious. ""He just pulled a USB out,"" says the male narrator. ""Did he? Where is he going?...,"" says the female narrator. ""Oh my god — is he taking it to that laptop?"" The narrators then continue to chuckle and speculate about the man’s actions, but without any evidence that he is doing anything wrong. Gwinnett County spokesperson Joe Sorenson told us that the video shows ""a Dominion technician producing a data report on the server and saving the report to a Dominion USB thumb drive and then using a laptop to filter requested information. The Dominion servers are not equipped with Excel and counties are not authorized to install any hardware or software on these systems."" A Dominion spokesperson told Fox News’ Eric Shawn in a Nov. 22 interview that it wouldn’t be possible for a person to stick a thumb drive into a computer and fill it up with thousands of votes for Joe Biden. The interview was related to baseless claims made by pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell and occurred before the viral Facebook video appeared. Dominion election equipment has been a frequent subject of misinformation promoted by Trump’s allies and social media users following Trump’s narrow loss in Georgia. A Dominion representative didn’t respond to our questions about the video but referred us to the public remarks Sterling made debunking the misinformation. ""A 20-something tech in Gwinnett County today has death threats and a noose put out, saying he should be hung for treason because he was transferring a report on batches from an (election management system) to a county computer so we could read it,"" Sterling told reporters. Sterling said that the allegation that the worker was manipulating election data from the recount was ""wrong."" He called on Trump and Georgia’s Republican senators — Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who are both campaigning for runoff elections against Democrats on Jan. 5 — to condemn violent rhetoric.  ""This has to stop. We need you to step up and if you’re going to take a position of leadership, show something,"" Sterling said. Both senators’ campaigns put out statements saying they condemn violence. A Trump campaign spokesperson made a similar statement. Loeffler and Perdue were among those making baseless claims of malfeasance in the Nov. 3 election, and both called on Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to resign.  A Facebook post says that a Dominion representative in Gwinnett County improperly downloaded election data to ""manipulate the data.""

Former Pfizer employee wrong that coronavirus pandemic is ‘effectively over’ in UK
","As Pfizer landed approval to begin distributing its COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom, a former company employee’s wrong claims downplaying the pandemic recirculated online. The social media posts rely on statements made by Michael Yeadon, who argued in an Oct. 16 blog post that the coronavirus pandemic is ""effectively over"" in the U.K., and that ""there is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic."" The posts suggest that Yeadon’s connection to Pfizer makes his views on the pandemic and vaccines credible.  ""This is a factual article from a factual publication by a factual doctor who happens to be one of the utmost leading expert(s) on vaccines in the world,"" one Instagram post said. ""Here we have it,"" another post on Facebook said. ""The company making the vaccine saying the pandemic is over and healthy people do not need a vaccine."" But Yeadon hasn’t worked for Pfizer in nine years, according to the Associated Press and his LinkedIn profile. He was formerly the chief scientific officer of allergy and respiratory research, his profile says. And his claims are wrong, experts told PolitiFact. So are the social media posts that spread them. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The coronavirus pandemic is far from over in the U.K. and in other countries, as case spikes in recent months have shown. A widespread vaccine could prevent future waves, experts said. The Associated Press also debunked Yeadon’s statements. Fact-checkers with Lead Stories and Health Feedback previously addressed similarly inaccurate claims he made in a separate blog post and in an interview with a talk radio host in the U.K. PolitiFact’s efforts to contact Yeadon were unsuccessful.  Yeadon’s claim that the pandemic is ""effectively over"" is at odds with data showing that the U.K. was among the many countries where cases rose over the last several months.  The U.K. saw a sharp surge in daily confirmed cases between September and mid-November, when the numbers began to fall again as stricter restrictions were introduced. The country is still reporting tens of thousands of new cases each day, along with hundreds of deaths daily.  In total, the coronavirus has infected more than 1.6 million people in the U.K. to date, according to Johns Hopkins University data. It has killed nearly 60,000. ""If Dr. Yeadon’s claim were true that the pandemic is effectively over, then the number of cases in various countries should be leveling off or dropping,"" said Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.  Days before Yeadon published his blog post on Oct. 16, the U.K.’s deputy chief medical officer warned in an op-ed that the nation was ""at a tipping point similar to where we were in March."" Indeed, confirmed cases in the U.K. were already ""on the upswing"" in mid-October, said Emily Bruce, a faculty scientist in medicine at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine. They have increased substantially in the roughly six weeks since, Bruce said. Many other countries have experienced similar trends as colder weather has sent more people indoors. The U.S. reported over 1 million new cases in the first 10 days of November.  Yeadon’s claim about vaccines is also wrong. ""There is definitely still a need for vaccines,"" said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University.  In his blog post, Yeadon argued that more people are immune to COVID-19 than the U.K.’s scientists recognize, because many were previously infected with other coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold. That, he insisted, meant both the U.K. and the world are close to achieving herd immunity. Herd immunity occurs when enough people are immune to a virus to limit new infections and spread.  But experts told PolitiFact that Yeadon was leaping to conclusions. ""Whether prior infection with a seasonal coronavirus confers protection from SARS-CoV-2 is still not a settled question,"" Bruce said. ""While recent work indicates that it is possible that some cross protection (particularly from T cells) exists, this is not yet fully understood."" ""The immune system tends to be very specific, so exposure to related viruses does not necessarily result in protection from all of those related viruses,"" Watanabe added. Herd immunity generally requires greater than 70% of a population to be immune, Watanabe said. But experts agreed that’s a long way away without a vaccine. What we know about current case trends and the number of people who have been infected suggests that ""vaccination would be required to prevent future waves,"" Nichols said.  Even if herd immunity were reached without widespread vaccination, she said, anyone who has not been infected would remain susceptible to the virus unless they got a vaccine.  RELATED: What we know about COVID-19 and immunity In a blog post that has sparked several widespread social media posts, Yeadon claimed the pandemic is ""effectively over"" in the U.K. and ""there is absolutely no need for vaccines."" Both points are inaccurate and at odds with the realities of the pandemic, which has upended lives and killed over 1.4 million people globally. Confirmed daily case counts were rising in the U.K. at the time of Yeadon’s claim and remain in the tens of thousands. People are still dying. Experts said that COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths will continue to mount in the absence of widespread mitigation measures until a vaccine is distributed.

Is Florida doing better on COVID-19 than 'locked down' states?
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted pleas from some of his state’s mayors to enact statewide measures to fight COVID-19, such as a mask mandate and the power to adopt local restrictions. The day before Florida recorded its 1 millionth case, DeSantis told reporters that states in lockdown mode are faring worse than Florida. ""So I hear people say, ‘Oh, well, Florida is open, and they’re having increased cases,’"" DeSantis said Nov. 30. ""Well, OK, the states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are. If you look at the per capita cases, in a lot of these states that have closed schools, businesses shuttered, some of them even post stay-at-home orders there, you see a huge increase in these cases."" We checked DeSantis’ claim that ""the states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are."" We found that while Florida is doing comparatively well at the moment, DeSantis overstated the correlation between cases and lockdown rules. It’s likely that other factors beyond just a state’s rules are affecting COVID-19 rates. In an effort to reduce the spread of the virus, states have enacted — and then sometimes relaxed or lifted — various restrictions, including mask mandates, limits on restaurant capacity, and bans on large gatherings. DeSantis, a Republican, issued an order Sept. 25 that generally lifted restrictions on businesses and suspended fines for people who didn’t comply. While many stores and restaurants have adopted their own mask and social distancing rules, Floridians have still packed into some bars and other gathering spots.  In November, cases in Florida were on the rise, but unlike some other governors, DeSantis said he wouldn’t issue new mandates. We asked Fred Piccolo, a spokesperson for DeSantis, for evidence to explain the governor’s claim that cases in states that are locked down are increasing twice as fast as in Florida. Piccolo cited a New York Times state-by-state analysis, updated Nov. 30, showing which states have businesses that are mostly closed, which ones have no restrictions, and which ones are ""mixed."" The Times also published a map showing states with stay-at-home orders or advisories. Piccolo then used the Covid Act Now website to calculate the number of cases and hospitalizations per 100,000 residents in some of the states with more stringent restrictions. We checked the numbers ourselves. We focused on the states that the Times had cited as enacting the most stringent restrictions for either businesses or residents as of Nov. 30, as well as the states that had a medium level of restrictions on both businesses and residents. All told, 10 states qualified for this group of states with high coronavirus-related restrictions. (Our list of 10 states was slightly different from the one Piccolo provided, but not substantively so.) Broadly speaking, we found that Florida’s record, at least as of the beginning of December, compared favorably with most states across the country, including those with tighter restrictions. Specifically, in comparisons of coronavirus cases deaths and hospitalizations per capita, Florida ranked among the best, and better than some of the more highly regulated states. (Click on the chart to see separate comparisons for cases, deaths, and hospitalizations.)   So there’s something to what DeSantis said. However, there are also some important caveats. First, some of the more highly regulated states performed better than Florida did. For instance, Oregon, Washington state and California had fewer coronavirus deaths per capita than Florida did, while Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington state had lower hospitalization rates. Second, DeSantis’ reference to ""twice the rate"" undercuts the strength of his argument. Out of the 10 states with the most stringent rules, only about half had per capita cases, deaths and hospitalizations that were twice as high as Florida’s rate. Third, Florida may be faring better than many other states in fighting the coronavirus, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that a lack of restrictions is to credit for better coronavirus statistics. The following chart shows 27 states, including Florida, that the New York Times’ analysis found to have the least restrictive COVID-19 rules on businesses and residents.    Once again, Florida ranks well compared with the other states on cases, deaths and hospitalizations. But many of the states that followed similarly  low levels of restrictions as Florida did ended up with far worse outcomes.  We found that 12 of the low-restriction states had double Florida’s case rate, eight had double the rate of deaths, and nine had double the rate of hospitalizations. Five states had double Florida’s rate in each of the three statistics — South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, and Indiana — and another five states had twice Florida’s rate for two statistics.  RELATED: In Nebraska, skyrocketing cases of COVID-19 put localities, governor on separate tracks It’s also important to note that some states added or tightened restrictions in November, making the impact so far difficult to evaluate. The comparison with other lightly regulated states suggests that Florida may be doing relatively well for reasons other than its low-regulation policy. For example, Florida’s weather makes it easier for residents to eat and gather outdoors, even at this time of year. Scientists have generally said that the virus passes from person to person less easily outdoors than in cramped indoor spaces. ""I think it’s reasonable to say that the warmer weather certainly plays a part in Florida’s relative success,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious-disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. ""It’s no longer incredibly hot, necessitating indoor gathering for air conditioning, but not too cold that people need to congregate indoors for heat."" In addition, it’s hard to establish causation: Is it the loose regulation that helps reduce infection rates, or is it the low infection rates that allow for looser regulations?  Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county, had an increase in cases following the removal of the mitigation strategies, said Mary Jo Trepka, chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Florida International University. ""We don’t know how bad it will get,"" Trepka said. It’s also important to remember that states aren’t walled-off jurisdictions. During much of the pandemic, Florida has been open to tourists, which means we don’t know whether coronavirus transmission within Florida is increasing infections in other states after those tourists return home, said Marissa Levine, a public health professor at the University of South Florida. Jason L. Salemi, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida, cautions that the success DeSantis claimed is only in comparison with other states, and that cases and hospitalizations have been rising over the last few weeks. ""That, to me, is indicative of how serious the situation is across the country,"" he said. DeSantis said, ""The states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are"" in Florida. Currently, Florida does have relatively low rates of coronavirus cases, deaths and hospitalizations. But the connection between those statistics and Florida’s light restrictions on businesses and residents is less clear-cut than DeSantis suggests. Only about half of the 10 most stringently regulated states saw rates of cases, deaths and hospitalizations that were twice as high as Florida’s — DeSantis’ benchmark. Meanwhile, numerous other states that followed the same less restrictive policies as Florida have fared far worse than Florida. This suggests that factors other than behavioral regulations, such as warm weather, may play a role in keeping coronavirus infections relatively low in Florida.

His tweet included a link to a Nov. 24 analysis titled ""Anomalies in Vote Counts and Their Effects on Election 2020."" Interesting . . .

A separate Nov. 24 post under that same name says, ""Welcome to vote_pattern_analysis by me, Vote P. Analysis."" State election officials have defended their electoral process and rejected claims about voter or election fraud. We dug into the evidence Paul cited, and also looked at how states count and report votes. Paul said there was something ""interesting"" about the results reporting that suggested fraud; we found it easily explained by known vote-counting procedures.  Paul’s tweet misstated an element of the analysis he promoted. His tweet said there were four ""data dumps"" in four states (he did not name the states). However, the analysis centered on four updates in three states: Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia. (Two of the updates were in Michigan.) The post and Paul overlook the fact that in Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, absentee or mail-in ballots received by the time polls closed on Nov. 3 were legally allowed to be counted. The fact that workers were still counting ballots past midnight on Election Day is not indicative of fraud. States’ specific rules and varying election procedures influenced the timing of results. Wisconsin law, for example, bans clerks from tallying absentee ballots before Election Day. Several municipalities in Wisconsin could not finish processing their absentee ballots by the time the polls closed at 8 p.m. on Election Day, so there was a delay in reporting those results to county clerks. ""This was especially true in major cities including Milwaukee, Green Bay and Kenosha, where final unofficial results were reported after 3 a.m."" on Nov. 4, said a post on the Wisconsin Elections Commission website. (Milwaukee is Wisconsin’s most populous city and tends to vote heavily for Democrats.) Delayed reporting ""does not mean something went wrong — it means election officials did their jobs and made sure every valid ballot was counted,"" said Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin’s chief election official. The report Paul shared ""shows no awareness of the political geography of the states being analyzed,"" said Barry C. Burden, a political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""It is hardly surprising that large urban areas would take longer to count ballots and those ballots would favor Biden,"" Burden said. ""Instead, the report treats the arrival of ballots in the early morning after the election as a mystery with no clear basis in the politics of the states being investigated."" RELATED: Fact-checking the avalanche of Wisconsin election misinformation Paul’s tweet also ignores that many Americans were expected to vote by mail this election to avoid crowded places during the pandemic. And election officials had warned for months that mail-in ballots would take longer to count. Biden encouraged Americans to vote by mail. Trump disparaged the practice, baselessly saying it caused widespread voter fraud. Different states and even counties within a state have different rules for which ballots are tabulated first. So, whether a particular release of results favored Biden or Trump had a lot to do with how those ballots were cast — in person or by mail. ""Election officials and media outlets repeatedly explained how collections of tabulated absentee ballots would be released later than other ballots in some states and would tend to favor Biden rather than Trump,"" Burden said. The post Paul shared said that the vote updates were colloquially known as ""dumps"" or ""batches."" But election experts said that the term ""dumps"" is not a common technical description of these large-volume updates, although some media outlets have used that word, along with the less loaded term ""batches."" ""I doubt election administrators refer to the process of counting and posting running tallies as ‘dumps,’"" said Lorraine Minnite, an associate professor of public policy at Rutgers University-Camden in New Jersey. Experts also raised concerns about the unnamed author of the post Paul shared. ""A credible analyst would proudly attach their name to such an analysis and would contextualize the results with background on the political geography of each state rather than treating the large batches of votes as untethered from the rest of the election administration system,"" Burden said. PolitiFact asked Paul’s press office for the author’s identity but did not get an answer. His office sent PolitiFact a statement, attributed to Paul, which did not fully address our query. The statement said: ""Asking people to think for themselves, and asking that our elections be verified free of fraud, would seem to be basic, easy concepts. They are apparently too much for the media and big tech to handle, though, so they have to attack and censor."" It’s not censorship, though, to ask for proof. ""The suspicion of fraud, whether genuine or not, is not the same thing as evidence consistent with fraud,"" said Vincent L. Hutchings, a political science professor at the University of Michigan. ""If one wants to raise this claim, and thereby potentially invalidate the votes of millions of Americans, then the bar should be considerably higher than mere suspicion,"" Hutchings said. The Justice Department to date has ""not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,"" U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr told the Associated Press Dec. 1. Barr’s comment aligns with a Nov. 12 statement from federal and state officials, who said the Nov. 3 election ""was the most secure in American history."" Paul tweeted, ""Trump margin of ‘defeat’ in 4 states occurred in 4 data dumps between 1:34-6:31 AM. Statistical anomaly? Fraud?"" His suggestion that ""data dumps"" could reflect fraud in the presidential election is not supported by evidence. First, officials who oversee elections have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud. Second, states that reported votes after Election Day did so legally and as expected. Because of a high number of absentee ballots and the time it takes to process them, election officials warned before Election Day that complete, unofficial results from all jurisdictions would not be available on Election Night.

"['National', 'Supreme Court', 'GOP Daily Brief']","
Reassignment of Supreme Court justices won’t affect election results
","On Nov. 20, the Supreme Court assigned new U.S. Court of Appeals circuits to its justices. Under the new arrangement, the four justices perceived to be the most conservative will oversee circuits where the Trump campaign has filed lawsuits to contest the results of the election.  For example, Brett Kavanaugh now oversees the circuit that includes Michigan, Amy Coney Barrett oversees Wisconsin, Samuel Alito oversees Pennsylvania and Clarence Thomas oversees Georgia. Conservative media outlets and social media users seized on the news, suggesting that the new assignments could help President Donald Trump overturn the results of the 2020 election election.  ""Supreme Court Shakes Up 2020 Election, Assigns Conservatives To Swing State Circuit Courts,"" reads the headline of an article published in the GOP Daily Brief.  However, experts we spoke with told us that these posts and articles misunderstand how the federal court system works.  ""The claim that this realignment was done in order to influence the election — or the notion that it will have that impact — doesn’t really reflect reality,"" said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Law School.  The U.S. Court of Appeals is organized into 13 circuits — 12 regional ones plus the federal circuit. Each of the circuit courts is assigned to a Supreme Court justice based on his or her familiarity with the region, often from having lived or worked there in the past. One of the primary roles of the overseeing justice is filtering out cases eligible to be heard before the Supreme Court.  But their powers over the appellate courts are limited. In their capacity as circuit justices, individual justices are empowered by statute to take only discrete, temporary actions on lower-court decisions.  For example, the justices can extend the deadline to file a document or, in rare cases, issue an emergency stay on a lower-court decision until the rest of the Supreme Court has the opportunity to weigh in. An election challenge that could overturn the outcome of a vote would not be handled unilaterally. ""A circuit justice would be extremely unlikely to grant relief on his or her own in an election-related case,"" said Michael Morley, assistant professor at Florida State University College of Law. ""If the circuit justice thought there was a potentially substantial claim, he or she would refer the request to the full Supreme Court.  And even if a circuit justice did act unilaterally, the full court could overrule that ruling."" There is no evidence to suggest that the Supreme Court issued new circuit court assignments to ""shake up"" the 2020 election.  Circuit courts are reassigned whenever a new justice is appointed, and the latest reassignments came less than a month after Barrett, the newest justice, was sworn in. The Supreme Court typically assigns justices to locations they are familiar with. The recent reassignment follows this logic, said Tara Leigh Grove, a legal scholar at the Alabama University School of Law. For example, Barrett is overseeing the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, where she was a judge before joining the Supreme Court.  In addition, neither Alito nor Thomas moved circuits under the arrangement. Alito was overseeing Pennsylvania, and Thomas was overseeing Georgia before Barrett’s confirmation.  ""Anybody who thinks that there was any political motivation to the reassignments is completely wrong,"" Grove said.  Former Vice President Joe Biden won the election, carrying enough states to secure 306 electoral votes. But the Trump campaign has challenged the outcome in several battleground states that helped put Biden over the top. The reassignment of conservative Supreme Court justices won’t have an impact on the outcome of election challenges, because the bulk of post-election litigation takes place in state courts, said Rebecca Green, a law professor and co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary Law School.  During post-election litigation, federal courts weigh in only on questions that concern claims about federal statutes or the U.S. Constitution.  For example, Bush v. Gore — the controversial Supreme Court decision in a Florida recount dispute that decided the 2000 presidential election — involved the Constitution’s equal protection clause and a federal law called the Electoral Count Act. Without a federal question, the higher courts lack jurisdiction.   The Trump campaign has pursued several federal claims in court. But in all of these cases so far, the number of ballots under challenge isn’t enough to change the election outcome, Green explained.   ""This is not a Bush v. Gore election, where the margin was 537 votes,"" she said.  Finally, Green said, both federal and state courts have set a ""clear pattern"" for post-election lawsuits this cycle: ""Claims that lack grounded legal arguments and supporting evidence do not proceed …  irrespective of the perceived political leanings of the judges who have heard these claims."" In other words, the ideology of the judges is unlikely to affect the outcome of a lawsuit if it lacks merit and evidence. On Nov. 27, three Republican-appointed federal appeals court judges threw out a Trump campaign lawsuit in Pennsylvania for lack of evidence.  An article claims that the Supreme Court is shaking up the 2020 election by assigning conservatives to swing-state circuit courts. The Supreme Court did reassign some justices, but it’s misleading to claim that this will affect the election outcome.  Circuit courts are routinely reassigned when a new justice joins the Supreme Court, and an assignment is often based on a justice’s familiarity with a certain circuit or region, not political ideology. Law professors told us that individual justices would have limited power to unilaterally overturn the election outcome in any state in their assigned circuit. And there are too few ballots being challenged in federal court to affect the outcome of the election. We rate this claim Mostly False. ​",/factchecks/2020/dec/02/gop-daily-brief/reassignment-supreme-court-justices-wont-affect-el/

No, Biden didn’t plagiarize Donald Trump
","Clips of President-elect Joe Biden’s speech during the Democratic National Convention in August are again recirculating on Facebook, only this time they’re accompanied by allegations of plagiarism.   ""Joe Biden’s speech stolen from Trump!"" reads the title of the video published by radio host Mark Kaye. ""I mean, it’s not the first time he’s plagiarized a speech…"" Biden has come under scrutiny in the past for plagiarism — the act of stealing or passing off someone else’s words or ideas as your own — but we didn’t find anything to support he lifted lines from Trump for his DNC speech.  More broadly, the men have taken different positions on how to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has said coronavirus precautions shouldn’t hold back the U.S. economy and that states should take the lead on testing, mask requirements and more. He’s also advocated for the rapid development of vaccines.  Biden, meanwhile, has advocated for nationwide mask-wearing and physical distancing. He wants to dramatically increase access to rapid testing and he supports additional assistance for hospitals and public health workers.    The video on Facebook cuts between Kaye’s commentary and several clips from Biden, including the following statements from his Aug. 20 speech before the DNC:  ""If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I’ll be an ally of the light, not the darkness. It’s time for us, for we the people, to come together."" ""If I’m your president on day one we’ll implement the national strategy I’ve been laying out since March."" ""We’ll develop and deploy rapid tests with results available immediately.""  ""We’ll make the medical supplies and protective equipment that our country needs and we’ll make them here in America so we will never again be at the mercy of China or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people.""  ""We’ll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open, safe and effective."" Kaye didn’t provide any evidence in the video that Biden poached those lines from President Donald Trump. Rather, he criticized the former vice president for promising policies Kaye argued Trump had already enacted. Around the 3:15 mark, Kaye said: ""Every single thing he’s mentioned to this point, every single thing he’s mentioned — rapid testing, getting it out there quickly, American-made ventilators and supplies getting to the places where they’re needed, getting the schools open in a safe environment where kids can learn — every single thing he pointed out is something that the current occupant of the Oval Office has already done. It’s like he literally just watched a Donald Trump press conference, took notes and said, ‘Oh that’s good.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We searched Factba.se, which archives speeches and public comments made by Trump, for instances when he either said the same things Biden did in the Facebook video, or said something very close.  While Trump has discussed the pandemic, he didn’t make any of the statements that Biden made.  Looking for ""ally of the light,"" for example, we only found an Aug. 27 speech delivered after Biden’s DNC address in which Trump remarked that Biden ""may claim he is an ally of the light.""  The word ""darkness"" appeared in 38 addresses, but none in the same context that Biden used them — except for when Trump was referring to Biden’s speech.  Biden said: ""We’ll develop and deploy rapid tests with results available immediately.""  Trump has talked about rapid tests publicly 15 times, according to the Factba.se database. On Aug. 11, he said that his administration had ""delivered over 1,800 rapid point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes"" and that officials were in the process of delivering such devices to all Medicare and Medicaid-certified nursing homes.

"['Michigan', 'Mike Duggan']","
Detroit has among the lowest rates of infection in Michigan, but not the lowest.
","In a Nov. 29 interview on Face the Nation, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan was pressed on the resurgence of the coronavirus across Michigan. ""Most new cases of the virus are in and around the city of Detroit,"" host Margaret Brennan said. Duggan challenged that premise, responding that Detroit is an outlier compared with the metro area and the rest of the state in the latest phase of the pandemic. ""Detroit actually has the lowest infection rate in the state of Michigan,"" Duggan said. ""We’re half of that of the surrounding suburbs."" Data on infection rates do show that after getting hit hard early, Detroit appears to have done a better job more recently of slowing the spread of the coronavirus than surrounding communities. But Duggan was incorrect in stating that Detroit’s infection rate is the lowest statewide. And while it was running at less than half the rate of the suburban areas in the beginning of November, that’s no longer the case. Nonetheless, he said Detroit can be an example for other parts of Michigan dealing with rising caseloads. ""Conventional wisdom at the start of the pandemic was that the most densely populated cities would have the highest infection rates,"" Duggan told PolitiFact Michigan. ""The people of Detroit have proven that widespread testing and masking up is what really matters in fighting the virus."" Denise Fair, Chief Public Health Officer for the city, pointed to a number of factors that have contributed to the city’s low rate of new infections in a recent interview with Bridge Michigan. Among them, Fair mentioned the free drive-thru testing site set up by the city originally located at the State Fairgrounds and free transportation it offered to the site, Personal Protective Equipment shared with small businesses and community outreach and public service announcements regarding the risks associated with the coronavirus and how to prevent its spread. While the coronavirus pandemic has affected both urban and rural areas, the onset of the pandemic hit cities and their health systems particularly hard, and Detroit quickly became a hotspot for the coronavirus. At the height of its coronavirus outbreak in the spring, Detroit consistently reported more than 300 cases and dozens of deaths a day. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer responded with strict stay-at-home orders that closed schools and shuttered most businesses. The state also ramped up COVID-19 testing in hard-hit areas. Detroit’s testing program, along with businesses’ and residents’ compliance with mask orders, helped slow the rate of infection by mid-summer. But cases are now rising again, not only in Detroit, but across the state. Health experts look at the seven-day positivity rate as one key measure of how fast infection is spreading in a community. The seven-day positivity rate is a percentage derived by taking the number of COVID-19 tests that come back positive over the previous seven days and dividing it by the number of tests administered. When Duggan made his remarks, Detroit’s seven-day positivity rate was 8.2%, according to the city’s Health Department. That’s above the 5% threshold that the World Health Organizations considered a reasonable level for relaxing certain social restrictions. But Detroit was still doing better than surrounding areas. According to the University of Michigan’s MI Safe Start Map, the seven-day positivity rate was 14.9% in Wayne County excluding Detroit, 13.4% in neighboring Oakland County and 17.5% in Macomb County, as of Nov. 25. Data from early November show larger disparities in the tri-county area, with positivity rates in Detroit dropping below 5%, less than half the rates outside the city. Indeed, the MI Safe Start Map shows that Detroit’s seven-day positivity rate as of Nov. 25 was among the lowest in the state. (The figures include probable cases and exclude cases from correctional facilities.) But it wasn’t the lowest, as Duggan stated. Some counties in Michigan’s sparsely populated Upper Peninsula posted lower positivity rates during that period, including Alger (4.4%), Houghton (7.7%), Iron (6.7%), Luce (3.6%), Mackinac (4.1%) and Schoolcraft (5%). The population of these six counties — roughly 81,000 — is a small fraction of Detroit’s population of 670,000. Rural Emmet (6.1%), Gratiot (5.6%), Leelanau (7.8%) and Mason (7.9%) counties in the Lower Peninsula also recorded seven-day positivity rates on Nov. 25 that were also lower than Detroit’s. Even Washtenaw County, just west of Wayne County, had a lower rate: 6.4% as of Nov. 25. But Duggan said that the surge in infections in communities surrounding Detroit poses a public health threat to the entire metro area. ""We are one region. When Detroit got hit hard in March and April, Detroit patients were sent to outlying suburban hospitals,"" he told PolitiFact Michigan. ""Today, patients from the suburbs are being sent to Detroit hospitals, where we still have capacity. We need everybody in this region to make a real commitment to masking up and social distancing or all of Southeast Michigan will face a real hospital capacity crisis in the coming weeks."" On Nov. 29, Duggan said that Detroit has ""the lowest infection rate in the state of Michigan"" and that the city’s infection rate was half that of its surrounding suburbs. According to the seven-day positivity rate available when Duggan made his remarks, Detroit had among the lowest infection rates in the state and a better rate than surrounding areas but its rate was not the lowest in the state or half that of its surrounding communities.

Yes, Americans pay more for remdesivir. No, Trump administration isn’t to blame for that
","(Editors note: This fact-check was updated on Dec. 7, 2020, to include more detail on the government’s ability to take patents. The new information does not change our rating.) U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin called for change in the prices of a coronavirus drug, placing blame on the current administration for letting the prices rise so high.  Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) in a Nov. 19, 2020, tweet said Americans are paying the highest price in the world for a drug meant to combat the coronavirus pandemic, thanks to the Trump administration.  The drug, remdesivir, was the first medication released after the coronavirus pandemic began. It was developed by Gilead Sciences and largely funded with money from U.S. taxpayers, according to a July 23, 2020, article from PolitiFact.  The antiviral is designed to keep the virus from making copies of itself and spreading. A clinical trial in April found that patients who were given the drug recovered more quickly than those who were given placebo pills, but the study was not clear if the drug improved survival, according to an Oct. 15, 2020, report from the New York Times.  Attached to Baldwin’s tweet is a Nov. 16 letter to Alex Azar, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requesting information on price negotiations with the company making the drug. The letter is signed by Baldwin, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Tina Smith (D-Minnesota), Bernie Sanders (D-Vermont), Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).   The senators in the letter request that the federal government take over the production and distribution of the drug with compulsory licensing authority, which could be used to acquire lower-cost versions of the drug.  But is Baldwin right? Is the drug really more expensive in the U.S. than other countries? And are those prices the fault of President Donald Trump’s administration? Let’s break down the tweet.  Americans do pay more for remdesivir than people elsewhere. In a June 29, 2020 open letter from Daniel O’Day, the chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences, said each dose of the antiviral medicine will cost $520 for those on private insurance in the U.S. For the entire treatment, consisting of six doses of the medicine, the cost is $3,120.  For those on government-sponsored insurance, such as Medicare and Medicaid, remdesivir will cost $390 per vial, or $2,340 per treatment, the letter said. That price will also apply to those in other countries with national health care systems.  Countries such as Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany have national health care systems.  So is the drug more expensive in the U.S.?  Yes, for people on private insurance in the U.S., the drug will cost more than what people in countries with national health care systems pay.  That’s similar to price trends with other drugs, though, said Cody Wenthur, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Pharmacy.  ""U.S. drug prices have been calculated to be about four times higher on average than prices in other nations,"" he said.  And what about the claim that the Trump administration is at fault for the price of the drug? It’s not that simple. The president does have a small bit of influence, said Edmund Elder, the director of the Zeeh Pharmaceutical Experiment Station within the UW-Madison School of Pharmacy. The secretary of the U.S. Department Health and Human Services is a cabinet member, chosen by the president, and that department does oversee the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. And CMS negotiates drug prices for those receiving government-subsidized healthcare, setting a price that can dictate prices for the rest of the market as well, Elder said.  But the government is still not directly involved, because Congress doesn’t have the authority to tell companies — or the middle-man companies, called Pharmacy Benefits Managers — what to charge.  ""They can’t say you can’t charge more for a drug,"" he said.  Wenthur said the federal government actually plays little direct role in the setting of prices for the general public because it implemented rules to limit its own ability to influence drug prices. Also, the federal government is only one actor in the realm that sets the prices of prescription drugs. Other actors include health insurance companies, large employers, or other payers, all of which are typically represented by a Pharmacy Benefits Manager.  But unlike other stakeholders in the process, the government can modify the rules of the system that determines prices, Wenthur said. ""Whenever shortcomings in drug pricing or health care delivery are suggested to be the fault of any given administration, it generally implies that they haven’t been active enough in using their authority to optimize the system itself,"" he said.  When asked about the claim that Trump could lower prices, Baldwin’s office pointed to the letter, which notes the government could take over the production and distribution of the drug with compulsory licensing authority. That could be used to acquire lower-cost versions of the drug.  ""The U.S. government frequently used this authority in the 1960s to acquire lower-cost versions of the on-patent drugs, and has used it to acquire patented military equipment,"" the letter says. ""Some advocates have argued that using this authority could ‘provide adequate supply (of remdesivir) while pushing prices down.’"" That power has not been used since the 1960s and 1970s, according to a 2017 study in the Yale Journal of Law & Technology, though there has been a renewed push to once again rely on compulsory licensing authority due to rising drug costs. 
  But, in a Nov. 25, 2020 opinion piece in The Hill, Sean O’Connor, a professor of law and the executive director at the Center for the Protection of Intellectual Property at George Mason University, said that by using compulsory licensing, the government would essentially be stealing the patent for remdesivir from Gilead. And while the company would be able to sue the government for full compensation if that were to happen, he said, the government is not authorized to infringe on patents any more than everyday individuals.  ""Ultimately, drug prices are driven more by other factors in the health care system than by patent rights that incentivize lifesaving innovations,"" he said.  Pilar Ossorio, a professor of law and bioethics at UW-Madison said that while the U.S. government has the ability to ""take"" a patent and begin licensing a drug for production to drive down prices, it’s unlikely it will happen.  ""I think as a policy matter (the government) sees the right of intellectual property as so powerful and useful in the development of inventions,"" she said, that the government would be highly reluctant to take such a step because it would discourage other companies from pursuing their own advances.  And, she said, because of the emphasis the U.S. has put on the importance of intellectual property rights, there is a chance the U.S. Supreme Court could invalidate portions of the code that allows the government to take patents.  Baldwin says Americans are paying more for remdesivir than people in other countries, and the Trump Administration is to blame. The price element is correct. On average, Americans insured by private health insurance companies could be on the hook for an additional $780 over what people in countries with national health systems may pay.  But the blame element misses the mark. While Trump may have a slight influence over drug prices with his appointee to run the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there is really no way for the administration to step in and tell Gilead to charge less for remdesivir without a change in federal laws or invoking a rarely used maneuver to effectively seize the patent from the company. We rate this claim as Half True.",/factchecks/2020/dec/01/tammy-baldwin/yes-americans-pay-more-remdesivir-no-trump-adminis/

Raphael Warnock defended Jeremiah Wright’s damning of the mistreatment of Black people
","Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., has repeatedly used a video clip of a minister saying ""God damn America"" to attack her Democratic opponent, Raphael Warnock, who is himself a pastor. The clip, which caused controversy for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign, is from a sermon by Obama’s former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright of Chicago.  Loeffler used it in an ad claiming that Warnock defended Wright’s ""hatred"" and gave Wright ""an award for truth telling."" The ad leaves out important context. Warnock defended the Black church’s tradition of truth telling, including Wright’s sermon condemning America’s historical mistreatment of Black people. Warnock said people often confuse Black preachers’ moral outrage with hatred. A divinity school, not Warnock, honored Wright’s career in ministry at a 2008 event. Loeffler attacked Warnock in an ad that uses a black-and-white clip of Wright preaching, ""not God bless America, God damn America,"" but with the word damn bleeped.  Wright was Obama’s longtime pastor at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. During the 2008 campaign, ABC News aired a report that included excerpts of Wright’s sermons against racism and war.  In the most controversial video, from a 2003 sermon, Wright said that the government ""wants us to sing ‘God Bless America.’ No, no, no, not ‘God Bless America.’ God damn America — that's in the Bible — for killing innocent people. God damn America, for treating our citizens as less than human. ... The United States government has failed the vast majority of her citizens of African descent."" At the time of the report, Obama distanced himself from Wright and then resigned from Wright’s church.  In Loeffler’s current ad, separate pictures of Wright and Warnock appear on the screen. A narrator says: ""Warnock defended Jeremiah Wright's hatred, then gave him an award for truth telling.""  Next comes a split screen, with Wright shown preaching on the right. On the left, Warnock says in a TV interview: ""We celebrate Reverend Wright."" His quote is cut off and the narrator says: ""Warnock celebrated anti-American hatred,"" before a clip of Wright’s ""God (bleep) America"" is replayed. Loeffler has used the Wright clip in two other ads attacking Warnock and in an interview for a conservative podcast. The clip is also used in an ad by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and an ad by the Georgia Republican Party that attacks Warnock.  Warnock is the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the late Martin Luther King Jr. served. He faces Loeffler in one of two Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine which party controls the Senate. Loeffler’s campaign did not reply to our requests for information to back up Loeffler’s claim. But her ad cites sources, as does a website created by Loeffler campaign’s, RadicalRaphael.com. The ad cites an interview Warnock did in 2008 with Greta Van Susteren, a Fox News talk show host. Asked if he embraced Wright’s comments, Warnock replied:  ""We celebrate Reverend Wright in the same way that we celebrate the truth telling tradition of the Black church — which, when preachers tell the truth, very often it makes people uncomfortable. And I think that the country has been done a disservice by this constant playing over and over again of the same sound bite outside of context.""  Warnock noted that King was working on a sermon entitled, ""Why America May Go to Hell"" shortly before he was assassinated.  The website created by Loeffler’s campaign says that in 2013 Warnock defended Wright’s sermon as a ""very fine homily"" on God and government and had said the sermon was consistent with Black prophetic preaching.  Warnock did say those things in what was a 45-minute academic speech entitled, ""Piety or Protest: Black Theology and the Divided Mind of the Black Church."" But he explained that what Wright’s homily did was rail against injustice against Black people in America. Warnock said in the speech: ""The Black church, so central to Black life yet barely understood by mainstream America, was thrust to the center of the national dialogue. To be sure, part of the disconnect in the national dialogue was cultural, as those unexposed to the worship and preaching of the Black church sought to interpret the bombastic character of Black prophetic preaching as it is buoyed and heightened in the whooping moments by the emotive spirituality and exuberant response of those in the pews — you should show up to my church on a Sunday morning. ""In this way, there was a disconnect between Black and white Americans, as the latter were televisually translated to a Black church on any given Sunday morning, where preachers are expected — indeed encouraged — to speak the truth, tell Pharaoh and tell it like it is with clarity, creativity and passion. In that sense, Jeremiah Wright — whose sermon, by the way, you should read in its entirety;  it’s a very fine homily entitled, ‘On Confusing God and Government.’... ""The burning question within mainstream America was, What kind of church was this? What was the meaning of this kind of hate-filled preaching?..."" Warnock said it was futile amid the 2008 presidential campaign to try and answer those questions. He continued by saying: ""Yet, truthfully, if the Jeremiah Wright debacle revealed how little most white Americans understood about the Black church, it also underscored how little Black people, even Black church people, understood about Black theology…. ""Black theology is, in a real sense, a product of the Black church. And the Black church has been, at its best, the conscience of the American churches. The emergence of each represents a key moment in a long justice-making tradition, as Black people finding themselves trapped as chattel in a Christian slaveocracy and subjugated as second-class citizens in a caste system of Jim Crowe segregation justified by the theology and the practices of white churches Down South and Up South endeavor to work out for themselves an anti-racist appropriation of Christian faith…."" A Loeffler campaign document says Warnock was to give Wright an award at the Black Church Summit in Dallas in 2008, but that Wright did not attend the summit, citing security concerns amid the reaction to the ABC News story. Warnock attended the summit as an invited speaker, but he wasn’t involved with selecting Wright for an award. RELATED: 4 people want to be Georgia’s next 2 senators. The races could tip the Senate The summit was hosted by Brite Divinity School, which is affiliated with Texas Christian University and located on the TCU campus in Fort Worth, Texas. Brite had decided months before the ABC News story to make Wright the honoree of its fourth annual summit, based on his long career in ministry. Brite stayed with its plan following controversy over the ABC story, saying at the time: ""Contrary to media claims that Wright preaches racial hatred, church leaders who have observed his ministry describe him as a faithful preacher of the gospel who has ministered in a context radically different from that of many middle class Americans."" Wright did not attend the event, and other events around that time, out of security concerns following the ABC story.  Warnock’s campaign said he had no affiliation with Brite prior to the summit. Brite’s president, Newell Williams, who was also president at the time, said he does not believe Warnock had any prior connection to the school, did not recall that Warnock attended the summit and does not think he has ever met Warnock. Texas Christian University’s student news publication, in a news story cited by Loeffler’s campaign, reported at the time that Warnock said the public had confused moral outrage with hatred in response to claims that Black preachers promote hate from the pulpit. ""In fact, it’s inappropriate not to feel outrage in the face of injustice,"" he said. Warnock also said at the summit about the reaction to Wright’s sermons: ""Part of the reason the public is so shocked ... is that they have not heard the public voice of the liberated black church in a very long time. In a very real sense, it's an indictment of us."" Loeffler claimed that Warnock defended the ""hatred"" of Wright, the pastor who said in a 2003 sermon, ""not God bless America, God damn America,"" and that Warnock gave Wright ""an award for truth telling."" Wright’s sermon decried America’s historical mistreatment of Black people. What Warnock defended was Wright’s role as a preacher in the ""truth telling"" about that mistreatment. A Texas divinity school, not Warnock, honored Wright for his career in ministry. Loeffler’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

No proof that Kelly Loeffler will ensure protections for preexisting conditions
","Republicans for years have worked to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, the law that established the gold standard for protecting people with preexisting health conditions against discrimination in insurance pricing and coverage.  Those efforts include a lawsuit — backed by the Trump administration and Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler — that would overturn Obamacare. The case is awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court. Now Loeffler, campaigning in one of two Jan. 5 Georgia runoff elections that will determine which party controls the Senate, has advanced a new health care proposal — a ""framework"" she claims will ""ensure Americans with preexisting conditions are protected."" Previous GOP alternatives, including one from Georgia’s other senator, David Perdue, have fallen short of Obamacare’s protections for people with prior health problems.  Loeffler’s thinly detailed plan does, too.  ""There is nothing in the Loeffler plan that indicates she would support the policies necessary to protect Americans against insurer discrimination,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy and management, and of political science, at the University of North Carolina. ""The plan is short on details and substance, and long on political posturing."" RELATED: PolitiFact fact-checks and articles about the Georgia runoffs The existing Affordable Care Act was the first federal law to guarantee that people with health problems could buy their own insurance without paying more than healthier consumers.  Through multiple provisions, it prevents insurance companies from excluding patients with preexisting conditions. The ACA says carriers ""may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion."" It backs that up with another section that says they ""may not establish rules for eligibility"" based on health status, medical condition, claims experience or medical history. Another provision limits the premiums that can be charged to older policyholders. The Loeffler campaign did not provide us information to back up the senator’s claim that her proposal would ensure these protections. Loeffler released her four-page ""Modernizing Americans’ Health Care Plan"" on Nov. 13. As reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, it is a collection of more than one dozen new pieces of legislation sponsored or co-sponsored by Loeffler, along with three measures already signed into law.  The health care experts we spoke with said the plan lacked so many details that they were forced to make assumptions about what it might or might not include.   Joseph Antos, a health care scholar at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute, said because Loeffler’s plan does not mention repealing the ACA, ""the ACA's preexisting protections remain in place."" But Linda Blumberg, a fellow at the Urban Institute’s Health Policy Center, interpreted the plan differently. She said Loeffler’s plan ""would make adequate, affordable insurance for people with problems far less accessible than it is under current law."" Blumberg and other experts pointed to two provisions in Loeffler’s plan in saying that it would provide less protection than the ACA.  One provision would ""establish Guaranteed Coverage Plans to help cover patients with preexisting conditions."" No details are provided, but guaranteed issue generally refers to requiring insurers to cover any applicant. Before the ACA, such guaranteed coverage was sometimes provided through high-risk pools — non-group health coverage offered by states to customers who couldn’t otherwise obtain individual coverage. Such pools likely covered just a fraction of the people with preexisting conditions who lacked insurance, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, and they charged far more than what a typical person would pay in the non-group market.  If the Guaranteed Coverage Plans provision in Loeffler’s plan is a high-risk pool, Larry Levitt, KFF’s executive vice president for health policy wrote, ""it could provide help"" if it’s adequately funded. But ""the history of high-risk pools is that benefits were limited and premiums were high."" Other experts also said Loeffler’s proposal appears to be proposing high-risk pools. Health care consultant Robert Laszewski noted that Loeffler’s proposal has a specific plan for those who want their preexisting conditions covered, whereas all individual plans in the ACA’s exchanges cover preexisting conditions. Her Guaranteed Coverage Plans provision ""would seem to indicate she will have a plan that does not cover preexisting conditions, but then she will offer a special plan that will,"" Laszewski said, alluding to high-risk plans that ""tended to offer very limited and very expensive coverage."" Another provision in Loeffler’s plan would give low-income families with preexisting conditions a one-time federal tax credit toward Health Savings Account contributions. The fact that people with preexisting conditions would need separate plans ""sends a strong signal that they would no longer be guaranteed coverage or community rates in marketplace plans"" as they are under the ACA, and ""it seems likely that these plans would work like the high-risk pool plans,"" said law professor Wendy Netter Epstein, director of DePaul University’s Health Law Institute.  ""If those with preexisting conditions will only be able to get plans with fewer benefits and higher costs,"" she added, ""that explains why her proposal tries to help out low-income families with preexisting conditions with a one-time tax credit.""  Such a credit ""is like giving a family one bag of sand to protect their home as a hurricane rushes in,"" given that families with preexisting conditions can spend thousands of dollars more a year on medical care, said Allison Hoffman, a health care law expert at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law. ""There’s nothing substantive in Kelly Loeffler’s framework that would protect people with preexisting conditions anywhere near to the degree the Affordable Care Act does,"" Hoffman said.  Loeffler said her health care plan would ""ensure Americans with preexisting conditions are protected."" The plan lacks any detail to explain how it would provide protections that are at least as strong as the Affordable Care Act. Two of the plan’s provisions indicate it would make adequate and affordable insurance less accessible for people with preexisting conditions, experts say. Without evidence to back Loeffler’s claim, we rate it False. This fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.

No, the Denver Broncos didn’t sign Colin Kaepernick
","The Denver Broncos football team found themselves without a quarterback for their recent game against the New Orleans Saints after the league discovered some of the team’s players had been maskless around another player who tested positive for COVID-19. But the Broncos didn’t quickly sign former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to step in, as a recent Facebook post claimed. ""Breaking,"" the post said. ""Broncos signing Colin Kaepernick.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Kaepernick, who led the 49ers to the Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, has not played in the NFL since the 2016 season, when he began protesting police violence against Black Americans by sitting or kneeling during the pregame national anthem. In 2019, he and the NFL settled a grievance alleging that the league and team owners colluded to keep him out of football. For the Nov. 29 game against the Saints, the same COVID-19 protocols that prevented four eligible quarterbacks on the Broncos active roster from playing also precluded the team from signing Kaepernick.  News broke on Nov. 28 that the quarterbacks wouldn’t be able to play in the game the next day. It would have taken at least six days for Kaepernick to be eligible to play under the NFL’s COVID-19 rules. New players must remain in isolation for six days before joining a team.  Kendall Hinton, a practice squad receiver for the Broncos, filled in as quarterback on Nov. 29. The Broncos lost to the Saints 31-3. We rate this Facebook post False.",/factchecks/2020/nov/30/viral-image/no-denver-broncos-didnt-sign-colin-kaepernick/

Dane County 'fake votes' claim is ridiculous, based on lack of elections knowledge
","Much of the misinformation circulating widely amid the hard-fought 2020 election boils down to people unfamiliar with election processes making assumptions — trumpeting something as fraud when the issue is actually that they don’t understand the process. We saw a classic example of this in the latest baseless Gateway Pundit story about Wisconsin vote counting. The far-right purveyor of election nonsense published a story Nov. 28, 2020, with this headline: ""BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: THOUSANDS of fake votes found at Wisconsin Recount in Dane County – Photos and Report from GOP Observer."" This story, widely shared on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). The story — which also linked a long-since debunked claim about a ""dump"" of votes for Democrat Joe Biden in the middle of the night — contained nothing approaching proof of this claim. Here’s why this is both wrong and ridiculous. The closest thing to proof presented in the story is a sentence saying the signature (actually referring to initials) MLW was used on the ""fake votes."" It then shows a picture of a ballot with those initials. But those initials are under a section titled ""Absentee ballot issued by."" It’s where the issuing clerk puts their initials on every ballot. The Madison city clerk is Maribeth L. Witzel-Behl — in line with the initials cited in the story. In other words, those repeated initials are exactly what and where you would expect to find repeated initials on thousands of ballots. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell confirmed in an email the initials are simply those of the Madison clerk. When asked for proof that this picture showed votes were fake, Gateway Pundit Editor Jim Hoft changed the headline within minutes to say the votes were ""suspect"" rather than fake. And he briefly added a line to the story saying, ""Madison County attorneys contacted The Gateway Pundit to say the ballots were signed by the city clerk in Madison, Wisconsin."" That was later deleted. Of course, Hoft didn’t pass along this information to readers until he was challenged on the matter, and after the story had collected thousands of social media shares and comments. Aside from bungling the location — Madison is a city in Dane County — Hoft’s temporary change pointed out the obvious reason for the repeated initials, while still asserting there is something underhanded about the ballots. Which there isn’t. Hoft did not offer any other proof of his amended claim in the story or an email exchange. A story shared widely across social media said, ""More than 2,000 fake votes were found at the Wisconsin Recount in Dane County on Friday!"" An amended version instead referenced them as being ""suspect"" votes. Neither claim has any basis in reality. The repeated initials aren’t those of the voter, they’re initials of the clerk who issued the absentee ballots. That’s not sketchy, it’s just a basic element of how elections are administered.
