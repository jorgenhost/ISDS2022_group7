No evidence Joe Biden’s great-grandfather was Confederate soldier, enslaved people
","Did the vice president who served with America’s first Black president descend from a Confederate soldier who enslaved people? That’s the claim made by a viral image about Joe Biden, who served as vice president under Barack Obama (who himself has ancestors who enslaved people). The black-and-white image is included with a blog post shared widely on Facebook. Showing a man in what appears to be a military uniform and holding a rifle, it claims:  ""Joe Biden’s great-grandfather Joseph J. Biden (1828-1880) was a slave-owner and fought for the Confederate States of America.""  The June 22 blog post itself says: ""Hey!! Cancel Culture! Joe Biden's great-grandfather was a Confederate soldier and owned slaves.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There was not a Joseph J. Biden among Joe Biden’s grandfathers, great-grandfathers and great-great-grandfathers. And there isn’t evidence to back either part of the claim. Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, was born into a working class family in Scranton, Pa., that later moved to Delaware, where he served as a U.S. senator. He served as vice president starting with Obama’s first term in 2008. It was reported in 2007 that genealogists found that Obama, the American-born son of a white woman from Kansas and a Black man from Kenya, had a great-great-great-great grandfather and a great-great-great-great-great grandmother who each owned two slaves. We traced Biden’s ancestry on his father’s side, starting with his own father. Here’s what we found. Joe Biden Sr. held a number of jobs, including in used car and real estate sales. He died in 2002. Joseph H. Biden, an oil salesman, lived in Baltimore. He was born in 1893 — 28 years after the Civil War ended — and died in 1941, according to Smolenyak. George T. Biden lived in Baltimore County, Md., and worked as a produce dealer, according to a document from the 1910 Census. He was born around 1867, two years after the last of the enslaved people in the United States learned they were free, and died in 1933, according to genealogist Megan Smolenyak, who has written about the Biden family tree.  This Joseph H. Biden is from the Civil War period. A document from the 1870 Census shows that Joe Biden’s great-great-grandfather had the same name as Joe Biden’s grandfather. The document lists this Joseph H. Biden as a carpenter who lived in Baltimore County, Md.  He was on a draft registration list for the Union Army, according to a document provided to PolitiFact by genealogist Megan Smolenyak, but she said it doesn’t appear he served and there is no evidence he enslaved people. He died in 1895, she said. A State of Maryland slavery database lists no Bidens. People who were enslaved in Maryland were declared free in 1864. A National Park Service database of Civil War soldiers does not list Biden’s great-great-grandfather as having served for either side. Kurt Luther, professor of computer science at Virginia Tech and leader of a team that runs the Civil War Photo Sleuth online tool, said the surname Biden does not appear in various Civil War soldier databases he examined. Smolenyak also said she found no Confederates in the Biden family. Luther said the image we’re checking is of Richard Young Bennett, a Confederate soldier who served with Mississippi’s 2nd Infantry during the Civil War.  The fact-checkers Snopes and Lead Stories also found no evidence to back either the Confederacy or the slavery part of the claim. A blog post includes an image that says Biden’s great-grandfather, identified as Joseph J. Biden, was a Confederate soldier who enslaved people.  Biden’s great-great-grandfather was Joseph H. Biden. We found no evidence to indicate he was in the Confederacy or enslaved people.  We rate the post False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967ADD40>],/factchecks/2020/jun/26/viral-image/no-evidence-joe-bidens-great-grandfather-was-confe/

George Floyd’s hair does not differ in various images
","George Floyd was killed after a police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, and a blog post claiming his death was a false flag is not going to change that.  ""Why does George Floyd have hair in one shot but is bald in the shots of him laying on the ground?"" reads the headline of a June 15 blog post.  It compares two still video images: one showing Floyd standing in handcuffs with a visible hairline and another showing him being held on the ground by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. In the second image, which is quite blurry, Floyd appears bald.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Reuters reported that the second image was altered to blur Floyd’s hair. It was taken from graphic video footage showing Floyd’s death, starting around the 5:10-minute mark. His hairline is visible in the original footage. Floyd’s hair is also visible in security footage the Washington Post used to create a timeline of the moments leading up to Floyd’s death. Around the 2:20-minute mark, Floyd can be seen from above as he sits handcuffed against a wall. As he moves, his head looks different at different angles.  This blog post misleads readers to think Floyd’s death was staged. Video footage, witnesses, and autopsy reports prove otherwise.

"['Legal Issues', 'Wisconsin', 'Glenn Grothman']","
Wisconsin Congressman Grothman's bad-cop bill didn’t change the process
","Calls for police reform have taken center stage in the global protests against police brutality and systemic racism following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.  A number of cities across the country, including Milwaukee, are talking about reducing funding for police departments and putting the money toward social service programs. Others have talked about dismantling police departments and essentially starting over. On June 25, 2020, the House of Representatives passed a sweeping police reform bill that would, among other things, eliminate legal protections shielding police officers from lawsuits and make it easier to prosecute them for illegal actions.  U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah, decried the bill in an impassioned speech on the House floor before the vote, saying changes to qualified immunity would result in a ""timid"" police force.  He also referenced a bill he tried to pass in the Wisconsin state Senate that he said would have made it ""easier to get rid of an underperforming police officer."" It wasn’t the first time he mentioned that bill. In a June 16, 2020 tweet, the third-term congressman indicated he was ahead of the push to reform policing practices. ""As a state legislator, I sponsored legislation to make it easier to get rid of bad cops,"" Grothman tweeted. ""But Democrats' proposed police reforms are a disaster. Instead of focusing on punishing bad actors, they want to penalize the good cops."" Is Grothman right about the legislation he sponsored? Would it have made it ""easier to get rid of bad cops""? When asked for back up, Grothman pointed to a bill he introduced in the state Senate on February 15, 2008. Under the bill, which did not pass, a police officer or firefighter charged with a misdemeanor or felony could have been suspended without pay ""pending the disposition of charges."" Since then, the landscape has changed and similar reforms have been implemented. But we need to focus on where things stood at the time, and how Grothman’s bill would have changed things. When Grothman introduced his bill, Wisconsin police officers fired or suspended because they were charged with crimes continued to be paid until their cases were concluded. The bill would have eliminated that provision and discouraged what Grothman described as officers being paid ""to hang out and drag out the process.""  In an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Curt Witynski of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, who worked with Grothman on the bill, noted that the process for removing a police officer ""takes a long time.""  He echoed Grothman’s view that stopping officers from getting paid while they faced charges would have motivated them to get through the process.  ""There would be a desire for there to be a quick ending to the process,"" Witynski said of the bill, adding: ""It is legitimate to say that this would have made it easier for municipalities to get rid of bad cops faster."" But faster does not necessarily mean easier, which was how Grothman framed his claim. The proposed bill would not have made any changes to the process of removing an officer, such as reducing the number of steps or setting a specific timetable for appeals to be heard. Nor would it have reduced the legal standard for determining what is necessary to get rid of a problematic officer.  Additionally, it focused on officers facing legal charges — the misdemeanors and felonies. It did not cover officers who may have broken department rules, or did something questionable but were not charged. And it wouldn’t have prevented officers facing inquiries from quitting and moving on to a different policing job with a seemingly-clean record. A provision in the bill said police chiefs in cities smaller than Milwaukee could suspend a subordinate if the local police and fire commission failed to act after 181 days of the chief’s written move for the dismissal of an officer.  But an analysis from the Legislative Reference Bureau at the time found a chief had always had the ability to suspend a subordinate officer.  This provision would have just sped up the suspension process. It would not give police chiefs any additional authority.  As noted before, similar provisions have been passed in Wisconsin since Grothman’s bill failed to get enacted. Wisconsin law was changed later that year to immediately stop paying officers who were fired if they were charged with crimes. Lawmakers went further in 2009, ending pay for all Milwaukee officers as soon as they were fired, regardless of the reason for their dismissal, according to a June 24, 2011 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. An effort in 2011 by Republican state lawmakers to revert the rules back to the 2008 standard was vetoed by then-Gov. Scott Walker. The current process for removing a Milwaukee police officer has a number of steps. When an officer is accused of misconduct, the department places the officer on paid administrative suspension or limited duty during the investigation. If the police chief hands down a disciplinary suspension, the officer is not paid. A suspended Milwaukee officer can appeal a disciplinary suspension to the city Fire and Police Commission. A panel of commissioners then hears the appeal and determines if a rule was violated. If the panel determines a rule was broken, the commission then decides whether the discipline imposed was appropriate. After the commission makes its decision, an officer can appeal that decision to Milwaukee County Circuit Court, where a judge will make a ruling. An officer can then further appeal to the state Court of Appeals. Milwaukee police can only appeal suspensions of more than five days, and officers don’t get paid during appeals. Grothman said he sponsored legislation to make it easier to get rid of bad cops when he was a state legislator. His 2008 bill would have — at the time — removed the financial incentive for a charged officer to delay investigations and trial.  But the bill did not change the multi-step process of removing an officer, which can be slow and cumbersome. Nor would it have limited appeals or reduced the threshold for what behavior warrants firing.  Our definition of Mostly False is ""the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.

"['Florida', 'Dane Eagle']","
Florida congressional candidate blames antifa for violence without evidence
","A Republican running in a Florida congressional primary blames antifa for recent acts of violence and destruction in the United States, according to an ad running on social media.  State House Majority Leader Dane Eagle’s ad opens with a montage of images showing looting, assault, arson and a reference to the shooting death of a retired police captain. ""Antifa terrorists have declared war on our country,"" Eagle says as the ad begins. ""They are killing our police. Looting our businesses. Assaulting the elderly and burning our churches."" The ad portrays multiple national Democrats as being antifa sympathizers and includes a claim that former Vice President Joe Biden was ""bailing the terrorists out of jail.""  We found that some Biden campaign members — not the campaign itself — donated individually to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a nonprofit that pays bail for low-income people. But there is no suggestion that the individuals who received these funds are accused of terrorism, according to Greg Lewin, interim executive director for the fund. RELATED: No, George Soros and his foundations do not pay people to protest Eagle is one of many Republicans running in an August primary to replace U.S. Rep. Francis Rooney, who is retiring from the safe GOP seat in coastal southwest Florida. We wanted to take a closer look at the ad’s claim connecting antifa to these violent acts. Antifa refers to a collection of far-left, anti-fascist groups that rally against white supremacy and other causes, at times using violence. The antifa movement goes back decades, but regained attention after groups counterprotested white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. President Donald Trump and his allies have said that far-left groups, including antifa, are responsible for recent looting. But antifa, which is short for anti-fascist, is not an organization with an official membership, leader or base of operations. Some individuals self-identify with antifa. We asked Eagle’s campaign for evidence that antifa was behind the violence and looting shown in the ad. Campaign manager Terry Miller responded with general statements but did not provide specific evidence. Miller said that U.S. Attorney General William Barr identified antifa as sowing unrest and violence during peaceful demonstrations. Barr in a May 31 statement said, ""The violence instigated and carried out by antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly."" Thousands of people have been arrested amid the nationwide protests following Floyd’s death, not all for acts of violence. The number has included curfew violators, working press and others. It isn’t possible to know how many were motivated by any particular political belief or association, but government intelligence reports, media reports and interviews with experts show no evidence that antifa played any significant role. Let’s take a look at each image that flashes as Eagle makes each part of his claim: (Screenshot from Twitter) ""Killing our police"": The ad shows a picture of a tweet by Trump about David Dorn, a retired St. Louis police captain who was working security at a pawn shop June 2 when he was fatally shot. The killing happened on a night of violence about a week after Floyd’s death. Two men  were charged with murder, but court documents explaining charges against them make no mention of antifa. ""There is absolutely no evidence to support the allegation of antifa’s involvement of the killing of former Capt. David Dorn,"" Allison Hawk, a spokesperson for Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner told PolitiFact in an email. (Screenshot from Twitter) ""Looting our businesses"": The video that rolls resembles video of looting that was uploaded by a Russian magazine. We traced the video to an instance of looting at a store in Santa Monica, Calif., in late May. News reports we read did not mention evidence that antifa was behind the looting there. A police captain told us that the investigation is ongoing, but there is currently no evidence to support that the suspects identified with antifa.  (Screenshot from Twitter) ""Assaulting the elderly"": Another clip in the ad resembles news footage of an attack on a woman in Rochester, N.Y., outside the Rochester Fire Equipment Co.. A woman in the video pleaded with people smashing the building to stop.  A city spokesperson told us there was no evidence that antifa was involved and the victim was in her 20s. (Screenshot from Twitter) ""Burning our churches"": Eagle’s campaign told us that the video clip of the fire in the ad was St. John’s Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., where riots on May 31 followed peaceful protests. No arrests have been made in that incident, but a police spokesperson told us that there is no evidence to suggest members of antifa are responsible.  We found one image in Eagle’s ad did show antifa supporters in Portland, Ore., but the ad omits any context. The photo, which shows masked people lock-armed in a row wearing black, was taken Aug. 17, 2019, when antifa followers faced off against right-wing protesters at an event organized by a former InfoWars staffer.  Three experts in extremism or antifa told us that they found no evidence that antifa was the instigator behind any of the violence that erupted amid otherwise peaceful protests following Floyd’s death. Mark Bray, a Rutgers University lecturer and author of a book about antifa, called claims about antifa’s involvement ""an attempt by Trump and like-minded people to create a bogeyman."" Bray pointed to a report by The Nation based on a leaked internal report by the FBI’s Washington field office. It found ""no intelligence indicating antifa involvement/presence"" in the violence that occurred on May 31 during the D.C.-area protests. Most of the looting was done by people with no affiliation or political objectives, said Seth Jones, an expert on counterrorism at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""I have seen no credible evidence that organized groups — whether antifa, anarchists, white supremacists, or anti-government militia — have been behind most of the looting,"" said Jones, who has interviewed individuals from FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces as well as local law enforcement agencies. We asked the FBI if it had evidence that antifa is behind any looting or property destruction in recent weeks in the United States. A spokesperson replied ""no comment."" The U.S. Justice Department media office did not respond to our emails asking about antifa. However, a spokesperson told the Washington Post’s Fact Checker that ""we do not collect statistics based on potential inspiration but on unlawful acts according to statute."" The Post found that police had arrested more than 14,000 people across 49 cities, thousands for low-level crimes. Of roughly 80 federal charges the Post found, none cited an antifa plot. Many were arrested for minor, nonviolent offenses such as violating curfew or carrying an open container. The New York Times review of dozens of arrests on federal charges showed no coordinated effort by antifa.  Eagle said in a social media ad that antifa ""are killing our police, looting our businesses, assaulting the elderly and burning our churches."" Eagle’s campaign broadly blames antifa for violence and property destruction, echoing a statement by U.S. Attorney General William Barr. But the campaign didn’t point to proof that antifa was behind any specific act of violence or criminal behavior.  We found no evidence that antifa has played any significant role in any of the violence that broke out amid recent peaceful protests against police brutality. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C24FA00>],/factchecks/2020/jun/26/dane-eagle/florida-congressional-candidate-blames-antifa-viol/

A ‘face mask exempt card’ doesn’t exempt you from wearing a mask in public
","As more cities impose mandatory mask-wearing rules, some Americans are looking for loopholes. Enter the so-called ""face mask exempt card.""  A June 23 Instagram post shows a photo of a laminated card that says it exempts the owner from ""any ordinance requiring face mask usage in public."" The image bears the seal of the U.S. Justice Department and includes a logo for another entity called the FTBA. ""Wearing a face mask posses a mental and/or physical risk to me,"" reads text on the card, spelling error included. ""Under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), I am not required to disclose my condition to you."" Below the text, there’s the ADA phone number for reporting violations, followed by potential fines for offending businesses and organizations.  ""Denying access to your business/organization will be also reported to FTBA for further actions,"" reads the card, which includes a link to ftbagency.com. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)  Similar posts started circulating on conservative Facebook pages in late April and early May. The first instance of the ""face mask exempt card"" we could find was posted in several pro-Donald Trump and Fox News fan groups on June 20, according to CrowdTangle, an audience metrics tool. (Screenshot from Instagram) The advisory is not real. The FTBA — which stands for the Freedom to Breathe Agency — is not a part of the U.S. government. ""These postings were not issued by the Department and are not endorsed by the Department,"" the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement published on the ADA website. ""The Department urges the public not to rely on the information contained in these postings."" The FTBA website was registered June 12, according to public domain records, and it now appears to be down. FTBA’s Facebook group, which had more than 5,000 members and was created in early June, also appears to be offline. While the card is phony, we wondered whether there is a point about citing an ADA exemption for face masks to evade some state and local mask requirements. The ADA only provides legal protections to Americans who genuinely have disabilities. Legal experts say it’s possible that there could be some situations in which businesses may have to adjust their practices to accommodate people who cannot wear a mask and comply with the law. It’s also possible that some people could abuse the ADA to try to get around mask requirements. ""People that are not disabled are not protected by the ADA,"" said Vinh Nguyen, project director at the Southwest ADA Center. ""I realize that does not prevent people from lying."" Governments have broad authority to issue health mandates in a pandemic. From New York to California, dozens of states across the country have implemented requirements for people to wear face masks in certain public spaces. The legal framework for mask requirements varies across the country. ""Think of it like this: The government has the right to ban smoking in public places because your smoking can affect my health,"" wrote Al Tompkins of the Poynter Institute in a June 22 column. (Poynter owns PolitiFact.) ""And some places have signs that say, ‘No shirt, no shoes, no service.’ Just add ‘no mask’ to the sign."" The Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability, does not specifically say anything about face masks. However, there may be situations in which, by requiring people to wear face masks in public, businesses would need to consider aspects of the ADA.  As uncomfortable as masks are we’ve all gotten used to them by now, but some people are saying you can use ADA cards as exemptions from public mandates to wearing them. But is it legit? A post shared by  MediaWise (@mediawise) on Jun 25, 2020 at 12:07pm PDT For example, let’s say you’re deaf and primarily rely on lip-reading to communicate. You go to pick up takeout from a restaurant that requires everyone to wear face masks, including employees. Since you can’t read the employees’ lips, that business must provide ""auxiliary aids and services"" so they don’t deny you service, according to the ADA. Perhaps the cashier could communicate with you via text message or a dry-erase board to complete your order. ""What the ADA basically mandates is that they have to consider serving the customer in another way,"" Nguyen said. ""They don’t have to allow entry into the actual store."" There also may be a case in which a customer has a respiratory condition where their breathing cannot be restricted. Similar to the previous example, a business would not have to alter its mask policy to comply with the ADA; it could provide curbside pickup or delivery. It’s true that, per the ADA, businesses are not allowed to ask customers specific questions about their disabilities.  ""They cannot ask for medical documentation,"" said Robin Jones, director of the Great Lakes ADA Center. ""They can ask if you’re not wearing a mask due to a disability, but they cannot ask me what my disability is."" That creates a situation in which people could potentially abuse the law to try to get around mask requirements. ""We know that people abuse these things — just like people take their dogs into places and claim they’re a service animal,"" Jones said. ""This is just unfortunately the nature of human nature. There is no good way for an entity to monitor that."" RELATED: Yes, Gov. Newsom has the authority to make masks mandatory In California, legal experts say The ADA permits retailers to deny goods or services to customers if they pose a ""direct threat"" to the health and safety of others — but only when the threat cannot be mitigated by changing their practices or procedures. That stipulation may apply if someone without a mask exhibits COVID-19 symptoms in a business that requires face coverings. ""In this type of scenario, where there’s a chance where an unmasked person may transmit the virus to their employees or to their other customers, they have a right to restrict people from coming into the store,"" Nguyen said. An Instagram post claimed that a ""face mask exempt card"" allows you to cite the ADA and not wear a mask. The advisory is not real. The FTBA is not a part of the U.S. government, and the ADA only provides legal protections to Americans who genuinely have disabilities. Legal experts say it’s possible that there could be some situations in which businesses may have to alter their operations to comply with the law. It’s also possible that some people could abuse the ADA to try to get around mask requirements. But that does not mean those people are exempt from wearing face masks.

Exploring the spike in coronavirus cases in one Central Texas county
","Coronavirus infections are on the rise in Texas, with some areas experiencing a more dramatic increase than others. In Central Texas, Austin and its surrounding counties have reported an increase in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations. Hays County, which sits to the south of Austin, has been hit particularly hard. On June 19, the county reported more active cases than Austin’s Travis County — a remarkable feat considering that Travis County’s population is five times that of Hays County. U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat whose district includes parts of both counties, shared two tweets about the Austin area, including one highlighting the impact of the virus in Hays County. ""Hays County is one of the only places in Texas with more trouble: an incredible 845% increase in cases since June 7,"" he wrote. There’s no question Hays County has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, but is Doggett’s figure accurate?  Hays County increase tied to activities In response to a question from PolitiFact Texas, Hays County spokeswoman Kim Hilsenbeck shared a press release outlining the impact of the coronavirus in the county since the onset of the pandemic. During April and early May — when local and statewide orders to stay at home were in place — the number of new daily cases in the county ranged from zero to ten. In late April, Gov. Greg Abbott initiated the first phase of a plan to reopen the state’s economy and allowed the statewide stay-at-home order to expire. He also allowed restaurants, retail stores, malls and movie theaters to reopen at limited capacity. In subsequent phases, Abbott allowed barbershops and salons to reopen with limited capacity and other restrictions. He also allowed rivers, parks and other natural areas to reopen.  County health officials said they believe the gradual reopening of businesses might have contributed to an increase in COVID-19 cases.  ""Through contact tracing, our health department staff were able to see the rapid increase in COVID-19 totals seemed to coincide with activities such as working at or going to restaurants and bars, activities such as floating the river, and attending large public gatherings,"" the release reads.  Hilsenbeck also highlighted Mothers Day (May 10), Memorial Day (May 25) and protests against racism and police brutality as significant events in May. By the end of May and early June, the number of new cases in the county started to rise. On May 27 there were 18 new cases. On June 8, there were 43 new cases.  More recently, the number of new daily cases in Hays County has ranged from 100 to 200.  In April and May, the majority of new cases in the county were primarily in Kyle among people older than 30 who were Hispanic.  But since early June, the group experiencing the largest increase in new COVID-19 cases is 20 to 29-year-olds in San Marcos. The number of people who identified as Hispanic has decreased. ""While not all 20-29-year-olds are college students, San Marcos has a large student population because of Texas State University, many of whom are now back in town following a period of virtual learning throughout the spring,"" the release reads. Examining data on new cases Doggett spokeswoman Kate Stotesbery said the figure he shared came from a graph published by an Austin-area television station.  The graph shows the number of new coronavirus cases that have been reported each day in Hays County since April, plus a line showing the 14-day average of daily new cases. An arrow pointing upwards is overlaid on the graphic, with text on top that reads: ""845% 14-day average since June 7."" But Doggett’s remark on Twitter is missing that detail — that there has been an 845% increase in the 14-day average of new COVID-19 cases in the county since June 7. The increase in the actual number of cases is much higher. On June 7, the cumulative number of cases in the county was 385 and the number of new daily cases had been fluctuating. There were 24 new cases on June 2, 14 new cases on June 4 and zero new cases on June 7. By June 21, the cumulative count of cases in Hays County was 1,608, with 57 new cases reported that day. Looking at the 14-day average of new cases, it was 8 on June 7 and 87 on June 21. But the 7-day average is a more commonly used measurement by government agencies and news outlets to assess changes in the number of new cases in the area. The change in that figure during this period is substantially higher. Using weekly averages instead of daily tallies offers a more accurate picture of change over time, as it reduces the impact of daily spikes. From June 7 to June 21, Hays County experienced a roughly 1,569% increase in the 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases — from 8 cases on June 7 to 134 on June 21. Our ruling Doggett said that Hays County had experienced ""an incredible 845% increase in cases since June 7."" Doggett was actually speaking about an increase in the 14-day average of new COVID-19 cases — a less common measurement of the increase in COVID-19 cases in an area — but his figure is accurate.  We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A297AC0>],/factchecks/2020/jun/26/lloyd-doggett/exploring-spike-coronavirus-cases-one-central-texa/

Fact-checking Nancy Pelosi’s claim of high public support for 'Dreamers'
","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed that President Donald Trump is standing in the way of legislation that would benefit young immigrants here illegally, even though most Republicans, Democrats and independents are for it. In a June 23 Telemundo interview, Pelosi criticized Trump for saying his administration would try again to revoke Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that prevents deportation of immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States when they were children. She went on to cite support for this group of immigrants, commonly called ""Dreamers,"" because of stalled proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act that would protect them from deportation. ""Eighty percent of the American people support our Dreamers,"" Pelosi said. ""Over 70% think they should have a path to citizenship, and that's Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody."" In 2017, Pelosi made a similar claim about broad public support for these immigrants, which we rated True. We decided to fact-check her latest claim to see if her argument still holds. For this fact check, we interpreted Pelosi’s claims of support levels as referring to each of the three groups of voters. By this measure, Pelosi’s claim is mostly accurate, but needs clarification. While large majorities overall support letting the immigrants stay and apply for citizenship, support among Republicans runs much lower. On the citizenship question, GOP support is not over 70% in the polls we looked at, including the one Pelosi referred us to. RELATED: Republicans and Democrats claim to support Dreamers. So why can’t they pass a law? For nearly 20 years, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have crafted versions of legislation that would offer the immigrants a path to U.S. citizenship. No bill has passed both chambers of Congress, as neither party has been willing to concede on other immigration priorities. Opponents of the bills say they reward people for breaking the law and encourage illegal immigration.  The Obama administration’s DACA program allowed these immigrants to apply periodically for permission to stay and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation. The U.S. Supreme Court on June 18 ruled against a Trump administration effort to rescind DACA, saying the administration did not follow proper procedures to end the program. Democrats cheered the ruling and renewed their call for a legislative solution. A national survey cited by Pelosi’s office and other polls from the Pew Research Center and CBS News support Pelosi’s claim of widespread support for letting the immigrants stay. Pelosi’s office pointed to a Politico/Morning Consult national poll in mid-June, in which 61% of respondents said ""Dreamers"" should be allowed to stay and become citizens if they meet certain requirements; 17% said they should be allowed to stay and become legal permanent residents, but not citizens. So 78% support letting ""Dreamers"" stay. A June 4-10 survey from Pew Research Center showed similarly high support for ""Dreamers,"" finding that 74% of Americans favor a law that would provide them permanent legal status. A CBS News poll done May 29-June 2 found that 85% of respondents favored letting ""Dreamers"" stay, if they meet certain requirements. Another poll, commissioned by America’s Voice, FWD.us, and the Immigration Hub and done by Global Strategy Group May 27-June 3, found 72% of registered voters in 12 battleground states supported offering citizenship to ""Dreamers"" who met certain conditions. Pelosi claimed that over 70% of Democrats, Republicans and independents say ""Dreamers"" should have a path to citizenship. But Pelosi’s claim requires some clarification regarding Republican support. Pelosi’s office referred us to a 2019 nationwide survey of 800 likely November 2020 general election voters. According to that survey, from Global Strategy Group, support for making ""Dreamers"" eligible for citizenship, if they meet certain criteria, was 90% among Democrats, 71% among independents and 64% among Republicans. More recent polling shows similar variations by party affiliation: the May 27-June 3 poll by Global Strategy Group found that support for citizenship for ""Dreamers"" was 88% among Democrats, 69% among independents and 57% among Republicans. Pew’s early June poll found that 91% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents favor granting legal status to ""Dreamers,"" while half of Republicans and Republican leaners (54%) said the same. (Pew didn’t specifically ask about citizenship, yet granting legal status, such as a green card, can lead to naturalized citizenship.) Politico/Morning Consult’s June poll also showed that over 70% of Democrats supported allowing ""Dreamers"" to become citizens, but that support was below 70% among independents and Republicans. The CBS poll did not ask specifically about citizenship or legal status; it broadly asked respondents whether they favored allowing ""Dreamers"" to stay: 95% of Democrats were in favor, compared with 84% of independents and 73% of Republicans. Pelosi said, ""80% of the American people support our Dreamers. Over 70% think they should have a path to citizenship, and that's Democrats, Republicans, independents."" Pelosi’s claim of overall support for ""Dreamers"" is sound, but her claim weakens when she groups Republicans among the over 70% who support giving them a path to citizenship. Several polls show that support from Republicans for citizenship for ""Dreamers"" is not as high. Pelosi’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966411C0>],/factchecks/2020/jun/26/nancy-pelosi/fact-checking-nancy-pelosis-claim-high-public-supp/

The organization that grew out of the movement has been prominent in national protests over the Minneapolis death of George Floyd in police custody on May 25. Antifa is an umbrella term for a movement of far-left anti-fascists, and is not a unified organization. EdinburghLive.com reported that the flyers were found in Baxter Park in Dundee, Scotland.

Arizona Sen. McSally makes health care pledge that contradicts past votes, policy positions
","Trailing Democratic challenger Mark Kelly in one of the country’s most hotly contested Senate races, Arizona Sen. Martha McSally is seeking to tie herself to an issue with across-the-aisle appeal: insurance protections for people with preexisting health conditions. ""Of course I will always protect those with preexisting conditions. Always,"" the Republican said in a TV ad released June 22. The ad comes in response to criticisms by Kelly, who has highlighted McSally’s votes to undo the Affordable Care Act. That, he argued, would leave Americans with medical conditions vulnerable to higher-priced insurance. The Arizona Senate race has attracted national attention and is considered a toss-up, though Kelly is leading in many polls. McSally’s attempt to present herself as a supporter of protecting people with preexisting conditions — a major component of the 2010 health law — is part of a larger pattern in which vulnerable Republican incumbents stake out positions advocating for this protection while also maintaining the GOP’s strong stance against the ACA. McSally, who was appointed by the governor to take over John McCain’s Senate seat in 2019, used similar messaging in her failed 2018 bid for the state’s other Senate position. And President Donald Trump echoed the declaration at a June 23 rally in Phoenix, saying McSally — along with the rest of the Republican Party — ""will always protect people with preexisting conditions."" With that in mind, we decided to take a closer look. We contacted McSally’s campaign, which cited her support of a different piece of legislation, the Protect Act. But independent experts told us that legislation doesn’t satisfy the standard she sets out. Only one national law makes sure people with preexisting medical conditions don’t face discrimination or higher prices from insurers. It’s the Affordable Care Act. Both as a member of the House of Representatives and as a senator, McSally has supported efforts to undo the health law — voting in 2015 to repeal it and in 2017 to replace it with the Republican-backed American Health Care Act, which would have permitted insurers to charge higher premiums for people with complicated medical histories. ""Anyone who voted for that bill was voting to take away the ACA’s preexisting condition protections,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. ""Sen. McSally is trying to erase history for electoral purposes."" Especially as COVID-19 cases climb, health care— and, in particular, the ACA — has emerged as a flashpoint in the Arizona election, said Dr. Daniel Derksen, a professor of public health, medicine and nursing at the University of Arizona. ""Martha McSally has in her actions, in her votes, been pretty consistent about cutting back benefits and trying to repeal the ACA without any clear plan in mind that would protect people who gained insurance through the ACA,"" Derksen added. ""Her words on preexisting condition protections don’t align with any votes I’ve seen."" McSally’s campaign argued that the ACA is just one strategy, and a flawed one at that. Dylan Lefler, her campaign manager, instead pointed to her support of the Republican-backed Protect Act as evidence to back up her promise. Specifically, it ostensibly bans insurance plans from ""impos[ing] any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to … coverage,"" per the bill text. The problem, though, is that simply banning that exclusion isn’t enough, because the law also has to make sure the health insurance plans that cover pre-existing conditions remain affordable. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), does nothing to provide subsidies or cost-sharing mechanisms -- meaning people both with and without pre-existing conditions wouldn’t necessarily be able to afford those plans. Without that framework, the act remains a ""meaningless promise,"" argued Linda Blumberg, a fellow at the Urban Institute, a social policy think tank. And it has other holes: for instance, permitting insurers to charge women more than men. ""No six-page bill is ever the way of achieving something,"" said Thomas Miller, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""This is a check-the-box effort to try to say, ‘We’re [moving] in that direction.’"" It’s not just legislation. There’s also Texas v. Azar, a pending case in which a group of Republican attorneys general are arguing the Supreme Court should strike the entire health law, including its preexisting condition protections. The Trump administration has sided with the Republican states. McSally has consistently declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying she doesn’t want to weigh in on ""a judicial proceeding."" In reporting this fact check, we asked where she stood on the case. The campaign didn’t specifically answer, but pointed to her general disapproval of the ACA. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have called on the administration to reverse its stance. That context makes McSally’s silence especially relevant, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University. ""When given the opportunity, she has declined to oppose this lawsuit, which would essentially eliminate the protections that exist,"" Corlette said. So — big picture? McSally’s record in Washington hasn’t been one of preserving or building on preexisting condition protections. In her new TV ad, McSally claims she will ""always protect those with preexisting conditions."" But nothing in her voting record, which tracks closely with the Republican repeal-and-replace philosophy, supports this claim. And she has continually declined opportunities to oppose a pending legal threat to the ACA, including its provisions related to preexisting conditions, by a group of GOP governors and supported by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the legislation her campaign cited to justify her stance falls short in terms of meaningfully protecting Americans with preexisting medical conditions. McSally has not in the past or present taken actions that back up her statement. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DE2DC0>],/factchecks/2020/jun/25/martha-mcsally/arizona-senate-candidate-makes-health-care-pledge-/

Why your phone has ‘COVID-19 exposure logging’
","You may have noticed there are new settings on your phone for tracking COVID-19. What’s that all about? Not an unauthorized surveillance plot, as one popular social media rumor suggests. ""Remember a few days ago when everyones phone was acting crazy?"" reads a June 24 Facebook post, which is a screenshot of a comment on a live video. ""Well they put a covid tracker on every phone. Go look its there on your phone right now."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar claims have been shared widely by other Facebook and Instagram users, including a rapper with more than 420,000 followers. Having a health tracker installed on every Android and iOS device may sound invasive, so we wanted to investigate. (Screenshot from Facebook) We’re not sure what the Facebook post means when it says phones were ""acting crazy,"" but Snopes reported that a network outage June 15 affected primarily T-Mobile customers. While there are settings on your iPhone for ""COVID-19 Exposure Logging,"" you must opt in to the feature, which is aimed at helping contact tracers slow the spread of the coronavirus. Few states have said they will use the technology, which comes with a slew of privacy restrictions. Apple and Google have created technology to help public health officials. But the subtext of the Facebook post — that the companies are tracking users without their knowledge — is inaccurate. In April, Apple and Google announced they were building a tracking system for iOS and Android mobile operating systems. The feature, samples of which were released in early May, uses Bluetooth Low Energy signals to automatically send users notifications when they have come in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 and who has also enabled the technology. Apple rolled out the new settings with iOS 13.5 on May 20. The feature would work like this:  Say you’re diagnosed with COVID-19. You have a contact tracing app from your local public health department on your phone, so you report your diagnosis. Then, with your consent, the app uses your phone’s Bluetooth data to find other cellphone users you’ve been in contact with over the past 14 days (which is how long people could spread the virus without showing symptoms). Finally, if those people have consented to using the technology, the system notifies them that they were potentially exposed to the coronavirus. (Screenshot from Google) The tracking system is aimed at helping public health officials conduct contact tracing, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is a key part of reopening the country. Contact tracing tasks public health workers with learning as much as they can about who a patient has been in contact with so they can be notified about their potential exposure. One way to think about the process is a series of ""disease investigations."" ""That’s like the nickname for them. It’s investigative work — you’ve got to learn everything about this person that you can, and you have to help them recall what they did over the last 14 days,"" Jerne Shapiro, a lecturer in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Florida, previously told PolitiFact. ""This is called ‘shoe-leather epidemiology.’"" Some public health experts have extolled the potential of the Apple-Google partnership in helping epidemiologists quickly track down potential COVID-19 patients. The thinking is that, by limiting the amount of time someone is unknowingly spreading the coronavirus, the number of new cases would decrease. ""Once we have the capability to test as many people as want to get tested, the capability of the human resource side — to put somebody in isolation who is positive, to find out who their contacts were and put them into quarantine — that is your strongest tool to prevent the spread of the disease,"" Shapiro said. Some social media users and experts have raised concerns over how cellphone users’ data could potentially be misused by Apple, Google and public health authorities. But the contact tracing system has some built-in privacy settings that aim to safeguard users’ data. First, to participate in the tracking programs, users must install one of the authorized public health apps and then choose to turn on the COVID-19 exposure notifications (which they can turn off at any time). Second, location data is not stored in the system — just Bluetooth identifiers, which change frequently and do not give other users, Apple or Google the identities of their owners. Finally: ""Only public health authorities will have access to this technology, and their apps must meet specific criteria around privacy, security and data control,"" according to an FAQ about the feature. Apple and Google have said they will shut down the feature once the pandemic ends. RELATED: Contact tracing: How it's used to fight COVID-19 As of June 5, few states have said they will use the contact tracing system. 9to5Mac, a website that writes about Apple products, polled all 50 state governors’ offices and health departments in late May to see if any were planning to use the technology. Only four — Alabama, North Dakota, South Carolina and Virginia — said they would. Seventeen states said they would not use the system, and the rest did not respond.  A poll from Business Insider had similar results. Many states told the publication that they intended to rely on human contact tracers. Other challenges facing Apple and Google’s technology: It’s hard to get people to download apps from public health officials, the federal government hasn’t endorsed the approach, and it’s unclear whether Bluetooth contact tracing systems have been effective in other countries, such as Norway. We reached out to Google for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. A social media rumor claims that Google and Apple ""put a covid tracker on every phone."" The technology companies created a system that notifies cellphone users when they’ve been exposed to a COVID-19 patient who was enabled the same technology. The system aims to help public health officials slow the spread of the coronavirus by limiting the amount of time infected people who don’t show symptoms unknowingly spread the virus. But the subtext of the Facebook post — that the companies are using the system to track users without their knowledge — is inaccurate. iPhone and Android users must opt in to the feature, and personal information like location data will not be shared.

No, OSHA does not say that 'masks don’t work' against COVID-19
","When it comes to fighting the spread of COVID-19, the consensus among health authorities is that masks provide some measure of protection for people around the wearers. So, has the federal agency charged with ensuring healthy conditions in the workplace declared that face coverings don’t work, and actually pose a health risk? That’s the claim of an article (archived here) widely shared on Facebook that carries this headline: ""OSHA says masks don't work — and violate OSHA oxygen levels."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In fact, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Department of Labor, recommends the use of masks. Initially, the lead federal agency on the coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, did not recommend face coverings. That changed in April: ""We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (‘asymptomatic’) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (‘pre-symptomatic’) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.  In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission."" The article we’re checking is on a website called GreenMedInfo. The article doesn’t have text per se, but rather two videos and links to OSHA web pages.  But we found that on its website, OSHA repeatedly recommends the use of face coverings: From OSHA’s ""COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions"": Cloth face coverings are worn in public over the nose and mouth ""to contain the wearer's potentially infectious respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and to limit the spread"" of the coronavirus.  From OSHA’s ""Guidance on Returning to Work"":  Employers must determine PPE (personal protective equipment) such as gloves, surgical masks and face shields) are necessary for employees.  From OSHA’s ""Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19"": ""Provide a face mask, if feasible and available, and ask the person to wear it, if tolerated. ...Most workers at high or very high exposure risk likely need to wear gloves, a gown, a face shield or goggles, and either a face mask or a respirator, depending on their job tasks and exposure risks."" A Department of Labor spokeswoman told PolitiFact that OSHA ""generally recommends that employers encourage workers to wear face coverings at work. Face coverings are intended to prevent wearers who have COVID-19 without knowing it from spreading potentially infectious respiratory droplets to others.  ""OSHA has not suggested they are ineffective for that purpose."" The spokeswoman also said OSHA has not made any determination on whether masks have any impact on oxygen levels.  A Facebook post claims ""OSHA says masks don't work"" to reduce COVID-19 transmission ""and violate OSHA oxygen levels."" OSHA actively recommends masks, when appropriate, in the workplace, and has made no determination on whether they affect a person’s oxygen levels.  We rate the post False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973CD880>],/factchecks/2020/jun/25/facebook-posts/no-osha-does-not-say-masks-dont-work-against-covid/

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that millions of illegal votes cost him popular vote victory
","President-elect Donald Trump provoked a firestorm on social media with a series of tweets on Nov. 27 that questioned the integrity of the balloting that elected him president. In one tweet, Trump wrote, ""In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."" In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally He later tweeted, ""Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!"" These tweets offer a cornucopia of assertions we’ve already debunked, including the notion that Trump won the Electoral College in a ""landslide"" (False), that he won the popular vote (Pants on Fire), and that 3 million votes were cast by illegal aliens (False). We found zero evidence for Trump’s charge that he ""won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,"" and a lot of reasons to conclude that it didn’t happen. The current status of the vote Almost three weeks after Election Day, the ballots are mostly — but not entirely — counted. The most comprehensive vote-tracking analysis is published by David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As of noon on Nov. 28, according to Wasserman’s calculations, Hillary Clinton led Trump by roughly 2.24 million votes -- specifically, 64,654,483 for Clinton, 62,418,820 for Trump, and 7,192,036 for other candidates. Late ballot tabulations in some states are still trickling in -- many of them states, such as California, where Clinton fared overwhelmingly well. For this reason, Wasserman tweeted on Nov. 26 that Clinton seems to be on track to win the popular vote by 2.5 million to 2.7 million votes, or a margin of about 2 percentage points over Trump. So to erase Trump’s popular-vote deficit, there would need to be almost 3 million votes for Clinton that were cast illegally. And that assumes that all 3 million of these ""illegal votes"" went to Clinton and not a single one went to Trump. That’s a really big number. For a sense of scale, 3 million votes is more than were cast for any presidential candidate in 36 states plus the District of Columbia. And 3 million people is more than a quarter of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States — a group that InfoWars specifically singled out as the source of 3 million illegal votes. A lack of evidence As we’ve previously noted, conspiracy-minded websites — notably Alex Jones’ InfoWars — have posted articles claiming that 3 million votes in the presidential election were ""cast by illegal aliens."" We rated that False. As evidence of its claim, InfoWars’ headline referred to a report from VoteFraud.org and tweets from Gregg Phillips, whose Twitter profile says he’s the founder of VoteStand, a voter fraud reporting app. However, there is no report from VoteFraud.org, and Phillips told PolitiFact he is not affiliated with that website. Tweets by Phillips on Nov. 11 and Nov. 13 said that ""we have verified more than 3 million votes cast by non-citizens"" and that Phillips had ""completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team."" Phillips has not responded to PolitiFact’s queries for additional information. He told us previously that he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy. Phillips would not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used. He said he would release the information publicly once he is finished. On a Nov. 28 conference call with reporters, Trump spokesman Jason Miller mentioned two pieces of evidence that Trump had also cited earlier in the campaign. One was a 2012 Pew Center on the States study whose author denies that it found any evidence of voter fraud. The other was a 2014 article posted on the Monkey Cage blog hosted by the Washington Post; it prompted multiple articles by other political scientists casting doubt on its accuracy. In any case, neither study offers analysis of the 2016 electoral returns. True the Vote, a group that has argued that election fraud is widespread, gave Trump’s comment rhetorical support but did not provide specific evidence. Backing from elected Republicans was scarce. One GOP senator, James Lankford of Oklahoma, said on CNN's New Day, ""I don't know what (Trump) was talking about on that one."" He added that while there may be irregularity ""on the edges,"" he has ""not seen any voter irregularity in the millions."" Voter fraud uncommon Other research suggests that voter fraud is not widespread. • News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011. • A report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. ""Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper,"" reads the 2007 report. • In 2012, Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s administration started an effort trying to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. The Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives — including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the rolls. Meanwhile, ProPublica, an investigative journalism project, tweeted that ""we had 1,100 people monitoring the vote on Election Day. We saw no evidence the election was ‘rigged’ "" and ""no evidence that undocumented immigrants voted illegally."" Experts unconvinced Experts dismissed the substance of Trump’s tweet. ""This is patently false,"" said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. ""There would need to be a massive national conspiracy and coordination effort to do this, and illegal aliens would need to be on the voter rolls in states across the country months earlier to be eligible to vote. It is also very convenient the estimated fraudulent vote is just enough to give Trump the popular vote. Not likely a coincidence."" Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz added, ""If Mr. Trump seriously believes that there was significant vote fraud in any state, he should file a formal protest and ask for an investigation. He does not — he is simply repeating baseless claims."" And University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket said the claim is short on basic logic. ""It’s bizarre to claim that Clinton had the ability to generate millions of illegal voters but not use them to help her win the Electoral College,"" Masket said. Our ruling Trump tweeted that he ""won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."" Neither Trump nor his allies have presented any evidence of widespread illegal voting. In reality, studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is nowhere near common enough to call into question millions and millions of votes.

Santa Fe mayor defends sanctuary cities, says studies don't show increase in crime
","Mayors across America are doubling down on their cities’ decisions to serve as a ""sanctuary"" for immigrants living in the country illegally, despite President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to cut federal funding. Javier Gonzales, mayor of Santa Fe, N.M., appeared on Fox News recently defending his city’s stance to not assist federal officials with immigration enforcement. Megyn Kelly, host of Fox News’ The Kelly File, asked Gonzales about criticism directed at cities like Santa Fe, claiming that ""sanctuary cities"" attract criminals. Gonzales said his city prioritizes going after people who commit violent crimes, regardless of their immigration status. There’s also evidence that sanctuary cities aren’t a magnet for crime, he said. ""Study after study have shown that sanctuary cities do not lead to an increase in crime because of the presence of people that are undocumented,"" Gonzales said Nov. 16. Is that true? 'Sanctuary cities' Despite the name, a sanctuary city is not always a city, it can be a town, county or other jurisdiction. There isn’t a federal law defining sanctuary locations, but the term is generally applied to places that have policies or ordinances limiting their assistance to federal immigration authorities who seek to apprehend and deport immigrants in the country illegally. The modern-day sanctuary concept stems from the 1980s when churches opened their doors to shelter Central Americans who fled violence in their countries and lived illegally in the United States, fearing deportation. The New Sanctuary Movement rolled out in 2007 as places of worship across the country became a refuge for immigrants facing deportation. There are at least 50 congregations across the United States offering sanctuary. Churches, schools, hospitals and public demonstrations such as rallies and parades are considered by immigration officials as sensitive locations, where enforcement actions are generally avoided but can take place with approval from a supervisor or under ""exigent circumstances."" The exact number of jurisdictions deemed sanctuary cities fluctuates as places adopt or abandon policies. The specifics of the policies also vary from place to place. The mayor of New Orleans, for instance, says the term ""sanctuary city"" does not apply to his city, but some critics say it has practices that parallel policies in other places that openly embrace the title, the Times-Picayune reported. Lena Graber, a special projects attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, estimated there are more than 500 counties and 38 cities with policies not to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Federal laws say state and local governments or officers may not prohibit the maintenance or exchange of individuals' immigration records with other local, state or federal entities, according to a 2009 Congressional Research Service report. However, if jurisdictions don't ask individuals about their immigration status, then they don't have the information that could potentially be kept and shared, the report said. Supporters of sanctuary cities say not questioning people about their immigration status builds trust between police and the community, encouraging residents to report crime. If an undocumented immigrant gets arrested for a non-immigration offense, they can still be charged, tried and convicted for that crime, Graber said. Opponents contend that sanctuary cities attract illegal immigration and undermine enforcement of the law. Any crime by someone in the country illegally is a crime that could have been avoided by having removed that person, said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks to reduce immigration levels. What studies show The Santa Fe mayor’s office sent over multiple studies that found immigrants are less prone to commit crime than people born in the United States. They also highlighted a report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant group, saying that held true for immigrants here legally and illegally. But there isn’t a lot of research specific to sanctuary cities and their impact on crime, experts said. Sanctuary ordinances have been around for more than 30 years, but only until recently have social scientists been able to study their effect on crime rates, said Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University. A 2009 study out of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law cites Austin, Texas, as an example where cooperation between immigrant communities and law enforcement led to an increase in crime reporting and lower crime levels. Other examples of decreases in crime due to immigrant-friendly policies are also cited in this 2012 study. Research also suggests that crime reporting -- especially in communities with a high proportion of immigrants -- is very likely negatively impacted when immigration enforcement practices are carried out by local officials, said Charis E. Kubrin, a criminology professor at University of California, Irvine. A 2014 study by collaborators at University of Chicago and New York University on whether the immigration enforcement program known as Secure Communities reduced crime showed there was no significant rise in crime in sanctuary cities during the program’s rollout, Cohen said. Under the program (which has been replaced), when someone was booked into a police station or jail, that person’s information was sent to the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, ultimately to figure out the person’s immigration record. More recently, researchers at the University of California at Riverside and Highline College found sanctuary policies do not affect crime rates either way. The study included analysis of violent crime, property crime and rape. ""Sanctuary policies in terms of leading to crime do not appear to be a problem,"" the October 2016 study said. ""In fact ... almost all research that assesses links between immigration and criminality find an inverse relationship."" Trump campaigned against sanctuary policies by bringing up incidents of undocumented immigrants in these cities committing violent crimes, such as the alleged shooting by a Mexican national of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco. But we did not turn up evidence of sanctuary cities leading to an increase in crime. Qualitative information on sanctuary practices suggests they are beneficial to criminal law enforcement practices, said Phil Torrey, a lecturer on law with the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program and supervising attorney for the Harvard Immigration Project. A rise in crime in a sanctuary city could be caused by factors unrelated to that city’s undocumented population, Torrey said. For instance, a city’s rising population can account for increased overall criminal arrests, he said. Our ruling Gonzales said, ""Study after study have shown that sanctuary cities do not lead to an increase in crime because of the presence of people that are undocumented."" The data behind Gonzales’ point about sanctuary cities is not conclusive or as extensive as he described. However, a recent study by academic researchers found that sanctuary policies have no effect on crime rates. Other studies have found a reduction in crime as a result of cooperation between immigrant communities and law enforcement. Scholars also say immigrants, including those in the country illegally, are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population. Gonzales' statement overstates the breadth of research on this topic but is on the right track.

"['Trade', 'Virginia', 'Don Beyer']","
Don Beyer wrongly says U.S. has surpluses with all of its trade agreement nations
","U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th, made a pitch for free-trade agreements early on election night, a few hours before Republican Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential race put those pacts in jeopardy. Beyer was interviewed by PJ Media, a conservative online news outlet and blog. If Democrat Hillary Clinton won the presidency, he was asked, what would Democrats do to gain the support of those who voted for Trump ""specifically on the trade issue?"" ""First, I don’t think we can abandon our trade agenda,"" Beyer said. ""We have trade agreements with 20 countries, and we have trade surpluses with each one of those 20."" Beyer offered a far rosier view of free-trade agreements than Trump, whose unrelenting criticism of them is credited with helping him to attract critical blue-collar votes. Trump says the agreements have encouraged U.S. manufacturers to move plants and jobs to countries that offer cheaper labor. He’s vowed to renegotiate - and possibly pull out of - the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. And he promised not to enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Barack Obama negotiated with 11 Pacific Rim nations. So we wondered whether Beyer has it right when he says the U.S. has a surplus with all of its partners in existing trade deals. Uncle Sam, indeed, has trade agreements with 20 nations, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Mexico and Canada, as we mentioned, are part of NAFTA, which became effective in 1994. Six nations joined the U.S. in 2004 in the Central American Free Trade Agreement: Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The U.S. has independent trade agreements with 12 nations: Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Jordan, South Korea, Morocco, Oman, Panama, Peru and Singapore. Census Bureau records show that during the first nine months of 2016, the U.S. was running overall trade deficits with seven of its agreement partners. Here are those nations and the U.S. negative trade balance with them: •Canada, $5.8 billion; •Colombia, $642 million; •Israel, $7 billion; •Jordan, $197 million; •South Korea, $22.8 billion; •Mexico, $46.8 billion; and •Nicaragua, $1.4 billion. When you add up the balances of all 20 nations with pacts, the U.S. was running a $54.5 billion trade deficit for the first nine months of this year. We examined the numbers for 2015 and found a similar result. The U.S. had trade deficits with six of the countries; only Colombia fell off the list. The U.S. had a composite $64 billion trade deficit with its 20 trade-agreement nations. All told, the U.S. ran up a $546 billion global trade deficit during the first nine months of this year and a $746 billion deficit in 2015. About half of the U.S. deficit both years came from its trade with China. We finally should note that we made two efforts to contact Beyer’s office for this article and did not get a reply. Our ruling Beyer said, ""We have trade agreements with 20 countries, and we have trade surpluses with each one of those 20."" Data show the U.S. is running trade deficits with seven of those trade-agreement nations through the first nine months of this year and ran deficits with six of those countries in 2015.

"['Criminal Justice', 'Legal Issues', 'Wisconsin', 'Lena Taylor']","
Even if not practiced, is slavery still allowable in Wisconsin as punishment for a crime?
","State Sen. Lena Taylor has made a promise for when the Wisconsin Legislature starts its next session, in January 2017. ""I am reintroducing my slavery ban,"" the Milwaukee Democrat declared. Which suggests that slavery can be legal in Wisconsin -- a claim we want to check. Here’s more of what Taylor said while making the pledge Oct. 13, 2016 in an opinion column headlined, ""Legalized slavery in Wisconsin"": ""There is absolutely no compelling reason for the State of Wisconsin to allow slavery. Period,"" Taylor wrote on Madison365.com, a site devoted to the Madison area’s communities of color. ""But did you know slavery is still allowable under Wisconsin law as long as it’s a punishment for a crime?"" She added: ""I don’t care what you do or who you are, nobody deserves a life of enslavement. Nobody gets to own another person. I hope we can all agree on that. In practice, this amendment allows our prisons to exploit incarcerated individuals and force them to work without pay. Now I need to be clear on one thing – Wisconsin’s Department of Corrections does not currently use slave labor. But they could. And they would be fully within their legal rights to do so."" So, is ""slavery"" legal in Wisconsin ""as long as it’s a punishment for a crime""? Slavery in the news Surprisingly, slavery was repeatedly in the news in Wisconsin in 2016. More surprisingly, each time it was due to a candidate for the state Supreme Court. Now, let’s see how Taylor’s slavery statement stacks up on the Truth-O-Meter. Wisconsin Constitution To back her claim, Taylor cites the Wisconsin Constitution, which was approved by state voters in 1848. Section 2 of Article 1, entitled ""Slavery prohibited,"" says: ""There shall be neither slavery, nor involuntary servitude in this state, otherwise than for the punishment of crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted."" (Taylor says she will introduce a constitutional amendment that would end Section 2 at the word state. If the amendment passes the Legislature, which is controlled by Walker’s fellow Republicans, in the next two legislative sessions, it would go to voters in a referendum in 2020.) Wisconsin’s Section 2 essentially mirrors the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery. ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."" So, both constitutions ban slavery, but they specify an exception for the punishment of a convicted criminal. Two Marquette University law professors whose specialties include constitutional law told us it is lawful for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections to force prison inmates to work without pay. But it’s not absolute. Scott Idleman told us the work must be reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest, such as rehabilitation -- that is, it cannot be cruel and unusual, or arbitrary. He also made the point that while slavery can be considered to be forced labor without pay, it is not the same as chattel slavery (people owned as property) that existed before the 13th Amendment. His colleague Alan Madry provided a couple of examples. Requiring inmates to work in the prison laundry isn’t cruel and unusual, or arbitrary; cleaning up litter along the highway is probably within the law, too. Although there are no state Supreme Court opinions on how far the Department of Corrections could go, the department likely could not rent out inmates to private businesses to do work solely for the benefit of that business, he said.    The Department of Corrections told us prison inmates are not required to work. Those who work are paid 5 cents to $2 an hour, depending on the assignment. The department sometimes requires inmates to work for no pay, but only as a penalty for violating prison rules. Our rating Referring to prison inmates, Taylor said: ""Slavery is still allowable under Wisconsin law as long as it’s a punishment for a crime."" Prison inmates aren’t owned and they cannot be forced into labor based on skin color. But slavery can also be considered as being forced into unpaid labor. And Wisconsin does have the legal authority to require inmates to work for no pay, although in practice it does so only when inmates violate prison rules. We rate Taylor’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979CD380>],/factchecks/2016/nov/25/lena-taylor/even-if-not-practiced-slavery-still-allowable-wisc/
"['Climate Change', 'Texas', 'Jill Stein']","
Jill Stein overstates forecast about seas rising up to 30 feet in 50 years or so
","Presidential candidate Jill Stein told a boisterous Texas crowd that a respected scientist foresees the loss of coastal cities within a half century due to creeping seas. ""In this election, we’re not just deciding what kind of a world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,"" Stein said Oct. 17, 2016 at a forum at Austin’s Huston-Tillotson University. As of mid-November 2016, with some votes left to be counted, Stein appeared to have drawn about 1 percent nationally in her second run as the presidential nominee of the Green Party, which emphasizes environmental sustainability. Its party platform describes environmentalism and justice as intertwined and calls for ""an ecological society that is harmonized with nature."" Stein said at the forum: ""Jim Hansen, the father of climate science; he hasn’t been wrong yet in about 40 years of climate science. And his latest predictions are that, folks, we have until perhaps 50 years from now — maybe a little bit longer, but maybe not. And at that point, we are looking at 10, 20, 30 feet of sea level rise which means goodbye to population centers on the coasts."" Of the nation’s 50 most populous cities, 16 lie in part at sea level, according to the US Geological Survey. The cities include New York, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, Portland and Seattle. Scientists have attributed sea-level rise to the melting of glaciers and ice caps, caused by the Earth’s warming atmosphere. In July 2013, PolitiFact rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., that sea levels measured in Florida had risen nine inches since the 1920s, finding corroborating historical data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency attributes the rising seas to a combination of thermal expansion (because warm water expands) and melting ice. Then again, nine inches is a whole lot less than 10 to 30 feet. So, did a top climate scientist predict that much of a sea-level rise in about 50 years? We emailed the Stein campaign for the nominee's backup information but didn’t hear back. Otherwise, a Google search led us to think Stein was citing James Hansen, the climate scientist who testified to Congress about global warming in 1988 while he was director of NASA’s Institute for Space Studies; in that testimony, he warned of resultant heat waves and droughts to come, not of rising seas swallowing cities. We noticed too that Stein made a similar claim in an Aug. 10, 2016 Twitter post warning about Americans losing homes due to a nine-foot sea-level rise by 2050. At the time, Stein spokeswoman Meleiza Figueroa said Hansen was the candidate’s source. An Aug. 17, 2016, Washington Post news story went on to characterize the nine-foot figure as a possibility, not a prediction, also saying that the prospect ""doesn’t represent a scientific consensus."" Hansen’s hypothesis For our part, we emailed Hansen, who works for Columbia University’s Earth Institute, to run Stein’s claim by him.  He wrote back that he has forecasted ""multi-meter sea level rise"" in 50 to 150 years, which he wrote ""means loss of most coastal cities."" Hansen also pointed us to a study he co-authored with 18 fellow scientists from the U.S., China and Europe, published March 22, 2016, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. The 52-page study flatly predicts the 50-to-150 year timeframe for sea-level rise. Yet it ties that expectation to the authors’ hypothesis that polar ice caps will melt drastically faster than what had been estimated by that time by most scientific studies. The study repeatedly warns of potential rise by ""several meters,"" we noticed, but doesn’t have specific figures equal to the 10-to-30 foot range declared by Stein. The study also acknowledges that the data used to test the authors’ hypothesis were imperfect, making the implications uncertain. Researchers, the study says, used ""coarse-resolution modeling and simplifying assumptions"" and so ""raises fundamental questions that point towards specific modeling and measurement needs."" It also states ""the record is too short to confirm the nature of the response""--meaning there’s too little data to know for sure how quickly the ice caps will melt. We’re sharing next more detail about the basis of the hypothesis and the authors’ related conclusions. The study, drawing on computer models taking into account ancient climate data revealed by ocean sediment cores plus more recent observations of ice melt, ocean currents and global surface temperatures, specifically hypothesizes that the ice caps will melt at an exponential, as opposed to linear, rate. Under that scenario, the study posits, the volume of discharged meltwater would double every 10, 20 or 40 years. Still, the authors note, ""the record is too short to confirm"" which timeframe will prove out, though limited modern observations put it nearer to 10 years, they say.   ""If (greenhouse gas) emissions continue to grow"" (which they were as of 2011, according to federal data published in 2015), the study says, ""multi-meter sea level rise would become practically unavoidable, probably within 50-150 years.""    The study says: ""Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise, and the attendant increases in storms and climate extremes, could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization."" The Hansen-led study drew wide attention at its debut with some experts saying the conclusions were speculative rather than certain. On March 22, 2016, the New York Times ran a story headlined, ""Scientists warn of perilous climate shift within decades, not centuries,"" and the Post wrote, ""We had all better hope these scientists are wrong about the planet’s future."" A main point of those news stories: the possibilities raised by Hansen and his co-authors overstepped the accepted spectrum for projected sea-level rise in existing scientific literature.   Other sea level forecasts Other prominent predictions: --The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013 forecasted sea level rise between 0.6 and one meter by 2100. --In 2014, the U.S. National Climate Assessment, a federal project, predicted between one and four feet of sea level rise by the century’s end, about 0.3-1.2 m. --The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in its plans for incorporating sea level change into civil works construction, holds that ""a credible upper bound for 21st Century sea-level rise would not exceed 2 meters. So, Hansen and others indeed made bold predictions. But the predictions were based on a hypothesized phenomenon of exponential ice cap melt. Other researchers Next, we turned to outside experts for interpretation. We looked up Climate Central, a New Jersey-based a New Jersey-based organization of scientists studying climate change, and emailed the head of sea level research there, Benjamin Strauss, to inquire if Hansen’s researcher seemed credible. Asked about Stein’s claim that Hansen hasn’t been wrong in 40 years, Strauss said Hansen ""is definitely one of the greatest heroes of climate science, and he has often been prescient, but everyone makes mistakes."" Regarding the March 2016 study, Strauss said it ""was far outside the mainstream of climate or sea level science. It was very provocative, and coming from him it must be taken seriously, but specialists were and remain extremely skeptical of its projections and conclusions."" We wondered what could set Hansen’s conclusions so far apart from the accepted projections. Per our reading, public discussions posted online and other news analyses, it was largely based on a hypothesized snowball effect in ice cap melting. The study said that as freshwater poured off melting polar ice, it would form a cap atop the relatively heavy ocean saltwater; that would suppress vertical currents that bring polar sea water to the surface to cool, thereby warming the ocean subsurface, speeding melting at the deepest levels of the ice caps and increasing the rate of freshwater runoff. When Hansen emailed, he also pointed out the extensive public review process posted online. There, we found commentary from other researchers on the study. Peter Thorne, director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units at Maynooth University in Ireland, left a 12-page review in which he addressed the proposed snowball effect of ice cap melt. The hypothesis, he wrote, ""relies to an uncomfortable extent upon a causal chain of the nature given a then b and because b then c and c means that d shall occur etc. Each link in the chain is certainly plausible based upon the relatively scant evidence at hand, but it is not by any stretch determinant."" Thorne also wrote: ""At the same time, however, it would be foolish in extremis to discount this out of hand as a possibility of what shall occur"" because ""we do not know enough about the earth system as a whole"" and ""I share many of the author’s manifestly obvious concerns"" about the dangerous implications of a warming climate. Texas state climatologist By email, we ran the densely-worded study by Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, a professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University. Nielsen-Gammon replied that the study's mention of sea level rise amounted to more of a ""statement of the possible"" as opposed to an actual sea-level-rise prediction."" He wrote that he read the study and explained that Hansen and the team hypothesized an exponential increase in meltwater discharge, then tested the hypothesis using observed meltwater rates for Greenland and Antarctica. He said the authors ""concluded that the observed record was too short to determine whether meltwater discharge is increasing exponentially, let alone what the time scale of increase is, though the data is consistent with their hypothesized rapid exponential increase."" Hansen acknowledged as much in a 15-minute video he released in conjunction with the paper on March 21, 2016. Hansen said in the video: ""The data records are too short, but if we wait until the real world reveals itself clearly, it may be too late to avoid sea-level rise of several meters and loss of all coastal cities."" If the volume of discharged meltwater doubles in ten years, he said in the video, seas could rise one meter in about 50 years; if the volume doubles in 20 years, seas could rise one meter in about 100 years. Our ruling Stein said Hansen predicted 10 to 30 feet of sea-level rise within 50 years or ""maybe a little bit longer."" Hansen published startling predictions exceeding established forecasts of sea-level rise related to climate change. But even under the most urgent scenario, the Hansen-led study projects about one meter—3.3 feet—of sea-level rise in 50 years. It projects, with some admitted uncertainty, multi-meter sea-level rise within 50 to 150 years. We rate Stein’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

James Quintero says salmonella and other illnesses spiked after San Francisco banned plastic bags
","Reused grocery bags made Californians sick, a conservative Texas analyst suggested. James Quintero, director of the Center for Local Governance at the Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation, brought up health implications of shoppers reusing bags during an Oct. 10, 2016, SXSW Eco panel discussion. ""There are health consequences in that,"" Quintero said. ""I believe this is in San Francisco: When they enacted their bag ban, you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses—you saw that number spike."" Someone on the panel responded: ""Wait, that’s curious. I never heard that before."" Quintero replied: ""So you have a reusable bag, right? And then of course, people don’t clean out these bags. So when you mix meat with vegetables and fruits and other goods, and you don’t clean out that bag on a regular basis, then people are susceptible to foodborne illnesses."" Take note: Health authorities recommend you wash bags regularly used to carry meats and vegetables. For this fact check, we were curious about what happened when San Francisco banned plastic bags. Quintero cites professors’ paper We asked a foundation spokeswoman, Caroline Espinosa, to share the basis of Quintero’s claim. By email, Espinosa pointed us to a November 2012 paper, ""Grocery Bag Bans and Foodborne Illness,"" by Jonathan Klick and Joshua Wright, law professors at the University of Pennsylvania and George Mason University, respectively. In their write-up, posted by a University of Pennsylvania research center, the authors noted that San Francisco County barred large supermarkets and pharmacies from using ""non-compostable plastic checkout bags,"" effective Oct. 20, 2007. In 2012, the county’s board of supervisors ""expanded the non-compostable plastic checkout bag ban to cover all retail and food establishments in"" the county, effective Oct. 1, 2012, the paper says, also requiring stores to charge at least a dime for any bag provided. ""To analyze emergency room visits,"" the authors wrote, ""we used the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development’s Emergency Department and Ambulatory Surgery Data for each quarter from 2005-2010. These data provide the county of residence of each person admitted to a California ER, as well as the principal diagnosis for the individual using ICD-9 codes. Given the prevalence of coliform bacteria, especially E. coli, in reusable grocery bags, we focus on ER visits involving E. coli,"" the two said. And? The San Francisco bag ban is ""associated with a statistically significant and particularly large increase in ER visits for E. Coli infections. We find increases between one fourth and two thirds, suggesting an increase in visits between 72 and 191 annually,"" the paper said. All told, the authors said, the bag ban there is ""associated with a 46 percent increase in deaths from foodborne illnesses. This implies an increase of 5.5 annual deaths for the county."" On the other hand, the study’s small sample size make ""any inferential claims"" tentative, the authors wrote. We emailed and telephoned each professor and didn’t hear back. San Francisco County memo Hunting perspective, we then ran the authors’ names through the Nexis news database. That query led us to a March 2013 story posted by Texas-based D Magazine stating a San Francisco health officer had spelled out flaws in the professors’ paper. That story included a web link to a Feb. 8, 2013, memo from a San Francisco County health officer, Tomás Aragon, to Eileen Shields, a county public health information officer. The memo said the county Department of Public Health had reviewed the professors’ paper which, the officer noted, ""has not been submitted for rigorous scientific peer review and publication."" Generally, the memo states, ""Klick & Wright’s conclusion that San Francisco’s policy of banning of plastic bags has caused a significant increase in gastrointestinal bacterial infections and a ‘46 percent increase in the deaths from foodborne illnesses’ is not warranted."" One weakness, the memo says, was that the professors presumed a link between reusable bags and a seeming spike in gastrointestinal bacterial infections--yet they failed to establish the link. ""Drawing causal conclusions from this type of study is called an ‘ecological fallacy,’"" the memo states. ""The basic study flaw is that persons that use reusable bags frequently may not be the same persons that were diagnosed with gastrointestinal bacterial infections in their study. This is the reason epidemiologists will not use ecological studies to test causal hypotheses. At best, ecologic studies raise epidemiologic causal hypotheses but cannot test them."" The memo continues: ""In testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to measure the outcome (gastrointestinal infections) and exposure to the putative cause (reusable bags) in the same persons. Because of their study design, this was not possible."" Also, the memo says that in ""testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to ‘control for’ alternative causal explanations (called ‘confounders’). Because of their study design, this was not possible. For example, gastrointestinal bacterial infections are not only caused from contaminated food, but also from contaminated water, improper food handling or preparation, or from person-to-person spread (such as sexual activity, especially in men who have sex with men). In any causal study, investigators always adjust for the ‘usual suspects,’"" the memo says. Moreover, the memo notes that the study’s focus on illnesses identified in emergency rooms misses that people seek care at other places--or not at all--leaving the data incomplete. Alternatively, the memo says, laboratory-confirmed diagnoses reported to the health department are ""the proper basis for surveillance of microbiological data on these infections in our population."" The official went on to say there had been increases in some illnesses oft linked to food. Specifically, according to the memo, health department data show an increase in campylobacteriosis, one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness. Then again, the memo says, there was no detected increase in salmonellosis or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which is transmitted by food or water contaminated with animal or human feces. ""Interpreting these changes is not straightforward,"" the memo continues. ""The epidemiology of enteric pathogens in San Francisco differs compared to surrounding counties because we are an urban center with a larger population of ethnic immigrants and men who have sex with men (MSM),"" the memo states. ""Research studies need to adjust for these population differences."" The memo also disputes the professors’ conclusions about deaths going up after the bag ban, mostly by declaring that 111 of the 140 San Francisco deaths from 2001 through 2010 figuring into the paper were attributed to Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile--an intestinal infection most commonly tied to exposure to antibiotics, particularly among hospitalized patients. ""Foodborne exposures is not yet an established cause of C. difficile enterocolitis, but is an active area of research,"" the memo says, going on to say the authors shouldn’t have included C. difficile deaths in their analysis. Summing up, the memo says ""the idea that widespread use of reusable bags may cause gastrointestinal infections if they are not regularly cleaned is plausible. However, the hypothesis that there is a significant increase in gastrointestinal foodborne illnesses and deaths due to reusable bags has not been tested, much less demonstrated in this study. It would be a disservice to San Francisco residents and visitors to alarm them by claiming that it has been. It could be useful, however, to remind people to use safe food-handling practices, including maintaining the cleanliness of everything they use to transport, handle, and prepare food."" We asked San Francisco County if there had been any response by the professors to the county’s memo. Nancy Sarieh of the public health department told us by email: ""They did respond. We agreed to disagree and they have not updated their paper."" In February 2013, we otherwise noticed, commentator Debra J. Saunders of the San Francisco Chronicle quoted Klick saying he cannot ""rule out the possibility that there was something peculiar that happened in San Francisco."" A Texas expert Separately, we asked Dr. Philip Huang, the medical director for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department, to take a look at the paper posted by Penn plus the San Francisco County memo. Huang said by phone that the Penn paper, limited to ER admissions, missed the fact that individuals who take sick from food are treated by private doctors or don’t even seek health care. Notably too, Huang said, the researchers failed to consider the health surveillance data later cited by the county. ""I mean, who knows? You can get a spike"" in illness ""and there could have been something else going on in the community that is totally unrelated,"" Huang said. ""I think the people who are closest to the data in their own community would have the best perspective."" From ER admissions alone, Huang said, ""certainly the data is not there to make any conclusions about this."" Foundation notes other accounts Next, we circled back to Espinosa, the foundation spokeswoman, about the memo disputing the professors’ analysis and Huang’s comments. By email, Espinosa pointed out a 2011 peer-reviewed study, partly supported by the American Chemistry Council, finding that among reusable bags randomly collected from consumers entering grocery stores in the San Francisco area, Los Angeles and Tucson, E. coli were identified in 8 percent of bags plus a ""wide range of enteric bacteria,"" according to the authors including Charles P. Gerba of the University of Arizona. ""When meat juices were added to bags and stored in the trunks of cars for two hours, the number of bacteria increased 10-fold, indicating the potential for bacterial growth in the bags,"" the authors wrote. ""Hand or machine washing was found to reduce the bacteria in bags by > 99.9%. These results indicate that reusable bags, if not properly washed on a regular basis, can play a role in the cross-contamination of foods. "" Espinosa also noted a May 2012 Los Angeles Times news story describing an Oregon outbreak affecting nine soccer players who had come in contact with a reused grocery bag. The story said one of the girls got sick shortly after arrival, from a norovirus she presumably acquired prior to the trip, Dr. Kimberly K. Repp of the Oregon Health and Science University and Dr. William E. Keene of the Oregon Public Health Division reported in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. ""The sick girl was then isolated in the room of one of the chaperones,"" the Times reported. ""Nonetheless, eight other girls became ill. The investigation showed that the virus was found on a reusable grocery bag that had been used to store snacks for the team. It had, unfortunately, been stored in the bathroom,"" the story said. When the sick girl used the bathroom, the norovirus was aerosolized and deposited on the bag, where it was later transferred to other girls when they got snacks. Our ruling Quintero said that when San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, ""you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses"" spike. This declaration relied on a study that took a correlation between ER cases and San Francisco’s phased-in bag ban to declare ties between the reported illnesses and the ban. However, the county raised serious questions about the study methodology and conclusions, which were overly simplistic. We rate this statement Mostly False.

Ted Cruz says 'long historical precedent' for smaller Supreme Court
","Before Republican Donald Trump bested Hillary Clinton for president, Sen. Ted Cruz sparked a fresh line of speculation when he hinted that the Senate in 2017 might not even vote to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. The Texas Republican, an attorney and former Supreme Court clerk who went on to represent Texas before the court, asserted that the court’s current composition of eight justices -- following the February 2016 death in Texas of Justice Antonin Scalia -- was consistent with other times the court had fewer than nine members. Cruz, addressing an October 2016 campaign rally for Darryl Glenn, the Republican U.S. Senate nominee in Colorado, said: ""There is certainly a long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with few justices."" We asked Cruz’s Senate office what he meant by a court with fewer than nine justices. Did a specific historical period back his claim? By email, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack didn’t offer detail, saying instead: ""The key here is that Cruz said there is time to debate the issue."" Speaking of debate, we spotted objections from two justices to the court not regaining a member. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in May 2016 that eight members ""is not a good number for a multimember court."" In September 2016, Justice Elena Kagan opined that an eight-member court would become a ""problem"" over time because of the potential for tie votes, according to a U.S. News & World Report news story. At the Colorado rally, though, Cruz noted that Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, who joined the court in 1994, had ""observed that the vacancy is not impacting the ability of the court to do its job."" Cruz was referring to an Oct. 24, 2016, interview of Breyer on MSNBC’s Morning Joe in which the justice said the Supreme Court occasionally has functioned with fewer than nine members. ""The court, when it began at the time of the Constitution’s writing, had six members,"" Breyer said. ""They had six members for several years. They had 10 members for several years after the Civil War."" The Supreme Court without nine members The court can act without an odd number of members. But if a majority cannot agree on an opinion, it’s as if the court never took up the case. ""If the Court divides 4-4, the lower court opinion is affirmed without creating any Supreme Court precedent,"" Jeffrey Fisher, a Stanford University law professor, told Business Insider. And the even number of justices after Scalia’s death altered the trajectory of a few major decisions during the court’s latest term, which ran from October 2015 to June 2016. Consider Fisher v. University of Texas in which the court decided 4-3 that the University of Texas at Austin’s race-conscious admissions program and others like it around the country were constitutional. If Scalia were alive to cast a vote in the case, court observers agree, he likely would have made it a 4-4 decision--with the court still upholding the UT program but not creating a national precedent. ""The thing is that the court gets the hard cases where you got legitimate arguments on both sides,"" Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, told us by phone. ""Those are exactly the cases where it needs not to split 4-4.""For months, filling Scalia’s seat has been a topic of fierce partisan fighting. Democrats have criticized the Republican-majority Senate for refusing to consider President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland, a federal appellate judge, to fill the vacancy. Senate Democrats argue that the court needs a full contingent of nine justices to settle legal disputes of consequence. Court’s size through history Breyer was correct that the court didn’t start with nine members. Also, we learned, the court’s size is set by statutory law, not in the Constitution. There also have been long stretches where the court remained short a justice. Most recently, 257 days elapsed between Scalia’s death and Cruz’s statement. After Scalia’s death, Roll Call published this chart showing how long high court vacancies lasted the previous 116 years of the court’s history:                                        To our inquiry, James O’Hara, chairman of the Library Committee at the Supreme Court Historical Society, told us by phone that when there is divided government in Washington, fighting over a vacant court seat is to be expected. Since the Constitution is mum about how many judges can sit on the high court, any change to the number requires federal legislation. O’Hara, a retired history professor from Loyola University Maryland, said: ""When it comes to Supreme Court vacancies, Congress and the president play hardball and this is not the first time. It’s something that has happened multiple times, usually because the president is from one party and the other party is in control of the Senate."" We asked about specific years when the number of Supreme Court justices fluctuated, and O’Hara advised that twice in the court’s history, it operated for months with fewer than nine justices. O’Hara talked us through this history: In 1789, the first Congress set the number of justices at six -- an even number. O’Hara told us the court’s early cases weren’t concerned with broad national issues, so an even number of judges likely was not a pressing matter for the earliest lawmakers who designed the court. Plus, some court observers long have argued that a smaller, even-numbered set of justices would force them to find compromise and write narrower opinions. Save for about 30 years, during which the Civil War occurred, the court has had nine justices for much of its history. Its membership, first set at that number in 1837, fluctuated a few times before Congress set it again at nine starting in 1869. In 1801, Congress’ majority Federalist party shrank the court by one in the hopes of stopping President Thomas Jefferson, a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, from filling a vacancy. But Congress went the other way toward the end of Jefferson’s two terms by expanding the court to seven members. Later, in 1837, Congress made the court a nine-person body, according to several court histories. We couldn’t immediately divine the reason for the expansion. The Civil War period saw a spike in Supreme Court membership; Congress bumped the court up to 10 justices in 1863. Three years later, with the war over, the Republican majorities in both chambers did not want President Andrew Johnson -- the Democratic successor to Abraham Lincoln who would be impeached by the House two years later -- to appoint any new justices, so they lowered the number to seven. The decrease was to take effect as each seat became vacant. In 1869, with Johnson out of office, Congress increased the court’s membership to nine, where it has stayed ever since. In the late 1980s, the court temporarily shrunk to fewer than nine justices. Two of President Ronald Reagan’s court nominees failed before his third choice, Anthony Kennedy, won Senate confirmation in 1988. The president’s first nominee, Robert Bork, did not win Senate approval and his second nominee, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew from consideration after reports surfaced that he had smoked marijuana. When Kennedy joined the court, his colleagues ordered new arguments in four cases that had been evenly split, 4-4, so he could break the tie, according to journalist Jan Crawford Greenburg’s book, Supreme Conflict. Arguments for and against a nine-member court Next, we looked for research into whether an even-numbered court has affected the court’s quality of work--finding that debatable. After all, the last time the court was statutorily set at fewer than nine justices, America did not have 50 states and slavery was a major legal issue. The court’s membership has not permanently dropped below nine for more than a century, making it difficult to compare whether it is more or less able to do its work with fewer than nine. Brianne Gorod, chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center, argued in a February 2016 Huffington Post piece that an even-numbered court would promote stalemates. ""By hearing cases in which lower courts are divided, the Court can settle the dispute and establish one rule of law to govern the entire nation,"" she wrote. ""But there will be many cases in which the Court cannot do that when it has only eight members. There’s no question that on this sharply divided Court, the potential for 4-4 decisions will be strong."" Meanwhile, Eric Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law, argued in an April 2016  Salon blog that an even-numbered court would champion compromise. ""First, with eight Justices equally divided between the two major political parties, the winning side must convince at least one Justice to side with Justices from the other party to form a majority. Over time, this requirement would lead to more public confidence in the final outcomes and also likely generate more moderate arguments and decisions (which is a good thing given that the Court is composed of life tenured, elite lawyers who the people don’t elect and cannot vote out of office)."" Our ruling Cruz said: ""There is long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices."" In fact, Congress has kept the court at nine members for all but a handful of years since lawmakers set that number of justices in 1837. A few extended vacancies later left the court operating with eight members, but they occurred because the Senate was resisting nominees rather than committing to an even-steven smaller court.

Like Trump, 'Hamilton was an immigration hawk,' Rush Limbaugh says
","If the actors in the hit broadway musical Hamilton knew anything about the real Alexander Hamilton, they might not like him so much, said conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. At the end of a Nov. 18 Hamilton performance, cast members made an appeal to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who was in attendance and had been booed by some in the audience. Speaking for the cast, Brandon Victor Dixon (who portrays Aaron Burr) said they hoped the show inspired Pence to work on behalf of all Americans and uphold the country’s collective values. But the real Alexander Hamilton, as opposed to the character in the musical, might not be the role model for Pence the cast members would like, Limbaugh said on his show Nov. 21. The ten-dollar founding father and first secretary of the Treasury believed in monarchy and aristocracy, and he even held tough views on immigration that were similar to Trump’s. ""Do you know that Alexander Hamilton was an immigration hawk?"" Limbaugh said. ""I wonder if the people in this cast have any idea who they are lionizing and celebrating. This guy's Donald Trump."" Hamilton himself has an immigrant story. He came to the American colonies from the British West Indies as a poor, teenage orphan. So we wondered if Limbaugh’s assertion was correct. We’re not throwing away our shot to fact-check this claim.   We asked historians and consulted some of Hamilton’s written work, and we found that over his life, Hamilton showed support for both increasing and limiting immigration. Experts said Limbaugh’s portrayal of Hamilton as an ""immigration hawk"" lacks nuance. ""In short, Hamilton wasn't quite anti-immigrant. But he wasn't always pro-immigrant either,"" said Joanne Freeman, a Yale University history professor who has edited a volume of Hamilton’s writings. Pro-immigration Prior to the United States’ Quasi-War with France in the late 1790s — which we’ll talk about shortly — Hamilton and other members of the Federalist Party were rather dovish on immigration, said Stephen Knott, a professor at the Naval War College and author of Alexander Hamilton and the Persistence of Myth. ""So his position is perhaps more complex than Limbaugh suggests,"" Knott said. Hamilton occasionally argued for policies that would encourage immigration. In his 1791 Report on Manufactures, for example, he said manufacturing would benefit the United States in part because it would invite immigrants, expanding the population and labor force. ""Here is perceived an important resource, not only for extending the population, and with it the useful and productive labour of the country, but likewise for the prosecution of manufactures,"" he wrote of immigrants. Hamilton also argued against requiring people to be native-born or to have lived in America a certain number of years in order to be eligible to serve in Congress, according to the historian Ron Chernow’s biography of Hamilton (which inspired the musical). Hamilton said this would attract foreigners of ""moderate fortunes"" to the United States, where they would be of the same status as the country’s earliest citizens. (Hamilton lost this fight — the Constitution has a residency period requirement for immigrants who want to seek congressional office.) Pro-limiting immigration But when the United States engaged in naval war with France at the end of the French Revolution, Hamilton and others were concerned that French people in America might try to undermine the United States government from within, Knott said. In response, Hamilton supported the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, which increased the length of time it took to become a citizen and gave the president the authority to imprison or deport foreigners perceived as ""dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States."" Hamilton’s support for these laws was qualified, however. He worried that the acts were susceptible to abuse, and he warned other Federalists not to take any actions that could lead to tyrannical rule, Knott said.   Hamilton also fretted about the political and cultural impact immigrants would have on the United States, Freeman said. Hamilton spoke out against then-President Thomas Jefferson’s proposal to allow for a dramatic influx of new citizens, saying that Jefferson might not have won the 1800 election if only American-born citizens had voted. ""To admit foreigners indiscriminately to the rights of citizens, the moment they put foot in our country, as recommended in the message, would be nothing less than to admit the Grecian horse into the citadel of our liberty and sovereignty,"" Hamilton wrote in 1801 — noting, though, that he did not want to halt immigration completely. Freeman said it's difficult to compare the concept of immigration today to what it meant in early America because at the time, a large portion of the population had come from Great Britain and had only been in America for a few decades. While calling Limbaugh’s claim an ""overreaction"" to the way Hamilton is portrayed in Hamilton, Freeman said the musical implies that the historical figure was more unquestionably pro-immigrant than he actually was. Our ruling Limbaugh said, ""Alexander Hamilton was an immigration hawk."" Limbaugh has a point that Hamilton did have some skepticism about immigrants. For several years, Hamilton favored limiting the flow of immigrants into the United States in order to preserve American culture and politics, and he offered qualified support for the Alien and Sedition Acts. But earlier in his political career, he supported policies that would encourage immigration to the United States.

No, 15,000 people did not vote for Harambe in 2016
","We all know Harambe as the late gorilla who became an Internet sensation, but is it possible one of America’s favorite memes also received 15,000 votes in this year’s presidential election? Shortly following Donald Trump’s win, stories about Harambe winning thousands of votes appeared on social media, fueling funny remarks that the gorrilla spoiled the election. For those of you who don’t know — Harambe, a silverback gorilla, was controversially killed at the Cincinnati Zoo in May after a young boy climbed into his enclosure. Harambe’s death sparked thousands of social media posts or memes memorializing his death. ""The Legend Of Harambe Continues As The Dead Gorilla Received Over 15,000 Votes For President,"" reads a Nov. 9 headline from Coed, an online entertainment magazine. A post from 9GAG got over 79,000 reactions on Facebook. And of course there were the social media posts: People are quick to blame Gary Johnson for what's going on right now but think about this: Harambe has over 10k votes.This is your America Harambe had 11,000 votes.11,000 people voted for a dead gorilla.Let that sink in. You start wondering how this could happen...then you see 11,000 write-in votes for Harambe and it all makes sense While it’s possible a handful of people voted for Harambe (see here), the stories that Harambe received thousands of votes — which ranges between 11,000 and 15,000 depending on the story — are not based on fact. Why? Write-in votes for Harambe would be treated like provisional or absentee ballots, meaning they wouldn’t be counted until after all the other votes, which takes weeks. We’re still counting votes in California, for instance. Seeing as these Harambe stories popped up immediately after the election, there’s no way they were based on real data. Plus, every state decides on their own requirements for write-in candidates, so not all votes for Harambe would count depending on the state. More than 30 states require a write-in candidate to file paperwork in order to be an official candidate and at least eight states don’t even allow write-in candidates. The remaining states have no-filing requirements. How many of these write-in votes actually get counted? Well, in 2012, 136,040 write-in votes were counted, which is .11-percent of the total votes, according to The Washington Post. Our ruling The day after the presidential election, bloggers took to social media to share stories claiming Harambe received thousands of votes in this year’s presidential election. The claims are a hoax. Most of those stories were written the day after the election, and any write-in votes for Harambe wouldn’t have been counted.

Bill Nelson says Donald Trump intends to expand oil drilling
","Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson spent the week after the 2016 election fighting against a bill that would have steered more royalties from oil drilling to some Gulf states. Nelson’s state of Florida already bans offshore oil drilling near its coasts. But Nelson feared that by dangling more royalties, state leaders would be more open to drilling near Florida in the future. In a speech on the Senate floor Nov. 16, Nelson said President-elect Donald Trump’s position on the issue is concerning to environmentalists.   ""Ever since I was a young congressman, I’ve been fighting to keep oil rigs off of Florida’s coast,"" he said, ""and now it's especially important at this time as we have a new administration coming in that took a public position in the election declaring the president-elect's intent to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling."" The American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016, sponsored by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., failed to get enough Senate votes to move forward on Nov. 17. But the future of oil drilling along coasts in Florida and the United States will remain a hot topic of conversation under Trump’s administration and potentially in Nelson’s re-election campaign in 2018. Here we will look at Trump’s position on opening up additional coastal areas to drill for oil. We heard back from Nelson’s office but not from Trump’s transition team. Donald Trump’s campaign position oil drilling Trump generally spoke in favor of offshore oil drilling during the campaign, although his position wasn’t always clear. He sounded skeptical about a proposal in Congress to allow offshore drilling closer to Florida in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times in February. ""They've already got plenty in the Gulf,"" Trump said. ""It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing."" In 2006, Congress -- with input and support from Nelson -- passed a bill to ban oil drilling within 125 miles off much of Florida’s coast and up to 235 miles at some points. The ban is set to expire in 2022. In 2015, Cassidy introduced the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act, which would allow drilling 50 miles off Florida’s Gulf shores. In response, Nelson filed a bill to extend the ban by five years. Neither bill reached a Senate vote. Trump was more forceful about his support for drilling since that time in speeches and press releases that we found through our own research and in Trump’s statements sent to us by Nelson’s Senate spokesman. During the campaign, Trump’s America First Energy Plan called for opening up onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands, eliminating a moratorium on coal leasing, and opening shale energy deposits. Trump called for unleashing ""America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in clean coal reserves."" In a May 2016 speech to the North Dakota Petroleum Council, Trump said that in his first 100 days in office, he would ""lift moratoriums on energy production in federal area. We’re going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies. These technologies create millions of jobs with a smaller footprint than ever before."" He reiterated those views during a September 2016 speech at the 2016 Shale Insight Conference. Trump’s position has remained the same since he won After Trump won Nov. 8, his transition team posted an energy policy that stated the administration will open onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands and waters and streamline the permitting process for all energy projects. A few days after Trump won, one of his economic advisers, Stephen Moore, told NPR that Trump’s administration believes it can raise ""hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years"" by opening up more federal lands for leases for oil and gas development and coal development. On Nov. 18, the Obama administration took the opposite approach, banning offshore drilling in the Arctic as part of a new five-year plan for energy development in federal waters. Trump won’t be able to instantly toss Obama’s ban. His administration will have to prepare a report which could take as long as two years, and then the federal government would have to organize a sale of leases for companies that want to drill there, the Washington Post reported. Although Trump wants more drilling, he may have to wait years for it. CNBC reported that Trump’s plan to expand oil drilling probably won’t happen until his successor is in the White House. Reasons for delay include the years it takes to start projects, local and state governments sometimes oppose drilling, and market forces. Our ruling Nelson said that Trump said during the campaign he intends ""to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling."" In official campaign and transition team statements, Trump repeatedly has called for making it easier to drill for oil. He called for opening offshore areas and reducing ""unnecessary restrictions."" Since he won, Trump’s administration has reiterated its pro-drilling stance. He hasn't been so clear about his specific plans for Florida. In one interview, he appeared skeptical about expanding offshore drilling closer to Florida. He is limited in the extent that he could expand drilling anywhere near Florida’s coasts because current law bans it within at least 125 miles.   With that caveat, we rate Nelson’s point Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A304400>],/factchecks/2016/nov/22/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-donald-trump-intends-expand-oil-d/

Flint water still has problems, but Michael Moore minimizes progress made
","After Michigan turned away from Barack Obama in 2012 and toward Donald Trump in 2016, Michael Moore, the liberal filmmaker and activist, said he understood voters’ frustrations. This could be seen, he said, even in Genesee County, which includes Moore’s hometown of Flint, where residents have been grappling with major water-contamination concerns. In Genesee County, Obama in 2012 won by a 62 percent-37 percent margin, yet in 2016, Hillary Clinton won by a significantly narrower 52 percent-43 percent margin. ""Barack Obama, who I loved, and voted for twice, and I will miss dearly -- he showed up in Flint five months ago and he drank the water, when it was still not fixed,"" Moore said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. ""The pipes were still not replaced. He drank the water to say, ‘It's all okay, everyone.’ And it was like a knife in the heart of the people of Flint, a black city, to see the president do this. I saw everybody just deflate. The pipes still haven't been replaced. The water is still poisoned. How many shows on Flint since he drank the water?"" Is Moore correct that in Flint, ""the pipes still haven't been replaced. The water is still poisoned""? The frustration he’s channeling is understandable. But he glosses over the progress that has been made in ameliorating this long-lasting problem. (Moore did not respond to our inquiries.) Origins of the problem In Flint -- a low-income and majority African-American city beset by a decline in the manufacturing industry -- the lead poisoning was precipitated by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder. Snyder had campaigned on his managerial experience and had promised to bring outside experts to transform financially languishing municipalities. Under emergency management, the city ended its agreement to obtain water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and instead joined a new pipeline project, the Karegnondi Water Authority, that would draw water from Lake Huron. The move, made officially in April 2013, was done in large part to save the city millions of dollars. The day after the switch was announced, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department said it would cut off service in April 2014. Since the pipeline wouldn’t be ready by then, the city prepared to switch its water supply to the Flint River. However, the river water contained salts that would corrode pipes, and the right mix of corrosion inhibitors was never used. Not only did residents complain that their new water was foul, but it eventually became clear that lead was leaching into the water supply from the city’s old pipes. Lead is a highly toxic metal, especially for children whose bodies are still developing. After a litany of missed opportunities, the situation became a focus of the national media in the second half of 2015, prompting both emergency water distribution and a search for a longer-term solution. Water quality Since the problems emerged and remedial actions were taken, the Environmental Protection Agency has conducted several rounds of testing, most recently in July. These samplings have shown improvements in lead levels, as long as residents use filters that are being provided free of charge. In June, officials decided that levels were safe enough to lift restrictions on pregnant women and small children from drinking the tap water, as long as it was filtered. The main challenge is that ""filter installation, operation and replacement are sometimes challenging, said Peggy Kahn, a University of Michigan-Flint political scientist who has closely tracked the issue. ""While lead levels have fallen according to sampling tests, there is concern that there is still lead in the system, and it is unclear whether every residence has safe water,"" Kahn said. In September 2016, Mark Durno, deputy chief of the EPA's emergency response branch, told the Detroit Free Press that lifting the filter requirement before the end of the year is not likely, barring a dramatic drop in lead levels. Marc Edwards -- a Virginia Tech environmental and water resources engineer who leads the Flint Water Study team, which helped identify the problem in the first place -- told PolitiFact that the improvements are real even though filters are still needed. ""Our recent data is indicating that the drinking water in Flint in terms of lead and other contaminants after the unprecedented intervention is now in the range of other cities with old pipes,"" Edwards said. ""Obviously, that is nothing to brag about, and the state and federal government are erring on the side of caution, including not giving an ‘all clear’ until there is a reasonable margin of safety. … But it is incorrect to say that Flint water is worse than that of other cities, at present, and given that residents are being provided protection, I think Flint residents are actually better off than residents in many other cities."" Water delivery infrastructure Progress on replacing pipes has taken longer, due in part to Congress’ inability to come to an agreement on funding. Flint has begun to rip out and replace some of the hazardous pipes under a ""FAST Start program"" that uses $27 million in funds appropriated by the state. Through mid November, pipes at 346 homes have been replaced. The city plans to replace pipes in a total of 788 homes this fall. The problem is that this is a small fraction of all pipes that will eventually need replacing. Bridge magazine, a Michigan publication that has been tracking the situation in Flint, has estimated that more than 17,000 homes may still need to be addressed, including homes with lead pipes and galvanized steel pipes, which entail similar hazards. A spokeswoman for the city of Flint, Kristin Moore, offered a similar number. ""While continuing to provide residents with free bottled water and filters is a needed and important step, the mayor stresses that we know it is only a temporary fix,"" Kristin Moore said. ""Therefore, doing what is necessary to eliminate the ongoing effects of the water crisis, including replacing all the lead-tainted pipes in the city of Flint, remains a top priority."" Edwards of Virginia Tech acknowledged the long road ahead, emphasizing that speeding up the process -- and potentially cutting corners -- could lead to more problems. ""While I know that lead pipe replacement sounds easy to a layperson, it is actually a very difficult and expensive process, and if done incorrectly can actually leave the problem worse than without pipe replacement,"" he said. ""Realize that you are disturbing a very hazardous material that is dispensing water intended for human consumption. Even a very ambitious lead pipe replacement project would take five to seven years to complete."" Edwards mentioned a ""pipe replacement disaster"" in Washington, D.C., as a precedent to avoid. The project involved 12,000 pipe replacements at a cost of more than $100 million over seven years — ""and in the process they actually increased the incidence of childhood lead poisoning due to falsified science and government agency misconduct,"" he said. Edwards understands this will sound like cold comfort for residents of Flint. ""Many Flint residents, with good reason, will never trust the safety of their potable water again, or the word of any government agency,"" he said. ""A few of them will not even trust me (or my colleagues) even after we exposed the problem. We cannot and do not blame them for that, given their journey. But the facts do not support statements that say Flint water is any more poisonous than other cities, especially considering the provision of the free filters and bottled water that protect consumers from any lead problems that remain."" Our ruling Moore said that in Flint, ""the pipes still haven't been replaced. The water is still poisoned."" It will take years to complete the replacement of Flint’s pipes. Officials have replaced a few hundred pipes, with thousands more to go. The tap water is still not safe to drink on its own. However, experts said the city has made progress here, and the water is considered safe when filtered, putting it on par with other cities with older infrastructure. While considerable hurdles remain, Moore has glossed over progress that has been made. We rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/db63e815-a3e5-4d32-aa87-0c16172dd1d5",[<zip object at 0x000002809679D580>],/factchecks/2016/nov/21/michael-moore/flint-water-still-problems-michael-moore/

Despite losing popular vote, Donald Trump won in 'electoral landslide,' GOP's Reince Priebus says
","The margin of Donald Trump’s presidential victory might be merely academic -- were it not for his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and fellow Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan declaring that Trump had won a mandate. In his own way, Wisconsinite Reince Priebus, the president-elect’s newly named chief of staff, also hammered home the idea of a surpassing victory. On Nov. 14, 2016, six days after the election, the Republican National Committee chairman repeated the same word on three network television shows: Landslide. Priebus put it this way on ABC’s ""Good Morning America"": ""And look what happened on Tuesday. I mean, it was an electoral landslide and the American people agreed that Donald Trump’s vision for America is what this country has been waiting for."" There was considerable political earth shaking after Trump’s triumph over Democrat Hillary Clinton, even though she won the popular vote. But was Trump’s win in the Electoral College, the result that mattered, a landslide? How the Electoral College works Voters cast ballots for candidates, but it is electors from each state who actually elect the president. That’s the way it’s always been in the United States. The states are assigned a number of electors based on population. The total number of electors is 538, with each state being assigned electors based on population. Thus, you need half-plus-one -- the magic 270 votes -- to win in the Electoral College. (Some Democrats want to scrap the Electoral College, but some Republicans have also backed election through popular vote. After Trump’s win, PolitiFact Georgia rated True a claim that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a major Trump supporter, had previously backed using the popular vote.) Go here to see a 1-minute video on how the Electoral College works. The Electoral College doesn’t sign, seal and deliver the final tallies until Dec. 19, 2016, a month and a day before Trump’s inauguration. But the margin, according to the Associated Press, is Trump 290 and Clinton 232, with Michigan’s 16 electoral votes still not officially determined. Trump holds a lead in Michigan, however, and is expected to win the state. So, giving him the benefit of the doubt, the electoral votes would be: Trump: 306 Clinton: 232 Does that constitute a landslide? Some really big landslides Landslide, of course, is not technically defined. When we asked for information to back Priebus’ claim, the Republican National Committee merely recited the electoral figures and repeated that it was a landslide. Countering Priebus, the Wisconsin Democratic Party pointed out that six times since 1952 alone, the winning candidate won substantially more electoral votes than Trump: President Election year Electoral votes won Ronald Reagan (R) 1984 525 Reagan 1980 489 Richard Nixon (R) 1972 520 Lyndon Johnson (D) 1964 486 Dwight Eisenhower (R) 1956 457 Eisenhower 1952 442 Democrat Barack Obama’s totals, by the way, were 332 in 2012 and 365 in 2008. These totals, too, are more than Trump. Still, just because some candidates won by larger margins doesn’t necessarily mean Trump didn’t win in a landslide. So, we consulted 10 experts. Other views One said it was close to a landslide, but none said Trump had crossed the threshold. Costas Panagopoulos, director of the Center for Electoral Politics and Democracy at Fordham University, said Trump’s winning 57 percent of the Electoral College vote makes it ""pretty close"" to a landslide. He said 60 percent is generally considered to be a landslide, at least when it comes to the popular vote. But the others all said Trump fell short. Taegan Goddard, founder of Political Wire, said the threshold should be 400 electoral votes. He said that was a figure often cited, prior to the election, when there were predictions of a Clinton landslide. Alex Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, went much lower -- 330 -- though still above what Trump has earned. Keyssar, former chairman of the Social Science Research Council's National Research Commission on Voting and Elections, acknowledged the figure is ""pure impression."" Political scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the Trump margin comes up short in another way. From 1952 to 2012, the winning candidate got an average of 73 percent of the electoral votes, well above Trump’s 57 percent. ""Losing the popular vote also takes the shine off any Electoral College victory,"" Burden added, a point echoed by Herb Asher, a political science professor emeritus at Ohio State University. Also voting no on landslide were John Woolley, a University of California, Santa Barbara political science professor and co-founder of the American Presidency Project; and Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Sabato also runs Sabato’s Crystal Ball, an election analysis website. ""Calling a 306 electoral-vote victory a ‘landslide’ is ridiculous,"" Sabato told us. ""Trump’s Electoral College majority is actually similar to John F. Kennedy’s 303 in 1960 and Jimmy Carter’s 297 in 1976. Has either of those victories ever been called a landslide? Of course not — and JFK and Carter actually won the popular vote narrowly."" Added Boston University history professor Bruce Schulman : ""To say that Trump won by a landslide, then Obama won by even bigger landslides."" Indeed, the narrower of Obama’s two wins -- in 2012 with 332 electoral votes -- was described at the time as not being a landslide by The Atlantic, Politico, conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg, Fox News’ Brit Hume and others. Our rating Priebus said Trump’s win was ""an electoral landslide."" But aside from the fact Trump lost the popular vote, his margin in the Electoral College isn’t all that high, either. None of the 10 experts we contacted said Trump’s win crosses that threshold. We rate Priebus’ claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097573200>],/factchecks/2016/nov/21/reince-priebus/despite-losing-popular-vote-donald-trump-won-elect/
"['Negative Campaigning', 'Virginia', 'Corey Stewart']","
Corey Stewart stretches Ed Gillespie's statements on Donald Trump
","Although Corey Stewart was ousted as Donald Trump’s campaign chairman in Virginia this fall, he’s still anchoring his gubernatorial campaign to the GOP president-elect. In the wake of Trump’s victory, the chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors took aim at Ed Gillespie who, like Stewart, is seeking the Republican nomination for governor. ""Ed Gillespie treated Donald Trump like he had typhoid,"" Stewart said in a post-election interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""He would not appear with him on stage. He would not mention his name unless he was condemning him."" The record on the first part of Stewart’s statement - that Gillespie would not appear with Trump - doesn’t lend itself to a fact-check because it requires us to get into Gillespie’s head. Gillespie never did appear on stage with Trump in Virginia, but there’s no evidence he refused to do so. Gillespie’s campaign says he was never invited by Trump’s camp and we’ve found no information to contradict that. So we’ll fact check the second part of Stewart’s statement - that Gillespie only mentioned Trump’s name when he was ""condemning him."" When we reached out to Stewart, he repeated that Gillespie kept Trump at an arm’s length and ""never mentioned Trump"" in a positive light. Stewart said that early in the campaign, Gillespie simply made a generic vow to support the GOP nominee. The only time Gillespie mentioned Trump by name, Stewart said, was to take the him to task following a release of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump made vulgar comments about groping women. Gillespie did criticize Trump for that, calling the candidate’s comments ""incredibly offensive and demeaning."" But contrary to Stewart’s statement, there were a few times when Gillespie did mention Trump’s name - tepidly - while voicing support for the GOP ticket. Matt Moran, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, pointed out those occasions. •A May 4 article in The Washington Post that noted Gillespie issued a one-sentence, prepared statement of support for Trump. The statement said, ""Republican voters have nominated Donald Trump for president, and I will vote for him against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in an election that will not only affect control of the White House but the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation or more."" •A May podcast interview with Bearing Drift, a conservative blog. Gillespie said, ""It’s very important that we help Donald Trump carry the commonwealth against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders because we play a critically important role in the Electoral College."" •An Aug. 23 interview with the Loudoun Times that was recorded by Gillespie’s campaign. ""I’m voting for Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton,"" Gillespie said. ""That is our choice in this election. It’s not just about the control of the executive branch for the next four years, but control of the judiciary for the next 30 years."" No doubt, Gillespie’s actions on Trump will be an issue in next year’s GOP primary for governor. Stewart isn’t the only Trump supporter accusing Gillespie of shunning the president-elect this fall. John Fredericks, who served as chairman of Trump’s campaign during the final month after Stewart was ousted, also said that Gillespie kept Trump at arm’s length. ""This was a cold, calculating political decision that he made that he’ll have to live with now,"" John Fredericks said of Gillespie. Fredericks became chairman of Trump’s Virginia campaign in October, after Stewart was fired for making unauthorized comments.   But Fredericks also acknowledged that he never asked Gillespie to appear with Trump and, therefore, can’t say definitively if Gillespie ""would not"" do so. Fredericks told us that that Gillespie did attend two rallies held by Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. They were held in Harrisonburg on Oct. 5 and at George Mason University on Nov. 5. At the latter event, Fredericks said he introduced Gillespie, who never mentioned Trump in his speech. While Gillespie is taking hits from Republicans for distancing himself from Trump, the state Democratic Party is trying to tie him to the president-elect. The Democrats started a ""Trump for Virginia governor"" website that claims Gillespie, Stewart and other GOP gubernatorial candidates are ""YUUGE Trump supporters."" Finally, we should finally note that Stewart was fired as the Trump campaign’s Virginia chairman on Oct.10 after joining a rally in front of the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington where he accused GOP ""establishment pukes"" of failing to sufficiently support Trump’s campaign. Our ruling Stewart said Gillespie ""would not mention"" Trump’s name ""unless he was condemning him."" Gillespie certainly did not praise Trump, and he did criticize the presidential nominee for making a vulgar statement about women. But there are several instances where Gillespie mentioned Trump while voicing support of the GOP ticket, saying it was important to keep conservative control of the U.S. Supreme Court. So we rate Stewart’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C142040>],/factchecks/2016/nov/21/corey-stewart/corey-stewart-stretches-ed-gillespies-statements/

Democrat Jennie Lou Leeder says Texas spends more per inmate than public school student
","Former teacher Virginia ""Jennie Lou"" Leeder said during her Texas Senate campaign that she’d like to see the state do more for students. As it is, the District 24 Democratic nominee declared: ""We spend more per day to house an inmate than we do on a student."" Really? Previous analyses First, we recognize that prisons are 24/7 operations that provide housing, meals, rehabilitation programs and other services for a housed population. Meantime, students in public schools attend classes for roughly eight hours a day, five days a week, for about 180 days each year. Regardless, it’s not uncommon for people to compare prison and school spending as an example of what they consider unbalanced budget priorities. In 2013, for instance, PolitiFact Oregon found True a claim that Oregon was spending about $10,000 a year per student compared with $30,000 per inmate, a move the governor said showed the state prioritized prisons over schools. In 2015, PolitiFact Virginia rated Half True a statement by Sen. Bernie Sanders that it costs more to go to prison than to the University of Virginia. Sanders based his claim on what it costs to house a federal prisoner, but at the state level the cost comes out to be less than a year’s fees to attend the university, particularly if considering out-of-state tuition. Fox News found in 2011 that most states, ""despite spending more money overall on education, are spending three to four times more per capita incarcerating prisoners than they are educating students."" In July 2016, the U.S. Department of Education released a report that compared the rise in spending on prisons with the rate of spending on public education. The report found that nationwide, public pre-K through grade 12 expenditures went up 107 percent while state and local corrections expenditures increased by 324 percent over a 33-year period. Leeder cites CNN  We asked Leeder before she lost to Republican Dawn Buckingham of Lakeway about the basis of her statement as quoted in an October 2016 Austin American-Statesman news article. On Leeder's behalf, Steven Rivas replied by emailing us web links from a briefing book that Rivas said the candidate took on the road to meet with teacher groups. While Leeder’s comment to the American-Statesman didn’t specify if she meant Texas or the nation in saying ""we,"" the provided web links focused on Texas. Among Leeder's offerings: A May 2013 CNN Money infographic, ""Education vs prison costs,"" indicating that nationally in 2012, every state spent more to hold inmates than it did on educating students with New York having the biggest dollar difference, spending about $40,000 more per inmate per year, and Kentucky appearing to have the smallest difference, annually spending $6,000 more per inmate. In Texas, according to the graphic, the year’s cost per student hovered below $10,000 while the cost per inmate landed near $20,000. We learned from a CNN footnote that the per-student spending figures came from the Census Bureau and the costs per inmate traced from the Vera Institute, a New York-based nonprofit research group that says it’s focused on ending mass incarceration. Scarlet Neath, an institute spokeswoman, responded to our email inquiry with links to a 2012 report, ""The Price of Prisons."" In the report, researchers calculated the cost of incarceration to taxpayers, accounting for expenses such as employee benefits, pension contributions and capital costs through a survey of 40 states. According to its Texas assessment, the state spent $3.3 billion on prisons in fiscal 2010, which ran through August 2010, or $21,390 per inmate--or, in keeping with Leeder’s ""per day"" statement, $58.60 a day. Then again, that was six-plus years ago. Updated Texas spending To get an up-to-date grasp on Leeder’s comparison, we started by eliciting figures from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the agency tasked with running state prisons and jails. In 2012, the agency had an operating budget of $3,087,899,321, and there were 152,303 offenders incarcerated, agency spokesman Jason Clark told us by email. Based on these numbers, the fiscal 2012 per inmate cost boiled out to $20,275, or $55.55 per day. Clark told us the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on fiscal matters, reaches its own estimates of such per-day costs. Clark pointed us to the board’s 2013 Criminal Justice Uniform Cost Report, which says that the state spent $50.04 per day per prisoner in fiscal 2012. The report says that figure reflects the costs of programs offered at specific prison units, such as sex offender or substance abuse treatment. Next, we searched the Census Bureau website to find its breakdown of per student state, federal and local education spending. In the latest analysis, a 2016 report called ""Public Education Finances,"" Texas was shown to spend $8,593 per student in fiscal 2014. To reach a per-day cost, we divided that figure by 180, the minimum number of days in a Texas school year--getting an estimated daily cost of $47.73 per student. A web search led us to a similar 2016 report, from the National Education Association, a teacher labor union, that cited bureau figures for state, federal and local spending to estimate the annual per student cost in 2015 for Texas at $8,935, which breaks out to $49.64 per day, we found. Next, we pursued spending figures from the Texas Education Agency. According to the agency’s online database, the 2011-2012 school year’s budget for all school districts totaled $49,623,331,143. Districts spent $9,969 per student that year, according to the agency’s calculation, that divided the state’s total revenue for school districts by the total number of students, except for those taught for less than two hours per day that year. That total comes out to a per day cost of $55.38, we calculated. Upshot: Breaking down annual spending to expenditures per day tightens the usual prison-education comparison. That is, the $55.38 that Texas spent on average to schoolchildren in 2011-12 is very close to our estimate that the state ponied up $55.55 a day in 2012 for state prisons. For perspective on the comparison, we reached Lori Taylor, a Texas A&M University school finance expert, who told us there’s research that suggests higher educational attainment can reduce the likelihood of crime, yet in her view that’s not an argument for unconstrained education spending. ""To argue that spending on schools should increase requires, in my mind, a description of what you expect schools to accomplish with the extra cash,"" she said. Our ruling Leeder said Texas spends ""more per day to house an inmate than we do on a student."" This contention holds up if you divide total costs for prisons versus schools by the 365 days in a year. It’s also narrowly so--by 17 cents a day in 2012, we found--if you limit the school part of Leeder’s comparison to the 180 days in a Texas school year. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

"['Economy', 'New York', 'Carl Heastie']","
Salary worth less today for state lawmakers than when first passed
","Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie believes members of the New York State Legislature deserve a pay raise. It will be 18 years without one when state lawmakers return to Albany in January. Lawmakers who live in areas with higher costs of living are especially pressing for an increase from the current $79,500 salary, which took effect in 1999. ""When the salary was $79,500, that purchasing power has now been reduced to $53,000,"" Heastie told WBFO last month. ""Legislators have children that they need to help go to college. They have real lives."" Their prospects for a raise look dim after the State Commission on Legislative, Judicial and Executive Compensation this week denied a proposal to boost their salaries by 47 percent to $116,900. It remains unclear when the pay issue will come up again. The Legislature has the power to reinstate the commission, or lawmakers can even vote to increase their own pay. We looked into whether Heastie is right about how far lawmakers’ current pay goes today compared with when they first received their $79,500 salary. The politics of pay The last pay raise, adopted by the Legislature in late 1998, took effect in January 1999. It did not come easily. Lawmakers got a 38 percent increase in pay from $57,500 to $79,500, but only after the Democratic-controlled Assembly passed a bill supported by then-Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, allowing charter schools in New York State. After the commission rejected the proposed pay raise last week, a member of the commission said the governor’s appointees would support a meaningful raise if the Legislature held a special session before the end of this year to limit lawmakers’ outside income. The commission is made up of appointees from the governor, the Legislature and the judiciary. Two appointees from the Legislature voted in favor of the pay increase. Two appointees from the governor did not vote on measure. An appointee of the judiciary also abstained. The proposal failed by one vote. What’s it worth now? The $79,500 base salary that lawmakers receive today ranks as the third highest for state lawmakers in the country. That doesn’t include stipends lawmakers receive for taking on leadership positions, which range anywhere from $9,000 to $41,500 for the highest-ranking lawmakers in each chamber. The purchasing power of that salary has fallen as the cost of living rises. One dollar in 1999 now has the purchasing power of just 68 cents according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The calculation proves Heastie’s point: $79,500 in January 1999 has the same buying power as $54,060 in October 2016. Our ruling While visiting Buffalo, Heastie said the purchasing power of a state lawmaker’s $79,500 salary ""has now been reduced to $53,000"" since that salary took effect 18 years ago. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Heastie is slightly off in his comparison. Inflation actually pegs the purchasing power of the current salary at $54,060. We rate this claim as Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dcea594d-995a-4fd0-829f-2c81a7d5e407",[<zip object at 0x00000280966CF380>],/factchecks/2016/nov/18/carl-heastie/salary-worth-less-today-state-lawmakers-when-first/

Reince Priebus says Trump, Congress have similar immigration policies
","Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and future chief of staff for President-elect Donald Trump, dismissed criticism that legislators from his party and Trump were at odds on a series of issues. During the presidential campaign, Trump disagreed with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans over mass deportations, trade, Social Security and Medicare, said Steve Rattner, a former adviser to President Barack Obama and an economic analyst on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. ""How are you guys going to resolve those conflicts?"" Rattner asked Priebus on the Nov. 14 show. ""Well, there's not that many, the conflicts aren't as great as you're outlining,"" Priebus responded. ""President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting. That's not extreme, that's exactly what is in the House today."" Is Priebus right? We decided to check whether there currently are immigration policies in Congress similar to Trump’s proposals. Trump’s immigration policies On the campaign trail, Trump promised to build a wall to stop illegal immigration and to be tough on people who violated immigration laws. While he was inconsistent about his plans for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, he was firm on deporting criminals. Trump also said he would limit legal immigration because ""immigration flows are too large to perform adequate screening."" Trump repeatedly criticized his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, for wanting to increase the number of refugees admitted into the United States from Syria, a country afflicted by terrorism. ""When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats,"" Trump said June 13, 2016. In December 2015, Trump called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on."" That comment came after a deadly attack in San Bernardino, Calif. In his 10-point immigration plan, Trump said he would ""suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur, until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place."" Congress policies We reached out to the Republican National Committee, chaired by Priebus, to find out which congressional policies specifically mirror Trump’s immigration proposals. We did not get a response from the committee or from the House Republican Conference. So we did some digging on our own. A bill called the American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced in the House a year ago, calling for additional screening of ""covered aliens,"" to ensure they are not a threat to national security. The bill defines a ""covered alien"" as a person applying for admission as a refugee and who is a national or resident of Iraq or Syria; has no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in Iraq or Syria; or has been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or after March 1, 2011. Individuals cannot be admitted as refugees until the FBI director certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security and to the National Intelligence director that background investigations sufficiently determined they are not a threat to national security, the bill said. A refugee may also only be admitted after the Secretary of Homeland Security -- in unanimous agreement with the directors of the FBI and National Intelligence -- certifies to 12 ""appropriate Congressional Committees"" that the person is not a national security threat. The American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced by Rep. Michael T. McCaul, R-Texas, and co-sponsored by 102 Republicans and one Democrat. It passed the House Nov. 19, 2015, with a 289-137 vote and stalled in the Senate in January. Another House bill, Give States a Chance Act of 2015, was introduced November 2015 to allow governors to refuse the placement of Syrian refugees in their respective states if they certify they are ""not reasonably satisfied"" that the refugee does not pose a security threat. Under that bill, the governor could also refuse a refugee if he or she ""has not properly been informed of the intended sponsorship process for the refugee"" and if the governor determines that the proposed resettlement location ""is inappropriate because the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants"" in the area is too high. Thirteen Republicans co-sponsored the bill introduced by Rep. Ted S. Yoho, R-Fla. It’s been referred to the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security. This summer, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) also introduced in the House the Resettlement Accountability National Security Prioritization Act of 2016, to ""suspend, and subsequently terminate, the admission of certain refugees."" The bill is directed to nationals of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen; or people who have no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in those specific countries. Forty-nine Republicans co-sponsored the bill, which would also evaluate the costs of benefits provided to refugees and their impact on national security. Babin’s bill to suspend admission of refugees sounds like what Priebus was talking about, said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring stricter immigration policies. Our ruling Priebus said, ""President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting."" Trump's policies include ending sanctuary cities, deporting at least 2 million people and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, not just restrictions on refugees. As for the restrictions, a bill passed in the House that is designed to increase screening of potential refugees from Iraq and Syria. The bill also called for certifications that ensure potential refugees are not a threat to the security of the United States. But it has stalled in the Senate. Two other House bills restricting the admission and resettlement of refugees have not been voted on either, so their outcome and support is still to be determined.  We rate Priebus’ statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971B06C0>],/factchecks/2016/nov/18/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-trump-congress-have-similar-im/

Fact-check: Did 3 million undocumented immigrants vote in this year's election?
","Were there 3 million illegal votes from undocumented immigrants in this year’s presidential election? Well, that’s what some websites are saying. ""Report: 3 million votes in presidential election cast by illegal aliens,"" reads a headline on InfoWars, a conspiracy website ran by Alex Jones. The article has been shared via Facebook more than 48,000 times when we last looked. Other websites also have touted this report, including Milo, TheNewAmerican and FreedomDaily. So is there any truth to it? Well, we don’t know for absolute certain. But the report is actually a tweet, and the person who authored the tweet won’t explain how he arrived at his figure. If that isn’t reason enough to be skeptical, independent experts and historical analyses suggest it’s highly suspect. In other words, don’t buy it. Where’s the report? As evidence of its claim, InfoWars’ headline refers to a report from VoteFraud.org and tweets from Gregg Phillips, whose Twitter profile says he’s the founder of VoteStand, a voter fraud reporting app. There is no report from VoteFraud.org, however, and Phillips told PolitiFact he is not affiliated with that website. The information comes from tweets made by from Phillips on Nov. 11 and Nov. 13. Here they are: We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens. We are joining .@TrueTheVote to initiate legal action. #unrigged Completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million.Consulting legal team. Phillips would not provide any additional information when asked by PolitiFact. He said he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy. Phillips would also not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used. Phillips said he would release the information publicly once he is finally finished. According to his page on LinkedIn, Phillips is a former finance director of the Alabama Republican Party. He also served as executive director of the Mississippi Republican Party and was managing director of a super PAC that supported Newt Gingrich’s 2012 campaign for president. Plenty of reason to be skeptical While we have no idea how Phillips arrived at his claim that 3-million noncitizens voted, people who have made similar claims in the past have cited a 2014 report that claims 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010 midterm congressional elections. That report was based on data from a Harvard survey of people. But the data was flawed, which created flaws in the subsequent report. The authors of the survey say a small percentage of respondents, who are citizens, accidentally misidentified themselves as noncitizens on the survey. This is because the respondents didn’t read the question carefully and accidentally selected the wrong response to the question. How do researchers know this? One of the authors of the survey, Brian Schaffner, said people changed their answers later when they were asked about their citizenship. ""When we took out people who changed their answer on the citizenship question and only look at people who answered consistently that they were noncitizens, we found no reported noncitizens who voted,"" Schaffner told PolitiFact. Other research contradicts Phillips’ tweet. News 21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011. A report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. ""Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper,"" reads the 2007 report. States that have tried to purge noncitizens from voter rolls, meanwhile, have found even government data lacking. In 2012, Florida Governor Rick Scott’s administration started an effort trying to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. Through this process the Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives — including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the voting rolls. State officials began to pursue a second attempt at a purge in advance of the 2014 election but then abandoned that effort, too. Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, called Phillips’ claim ""fake news."" ""There is no credible evidence I have seen to show large numbers of noncitizens voting in U.S. elections anywhere,"" Hasen said. ""The idea that 3 million noncitizens could have illegally voted in our elections without being detected is obscenely ludicrous."" Our ruling Reports claim 3 million ""illegal aliens"" cast votes in this year's election. The articles point back to tweets from Gregg Phillips, who has worked for the Republican Party and has a voter fraud reporting app. But Phillips will not provide any evidence to support his claim, which happens to be undermined by publicly available information. If Phillips does release a more detailed report, we will consider that information. But for now, this claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097248300>],/factchecks/2016/nov/18/blog-posting/no-3-million-undocumented-immigrants-did-not-vote-/
