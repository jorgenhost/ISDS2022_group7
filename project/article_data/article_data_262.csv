Sen. Sosnowski says Rhode Island ranks second in U.S. for Lyme disease
","
Remember when you could roll around in the grass and not have to worry that a tick bite would leave you with aching joints that make you feel like you’re 80 years old?

Lyme disease changed that. Now we have to worry that a tick the size of a poppy seed might cause an infection that mimics the flu and can cause muscle and joint pain. It can also lead to serious long-term health problems.

To help combat Lyme disease, state Sen. Susan Sosnowski of South Kingstown proposed legislation that would authorize the Rhode Island Lottery to sell ""Scratch-A-Tick"" scratch tickets, with the proceeds going toward prevention and research.

What caught our eye was the assertions in her news release that ""Lyme disease is one of the fastest growing infectious diseases in the United States, and Rhode Island has the second-highest incidence of this disease in the country.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which tracks diseases in the United States, doesn't rank infectious diseases by growth rate.

But the CDC does release annual reports on the number of cases. We took their numbers and did some additional math.  We picked 2008 -- the most recent online report -- and looked at growth rate of infectious diseases from 2004. While there were higher growth rates for much rarer diseases, such as measles, in terms of the actual number of additional cases, Lyme ranked third.

Because she couched her language, the first part of Sosnowski’s statement was true.

The second question is whether Rhode Island really ranks second in incidence of Lyme cases nationwide. We were intrigued by that figure because we had heard that the disease has become very common in other parts of the country. (Lyme was first identified in 1975 in Lyme, Conn., but scientists believe it has been around for at least a century -- and maybe since the last Ice Age.)

The CDC gave us state statistics from 2005 to 2009, and we found earlier numbers, showing that Rhode Island isn't even near the top among states where Lyme is common.

The numbers showed that Rhode Island was number two in the country in 2002 (behind Connecticut) and number one in 2003.

But since then, our ranking has declined. Six states -- Delaware, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts -- beat us out in 2004. We went back up to fourth in 2006, but in the other years after 2004, we ranked 13th or lower.

In 2009, the CDC numbers showed, a dozen states had a higher rate of confirmed cases of Lyme than Rhode Island. Nine states had rates that were double our rate of 142 cases per million people.

In other words, these days we're not even close to being second.

So we contacted Sosnowski. She said her statement was based on a July 2003 news release from the Lyme Disease Association of Rhode Island. ""It might be out of date,"" she acknowledged.

Thomas Mather, director of the University of Rhode Island’s TickEncounter Resource Center, who asked Sosnowski to submit the legislation, contended that the CDC numbers are not accurate. He believes Sosnowski, if not correct, is close.

The problem: Rhode Island, which supplies the numbers to the CDC, stopped making a rigorous count years ago for budget reasons. That's why, he said, in 2004 the number of Rhode Island cases reported to the CDC plummeted from 736 to 249, even though there was no evidence that the problem had diminished. (The numbers have since rebounded, but most years they are far below pre-2004 levels.)

Just based on the tick population in Rhode Island, he said, the state’s infection rate must be extraordinarily high. And, he said, it’s widely believed by people in the field that for every case reported, there are probably five other people who have been infected.

""We are certainly in the top five"" for Lyme disease cases, said Mather. ""Before 2004, we sort of were second. Then in 2004, states like Rhode Island and Connecticut suspended new case surveillance because we couldn't afford to do it.""

And in the intervening years, ""nothing has changed in Rhode Island to take away our ticks or our human exposure to ticks,"" he said. ""I'm fairly certain Rhode Island is right near the top of the list, if not at the top of the list, in the real number of cases of Lyme disease, if we could only count them.""

Annemarie Beardsworth, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Health, said the state’s Lyme disease numbers dropped from 2005 to 2007 because the Health Department didn’t have anyone to evaluate the data. That subsequently changed, she said, and the numbers have been reliable since 2008.

""Our sense is it is now fair to compare from state to state,"" she said. ""Doctor Mather may be looking at ticks, but we're looking at diagnosed, laboratory-confirmed cases.""

We found that for 2009, even if you took all 85 ""probable"" cases of Lyme in Rhode Island and added them to the 150 ""confirmed"" cases (and only do it for Rhode Island), we would be ranked 11th in the nation, not second.

From a broader perspective, Dr. Paul Mead, a chief of epidemiology and surveillance activity at the CDC, discourages people from focusing on state rankings because such numbers aren't as precise as you might expect. He said the uncertainty varies from disease to disease, and there may be more uncertainty in the numbers from some states than others.

""Lyme disease advocates will often push the idea of counting every case and surveillance is terrible,"" said Mead. ""I think much of that is borne from the notion that if you get your case count up, people will take it seriously and the disease will get more recognition.""

In the end, CDC data confirm that, even though Sosnowski was citing outdated information, it's still fair to say that Lyme is ""one of"" the nation’s fastest growing infections.

But when she says that Rhode Island ranks second when it comes to the incidence of Lyme, she is giving a very precise statistic, citing it with authority, and using the present tense to make it sound current.

Yet there's no data to support her claim.

Both Sosnowski and Mather expressed fear that, when people hear what the latest numbers are, they will falsely conclude that Lyme disease is no longer a big deal. In fact, it is.

And so is the truth, so we rate Sosnowski's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CF06C0>],/factchecks/2011/feb/20/susan-sosnowski/sen-sosnowski-says-rhode-island-ranks-second-us-ly/

Gov. Bob McDonnell says Virginia road bids are the lowest in a generation
","
It’s an ideal time to build roads, Gov. Bob McDonnell says. He’s telling everyone that interest rates are low, the improvements are badly needed and bids on highway projects are coming in dirt cheap.

The arguments have gained traction in the General Assembly. The House and Senate have passed versions of McDonnell’s proposal to accelerate the issuance of $1.8 billion in bonds to fund road projects across Virginia over the next three years.

McDonnell, a Republican, set the goal during his State of the Commonwealth Address to the  legislature last month. In laying out reasons to speed up borrowing for roads, he said, ""Bids on construction are coming in at the lowest in the modern era.""

We’ve heard supportive legislators repeat McDonnell’s line about bids -- or versions of it -- and wanted to know if it is true.

First, we asked for clarification. How does the McDonnell define the ""modern era"" when it comes to road bids? ""He’s talking about a generation, about 20 years,"" Tucker Martin, the governor’s chief of communications said.

So McDonnell is saying bids for road construction are the lowest in about 20 years. Martin said the information came from the Virginia Department of Transportation and urged us to call Malcolm Kerley, the chief engineer.

Kerley could not confirm McDonnell’s claim, explaining that VDOT does not keep annual records of the overall rise or fall in state construction bids. ""Historically, we haven’t done it,"" said Kerley, a 40-year employee at VDOT. ""I don’t remember anyone asking for it.""

Kerley acknowledged that last year bids for large state road projects were indeed low. They came  in an average 17 percent below VDOT’s projections, he said. VDOT had not tracked the figure prior to 2010.

""I don’t know if we’re making history or not,"" he said.

With the construction industry hurting, Kerley said competition among contractors for road work has increased, resulting in lower bids. Last year, about 130 new firms sought to qualify to bid on state highway work, Kerley said. During a normal year, ""10 to 20"" new companies seek qualification, he added.

We called Jeff Southard, executive vice-president of the Virginia Transportation Construction Alliance, a lobby for road contractors. Although he, too, is also convinced bids are coming in low, he had no data to offer other than what VDOT told us.

""People are looking for work and it’s very competitive,"" Southard said. ""You see companies that used to do commercial work bidding on highway work. You see a lot more companies coming in from out of state and expanding their geographical boundaries.""

OK, we’re convinced road prices are good right now. But is there any historical data that will tell us how good?

We found a few interesting charts that cast doubt on McDonnell’s claim bids are the best lowest in 20 years.

A Bureau of Labor Statistics index shows the cost of highway construction materials went up 98 percent nationally between 1990 and the middle of 2010.

The Federal Highway Administration began a quarterly measure of road construction costs in 2003. The index shows that costs at the end of last June -- the latest time available -- plunged 28 percent since the summer of 2008, when oil prices hit all-time highs. Oil is a key ingredient in asphalt.

Even with the drop, construction costs at the end of June were not at  the low point in the 7 1/2-year history of the index. They were the cheapest prices since March, 2004.

A road building cost index for five Western states goes back 20 years -- exactly the span McDonnell referred to in his speech. Since 1990, construction costs in those five states went up an average of 115 percent.

Given these indexes and the lack of any historical data in Virginia, is it possible that McDonnell is right and construction bids are coming in the lowest in two decades?

Ken Simonson, chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America, did not want to weigh in specifically on the governor’s claim, citing the dearth of data from Virginia. But he said the indexes we are using are reliable.

Simonson said Virginia may not have seen quite the increase in road costs over the last 20 years experienced by the more mountainous Western states. On the other hand, he added that Virginia has not been immune to a steady rise over two decades in the price of road construction materials such as oil, steel, copper and concrete.

Let’s review:

McDonnell says Virginia’s highway construction bids ""are coming in at the lowest of the modern era."" His communications chief says the governor was referring to about 20-year time span. McDonnell offers no statistical proof for his claim because such data has never been kept in Virginia.

But there is data that undercuts the governor’s claim.  A Bureau of Labor Statistics index shows the price of highway construction materials went up 98 percent over the last 20 years.

A Federal Highway Administration index shows road construction prices are the lowest in six years. The Western state index shows highway prices have increased by 115 percent since 1990.

While circumstantial evidence certainly suggests the governor statement is inaccurate, we can not establish that beyond all reasonable doubt. We rate McDonnell’s claim Barely True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C9A4C0>],/factchecks/2011/feb/19/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-road-bids-are-lowe/
"['Education', 'Texas', 'Lloyd  Doggett']","
Lloyd Doggett says Austin has ""half-a-dozen or more schools on a list to be closed"" plus several hundred school workers ""on the list for possible terminations""
","
U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett landed in a Feb. 16 opinion column by Gail Collins of The New York Times that questioned draft plans by the GOP-led Texas Legislature not to hike state education aid.

""In Austin,"" Collins quoted the Austin Democrat saying, ""I’ve got half-a-dozen or more schools on a list to be closed — one of which I presented a federal blue-ribbon award to for excellence. And several hundred school personnel on the list for possible terminations.""

We wondered if Doggett accurately summarized the situation.

Doggett’s spokeswoman, Sarah Dohl, told us by e-mail that Doggett based his comment on Austin American-Statesman news reports on a district task force’s recommendations about closing schools and the district’s recent announcement that it’s considering employee layoffs as part of an array of budget cuts.

Doggett’s ""blue-ribbon"" reference, Dohl said, was to South Austin’s Zilker Elementary. We found  a May 1999 Statesman story stating that Zilker was among three district schools that year to win the honor from the U.S. Department of Education. The story says Doggett was expected to attend the award ceremony. It quotes then-Education Secretary Richard Riley saying: ""These schools are examples of the good things happening in education nationwide.""

Next, we turned to the Statesman’s coverage of school closure recommendations by the Austin district’s volunteer facilities task force. According to a Feb. 10 story, the task force in January specified nine schools, including Zilker, that could be closed ""for efficiency’s sake."" However, the story says, the task force’s recommendations to the school board would not name particular schools, instead referring to areas of the city where schools could be closed in 2012-13 and 2013-14.

A link on the Statesman site led us to a Feb. 9 draft version of the task force’s district facility master plan, which urges consideration of school closures ""only after all other alternatives and options, both programmatic and facilities use, have been thoroughly examined and discussed with the affected communities.""

No individual schools are named, but there are regional suggestions for consolidating/closing a middle school in Northeast Austin; four elementary schools in ""Central East Austin""; three elementary schools in Central Austin; and one elementary school in South Austin.

We called the district, whose spokesman, Andy Welch, cautioned that the district has no school-closing schedule and said its facility task force won’t present its final report until March. ""So there is no list"" of schools to be closed, Welch said.

Still, didn’t the names of nine schools get floated for possibly closing? ""Can’t deny that,"" Welch said.

After he noted that some of the school district is outside Doggett’s House district, we ran the addresses of the schools named for possible closure through the Texas Legislative Council’s ""Who Represents Me?"" web feature. Eight are in Doggett’s district; Pease Elementary is in San Antonio Rep. Lamar Smith’s district.

Dohl of Doggett’s office said by e-mail that the congressman was aware of the updated task force report--and that it doesn’t specify individual schools to possibly close. But, Dohl said, ""the school closure list seems to still be a very real issue"" and Doggett believes school closures should be avoided.

All told, Doggett’s comment accurately refers to Zilker Elementary and possible district layoffs. At the time he spoke, though, the task force that aired school closing suggestions had backed off the specifics. And it's not certain any schools are to be closed. 
We rate Doggett’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C36E080>],/factchecks/2011/feb/19/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-hes-got-half-dozen-or-more-scho/
"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Wesley Smith']","
One pundit says Oregon Health Plan rations “covered procedures under certain circumstances”
","
UPDATE, Feb. 21, 2011 -- When we researched this claim, we made three attempts to reach Wesley J. Smith, the author of the Weekly Standard article. He did not respond to our messages, so we researched the claim on the assumption that he was referring to rationing of covered services that the state had previously said it would pay for. After our item was published and rated False, Smith contacted PolitiFact Oregon and said he was misinterpreted.

He said he he never meant to imply -- nor did he write -- that the Oregon Health Plan declines to pay for treatment it has previously indicated it will cover. Rather, he says, he meant simply to say that while the Oregon Health Plan does cover some chemotherapy, there are certain treatments that fall under that broad umbrella that would not be covered. ""I wasn't saying that she (Barbara Wagner) thought the plan would have permitted her to have the drug. I never meant to imply that. All I was trying to say was that sometimes ... there will be a time when a treatment can be denied under the plan.""

He added that the claim that we chose to focus on surprised him. He said he would have been a ""little more precise"" has he known that sentence, in particular, would garner so much attention.

The assertion that the Oregon Health Plan rations ""covered procedures under certain circumstances"" can be read a few different ways. Our take initially, absent Mr. Smith's comments, was that he was implying that the plan could ration treatments that it had previously purported to cover. His clarifications, however, indicate to us that there is a certain amount of underlying truth to what he argued. As such, we've moved the Truth-O-Meter to Half True. Our updated article is below.

Also, Barbara Wagner's name was misspelled when this analysis was initially published. The spelling has since been corrected. 
  
-----------------------

You might think that naming something ""Lie of the Year"" would put an issue to rest. Apparently, you’d be wrong. PolitiFact National called Sarah Palin’s assertion that Barack Obama’s health care overhaul would lead to ""death panels"" Lie of Year back in 2009, but the term keeps cropping up.

In a recent Weekly Standard article one writer, Wesley J. Smith, applied the label to Oregon’s own Medicaid program. ""‘Single payer’ and ‘death panels’ go together like ‘See’s’ and ‘candy,’"" he writes.

Smith takes aim at several targets -- Wisconsin, Canada’s Medicare, Britain’s National Health Service and, of course, ""Obamacare"" -- but here’s what he says about the Oregon Health Plan:
  
Oregon, a decidedly liberal state, provides an unequivocal example. In 1993, the Clinton administration gave permission to the Oregon Health Plan, the state’s Medicaid program, to introduce rationing. The system involves a treatment schedule that lists 649 potentially covered procedures. The state pegs the number of procedures the state will cover to the available funds. Patients requiring procedures above the cutoff line are out of luck. 
As of October 2010, only the first 502 treatments were covered. But even that low number doesn’t tell the full story of rationing in Oregon. The Oregon Health Plan also rations covered procedures under certain circumstances. Chemotherapy, for instance, is not provided if it is deemed to have a 5 percent or less chance of extending the patient’s life for five years, meaning that a patient whose life might be extended a year or two with chemo may not receive it. 
  
Worse, even though it is not a formally ranked procedure, assisted suicide is covered under state law. Thus, when two recurrent cancer patients were rationed out of receiving potentially life-extending chemotherapy in 2008, an administrator wrote a letter assuring them that the state would pay for the costs associated with their assisted suicides. Talk about a death panel! 

There’s a lot to take in here. Did Oregon really start rationing in 1993? Did we really deny lifesaving chemotherapy to a patient?

Ultimately, we decided to fact-check one statement that, on its face, might seem a little tame, but, in fact, seems to speak to the implications of Smith’s piece. So, here it is:

Does the Oregon Health Plan ration ""covered procedures under certain circumstances""? 

Before we jump into that question, however, we wanted to take this opportunity to correct some factual errors that Darren Coffman, director of Oregon’s Health Services Commission, pointed out when we called to chat with him about the article.

1) The Oregon Health Plan has a list of 679 potentially covered lines of treatment, not 649. The word ""procedure"" isn’t very accurate when used here, either. Each of those entries is a medical condition with a corresponding treatment plan that could include dozens of procedures. Some conditions are repeated multiple times, Coffman said. Cancer of the liver, for instance, has several  lines of treatment.

2) Smith writes that chemotherapy isn’t covered if it has a ""5 percent or less chance of extending the patient’s life for five years, meaning that a patient whose life might be extended a year or two with chemo may not receive it."" That rule was changed two years back, Coffman said. Now, it’s less cut and dried. Instead there are four conditions under which chemotherapy might be denied. For example, a treatment that has less than a 50 percent chance of extending life, on average, six to 12 months, based on the ""best available published evidence"" would not be covered. Still, the basic concept remains: If there’s a small chance the treatment will extend life significantly, the state will not cover it.

Next, let’s look into this idea of Smith’s that the Oregon Health Plan started ""rationing"" after 1993 when the Clinton administration gave then- and current-Gov. John Kitzhaber permission to change the way the Medicaid program worked.

Kitzhaber did change the way the state’s Medicaid program worked in 1993. And it was a significant change. Here’s the before and after:

Before 1994, Oregon’s Medicaid program worked the way most any other state’s program worked. The program covered individuals and families who were either so high risk that private insurance companies would not cover them or who were making a certain percent of the federal poverty level. That option left tens of thousands of Oregonians uninsured. If you made too much to get into the state’s program but not enough to afford a private insurance package, you simply went without. Furthermore, if the state’s budget dipped, officials simply reset the bar at which people were eligible for the program, essentially cutting off people who made too much.

After 1994, the state began to prioritize health care treatments. Kitzhaber created a commission that developed this much-talked-about prioritized list. The list gave higher priority to the most effective treatments as indicated by the latest research. At the top, you have preventive care for children and maternity care; at the bottom, plastic surgery, which is, of course, not covered.

Every two years, the Legislature draws a line, saying, essentially, we can cover treatment option 502 and up. Or whatever government income might allow. Legislators do not pick which services to provide; they simply draw a funding line.

After 1994, the number of treatments covered shrank, but by limiting the services provided -- and therefore the costs -- Oregon could afford to include more folks in the program. Under the new guidelines, the health plan added some 55,000 people who would have otherwise been ineligible, according to state numbers.

So which of the above options are rationing? Well, Susan Tolle, the director of Oregon Health & Science University’s Center for Ethics in Health Care, says both are.

The way most states work -- and the way Oregon worked before ‘94 -- is if you don’t meet the poverty level stipulated ""you’re thrown out. You get nothing. You’re ineligible. You don’t receive benefits of any kind. It’s not a discussion of what’s fair or not fair,"" Tolle said. ""I believe that is rationing. And it’s what we did before the Oregon Health Plan.""

Now, she says, ""the Oregon Health Plan has created much more transparency about rationing than before … we are much more public about what people are getting and not getting.""

Coffman puts it this way: ""We’ve chosen to try to cover more people and limit some of the services according to treatments that have been shown to be ineffective or have lower impact on personal health."" This is actually what private insurance companies do, as well.

We’re convinced by what Tolle says. It may be that the Oregon Health Plan’s current configuration seems more like rationing, given that there’s a prioritized list. But any Medicaid program ""rations,"" whether by denying some services, or denying all services. Oregon takes the former route.

This is important, because the idea that Oregon is somehow fundamentally different in the way it denies care is central to Smith’s argument that the state rations even those services that it purports to cover.  

Let’s move on to his proof: He says Oregon denied life-extending care and instead offered physician-assisted suicide to two cancer patients.

This story has roots in a controversy that erupted in summer 2008. According to an Associated Press story and an editorial in The Oregonian from the time, Barbara Wagner, a 64-year-old Springfield woman with lung cancer, was told that the Oregon Health Plan would not cover a prescribed cancer drug, but that it would cover end-of-life care, including physician-assisted suicide.

Now, as the editorial from the time pointed out, Wagner had received thousands of dollars worth of care through the Oregon Health Plan in the previous years. And she would continue to do so. However, a specific drug she had been prescribed cost some $4,000 a month and did not meet the standard -- in place at the time -- that the drug should have a 5 percent chance of extending her life by five years. (Under the revised standard, according to Coffman, the outcome would have been the same: the state would not pay for the chemotherapy drug.)

At the time, Kitzhaber co-wrote an opinion piece along with the then-chairman of the Oregon Health Services Commission. Here’s how they explained what had happened:

""The Oregon Health Plan covers nearly all chemotherapy prescribed for cancer patients, including the multiple rounds of chemotherapy that the woman in this case received. The request for second-line treatment was denied because of the drug’s limited benefit and very high cost.""

It’s true, Kitzhaber continued, that the Oregon Health Plan covers doctor-assisted suicide but ""weighting the cost of end-of-life treatment against the voter-approved Death With Dignity Act was never part of those discussions. No treatment has ever been denied because death would be more ‘cost effective.’""

So, with that all sorted out, the question remains, did the Oregon Health Plan decide to ration previously covered treatment? 

Well, in the case of the woman mentioned above, that doesn’t seem to be the case. From the get-go, the medication she requested would not have been covered. There are clear guidelines for what sorts of treatments should and should not be covered. This drug was never one of them. This wasn’t the case just for the cancer patient in question. It’s the case for all covered under the Oregon Health Plan.

So this situation aside, can the Oregon Health Plan suddenly restrict covered treatment lines? It cannot. The process is clear: A commission, every two years, prioritizes treatment plans based on the most current research. There are some 679 of these lines. The state Legislature then draws a funding line -- currently at treatment line 502. That line, and all those above it, are covered, Coffman says. Period.

We read Smith’s comment that the plan rations covered procedures to mean that the plan denies patients care it has previously said it covers. However, Smith says that’s not how his words should be interpreted. Instead, he was trying to indicate that while chemotherapy is generally covered under the health plan, there are instances when it’s not. 

He’s right to a certain extent. Chemotherapy is included in several of the 502 treatment lines currently covered, but the type of chemotherapy covered and the situations under which it is covered are clear and immutable. We understand what he’s saying, but it somewhat confuses and ignores the way in which the prioritized list works. The list is not one of broadly covered procedures -- chemotherapy, organ transplant, physical therapy, etc. -- but one of medical conditions and very specific treatment plans. 

Smith’s clarification is welcome. It’s also necessary to understanding his argument. As such, we find his claim that the Oregon Health Plan rations ""covered procedures under certain circumstances"" to be Half True -- the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important, clarifying details.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2B5840>],/factchecks/2011/feb/19/wesley-smith/one-pundit-says-oregon-health-plan-rations-covered/

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says his budget-repair bill would leave collective bargaining “fully intact”
","
If Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker isn’t trying to strip most collective bargaining rights from public employees, then why do workers keep pouring into Madison by the thousands to demonstrate against him?

Many state, local government and public school employees -- including those represented by the largest state workers union -- have said they would be willing to pay more for pensions and health insurance, as called for in a budget-repair bill introduced by Walker.

But the workers continue to protest provisions in the bill that would restrict most public employee unions to bargaining only over wages, and then only within caps.

It’s the central issue in the protests, which have drawn national attention.

And yet on the morning of Feb. 18, 2011 -- a day after Democratic state senators fled to Illinois to prevent a vote on the bill -- Walker made a startling declaration in a Milwaukee radio interview.

At the turn of the 19th century, the Republican governor told conservative talk show host Charles Sykes, Wisconsin adopted the ""strongest civil service protections"" in the world.

Walker then added:

""Those fully remain intact. Civil service does not get altered by the modest changes we’re talking about here. Collective bargaining is fully intact. You’ve got merit hiring, you’ve got just cause for termination and for discipline. All those things remain.""

In the middle of that statement is the eyebrow-raising remark.

Collective bargaining would remain ""fully intact""?

We immediately asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie for evidence that would back up his boss’ statement. In the crush of activity in Madison, where the state Assembly took up the budget-repair bill as Walker did the interview, Werwie had not responded by publication time.

But let’s take a look at what was said.

In contending that collective bargaining would remain fully intact, Walker mixed civil service protections with collective bargaining rights.

They are not the same.

Civil service protections

The protections are put into state law by the Legislature, or into a local ordinance by a city council, or village or town board, said public-sector employer attorney Andrew Phillips. He is general counsel for the Wisconsin Counties Association and his Mequon firm also represents municipalities and school districts.

Currently, state employees are covered by civil service, but most local government employees don’t have it and no public school employees do, Phillips said.

Phillips said civil service protections, among other things, specify employee rights to things such as vacation and overtime; prohibit termination for reasons other than just cause; and create procedures for employees to file grievances and to have those complaints heard.

What they don’t provide, he said, is any right for employees to bargain with their employers over those issues and others. The terms are set by the employer.

Collective bargaining rights

Two sections of state law -- one for state workers and one for local government and public school employees -- give public employees the right in Wisconsin to collectively bargain.

The law issues a mandate to both the employer (the government) and the collective bargaining unit (employees represented by a union).

The two sides must ""meet and confer at reasonable times, in good faith, with the intention of reaching an agreement"" on wages, hours, fringe benefits and conditions of employment.

In other words, the workers -- through their union -- have a say in those areas. They do not have such a say under civil service rules.

So, what would change if Walker’s budget-repair bill is adopted by the Republican-controlled Legislature?

With an amendment approved by the Joint Finance Committee, the bill would require local governments that don’t have a civil service system to establish one, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

Alternatively, local governments could establish a grievance procedure that would, at minimum, address employee discipline and workplace safety, and provide for a grievance procedure for employee terminations.

Let’s return to Walker’s statement that under his changes collective bargaining remains intact.

To be sure, those rights would remain intact for the State Patrol and local police and fire department employees. They are exempt from any of the changes.

As for the rest of state, local government and public school employees, Walker’s own Feb. 11, 2011 letter to employees about his plan cited ""various changes to limit collective bargaining"" to the rate of base pay.

The letter also noted other changes, including limiting contracts to one year and requiring annual employee votes to retain unions.

Moreover, the bill would repeal all bargaining rights for home health care workers, University of Wisconsin System faculty and academic staff, and employees of University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics.

Indeed, Walker also said in the interview with Sykes it was necessary to use his bill to strip collective bargaining rights because when it comes to money the state is broke. He added:

""What changes is the fact that no longer can our unions have a stranglehold -- not only on the state government but local government -- to force them to not alter benefit packages that are like a virus eating up our budget.""

Where does that leave us?

In arguing the changes would be modest, Walker cited the civil service system and said ""collective bargaining is fully in
tact."" However, Walker himself has outlined how his budget-repair bill would limit the collective bargaining rights of public employees.

U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan compares Madison to Cairo, calls protests over collective bargaining changes “riots”
","
Crowds have built for a week in Madison as public employees and their supporters rally against Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to strip them of most of their collective bargaining rights.

Walker supporters have criticized the protests, especially because they included numerous teachers who called in sick, forcing the closure of school districts -- including the Milwaukee Public Schools.

Appearing on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" program the morning of Feb. 17, 2011, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., defended Walker’s efforts to force public employees to pay more in pension and health care costs to solve the state’s budget deficit.

""It's not asking a lot,"" said Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the stars of the new GOP House majority. ""It's still about half of what private sector pensions do and health care packages do.""

He added, referring to Walker, ""So he's basically saying ‘I want you public workers to pay half of what our private sector counterparts’ and he's getting riots -- it's like Cairo has moved to Madison these days.""

Now that warrants a news flash: Riots?

That conjures images of tear gas, broken windows, cracked heads. Is that really happening?

We started with law enforcement.

There are numerous agencies handling the protests including the Dane County Sheriff’s Department, Madison police, state Department of Natural Resources and Capitol Police. A handful of arrests have been reported.

""For the most part, people have been very respectful and very orderly,"" said Elise Schaffer, public information officer for the Dane County Sheriff’s Department. ""It certainly has been a very peaceful protest.""

Madison police estimated the Feb. 18, 2011 crowds outside the Capitol at 30,000, while Capitol Police said there were 5,000 inside the building, according to the state Department of Administration.

To be sure, emotions are strong and the stakes high.

But that does not sound like much of a riot.

We also talked to Paul Soglin, the former Madison mayor who led -- and was beaten -- during antiwar protests in the 1960s and ‘70s. Soglin, who has been part of countless other marches and protests, said he was amazed at the crowds.

Soglin used terms like ""joy and enthusiasm"" to describe the energy of the crowds and compared them to the civil rights protests in the 1960.

Asked about Ryan’s characterization of the events as riots, Soglin said: ""It’s astounding that he would say that. It’s so spectacularly wrong.""

Soglin pointed to the May 1970 antiwar protests when the National Guard was called out, the first Mifflin Street Block Party in 1969, and the 1967 UW protest against Dow Chemical recruiting on campus. Those events involved the use of tear gas, beatings of students and protesters and property destruction.

""Those were out of control riots,"" Soglin said.

Neil Shively, former Madison bureau chief for the Milwaukee Sentinel, covered state government in the early 1970s. He recalled National Guard soldiers with fixed bayonets at Capitol Square.

""We had to go through that line every day"" to get to work at the Capitol, Shively said.

Shively said he had not been to the Capitol this week but had attended a couple of gatherings of retired politicos and journalists in the last couple of days. The protests were Topic A.

""Everything I’ve heard is that it’s been very peaceful and orderly,"" he said.

Dick Wheeler, who runs the Wheeler Report news service in the Capitol, recalled covering race and antiwar riots in the 1960s and ‘70s in Ohio for United Press International and the Scripps Howard news service.

""A riot has anger and violence, and neither of these has sprung up here,"" Wheeler said from the Capitol press room, with considerable crowd noise in the background. ""It is not a riot.""

""Folks are being absolutely as civil as possible -- given the circumstances,"" he said.

Wheeler and Soglin heaped praise on law enforcement for their professionalism, and said there was no significant tension between the crowds and cops.

Puzzled, we called Ryan’s office and asked what he was referring to in his comments about riots and his comparison of a week of Madison protests with 18 days that led to the resignation of the president of Egypt.

Ryan’s response: ""It was an inaccurate comparison.""
 
To put it mildly.

Our response: Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979CF240>],/factchecks/2011/feb/18/paul-ryan/us-rep-paul-ryan-compares-madison-cairo-calls-prot/
"['Labor', 'Pundits', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Rachel Maddow']","
Rachel Maddow says Wisconsin is on track to have a budget surplus this year
","It has taken hold with conviction: the idea that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker ginned up a phony budget crisis to justify his bold bid to strip state employees of most bargaining rights and cut their benefits.

A volley of e-mails, blog posts and inquiries to reporters followed a  Madison Capital Times editorial on Feb. 16, 2011, that said no state budget deficit exists for 2010-’11 -- or if it does, it’s the fault of Walker and the Republicans in the Legislature.

Liberal MSNBC talk show host Rachel Maddow joined in Feb. 17, accusing Walker of manipulating the situation for political gain.

""Despite what you may have heard about Wisconsin’s finances, Wisconsin is on track to have a budget surplus this year,"" she said. ""I am not kidding.""

She added a kicker that is also making the rounds: Walker and fellow Republicans in the Legislature this year gave away $140 million in business tax breaks -- so if there is a deficit projected of $137 million, they created it.

Maddow and others making the claim all cite the same source for their information --  a Jan. 31, 2011 memo prepared by Robert Lang, the director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

It includes this line: ""Our analysis indicates a general fund gross balance of $121.4 million and a net balance of $56.4 million.""

We were curious about claims of a surplus based on the fiscal bureau memo.

In writing it when it was released, reporters from the Journal Sentinel and Associated Press had put the shortfall at between $78 million and  $340 million. That’s the projection for the end of the fiscal year, June 30, 2011.

Walker himself has settled on $137 million as the deficit figure, a number reporters have adopted as shorthand.

We re-read the fiscal bureau memo, talked to Lang, consulted reporter Jason Stein of the Journal Sentinel’s Madison Bureau, read various news accounts and examined the issue in detail.

Our conclusion: Maddow and the others are wrong.

There is, indeed, a projected deficit that required attention, and Walker and GOP lawmakers did not create it.

More on that second point in a bit.

The confusion, it appears, stems from a section in Lang’s memo that -- read on its own -- does project a $121 million surplus in the state’s general fund as of June 30, 2011.

But the remainder of the routine memo -- consider it the fine print -- outlines $258 million in unpaid bills or expected shortfalls in programs such as Medicaid services for the needy ($174 million alone), the public defender’s office and corrections. Additionally, the state owes Minnesota $58.7 million under a discontinued tax reciprocity deal.

The result, by our math and Lang’s, is the $137 million shortfall.

It would be closer to the $340 million figure if the figure included the $200 million owed to the state’s patient compensation fund, a debt courts have declared resulted from an illegal raid on the fund under former Gov. Jim Doyle.

A court ruling is pending in that matter, so the money might not have to be transferred until next budget year.

To be sure, the projected shortfall is a modest one by the standards of the last decade, which saw a $600 million repair bill one year as the economy and national tax collections slumped.

But ignoring it would have meant turning away eligible Medicaid clients, which was not an option, Lang said.

This same situation has happened in the past, including during the tenure of Doyle, a Democrat. In January 2005, a fiscal bureau memo showed a similar surplus, but lawmakers approved a major fix of a Medicaid shortfall that would have eaten up that projected surplus.

Reporters who cover the Capitol are used to doing the math to come up with the bottom-line surplus or deficit, but average readers are not. (The Journal Sentinel’s Stein addressed these and other budget questions in a follow-up story.)

So why does Lang write his biennial memo in a way that invites confusion?

Lang, a veteran and respected civil servant working in a nonpartisan job, told us he does not want to presume what legislative or other action will be taken to address the potential shortfalls he lists.

Admittedly, the approach this time created the opportunity for a snappy -- and powerful -- political attack.

But it is an inaccurate one.

Meanwhile, what about Maddow’s claim -- also repeated across the liberal blogosphere -- that Walker’s tax-cut bills approved in January are responsible for the $137 million deficit?

Lang’s fiscal bureau report and news accounts addressed that issue as well.

The tax cuts will cost the state a projected $140 million in tax revenue -- but not until the next two-year budget, from July 2011 to June 2013. The cuts are not even in effect yet, so they cannot be part of the current problem.

Here’s the bottom line:

There is fierce debate over the approach Walker took to address the short-term budget deficit. But there should be no debate on whether or not there is a shortfall. While not historically large, the shortfall in the current budget needed to be addressed in some fashion. Walker’s tax cuts will boost the size of the projected deficit in the next budget, but they’re not part of this problem and did not create it.

We rate Maddow’s take False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097801D00>],/factchecks/2011/feb/18/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-wisconsin-track-have-budget-sur/

Mike Haridopolos breaks silence on high-speed rail, then switches position
","
When Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced on Feb. 16, 2011, that he would reject $2.4 billion in federal funds for a bullet train from Orlando to Tampa, many Republican and Democratic legislators immediately criticized him for acting too hastily. Some conservatives praised the governor for sticking to his anti-spending principles, and a handful of Republicans offered tepid statements that resembled support for Scott. Kind of, anyway.

Then there was Republican Senate President Mike Haridopolos, a candidate for U.S. Senate in 2012.

Haridopolos said -- nothing.

Crickets.

For two days, nothing.

Finally, on Feb. 18, Haridopolos issued a written statement.

He was siding with Scott.

""From the beginning, I have made it clear that Florida will cut $3.62 billion in spending this year and balance its state budget without raising taxes. We will not finance our future. We have also said that under no circumstances would we use state dollars, needed to support priorities like education, to pay for high-speed rail. For Floridians, that would be unforgivable.

""Florida is leading by example in keeping its fiscal house in order. We must demand the same from Washington. To President Obama and all members of Congress, I say we are far better off reducing the $1.5 trillion in proposed deficit spending by this $2.4 billion than we are to build a rail project that has a questionable, at-best, economic viability.""

Haridopolos' position -- against the high-speed rail project -- seemed at odds with his previous words and votes, PolitiFact Florida readers told us. So we decided to run Haridopolos' statements and position on the high-speed rail project through our Flip-O-Meter.

The story for us starts in 2009, when the Legislature met in special session to consider a rail package that supporters claimed was critical to Florida winning billions of dollars in federal funds for high-speed rail.

The bill that was considered, passed and signed into law by Gov. Charlie Crist included major rail components, beyond just the Tampa to Orlando line. The law created two state entities to oversee passenger rail systems across Florida. The law shifted $60 million a year to finance rail projects starting in 2014, and increased the state subsidy to the Tri-Rail commuter line in South Florida by up to $15 million from the current $27 million. It created the framework for Florida to pledge $280 million in state money to receive federal funds for the Tampa/Orlando line. And it allowed the state to purchase 61.5 miles of CSX railroad track for $432 million to construct a SunRail commuter system in the Orlando area.

During the week of debate, it was the SunRail component of the legislation that was most controversial.

Opponents argued SunRail was too costly, too good of a deal for CSX and not ultimately necessary to win the billions of dollars in federal aid. Another concern: liability provisions that would leave taxpayers on the hook for accidents caused by CSX, which would share the track.

We checked long and hard to see what Haridopolos had to say about the legislation, and found virtually nothing. We checked with veteran reporters in the Tallahassee press corps who remembered Haridopolos for being largely silent.

We found this bland tweet from Haridopolos, @MikeHaridopolos, during the debate on Dec. 3, 2009: ""Interesting debate on rail issue here in Florida Senate today.""

And we found an editorial on Dec. 8 from the Orlando Sentinel asking ""where's the leadership from Mike Haridopolos,"" who at the time was in line to become Senate president.

But when it came down to the vote, a silent Haridopolos voted yes on the rail package.

The 2010-11 state budget included $131 million to develop the Tampa/Orlando rail line. And again, Haridopolos voted yes.

Haridopolos started talking more critically about rail in October 2010. He suggested that Democratic candidate for governor Alex Sink had proposed $12.5 billion in new state spending, including $9 billion for supporting a high-speed rail project from Orlando to Miami. The Orlando/Miami line was to come after the Orlando/Tampa line was completed. (We ruled the claim about Sink's spending plans False.)

But then in November, a Haridopolos spokesman told the Sentinel that Haridopolos still supported the Tampa/Orlando high-speed train. Bush said Haridopolos planned to meet with then Gov.-elect Scott to ""get his thoughts on high-speed rail for this state.""

The yo-yoing continued in January, when Haridopolos said he supported the Tampa/Orlando line, as long as the state didn't have to pay for it, and that private companies picked up the state's $280 million required share.

""I think rail, or in this case, high-speed rail, is something that people would like to have,"" Haridopolos said. ""I would make the argument … it's something that we cannot afford at this point using state dollars. If the private sector chooses to make up that last 10 percent, great.""

The private sector, however, will never get that chance, it appears, as Scott on Feb. 16 signaled the death of the project before bids were issued to build the 84-mile line.

And then to cap it off, Haridopolos agreed with him.

Haridopolos' position is a bit of a head-scratcher. He was silent and voted for the bills, and stayed silent for almost a year. Then, all of the sudden, he was worried about the cost to taxpayers (after agreeing to spend money in the state budget). Then he wanted to try to get the private sector to pick up the state's tab, but before they could try, Haridopolos agreed with Scott's decision to effectively short-circuit the process.

We think there's enough inconsistency there to rate Haridopolos' position on high-speed rail a Full Flop.

"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Club for Growth']","
Group says Wisconsin state workers “haven’t had to sacrifice”
","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s proposal to impose cuts on public workers without bargaining has become the latest flash point in a longstanding debate over the compensation for public employees.

In lobbying for Walker’s proposal, the conservative advocacy group Wisconsin Club for Growth has launched a TV and radio campaign that argues state employees have been exempt from cutbacks even in the recession.

The group’s TV ad uses a backdrop of newspaper headlines about job-saving union concessions at private firms -- Harley-Davidson, Mercury Marine and Sub-Zero Appliance. The ad notes Wisconsinites ""all across"" the state have accepted wage freezes, pay cuts and are paying more for health care.

Then, over an ominous piano soundtrack, the narrator adds:

""But state workers haven’t had to sacrifice. They pay next to nothing for their pensions, and a fraction of their health care. It’s not fair. Call your state legislator and tell them to vote for Gov. Walker’s budget repair bill. It’s time state employees paid their fair share, just like the rest of us.""

That’s a broad -- and powerful -- claim, that there has been no sacrifice from state workers.

But is it true?

Officials with the Club for Growth -- Deb Jordahl and R.J. Johnson -- told us the ad meant to highlight just two issues regarding state employee compensation: pension and health care payments.

So we’ll start there. 
We covered some of this ground in a Feb. 8, 2011 item that evaluated a statement by Walker that ""most state employees could pay twice as much toward their health care premiums and it would still be half the national average."" We rated it True. 
The item found that unionized state workers pay about 4 percent to 5 percent of their health insurance premiums. In contrast, a Kaiser Family Foundation study put the employee share paid by state and local government workers nationwide at 25 percent for family coverage. 
Meanwhile, on pensions, most public workers in Wisconsin contribute nothing or very little to their pensions.

Walker's plan would require most public workers to pay half their pension costs -- typically 5.8 percent of pay for state workers -- and at least 12 percent of their health care costs.

That does not apply to police, firefighters and state troopers. Under the budget repair bill, public-safety unions would be exempt from the changes. They would continue to bargain for benefits under current laws while other unions would lose the right to bargain on benefits and working conditions.

So the ad is on target in pointing out that the situation for state workers -- even after the Great Recession -- compares favorably to the private sector.

But the pension and health care points are framed around the assertion state workers have not sacrificed at all.

That’s a bigger question, and calls for a look backwards -- not just forward.

On health care and pensions, state employees have been asked to give more -- though in modest amounts compared to the private sector. 
The portion of health premiums paid by employees more than doubled under then-Gov. Jim Doyle, from 2.5 percent to 5.6 percent in 2011. 
We looked at that when we evaluated a statement from Doyle, who said he ""had to impose tougher cost controls on state employees"" than any previous Wisconsin governor. We rated that statement Mostly True. 
On pensions, the vast majority of state employees paid nothing toward their pensions until January 2011, when they were required to contribute 0.2 percent -- two-tenths of 1 percent -- of their pay.

But the most notable change for state workers has come on pay.

The Club for Growth ad dramatically highlights ""frozen wages"" and ""pay cuts"" accepted by unions at the private companies -- and then says ""state workers haven’t had to sacrifice."" 
In fact, state workers have taken a hit on wages -- in the form of furlough days. 
To deal with his own state budget problems, Doyle required employees to take eight unpaid furlough days in both the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 budget years, saving an estimated $208 million over the two-year period. That's a 3.1 percent reduction in wages annually. 
The average pay per full-time equivalent state worker was $54,900, according to the latest census report on government payrolls. 
Doyle said he used the furlough days to avoid widespread layoffs -- the same argument Walker is using for his plan.

Indeed, fewer than 150 state workers (not including the University of Wisconsin System) were laid off from 2007 through 2010, state figures show. That’s 0.4percent. That compares to the state losing more than 155,000 jobs overall since the recession began -- about 5.6 percent.

Doyle also rescinded 2 percent raises for non-union employees in the 2007-2009 state budget. Under Doyle, raises averaged 1.21 percent per year. We found that was less than under the previous four elected governors dating back to 1971.

Doyle also suspended merit awards in November 2008.

In the previous two years, the state had given out 2,600 of those awards, totaling $11.4 million, according to the state Department of Administration.

So state workers have in fact given up some pay, which is the definition of sacrifice.

The Club for Growth officials note that the furloughs did not affect base pay going forward, and that Walker has said he will not continue furloughs in exchange for the pension and health care benefits cuts.

""Plus they get to keep their jobs,"" Jordahl said of Walker’s plan.

But, again, the ad argues for changes in the future. Its assertion is there was no sacrifice in the past.

What’s the bottom line?

The Club for Growth, lobbying for Walker’s plan to trim state employee compensation, claims state workers ""have not had to sacrifice"" while the private sector has reeled from jobs losses, pay cuts and increased responsibility for pension and health care benefits.

Their claim as it relates to health and pension benefits -- the focus of Walker’s proposal -- is pretty much on target. But pay is also part of the equation -- a big part -- and on that score state workers took 3 percent pay cuts in the form of furloughs, among other wage-related cutbacks.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the definition of Barely True is a statement that ""contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""

That fits. And that is our rating of the ad’s ""no sacrifice"" claim.",[<zip object at 0x000002809718AE00>],/factchecks/2011/feb/18/club-growth/group-says-wisconsin-state-workers-havent-had-sacr/

Michele Bachmann says the government will buy you a breast pump for your baby.
","
The Democrats are at it again, said Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn.: Trying to get the government to solve all our problems.

""I’ve given birth to five babies, and I’ve breast-fed every single one of these babies,"" Bachmann said on The Laura Ingraham Show. ""To think that government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies? You want to talk about the nanny state? I think you just got a new definition of the nanny state.""

We decided to fact-check Bachmann’s catchy sound bite after seeing it repeated in the media this week.

Bachmann’s comments were prompted by a decision from the Internal Revenue Service to change the way it classifies breast pumps and related supplies. Previously, the IRS said breast pumps were not medical expenses because they were related to nutrition. And nutrition -- i.e., food -- is not a medical expense.

On Feb. 10, the IRS announced it had reconsidered, and that it had decided breast pumps are in fact used for medical care. Like obstetric care, breast pumps ""are for the purpose of affecting a structure or function of the body of the lactating woman,"" the IRS said in its ruling.

So does this mean free breast pumps for mom? Hardly.

Formally, it means that breast pumps can be treated like other medical expenses that are tax deductible. Keep in mind, the hurdle for directly deducting medical expenses is quite high: The out-of-pocket expenses have to exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted income before you can begin deducting them.

More commonly, it means people can now buy breast pumps using money from flexible health spending accounts.

Many employers offer these accounts, which allow workers to save part of their paychecks tax-fee to a personal account that can be used only for health care costs. Because the money isn’t taxed, people are able to set aside more for health expenses than they would otherwise.

The accounts have restrictions, though. There’s a limit to how much can go to the accounts, currently $2,500. People have to save all their receipts and submit them to an administrator in most cases. And if there’s money in the account at the end of the year, the employer gets to keep it. Because of the use-it-or-lose-it provision, people tend to use these accounts for predictable health expenses, not emergencies.

In addition to the IRS announcement, breastfeeding has been in the news because First Lady Michelle Obama said recently that she hoped to promote breast-feeding through her ""Let’s Move"" campaign to prevent childhood obesity. Obama said that studies have linked breast-feeding to lower obesity rates.

Radio host Laura Ingraham, who asked Bachmann about breast pumps, questioned Obama’s motivation for the ""Let’s Move"" campaign, and speculated that the First Lady might intend to run for office later.

Bachmann, though, said she doubted that Obama was motivated by self-interest. ""I think honestly she is really committed to the far left agenda, more than anything else,"" Bachmann said.

We should note that Ingraham was accurate in explaining that breast pumps were being newly classified as a medical expense, and hence tax deductible. Bachmann, though, described the decision incorrectly when she said, ""To think that government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies? You want to talk about the nanny state? I think you just got a new definition of the nanny state."" Those remarks have been widely reported.

It’s a catchy sound bite, but like a lot of sound bites, it’s not so accurate. The government will not buy you a breast pump. Rather, it will now allow you to treat money you spend on the pumps as a deductible medical expense.

Bachmann's statement suggests a large government program to purchase and provide the devices when in fact the government is actually treating them as tax-deductible, like countless other things.  We rate her statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979D27C0>],/factchecks/2011/feb/18/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-government-will-buy-you-brea/

UPDATED: State Sen. Dan Patrick says 80,000 abortions are performed in Texas every year
","
UPDATE, 11 a.m., July 11, 2013: More than two years after this fact check was completed, we rated as Mostly False a claim that more than 80,000 abortions annually occur in Texas. This rating traced to state-collected data indicating 72,470 abortions occurred in Texas in 2011, down from some 77,000 abortions reported for 2010. See that full article here. We did not change this Truth-O-Meter story, which reflects abortion counts and other information available at the time Dan Patrick made his claim. 
Answering colleagues’ questions about his proposal to require women seeking an abortion to first get a sonogram, state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, said: ""We have 80,000 abortions in Texas every year."" 
Last month, we rated True Gov. Rick Perry’s statement at a Texas Rally for Life that there have been 50 million abortions nationally since the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that states cannot prohibit abortions before the point at which a fetus can survive outside a woman’s body. We decided to check Patrick’s statement, too. 
Donna Bahorich, a Patrick spokeswoman, pointed us to a web page about abortions in Texas on the Texas Department of State Health Services website. 
The Texas Abortion Facility Reporting and Licensing Act requires every abortion facility in the state to submit an annual report to the department on each pregnancy terminated at the facility, according to the page, which was updated in July. In 2007, 81,079 induced abortions were reported to the agency. 
Carrie Williams, a DSHS spokeswoman, pointed us to more recent data that showed a slight uptick in abortions in Texas in 2008: 81,591. According to the department, 78,330 of those abortions were performed on Texas residents, and 2,974 were performed on residents from out of state or another country. 
Next, we turned to the respected Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health. According to a 2011 fact sheet prepared and posted online by the institute, 579,700 of 5.1 million women of reproductive age in Texas became pregnant in 2008. Seventy percent of those pregnancies resulted in live births, the sheet says, and 15 percent in induced abortions. 
That year, the sheet says, 84,610 women obtained abortions in Texas — a rate of 16.5 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age. The sheet cautions: ""Some of these women were from other states, and some Texas residents had abortions in other states, so this rate may not reflect the abortion rate of state residents."" The sheet also says the 2008 Texas abortion rate was down 4 percent from the 2005 rate.  
In 2008, according to the institute, abortions in Texas represent 7 percent of  all abortions in the United States — 1.2 million American women obtained abortions that year. 
Finally, we wondered whether 80,000 abortions are performed in Texas every year, as Patrick says — not just the most recent year. 
According to a January Guttmacher report on abortion trends in Texas from 1973-2008, abortions increased from a low of less than 20,000 in 1973 to a peak of more than 100,000 in 1981. The report shows a downward trend since then. 
According to the Department of State Health Services, 82,056 induced abortions were reported in 2006, 77,374 in 2005, 75,053 in 2004, 79,166 in 2003, 79,929 in 2002 and 77,537 in 2001.

Georgia pols use report to push for immigration reform
","
Some strident critics of Georgia’s immigration policy have turned to what they hope will be the prevailing argument that sways state lawmakers to pass tougher policies this year.

The almighty dollar.

Georgia spends too much money, they say, on the estimated 425,000 illegal immigrants living in this state.

And how much money does Georgia spend? One figure being passed around by supporters of two bills in the Legislature to tighten immigration guidelines is $2.4 billion. A Georgia tea party leader used the number at a recent state budget hearing. So has a U.S. congressman from Georgia.

""We have the seventh-highest population, and it’s estimated that illegal immigration costs our state $2.4 billion annually,"" U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, a Republican from Savannah, said in one news release.

Kingston’s office said the cost estimate came from a report by the Washington-based Federation for American Immigration Reform. The 102-page report says it costs the state of Georgia and local officials $2.399 billion a year to assist illegal immigrants. That’s a substantial amount of money -- the entire state budget is about $18 billion.

Few organizations dig into the annual cost of illegal immigration and offer estimates because it is such a slippery subject. But FAIR has consistently offered such estimates and has come under criticism for doing so. FAIR’s estimates are frequently used in the immigration debate, particularly those who support a crackdown.

Founded in 1979, FAIR claims about 250,000 members and supporters. Its mission statement is to educate Americans on the impact of ""sustained, high-volume immigration.""

FAIR estimates how much it costs local and state officials to educate, provide health care and offer other services to Georgia’s illegal immigrants.

The estimate of 425,000 illegal immigrants in Georgia comes from the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan organization that conducts demographic research on Latinos. The Department of Homeland Security reports similar numbers, but even this estimate is a calculated guess.

FAIR contends the biggest cost of illegal immigration -- more than 50 percent -- is education. The organization uses the average cost the state spends per pupil to educate children, which comes from the U.S. Department of Education. The most recent estimate we found is $10,597. FAIR’s per-pupil estimate is close, $10,907. FAIR believes there are 133,262 illegal immigrants in Georgia’s school system.

But some experts on illegal immigration say there’s a major flaw in FAIR’s numbers. The organization includes U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. The U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship to any child born in this country. Still, FAIR believes it is appropriate to include these U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants.

""Our reasoning is that they would not be in the U.S. and a burden on the Georgia taxpayer if it were not for the illegal presence of their parents,"" said Jack Martin, who helped put the FAIR report together.

Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, thinks using the average per-pupil cost also presents problems. Costs, he says, may vary by student.

The second greatest cost, FAIR says, is medical care. The organization argues that because illegal immigrants aren’t eligible for taxpayer-funded health programs, they often rely on emergency care. For childbirth, that’s $10,000 per delivery. FAIR estimates that Georgia spends $317.6 million a year on medical care for illegal immigrants.

The FAIR report also examines the potential economic contributions of illegal immigrants. FAIR contends illegal immigrants often work jobs that aren’t taxed. Georgia collects about $142 million a year in taxes from illegal immigrants, FAIR estimates.

A Congressional Budget Office report reviewed 29 studies on the matter in 2007 and found tax revenue typically does not offset the costs to states and local government for illegal immigrants. In Colorado, for example, a 2006 study found that state received between 73 and 86 cents for every dollar it spent on education, Medicaid and prison time for illegal immigrants.

The Internal Revenue Service estimates 6 million illegal immigrants -- about half the nation’s estimated illegal immigrant population -- paid some federal, state and local income taxes. The Social Security Administration estimates that half of illegal immigrants pay Social Security taxes.

FAIR’s reports have become a bible of sorts for many frustrated with illegal immigration. Last year, Nathan Deal used a prior FAIR report to back up his claim during his successful candidacy for governor that ""illegal aliens are costing Georgia taxpayers over a billion dollars every year."" PolitiFact Georgia reviewed that claim in July and ruled it Half True.

So where does all this information leave us? There’s strong evidence from several sources that illegal immigrants cost each state, including Georgia, massive sums of money. Studies show illegal immigrants use more money in state and local resources than they contribute. But the actual percentage is inconclusive.

Georgians who want tougher policies to deter illegal immigration should be careful using FAIR’s estimate. It is not a precise number and includes the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants.  

FAIR appears to be correct in its larger point that illegal immigration costs states such as Georgia large sums of money. But FAIR’s $2.4 billion estimate leaves out important details and in some cases takes things out of context.

That meets our definition of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096728080>],/factchecks/2011/feb/18/federation-american-immigration-reform/georgia-pols-use-report-push-immigration-reform/

Rep. Dennis Kucinich says defense spending consumes more than half the discretionary budget
","
President Obama submitted his 2012 budget proposal to Congress on Valentine's Day, but the debate on efforts to cut spending started weeks earlier. Rep. Dennis Kucinich opened it with a call to question the cost of wars.

""We can have a strong defense, but we are spending so much money that we are undermining our ability to be able to provide for the American people here at home,"" he said.

""One of the biggest causes of our soaring debt and economic insecurity ends up being Pentagon spending. The budget for the Pentagon consumes more than half of our discretionary spending.""

PolitiFact Ohio wondered about that and took a closer look.

We turned to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and to the National Priorities Project, a nonpartisan, liberal-leaning think tank that analyzes data to show how tax dollars are spent.

The federal budget has two types of spending, discretionary and mandatory.

Mandatory spending, also called direct spending, refers to outlays required by law. It includes such entitlement programs as Social Security and Medicare, veterans' benefits, food stamps, education and health programs.

Mandatory spending is about two-thirds of the total budget. The problem of dealing with the politically charged entitlements is why balancing the budget is so difficult.

Discretionary spending is the part of the budget governed by the annual appropriation process and debated by Congress. That category includes ""defense"" (which does not include all military-related spending), security, agricultural subsidies, education, health programs, highway construction and housing assistance.

Discretionary defense outlays in fiscal 2010, which ended in October, were $689 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Non-defense outlays were $677 billion, or less than half the total.

For fiscal 2011, the CBO projects an even larger percentage of the discretionary budget -- 58 percent -- is military.

Discretionary spending on the military has been trending up for more than a decade. From 2001 to 2010, it increased by 71 percent -- almost three times the rate of increase in domestic discretionary spending, which rose about 24 percent.

Nonsecurity-related discretionary spending accounts for only about 15 percent of the $3.5 trillion total budget.

We leave the question of whether that’s good policy for others to debate. But as to Kucinich’s statement, we rate his claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C505B40>],/factchecks/2011/feb/18/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-defense-spending-consumes/
"['Deficit', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Alberta Darling']","
Despite news of $1.8 billion shortfall, Alberta Darling says Wisconsin has $443 million surplus
","On Sept. 8, 2014, a Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau report made headlines that said the state budget faces a ""shortfall"" estimated at nearly $1.8 billion. The same day, state Sen. Alberta Darling, a suburban Milwaukee Republican, put out what seemed like a contradictory statement. ""Wisconsin does not have a deficit,"" Darling said in a news release, which was issued with GOP Rep. John Nygren of Marinette. ""Thanks to Republican reforms, the 2014 budget will begin with a $443 million surplus."" Darling and Nygren are co-chairs of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, which plays a key role in formulating the budget that was signed into law by Gov. Scott Walker. So, Wisconsin taxpayers (and voters in the upcoming election for governor) would like to know:  Does state government have a deficit, a surplus, or what? Budget basics Wisconsin’s budget, of course, is a two-year document. So, there isn’t a ""2014 budget,"" as Darling said. But we are more than two months into the fiscal year that runs from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015. This is the second half of the 2013-’15 budget. These points in time are important because, by law, the two-year state budget must be balanced. It can't run an actual deficit. What drew the headlines was the fiscal bureau’s projection that the state’s ""out-year commitment"" -- often referred to as a shortfall or a ""structural"" deficit -- is $1.8 billion for the next budget period, 2015-’17. That's an estimate of how much the next biennial budget -- if there are no changes in revenue or spending -- would be out of balance. In other words, the shortfall isn't actual red ink. Now to Darling's claim. A surplus? Darling's office pointed us to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo issued five days before the $1.8 billion memo. The bureau is a nonpartisan agency that both political parties regard as the gold standard on budget matters. That earlier memo says 2014-’15, the second year of the current two-year budget, started on July 1, 2014 with a balance of $443 million. So, it’s true that at this moment in time -- the midpoint of the two-year budget -- the books are in the black. But the same memo also projects the budget picture for the second year of the cycle. That is, it shows what money is expected to come in, and how much is expected to go out. It shows the entire $443 million surplus being swallowed up and the state facing a ""revenue shortfall"" of nearly $116 million -- since revised to $396 million -- by the end of the fiscal year -- June 30, 2015. That's because tax collections have been lower than expected. As we mentioned, the state cannot run an actual deficit. Accordingly, the fiscal bureau said the state might need a budget repair bill by June 30, 2015 unless revenue comes in higher than currently expected and/or spending is reduced. It’s also possible, depending on how large the revenue shortfall turns out to be, that the Walker administration could reduce spending -- by not filling open positions, for example -- enough to eliminate the need for a budget-repair bill. So, as of now, the state budget has a $443 million surplus, but that is expected to become a $396 million shortfall by next June. Now to the $1.8 billion ""out-year commitment"" or shortfall estimate for 2015-’17, which is what prompted Darling to make her claim. The $1.8 billion There are two key things to know about the new number from the fiscal bureau: 1. The projected $1.8 billion shortfall -- -- about 5.8% of the spending expected in the 2015-'17 state budget -- is an educated guess about future tax collections and demands for services. Shortfalls occur in large part because of changes in how much money comes in through income and sales tax collections, which are dependent on the economy, among other factors. 2. Again, the projection is not for the current budget cycle, but rather for the 2015-’17 biennium. A budget for 2015-’17 is what the winner of the Nov. 4, 2014 gubernatorial election between Walker and Democrat Mary Burke will have to devise. Rather, the shortfall is an imbalance between ongoing revenues and spending. It assumes no changes in revenue and no changes in spending -- in other words, continuing the operations of state government as they are now. The state has been here before. When Walker took office in January 2011, he faced a $2.5 billion ""out-year commitment"" or shortfall, plus an increase of roughly $1.1 billion in funding requests from state agencies. That amounted to a $3.6 billion ""deficit,"" which Walker addressed through funding cuts and the Act 10 collective bargaining law. Here’s the current situation in a nutshell:   Budget period Dates Budget condition 2013-’15 cycle -- Year 1 July 1, 2013-June 30, 2014 Ended with $443 million surplus 2013-’15 cycle -- Year 2 July 1, 2014-June 30, 2015 Projected to end with $116 million (later revised to $396 million) shortfall 2015-’17 cycle July 1, 2015-June 30, 2017 Projected to start with $1.8 billion shortfall Darling said: ""Wisconsin does not have a deficit. Thanks to Republican reforms, the 2014 budget will begin with a $443 million surplus."" The second year of the current 2013-’15 budget -- what Darling refers to as the 2014 budget -- did begin with a $443 million surplus. But the year is expected to end with a $396 million shortfall, and the next biennium -- 2015-’17 -- is projected to start with a $1.8 billion shortfall. Darling’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out a lot of context. Our rating is Half True.

"['Regulation', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Homeowners are paying more for less insurance coverage under Scott, Crist says
","It didn’t take long for Charlie Crist to fire a major volley in the battle for the governor’s mansion, taking aim at incumbent Rick Scott’s record on homeowner’s insurance. Soon after the August primary, Crist outlined a plan to ""reverse Ricks Scott’s hikes to property insurance."" The Sept. 4 document compared the new Democrat’s record on the issue to Scott’s, saying the cost-to-benefit ratio has been going in the wrong direction. ""During Scott’s tenure, premiums rose while the amount of coverage declined,"" Crist’s plan read. ""In other words, under Rick Scott, homeowners are paying higher premiums for less coverage."" The insurance market has been on a rollercoaster ride the past decade, with consumers reeling from the highest costs for homeowner’s insurance in the nation. Are homeowners paying more for less coverage under the current Republican governor? It’s PolitiFact Florida’s policy to check the paper trail very carefully. A familiar pledge Crist is no stranger to making insurance rates a campaign issue. When he campaigned as a Republican in 2006, he pledged to bring rates down after eight hurricanes hit the state in 2004 and 2005, catapulting premiums ever higher. He followed through on a promise to call a special session of the Legislature in January 2007. The result was HB 1A, which expanded state-sponsored reinsurance (essentially insurance for insurers) for private carriers and froze rates for Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-run insurer of last resort. Because private insurers began charging such high premiums, Citizens had taken on some 400,000 more policies between 2004 and 2007, for a total of 1.2 million properties covered as private insurers looked to reduce their exposure in Florida. Industry experts warned that a major side effect of expanding Citizens was that the company would not be able to pay claims in the event of a direct hit by a hurricane, resulting in a statewide assessment on all policies. The rate freeze eventually stretched on until 2009, when Crist signed HB 1495, which passed the Legislature with strong support. That law allowed rate increases of up to 10 percent to help Citizens become actuarially sound. Florida’s insurance rates began another upward climb under Crist, despite no direct hits from hurricanes since 2005. Scott came into office in 2011 looking to reduce the high number of Citizens policies by turning to the private insurance market. His first year, he signed SB 408, which insurance companies and business groups praised. This is the bill Crist blames for rising premiums and reduced coverage; Crist vetoed a similar bill near the end of his term. Critics warned the legislation was bad for consumers because it allowed a reduction in overall coverage limits, shortened the window for filing sinkhole and storm-related damage claims, and limited claims for damage caused by sinkholes to primary structures, among other things. SB 408 also made carriers file requests with the regulation office for rate increases up to 15 percent to account for higher reinsurance costs. The law also allowed insurers to pay back some claims at actual cash value -- the cost of the insured dwelling minus depreciation -- instead of replacement value, depending on the policy. By the following year, Citizens began limiting coverage on most policies to the primary structure, leaving out things like gazebos, awnings, carports and pool enclosures. That was something private insurers had been doing since Hurricane Wilma in 2005. We took a look at average premiums for all private homeowners insurance policies over the last eight years. (Crist’s plan referred to all these years except 2014’s first quarter totals, as well, which the state’s Office of Insurance Regulation said were accurate). Total exposure is the amount both private companies and Citizens were liable to cover, while total premiums paid is the amount all policies collected in premiums. The state maintained a steady run of roughly 6 million total policies during this time period: Year/governor Average premium Total exposure Total premiums paid 2007/Crist $1,679 $1.82 trillion $9.6 billion 2008/Crist $1,463 $1.9 trillion $8.6 billion 2009/Crist $1,421 $1.9 trillion $8.3 billion 2010/Crist $1,518 $1.88 trillion $8.8 billion 2011/Scott $1,608 $1.88 trillion $9.3 billion 2012/Scott $1,670 $1.83 trillion $9.6 billion 2013/Scott $1,732 $1.82 trillion $10 billion 2014/Scott* $1,741 $1.68 trillion $9.5 billion * as of March 2014, excludes State Farm The chart shows that premiums dropped the first year after Crist took office, even while more coverage was in force. Premiums went up and exposure went down in 2010, Crist’s final year in office, but the trend really took off after Scott took office. Premiums continued to rise while exposure fell by some $200 billion. Scott’s aim was to shrink Citizens, and that’s what happened (his campaign promise to make Citizens ""actuarially sound"" is on our Scott-O-Meter). The state insurer slimmed down by more than 400,000 policies, largely by ""taking out"" customers, in which private insurers assumed coverage at slightly different terms. While customers were allowed to refuse the switch, the new policies often were less expensive than Citizens policies, with marginally better terms. On Sept. 4, the same day Crist released his plan to lower insurance rates if elected, the state Office of Insurance Regulation authorized 14 insurers to assume up to more than 425,000 Citizens policies, further shrinking the state’s pool of customers and reducing the company’s risk. It is the single largest authorized removal since Citizens was formed in 2002, although far fewer than that are likely to move to private insurers. There’s no question SB 408, passed under Scott, allowed rates to increase and coverage to be restricted, because that’s what it was supposed to do, according to Citizens media relations manager Michael Peltier. He told PolitiFact Florida that changes in sinkhole coverage were necessary because of a dramatic increase in claims that often were fraudulent. The problem hadn’t been addressed and was increasingly becoming an issue after those historic hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005, leading to the 2007 legislation that froze rates. ""The rates have been raised since (SB) 408 and there have been more stricter policies since (SB) 408, but those are making up for prior deficits,"" Peltier said. He said now that rates have gone up and exposure has gone down, the company is in a much better position. It’s not all rosy, however, because some customers still cannot afford the coverage they need, since sinkhole coverage is not a part of a base policy. The entire insurance industry has insisted there are many other factors forcing continued rate increases, such as reinsurance costs and payouts for other claims beyond hurricane damage. For example, State Insurance Consumer Advocate Steve Burgess said, companies have pointed to a recent spike in claims on homeowners policies over water damage. Reports have surfaced of attorneys convincing contractors they were being shortchanged by insurance companies to repair damage from leaky pipes and floods. Data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2013 ranked Florida as having the most expensive homeowners insurance in the nation. Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty said in a January 2014 report that after years of double-digit increases, a half dozen top insurers suddenly had sought or approved cutting future premiums between 2.4 and 9.2 percent. Companies that had initially wanted increases reversed themselves when their savings on reinsurance came to light.  Citizens in August also asked for a 2015 rate cut for about 70 percent of its customers.The state approved a slightly larger break than what was requested in September, and Citizens had to back off a plan to raise sinkhole rates in Hernando County. Peltier said the drop in exposure, the terms of 408 and the recent lower cost of reinsurance all helped bring about the lower premiums. The lack of hurricanes since 2005 has been a big help, as well. ""It’s taken time,"" Peltier said. ""Since (SB) 408 has had such an effect on our claims, we can’t project what our losses are going to be. We’ve had to wait."" Our ruling Charlie Crist said ""under Rick Scott, homeowners are paying higher premiums for less coverage."" He was referring to a controversial bill Scott signed in 2011, right after taking office, that made a host of changes to the insurance industry and allowed rates to go up. The insurance industry says these changes were necessary to remain solvent after dealing with a host of factors, including two very active hurricane seasons, a jump in sinkhole claims and high reinsurance costs. Those issues have since ebbed, and many policyholders should now enjoy a small break on premiums. Rates have been rising since Crist’s last year in office, in part because companies sought to catch up from limits placed on them by his 2007 legislative push after premiums rocketed out of control. That’s a bit of additional information Crist didn’t include in his attack on Scott, but his statement is still accurate. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F19D40>],/factchecks/2014/sep/10/charlie-crist/homeowners-are-paying-more-less-insurance-coverage/

Huffington: 20% of young adults use smartphones during sex
","The unveiling of the Apple Watch, a bit of wearable tech that puts a lot of iPhone features on your wrist for easy viewing, prompted an intriguing tweet from media mogul Arianna Huffington. The founder of the Huffington Post wrote, ""As it is 20% of young adults use their devices during sex. Prepare for ‘Honey, I'm checking how many calories we're burning on my #iWatch!’ "" We don’t know if wearable tech will mesh with moments when little — if anything  — is worn, but the statistical reference to smartphones and sex raised the eyebrows of one of our fans, New York Times Upshot reporter Josh Barro, who tweeted asking for a fact check. We asked Huffington for her source and she pointed us to a Huffington Post article from about a year ago. Indeed, Jumio, a firm involved with mobile credit and debit card payment systems, commissioned a distinctly non-random online survey of mobile consumer habits. Topping the press release was the finding that 9 percent of adults say they have used a smartphone during sex. For those 18 to 34, the percentage rises to 20 percent. (Huffington said use, while the study asked ""have used."") We asked Jenny Davis, the media contact for the survey, if there were any other details. In particular, we wanted to know what people were doing with their phones at times when their attention might be focused elsewhere. ""That’s the question everybody has,"" Davis said. ""The survey didn’t go further. I’ve always thought a follow-up study would be interesting. Are they playing music? Are they taking pictures?"" Or looking up recipes, who knows? The online report of the poll, we should note, included this word of caution. ""This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated."" That’s an important distinction for anyone who knows anything about polling, and means that you shouldn’t consider the results scientific or all together meaningful. Our ruling Huffington said that 20 percent of young adults use mobile devices during sex. That, for the most part, accurately reflects the findings of an unscientific online poll. While the poll itself is dubious, there is no better information available to contradict the poll of Huffington's claim. Maybe the new Apple Watch will have an app for that one day.

Facebook post claims Fox 'admits they lie,' have right to 'distort news'
","Critics of Fox News not-so-fondly call the cable channel ""Faux News."" But, according to an Internet meme, Fox not only admits it airs false news, it says it has a legal right to do so. ""Fox News admits they lie,"" reads one version of the meme, ""They argued that, under the First Amendment, broadcasters have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves."" The meme, which quotes a 2003 report in the now-defunct Chicago Media Watch, has circulated around the blogosphere, and the legal case it refers to was featured in documentary on the history of corporations. A reader asked us to look into the claim that Fox News admits to lying and says that right is protected by the First Amendment. What we found is that the claims centers around a lawsuit involving a Florida Fox-owned affiliate, not the national network or cable news channel. And that's not all that is wrong with what the meme. Spilled milk The lawsuit the meme refers to involved two married reporters -- Jane Akre and Steve Wilson -- and their former employer, WTVT Channel 13, a Fox affiliate in Tampa, Fla. In 1996, the husband-and-wife team began reporting on the use of Posilac, a synthetic growth hormone in Florida dairy cattle developed by Monsanto. After eight months of back and forth between the reporters and the station, the story never aired, and the reporters were fired in 1997. Akre and Wilson sued the station for breach of contract and retaliatory firing in 1998. Why the reporters lost their jobs is the heart of the case. According to Akre and Wilson, WTVT caved to pressure from Fox corporate and Monsanto, and fired the pair when Akre threatened to take what Akre described as the station’s deliberate news distortion to the Federal Communications Commission. According to WTVT, the reporters submitted a biased and inaccurate report and were terminated after they refused to make the necessary edits. In 2000, a Tampa jury ruled that WTVT did indeed retaliate against Akre and awarded her $425,000, the Tampa Bay Times (then the St. Petersburg Times) reported. WTVT then appealed the case. In 2003, the Florida Second District Court of Appeals reversed the ruling, arguing that Akre’s retaliation allegation did not hold water. Whistleblowing in the dark Akre’s allegation and the meme involve the intersection of three pieces of media policy: the FCC’s false news provision, the FCC’s whistleblower’s statute, and the First Amendment. According to Akre, WTVT deliberately distorted news by airing a revised version of the Posilac story. That, Akre says, is prohibited under the false news provision. When Akre threatened to notify the FCC, the station fired her and breached the whistleblower statute that prohibits retaliation against employees who disclose an employer’s ""violation of law, rule, or regulation."" The station denied repeatedly that it had tried to broadcast distorted news and said it wanted fair and balanced reports from Akre and Wilson. WTVT argued that the FCC’s news distortion policy is more a rule of thumb than a codified law, and thus not under the purview of the whistleblower statute. The appeals court agreed. Stuart Benjamin, a professor of telecommunications at Duke University, said he doesn’t see anything in the legal documents that suggests WTVT admitted to any lies or distortion. Rather, the station argued, and the court agreed, that Akre failed to meet her burden of proof, according to Benjamin. ""If a statute prohibits me from hitting you only if I act with malice, and you say that I hit you but don’t establish malice, then I have a simple winning argument in court that you failed to show malice.That doesn’t mean I agree I hit you. It just means I have a winning argument that focuses on the absence of malice,"" he said. Freedom of the press Beyond what was in writing, Akre doesn’t remember WTVT admitting to lying and defending it as a legal right. ""I don’t think they said it just like that, but they basically said we can do what we want,"" Akre told PunditFact. ""They kept saying ‘we have First Amendment rights,’ meaning they can operate with impunity and have the constitutional right to do so.""  The First Amendment, as well as the Florida Constitution, ""prohibits judicial review of Defendants’ news judgments and the exercise of editorial discretion, consistent with the guarantees of a free press,"" the station argued in its defense statement. What this means is that the court shouldn’t judge the editing choices of WTVT, the station’s lawyer Patricia Anderson told The Weekly Planet. Anderson invoked the First Amendment because it is dangerous for the courts and the FCC to become involved in disputes between members of the media and tread on either party’s freedom of press rights, according to Alison Steele, a media lawyer and Anderson's’ former law partner. (Steele currently represents the Tampa Bay Times, which operates PunditFact.) Deni Elliott, a professor of media ethics at the University of South Florida, said that by invoking the First Amendment, Fox is suggesting that they are not accountable to anyone -- ""not a reasonable stand for a news organization to take."" But to infer that WTVT used the First Amendment to defend news distortion and declare impunity is wrong. ""That wasn’t ever their position,"" Steele said. ""There was never a factual or logical nexus established between the alleged crippling of the First Amendment and the firing of these two individuals,"" said Thomas McGowan, a media lawyer who was part of WTVT’s defense team. Liane Casten, the reporter who wrote the the Chicago Media Watch article that originated the meme, said WTVT admitted to the false news allegations and defended it as a legal right during the trial, but could not recall the specifics. That position, however, is not corroborated by Akre. Steele, who worked with WTVT’s attorney, said it’s possible lawyers conceded the point as a hypothetical. But it was never central to their legal argument, nor an admission in the sense Casten or the meme suggests. ""I can certainly imagine that in oral argument. The other side says, ‘If you did do this,’ and you respond, ‘If I did, it doesn’t matter.’ That’s just part of the refining and defining what the legal argument,"" she said. ""This happens all the time, but it’s not an admission."" The ruling The Internet meme claims, ""Fox admits they lie"" and, under the First Amendment, ""have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves."" The claim doesn't track back to the national cable network most people know. Instead, it's rooted in a wrongful termination lawsuit between a Tampa Fox affiliate and two reporters. The heart of the suit was whether the Fox affiliate wrongly fired the reporters over a story about a synthetic growth hormone in Florida dairy cattle. The reporters and the station disagreed about the accuracy of the story. As part of the lawsuit, lawyers for the station argued that the courts do not have the right to play referee on story decisions -- citing the First Amendment. We found no evidence that the Fox affiliate admitted that it lied about the news it ultimately presented, and we certainly found no evidence that Fox News as a whole admits it lies (in the present tense). While the Fox affiliate argued that it has the right to present the news as it chooses, it’s quite a leap to suggest Fox as a television corporation defended some right to ""distort news reports"" -- other than in a hypothetical sense to quash a wrongful termination suit. This meme wasn’t conjured out of thin air, but it’s not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966FEC00>],/factchecks/2014/sep/10/facebook-posts/facebook-post-claims-fox-admits-they-lie-have-righ/

Scott Walker says Madison school district is only one to ignore Act 10
","Mary Burke’s position as a member of the Madison Metropolitan School District board has played a minimal role in the governor’s race so far. Gov.

In a campaign news release, Walker said Madison ""will be the only school district left in the state out of 424 to ignore the law and not take advantage of Governor Walker’s reforms into the 2015-16 school year."" Walker was playing off the fact the Madison board in 2014 signed a far-reaching contract with its teachers union despite the fact that Act 10 only allows for limited negotiations on base wages. Burke, who opposed Act 10 and who supported negotiating with school district employees, countered that the Madison district is being fiscally responsible, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. Is Madison the sole district in the state with such a contract for 2015-’16? And does that mean the district is ignoring Act 10? To back the claim, the Walker campaign pointed us to a Madison Teachers Inc. flier on contract negotiations that said only seven of the state’s public school districts ""have contracts for the current school year, and MTI is the only union to have contracts for 2014-15, and now, upon ratification, for 2015-16."" In our research, we were told by multiple officials there is no central repository for school contracts, so definitive proof of Madison’s singular status is lacking. But the Madison teachers union flier is very likely correct, based on our interviews with experts on both sides of this issue. And it makes sense. Act 10 took effect in 2011, and existing labor contracts remained in effect, but most of those have long since expired. Madison’s teachers, however, challenged Act 10 in court and in 2012 won an initial round before a Dane County judge, which opened a window in which technically they were not covered by the provisions of the new law, noted James Scott, chairman of Walker’s Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission. The state Supreme Court later upheld the law, in July 2014. During that interim period, the union negotiated a contract with the Madison district that went beyond just base wage changes. The Wisconsin Education Association Council, an umbrella group representing most local teachers unions in Wisconsin, has heard of no other local affiliates with collective-bargaining agreements for 2015-’16, said spokeswoman Christina Brey. AFT-Wisconsin represents some other local unions at school districts. Likewise, it has no locals under collective bargaining agreements for 2015-’16, said Kim Kohlhaas, president of the group. And an official with the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators told us he believes Madison is ""the only district that will continue under what would be described as a pre-Act 10 contractual agreement."" ""In Madison’s case, they continue to adhere to a contract that was bargained with the union prior to Act 10 and that does include all items that were the subjects of that earlier bargain,"" said Jon Bales, executive director of the administrators group. ""Thus, all conditions such as working conditions, transfers, evaluations, etc. – anything that they had negotiated in the past as a part of the contract."" So Walker appears to be on firm ground in singling out Madison. Debating the law’s effect But what of his characterization that Madison is ignoring the law? That is, that the district is not taking advantage of the measure’s ability to save costs through unilateral changes in benefits and working conditions. If Walker means the district is disobeying the law, that’s a matter of dispute that has yet to be settled in court. If he means the district is not applying it, there’s some evidence both ways. Madison district officials and Madison Teachers Inc. executive director John Matthews disagree with Walker’s characterization. The union leader notes that employees accepted a 0.25% base-wage increase, well within Act 10, which limits increases to the inflation rate. It was a raise, he said, the  district never could have sold to employees before Act 10. And Matthews said the district got authority through Act 10 to change the employees’ health insurance carrier, though the district says ultimately that was done as part of bargaining. Walker, meanwhile, has criticized the district for not using Act 10 to get teachers to contribute to their health insurance premiums, something his law allowed districts to do without bargaining. Madison teachers currently make no contribution to premiums. Additionally, one of Act 10’s provisions was that districts adopt an employee ""handbook"" spelling out policies that had once been bargained. Madison has not yet done so, although like some other districts it will do so using the union contract as a basis for it. Another provision of Act 10, new deductions from worker paychecks toward pensions, went into effect automatically statewide. The Madison district counters that it has found cost savings by working collaboratively with employees. It believes it was on solid legal ground in negotiating contracts, said Rachel Strauch-Nelson, spokeswoman for the Madison district. One final note: The 2015-’16 year is a ways off, and it’s possible another district could sign a pre-Act 10-style contract before then. Such a move could or would subject a district to legal challenge. Our rating Walker said Mary Burke’s Madison school district ""will be the only school district left in the state"" to ""ignore the (Act 10) law"" in the 2015-16 school year. Due to some legal circumstances, Madison stands alone right now with a 2015-’16 contract that has pre-Act 10 elements. The law has affected some elements of district policies nonetheless. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097229BC0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/10/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-madison-school-district-only-one/

How much have Medicare beneficiaries 'paid in' to the system?
","The National Republican Senatorial Committee recently aired an ad in the hotly contested Iowa Senate race between Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst. It features a woman named Darlene Blake of Des Moines, Iowa, talking about the importance of Medicare. ""Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare,"" Blake says. ""That’s just not fair. We paid in. We paid for it. That should be there for us."" In a separate fact-check, we looked at the claim that Braley ""voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare."" Here, we’ll look at the claim that cuts to Medicare affect people who have already ""paid in. We paid for it."" The ad has a point that Americans 65 and over have ""paid in"" to Medicare through the payroll taxes they’ve paid throughout their working lives. Currently, workers pay a 1.45 percent payroll tax for Medicare, while employers kick in an additional 1.45 percent. Self-employed people pay both parts of the tax. Meanwhile, starting in 2013, households earning $125,000 (or $200,000 or $250,000, depending on the number of people in the household and their tax-filing status) pay an additional 0.9 percent Medicare tax. However, it’s not as if those payroll taxes are placed in an account for that beneficiary’s future use alone. Instead, the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by workers of all ages (combined with the proceeds of current beneficiaries’ Medicare premiums) foot the bill for the Medicare costs of today’s beneficiaries. And the way the math has worked out over the years, today’s beneficiaries have gotten far more back in Medicare spending than they put into the system through their tax payments. We discussed this topic in 2013, using statistics from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research institute in Washington. We’ll recap their findings here, updated with the most recent data. Institute researchers figured out what people turning 65 in various years have already ""paid in"" to the system and what they can expect to ""take out"" after they reach age 65. Because marital status and family income can significantly affect both the amount paid in and the amount paid out, the institute offers calculations for various types of family units. To make the final amounts comparable to what might have been done with the tax money had it been invested privately, the institute adjusted all dollar figures at 2 percentage points above the rate of inflation. (The authors note that different assumptions for long-term returns on investment would change the results.) We looked at the statistics for three ""cohorts"" of seniors -- those who turned 65 in 2000, 2005 and 2010. That means they’re 79, 74 and 69 years old today. We found that, for Medicare recipients, the ""worst"" deal for any of these demographic groups is still quite generous. A two-earner couple, with one high earner and one average earner, who both turned 65 in 2010 would have paid $158,000 in Medicare taxes over their lifetimes, but can be expected to be the recipient of $385,000 in Medicare spending. That’s a ratio of $2.40 in benefits for every dollar paid in taxes -- and that’s the least generous ratio we found. The highest such ratio we found was for one-earner couples in which the earner turned 65 in 2000 and was paid the average wage. Such a couple would have paid $39,000 in Medicare taxes but can expect to benefit from $306,000 -- a ratio of $7.80 in Medicare spending for every dollar the couple paid in taxes.  So the ad’s claim -- that cutting Medicare is ""just not fair. We paid in. We paid for it"" -- is greatly exaggerated. For today’s typical Medicare beneficiary, what they paid into the system represents just 13 percent to 41 percent of what they can expect to get out of it. The rest is funded by younger Americans’ payroll taxes. The fact that taxes paid by active workers are supporting today’s generation of retirees is a big reason why some policymakers are concerned about the program’s long-term solvency. In 1950, the average American lived for 68 years and retirees were supported by 16 active workers. Now, the average life expectancy is 78 and just three workers support every retiree. By the time today’s middle-aged workers reach retirement age, only two workers will be around to support their benefits. Promised benefits will exceed revenues by about 30 percent, and there will be no money in the trust fund to rely on. ""The problem with the quote from the ad is that it is numberless,"" said C. Eugene Steuerle, who helped assemble the Urban Institute’s calculations. "" ‘We paid for it’ doesn’t say what we ‘paid’ nor what ‘it’ is, since the program expands constantly over time."" Steuerle added, ""We paid for our parents’ Medicare. There’s very little money sitting in the trust funds. The issue is what we think we should expect from our children, which requires consideration of the cost and the benefits."" Our ruling The ad says that cuts to Medicare affect people who have already ""paid in. We paid for it."" While Americans have indeed ""paid in"" to Medicare, the amount that today’s beneficiaries have paid in only covers a fraction of their expected costs. The taxes paid by today’s typical beneficiaries will cover just 13 percent to 41 percent of what those beneficiaries can expect to get from Medicare during their lifetime. The rest of what has been ""paid in"" for their care has come from younger Americans. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A394DC0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/09/national-republican-senatorial-committee/how-much-have-medicare-beneficiaries-paid-system/

GOP ad says Bruce Braley 'voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare'
","Some political talking points just never die. Like this one, used in a recent ad aired by the National Republican Senatorial Committee in the hotly contested Iowa Senate race between Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst. ""Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare,"" the ad says. ""That’s just not fair. We paid in. We paid for it. That should be there for us."" Here, we’re going to look at the claim that Braley ""voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare."" (In a separate item, we’ll look at the second half of the claim.) It’s correct that Braley, as a House member, voted for the Affordable Care Act in 2010. However, PolitiFact has been skeptical of numerous previous claims that Obamacare cuts Medicare, rating them either Half True or Mostly False, depending on how they are worded. Other fact-checkers have concluded similarly. The claim is too sweeping and doesn’t convey fully what the law is doing. Here’s the gist. As Congress was debating President Barack Obama’s health care law in 2010, its backers acted to fend off one line of criticism -- that the bill was a budget-buster -- by making sure the bill didn’t add to the deficit. To do this, they wrote into the law both new taxes and new savings. Among the spending cuts were measures aimed at reducing the increase in future Medicare costs. When the law was passed, the reductions amounted to $500 billion over the following 10 years; eventually, as the 10-year budget window shifted a year or two into the future, the cost of these reductions rose to more than $700 billion. Over 10 years, the combined reductions are estimated to be $415 billion for traditional Medicare, $156 billion for the managed-care option known as Medicare Advantage, $56 billion in payments to teaching hospitals that serve large low-income populations, and $114 billion in other categories, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate. But it’s important to note a few caveats. First, while the ad implies that the law is slicing Medicare benefits, these are not cuts to current services. Rather, as Medicare spending continues to rise over the next 10 years, it will do so at a slower pace would have occurred without the law. So claims that Obama would ""cut"" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. Second, the savings are focused on lowering payments to hospitals and insurance companies. They are not aimed at beneficiaries. For instance, the law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers that serves roughly 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to participating health plans. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Does this mean that no senior citizen today would be harmed by the law’s passage? No. It’s possible that some beneficiaries, including Medicare Advantage participants, could see additional costs passed along to them, experience reductions in services, or find fewer doctors willing to treat them under Medicare. For instance, Brook Hougesen, the NRSC’s press secretary, pointed to news coverage in Iowa about how 9,200 state residents, ""many of them in rural areas of the state,"" had to choose a new Medicare Advantage plan to avoid losing coverage on Jan. 1, 2014. The shifts were prompted by some Medicare Advantage plans’ determination that they could not provide the minimum number of health care providers in thinly populated areas to satisfy Medicare Advantage rules. Still, there’s a lot of uncertainty about the extent and scope of these cutbacks -- more than the ad lets on. Also, the ad ignores some of the benefits seniors will get from the law -- for instance, $48 billion over 10 years for Medicare Part D prescription coverage from the ACA’s provisions that targeted the so-called ""donut hole."" It also funds illness prevention benefits and expands preventive care benefits. We asked Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid for President George H.W. Bush, whether subsequent changes in the law’s implementation would undercut our previous skepticism about claims like those made against Braley, and she said they did not. The prior critiques of the claim ""remain relevant,"" she said. Our ruling The ad says, ""Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare."" The law does include cost savings that could impact some beneficiaries, such as Medicare Advantage participants. But the ad overlooks some key nuances. The statement that suggests that the law is reducing benefits now, across the board, but it’s actually reducing the future growth of Medicare spending. The law also targets these reductions at health-care providers, not beneficiaries. And the ad ignores new spending from the law that would benefit Medicare beneficiaries, such as expanded coverage for prescriptions. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate the NRSC’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097384C80>],/factchecks/2014/sep/09/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-ad-says-bruce-braley-voted-cut-700-billion-med/

Does Republican Carlos Curbelo support ending the Medicare guarantee?
","U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, portrays his Republican challenger Carlos Curbelo as out of touch with middle-class residents in his South Florida district when it comes to issues such as Medicare benefits. A Web ad repeatedly shows Curbelo in a TV interview saying ""if anybody has a complaint, file it,"" while the ad lists a litany of attacks on Curbelo. (That quote is unrelated to Medicare and relates to a situation involving Curbelo’s work as a lobbyist.) Narrator: ""When Curbelo supported ending the Medicare guarantee? Curbelo: ""If anyone has a complaint, file it."" Here we will fact-check whether Curbelo ""supported ending the Medicare guarantee"" -- an attack that could draw the attention of senior voters in the district that spans Miami to Key West. Paul Ryan’s proposals for Medicare  The ad provides no explanation about what it would mean to end the Medicare guarantee or why Garcia claims that is Curbelo’s view. Curbelo is a Miami-Dade school board member who has never served in Congress so he hasn’t voted on any Medicare plan. Garcia’s attack relates to Curbelo’s statement in April 2014 about a GOP budget plan by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Ryan, the House budget chairman, has included proposals to overhaul Medicare in his past few budget proposals with some changes along the way. When the Miami Herald asked Curbelo in April about whether he supported Ryan’s plan in response to a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee attack, Curbelo said, ""I would vote for any budget that helps create jobs and rewards hard work, protects Medicare for seniors, and stops immorally piling debt on my generation and on my daughters' generation. While I have not fully reviewed this budget I'm inclined to support it."" So what did the DCCC mean about ending the Medicare ""guarantee""? The clearest -- and least controversial -- explanation of how Medicare is a guarantee is that once you turn 65, you get Medicare, no questions asked. That’s been the case since Medicare was established in 1965. Medicare is structured as a defined-benefit plan rather than a defined-contribution plan. That means it specifies the benefits provided, rather than letting benefits depend on the amount of money paid into the system. But the federal government doesn’t guarantee that it will pay for every possible service or treatment -- Medigap insurance plans have emerged to pay for the procedures that Medicare doesn’t cover. And Congress and the president can change what is covered under Medicare. The Affordable Care Act makes changes to Medicare to reduce future growth of the program. Ryan has released multiple versions of his Medicare plan the past few years. The plan Ryan released this year advocates reforming Medicare into a ""premium support"" program in which, starting in 2024, every new beneficiary would go into the premium-support system, but they will be able to choose whether their premium-support payment goes to help pay for a private plan or a traditional fee-for-service plan. (Critics refer to this as a voucher plan, and it does have some similarities.) A spokesman for Ryan said the premium support payment would be pegged to the average bid. For those who were 55 or older in 2013, they would remain in the traditional Medicare system. Ryan also raises the eligibility from age 65 to 67. Ryan’s proposal to overhaul Medicare has not gone far because it lacks support in the Democratic-controlled Senate.   The ‘guarantee’ of Medicare Simply saying that Ryan’s plan is ""ending the Medicare guarantee"" is a misleading overstatement. If we talk about the ""Medicare guarantee"" simply as seniors getting Medicare when they hit a certain age, they are still guaranteed to get it. ""It is a fundamental change to Medicare, but saying that it ends the guarantee is too far, because everyone would still get some kind of insurance,"" said Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber, who has advised Republican Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama on health care matters. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that under Ryan’s plan Medicare ""is liable to be a smaller benefit, but it still is going to be a universal benefit. While it's going to be a smaller benefit, so is President Obama’s."" Some Medicare experts we interviewed argued that it is unclear what types of services would remain guaranteed. ""The Ryan plan keeps changing, lacks key details, and has multiple dimensions, making it hard to evaluate,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina. Today, Medicare has a host of services that are covered including a number of days in the hospital or nursing home and covers specified tests and procedures. ""These are ‘guaranteed.’ What would be covered under an insurance plan that people might buy with a voucher is not specified in law,"" said Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at Brookings Institute. ""Benefits could erode over time if the voucher was not increased as fast as medical costs rise, a standard feature of many voucher plans, unless people ponied up additional premium payments that might rise rapidly if they want to maintain breadth of coverage."" At this point, Ryan’s plan leaves advocates with questions.   ""I don’t know for certain if there would be guaranteed core benefits or if the benefits that are guaranteed now would have to be in those plans,"" said Judith Stein, executive director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy. ""It would be substantially different."" What Curbelo says Curbelo told PolitiFact Florida that he is against a voucher or premium-support plan for Medicare. ""I’ve never supported the voucher concept,"" Curbelo said. ""I don’t think we need to do that. I think we can preserve Medicare as it exists today through other reforms."" Curbelo calls for ""eliminating the rampant fraud in fee-for-service, adjusting the eligibility age to account for longer lifespan, and potentially, means testing,"" his campaign spokesman Wadi Gaitan told PolitiFact Florida. Curbelo, however, doesn’t deny that he said he supported Ryan’s overall budget proposal, though he told PolitiFact Florida he disagrees with the premium-support plan within it. ""Given a choice between the GOP budget and the Democrats’ budget, he would have supported the GOP budget,"" Gaitan said. Accusing a Republican of wanting to get rid of the ""Medicare guarantee"" is a common Democratic tactic this year -- in fact, Garcia’s attack on Curbelo is similar to one in April by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. (The DCCC has used a similar attack on U.S. Rep Steve Southerland, R-Fla., and the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee has used it against GOP Senate candidate Joni Ernst in Iowa.) This Democratic talking point is the latest variation on the Democratic line that ""Republicans voted to end Medicare,"" which PolitiFact rated Lie of the Year in 2011. Our ruling Garcia said ""Curbelo supported ending the Medicare guarantee."" The Democrats are hanging this claim on a very weak thread: when asked about Ryan’s budget proposal which includes a Medicare overhaul Curbelo said, ""While I have not fully reviewed this budget I'm inclined to support it."" That statement sheds no light on Curbelo’s views on changing Medicare. Ryan’s plan would change Medicare but it wouldn’t end the guarantee that seniors get it when they hit a certain age. And Curbelo says he wants to reform Medicare in other ways that don’t involve Ryan’s premium-support plan. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809700CA40>],/factchecks/2014/sep/09/joe-garcia/does-republican-carlos-curbelo-support-ending-medi/

Does the U.S. have more corporate-tax deductions than any other country?
","America’s tax code is so famously byzantine that it’s difficult to even measure how riddled it is with loopholes. But Fox News’ Bob Beckel took a shot at doing this on The Five, during a discussion of corporate taxes with co-host Eric Bolling. ""We have a high corporate tax rate,"" said Beckel, but ""we also have the most number of deductions available to corporations. They pay lower taxes than an awful lot of European countries do."" Bolling countered that the United States has ""the highest corporate tax rate in the free world,"" which he said is why companies like Pfizer and Burger King ""jumped ship"" by relocating their corporate headquarters outside of the United States. Beckel, however, stuck to his guns, repeating that the United States has ""the highest number of deductions"" and adding that companies leave the United States for cheap labor, not to evade taxes. We checked Bolling’s claim separately. In this check, we will look at whether Beckel is correct that the U.S. tax code has the highest number of deductions. The uncountable The bad news for Beckel: Experts told us it’s neither practical nor useful to tally the number of deductions in the tax code, and that they hadn’t seen any study that tried. PolitiFact, our sister site, checked a claim in 2013 that ""there have been literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986."" Based on the best estimates available, we ruled that True, but that’s a much more limited claim than the one Beckel made. Deductions constitute a broader category of tax provisions, making Beckel’s claim even harder to check. ""Some Internal Revenue code sections might have 10 or more deductions"" by themselves, said David Kautter, managing director of the Kogod Tax Center at American University. The Treasury Department has issued estimates of the number of ""tax expenditures,"" but those are only a ""subset of tax deductions,"" said Kautter. ""Many deductions are not tax expenditures,"" such as ""wages, office rent, pencils, writing pads, etc."" Since tax experts can’t even really count the number of deductions in the United States, an international comparison is more or less impossible. In any case, experts told us that the more relevant figure is the size of deductions. Governments use what’s called a statutory rate -- 39.1 percent in the United States, the highest in the developed world -- which is levied on the businesses’ taxable base. The taxable base starts out as the corporation’s profits, but the tax code allows them to deduct certain expenditures from that base, like wages, health insurance, and investments in infrastructure. Once you account for deductions, the actual proportion of their profits that businesses fork over to the government is a lot lower. This is called the effective rate. Experts suggested we determine the difference between countries’ effective rates and their statutory rates as a way of measuring the scope of deductions. If the United States were to lead in that measure, then Beckel might have had a point, even if his literal claim didn’t hold water. Sizing up deductions Even this is difficult, experts say. William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, noted that credits and exemptions also help shape the effective rate, so the simple difference between effective and statutory rates can’t be chalked up to tax deductions alone. Still, since we figured that Beckel cared more about the difference between effective and statutory rates than about distinguishing between deductions and exemptions, we ran the numbers anyway, using the World Bank’s estimates for countries’ 2014 effective rates and the Tax Foundation’s tabulations of their statutory rates. Those figures showed that the United States has an effective rate of 27.9 percent, meaning the gap was 11.2 points. That difference ranked 16th out of the 34 advanced, industrialized nations that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Iceland had the widest ratio between its statutory and effective rates (20 percent versus 3 percent), while Belgium had the largest percentage-point drop (from 34 percent to 6.4 percent). In both difference and ratio, the United States was roughly in the middle of the pack. Our ruling Beckel said the United States has ""the highest number of deductions available to corporations."" Counting and comparing deductions internationally isn’t practical, and the only plausible alternative -- estimating the gap between the nations’ statutory and effective tax rates -- shows that the gap in the United States is about average among advanced, industrialized countries.

"['Corporations', 'Taxes', 'PunditFact', 'Eric Bolling']","
Does the U.S. have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world?
","Pundits don’t just disagree about what tax rates should be; they also disagree about how high they actually are. On Fox News’s The Five, hosts Bob Beckel and Eric Bolling came down on either side while discussing how the economy has fared under President Barack Obama. America has ""the most number of deductions available to corporations,"" Beckel said. ""They pay lower taxes than a lot of European countries do, and under Obama, I have not seen corporate taxes go up all that much."" ""Just to fact-check you a little bit,"" responded Bolling, ""we have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world."" Beckel repeated his point, then Bolling pointed towards Pfizer and Burger King going overseas for what he called ""tax inversion."" ""They’re going there specifically to capture a lower corporate income tax,"" said Bolling. We separately checked Beckel’s claim about deductions, but in this check, we’ll see whether Bolling is correct that the United States’ corporate tax rate ranks as the highest in ""the free world."" The rate in theory We decided to focus on the countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group that includes most advanced, industrialized nations. That fits our bill for a proxy for ""the free world."" Out of the 34 countries in the OECD, America ranks first with a 39.1 percent corporate tax rate, compared to an OECD average of 24.1 percent. The OECD figure is what’s called the statutory rate, meaning the base rate applied to corporate profits. According to the Tax Foundation, two non-OECD countries -- the United Arab Emirates (55 percent) and Chad (40 percent) -- have a greater statutory rate than the United States. But the UAE is governed by a monarchy and Chad is a developing country, so we don’t think they would fit into the ""free world"" category Bolling used. The rate in practice PolitiFact, our sister site, has looked at several variations on Bolling’s claim and ruled them Mostly True almost every time. The reason for the ""mostly"" qualifier is that companies aren’t actually taxed at the statutory rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions, and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. So economists often look at what they call the effective tax rate, which experts have told us is just as valid a measurement of corporate tax rates as the statutory rate. But whereas the statutory rate is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial, different, reputable organizations have published very different estimates of the effective tax rate that corporations pay. The most recent estimate comes from the World Bank and International Finance Commission, which put the United States’ effective rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. That’s second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured. In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a survey of 13 prior estimates of the United States’ effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.’s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall. Another 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service put the U.S. effective rate at 27.1 percent, slightly lower than the OECD average of 27.7 percent. Taxes are convoluted Different studies disagree on effective corporate tax rates because corporate tax rates tend to vary widely depending on the industry, said Alan Viola, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""The biggest deduction that varies across countries is how generous the depreciation schedule is,"" said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""When a business does an investment, equipment, a building, they don’t normally get to deduct the whole cost that year. They have to do it over time."" Faster is better, said Viard, but depreciation rates vary depending on what types of equipment a company is buying. Many studies also don’t account for what the United States classifies as S-corporations, meaning businesses that pay tax through the individual income-tax system rather than the corporate income-tax system, Viard said. This represents about 30 percent of American companies, he said. So while effective tax rates are a good estimate of the corporate tax burden in the United States, particular businesses’ burden may vary. Our ruling Bolling said the United States has ""the highest corporate tax rate in the free world."" He was referring to the statutory rate, meaning the rate before deductions.

Obenshain says Democrats exceeded voter ID law in recent primary
","Democrats have portrayed state Sen. Mark Obenshain as the face of voter suppression since the Harrisonburg Republican began his successful push in 2013 for a law requiring Virginians to produce photo identification at the polls. Obenshain recently threw paint back at his adversaries in the wake of the Aug. 9 firehouse primary Democrats held for the state Senate seat that was relinquished by Henry Marsh, D-Richmond. In his Aug. 13 newsletter, Obenshain wrote, ""In the Democratic Party-run firehouse primary to choose the party’s state senate nominee in the 16th District special election, Democrats -- free to adopt any voter identification standard they wished, or none at all -- opted for requirements considerably more stringent than those contained in the state law they denounce, actually going so far as to require that IDs show the address at which the individual is registered."" We wondered whether Democrats did adopt voter ID rules for the contest that were tougher than state law standards. State voter ID law Obenshain’s bill passed on partisan votes in the House and Senate last year and was signed by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. Democrats and many liberal-leaning organizations opposed the measure, saying Virginia had no history of election fraud and voicing concerns that the law would make it harder for the elderly, poor and minorities to vote. Republicans said their aim was not to deny access to ballots, but to protect the integrity of Virginia’s elections. The law, which went into effect July 1, requires voters to produce one piece of identification at the polls: a photo ID.  Acceptable forms of the photo identification include a Virginia driver’s license that has not been expired for more than 12 months; a U.S. passport or any other photo ID issued by the U.S., Virginia or one of its political subdivisions; a student ID issued by any institute of higher learning in Virginia; any employee identification card; or a voter ID card that can be obtained through local registrar’s offices. It should be noted that the law does not require the photo ID to include the voter’s address. Poll workers are required to check the ID against voter rolls to make sure the person is registered to vote in the precinct and, if so, is allowed to cast a ballot. ID in the 16th District A firehouse primary is not a typical election; it’s an informal caucus run by a political party, which establishes the rules.   On Aug. 9, Democrats opened two caucus sites in Richmond and each of five other localities in the 16th District. Registered voters could drop by between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. and -- provided they first signed an allegiance oath to the Democratic Party -- cast a paper ballot for one of four candidates seeking the Senate nomination. Robert Dempsey, executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia, sent PolitiFact the rules for the special election primary. They required each voter to provide proof of registration or residency. The procedures did not demand a photo ID and Dempsey said the party was willing to accept some forms of identification that had once been acceptable in state-run elections, such as a utility bill. Obenshain contends Democrats went beyond the bounds of state law by requiring voters to produce two IDs. Dempsey said that did occur briefly at one polling station, the result of a misunderstanding by officials, and was quickly corrected. Dempsey noted, accurately, that written procedures did not call for two forms of IDs. Obenshain also says Democrats exceeded state law requiring voters to produce an ID bearing their current address. There’s no dispute here. Dempsey said officials checked the address against the one listed in voting rolls. If there was a discrepancy, the voter was allowed to cast a provisional ballot.       About 3,800 votes were cast in the four-candidate firehouse primary, including 156 provisional ballots that were never counted because they wouldn’t have made a difference in outcome; Del. Rosalyn Dance of Petersburg won hands down. The district is heavily Democratic, and Dance will have an edge this fall in a race against independent Preston Brown. Our ruling Obenshain claims that the Democratic Party enforced voter ID rules in the 16th Senate District firehouse primary that were ""considerably more stringent"" than those mandated in a new state law. There was a temporary glitch at one polling place that required voters to produce two IDs, instead of just one mandated under state law. This was quickly corrected and didn’t reflect the party’s intent. That brings us down to the one ID that most primary voters had to produce. Democrats went one step beyond state law by requiring an ID with an address and another step by making sure the address matched with the one listed in voter rolls before a ballot was handed out. On the other hand, the party gets points for leniency because it did not enforce a state law requiring voters to produce a photo ID. So Obenshain’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out a lot of important information. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D448C0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/09/mark-obenshain/obenshain-says-democrats-exceeded-voter-id-law-rec/

EMILY's List attack on Perdue's former firm blasts gender-based pay
","EMILY’s List, a national group advocating for Democratic women candidates, has an attack ad out in Georgia’s closely watched U.S. Senate race between David Perdue, a Republican businessman, and Michelle Nunn, a Democrat and nonprofit executive. The ad focuses on a pay discrimination lawsuit filed by female managers at Dollar General while Perdue was CEO of the discount retailer. The lawsuit was settled several years later -- and after Perdue left the company -- for $18.75 million. The ad opens with a woman penning a letter to Perdue, explaining why he won’t be getting her vote. ""Federal investigators found a company that you ran discriminated against women -- paid them less than men for the same work,"" the woman states. We decided that was a claim worth investigating. The ad, which is paid for by EMILY’s List’s WOMEN VOTE!, focuses on a 2006 lawsuit that was later expanded to cover thousands of female store managers at Dollar General. The lawsuit accused the chain of paying male managers more than females performing the same job, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act of 1963. At the time, Dollar General had about 8,000 stores and about 70,000 employees. Perdue, who was Dollar General CEO from April 2003 to July 2007, was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. Dollar General did not acknowledge any liability or wrongdoing. But the settlement agreement promised some policy changes, something legal experts say is fairly routine. The ad claim is based on part of the lawsuit record -- specifically, a letter from an area director for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Jackson, Miss. to a complaining female manager. The February 2008 letter states that ""available evidence establishes reasonable cause to believe"" that female store managers in the district where the woman worked ""were discriminated against"" in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and the Equal Pay Act. The EEOC letter goes on to say that Dollar General’s explanation for the difference in pay ""is not supported by the evidence nor is it sufficient to rebut the sex-based inference established by pay differentials."" Sworn statements from several female Dollar General managers said the discounter had a pay system that perpetuated stereotypes for judging men and women on their pay, performance and salary needs. Derrick Dickey, spokesman for the Perdue campaign, told us that Dollar General, from the first legal filings to the final settlement, ""always maintained that it was in full compliance with the Equal Pay Act."" ""Years after David left, the company made a prudent decision to allow its liability insurer to cover the mediated amount instead of continue the lengthy and expensive legal process,"" Dickey said. We asked Charlotte Alexander and Jaime Dodge, two employment law experts, to review documents filed in the lawsuit and weigh in on several issues, including the accuracy of the ad.                                                           ----------------------------- ""Available evidence establishes reasonable cause to believe that (you) and other female managers in District #374 were discriminated against in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended and the Equal Pay Act as they generally were paid less than similarly situated managers performing duties requiring equal skill, effort and responsibility."" -- excerpt from the EEOC statement                                                              -------------------------- Alexander, a Harvard Law School graduate and assistant professor of legal studies at Georgia State University, said the claim in the ad ""on its face is true."" ""It seems to track the EEOC letter,"" she said. That letter ""could have been damaging"" at trial, but would not have meant an ""automatic win"" for the female managers, Alexander said. A judge and jury would not be bound to follow the EEOC’s findings, she said. ""They would have to make their own determination from the ground up."" Alexander said the lawsuit, filed against Dollar General parent company Dolgencorp, Inc., was ""pretty significant, ""with 2,000 female managers signing on as plaintiffs and more than 20,000 ultimately eligible to be part of the settlement agreement. Alexander said she does not believe $18.75 million would be a ""nuisance settlement."" (Those are settlements in cases, often without merit, that are reached just to avoid continuing and costly legal bills.) Dodge, a Harvard graduate, former member of the Harvard Law faculty and an assistant professor at UGA’s School of Law, strongly disagreed. She said there is ""strong support"" for the Perdue camp’s claim that Dollar General ""simply settled to avoid litigation costs."" The claims raised by the female managers at Dollar General are substantially similar, though not identical, to those raised in Wal-Mart v. Dukes, she said. Wal-Mart refused to settle, but it took nearly a decade of litigation all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court agreed with Wal-Mart that a nationwide class action for pay discrimination could not be fairly litigated, Dodge said. ""Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly here, the court found that the idea of implicit bias against women in the retail workplace was not supported by any reliable scientific evidence presented in court,"" she said. As for the settlement amount, plaintiffs' lawyers were allowed to seek up to $6.25 million, and then the named plaintiffs each had the opportunity to receive $10,000 each (and $5,000 for others), Dodge said. The class of female managers may have received less than $1,000 per person on average, Dodge said. ""That number says to me, either the pay gap was really small or the plaintiffs' had substantial doubts about the merits of their case, such that they settled for a very low percentage of the alleged damages. So, the settlement number does suggest that this was a weak case, in one way or another,"" she said. In summary: The ad is based on a letter from an EEOC area manager in MIssissippi, which says there was reasonable cause to believe female managers in at least one district were discriminated against in pay. The case never went to trial. The company settled out of court without admitting guilt. The statement is accurate on its face, but needs further clarification. We rate it as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967B6C40>],/factchecks/2014/sep/09/emilys-list/emilys-list-attack-perdues-former/

Cory Gardner says his plan for contraceptives, namely the pill, is cheaper than Mark Udall's
","Democratic Sen. Mark Udall has consistently attacked his Republican challenger, Rep. Cory Gardner, for supporting anti-abortion measures like personhood legislation. But Gardner is on the offensive with a new ad airing in the Colorado Senate race about women’s health issues. ""What’s the difference between me and Mark Udall on contraception?"" Gardner says. ""I believe the pill ought to be available over the counter, around the clock, without a prescription. Cheaper and easier for you. Mark Udall’s plan is different. He wants to keep government bureaucrats between you and your health care plan. That means more politics and more profits for drug companies. My plan means more rights, more freedom and more control for you."" Udall’s ""plan"" is essentially the Affordable Care Act, which requires health insurance companies to provide access to FDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing, meaning the consumer pays nothing for their prescription at the pharmacy. Gardner, who has repeatedly voted to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law, says he believes a ""cheaper and easier"" alternative is to allow the pill to be sold over the counter, meaning without a prescription. Gardner’s campaign said his plan has two parts: Allow the pill to be sold over-the-counter and ""ensure that women can be reimbursed for those through insurance."" His campaign said both can be accomplished without the Affordable Care Act. If the Affordable Care Act is not repealed, though, Gardner wants to allow insurance providers to cover the pill over-the-counter without a prescription. Udall’s campaign said he supports allowing over-the-counter sales of the pill as long as insurance companies are still mandated to cover it without any cost sharing. So we’re left comparing the Affordable Care Act to Gardner’s position, which is repeal the ACA and replace its contraceptive component with his proposal. Which contraceptive plan is ""cheaper and easier""? We found that even the groups that advocate making the pill available over the counter — like Jessica Arons, president and CEO of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project and Dan Grossman, vice president for research at Ibis Reproductive Health — did not believe it was a cheaper alternative for consumers than requiring insurance companies to cover contraceptives without cost sharing. Gardner’s campaign pointed us to a study by the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, an advocacy group for the consumer health care products industry. The study looked at savings from several different drugs becoming available over-the-counter, but not the pill. The group estimated that each dollar spent on over-the-counter medicines saves the health care system up to $7, which comes to $102 billion annually. About $25 billion of those savings come in the form of reduced drug costs. But the bulk of the savings is actually from avoiding trips to the doctor to get a prescription, the association found. (Imagine going to the doctor every time you had a cold to get a prescription for Sudafed or for Claritin when your allergies flared up. Those visits add up.) However, under the Affordable Care Act, women’s preventive health care must be covered without cost-sharing, meaning a trip to the doctor to get a prescription for birth control would not have any out-of-pocket costs. So a big chunk of the alleged savings from moving the pill over-the-counter would not be realized; it’s already not costing consumers anything. It’s also speculative for Gardner to insist that his plan is cheaper. As far as we can tell, there hasn’t been a study that looks specifically at the cost benefits of moving the pill over-the-counter, and a spokesperson for the Consumer Healthcare Products Association told us that they ""can't speak to any specific product or ingredient."" That’s not to say that providing birth control without cost-sharing, as the Affordable Care Act does, is free to the healthcare system. When insurance companies are required to cover birth control or doctor visits without asking for a co-payment, those costs are baked into the monthly premium. You may not have to pay anything at the pharmacy, but you may pay for it in other ways, especially if you previously chose not to purchase insurance and suddenly are forced by the law to buy a policy. Some grandfathered plans may also choose to not cover these services and it does not address the millions of individuals who would remain uninsured under the law. Zack Cooper, a health policy and economics professor at Princeton University, said it’s possible that if the pill was reclassified as over-the-counter, consumers would have more options, sales volume would go up and competition would increase between drug companies. These factors can all lead to prices going down. But he said it’s also possible that it has a negative effect, since suddenly consumers are paying for birth control at the point-of-purchase instead of getting it at no cost. ""When you make something even a little more expensive, use goes down,"" Cooper said. ""That means more women get pregnant, and babies cost a lot more than birth control. You can argue it would actually increase the cost of insurance and the government will be on the hook for more federal subsidies."" So there’s a lot of uncertainty as to which would actually be cheaper. We would also like to see more details from Gardner on how he would ""ensure that women can be reimbursed for (the pill) through insurance,"" but so far he has not produced legislation or a detailed summary. And Gardner’s plan only applies to one particular birth control: the pill. While the pill is the most common form of birth control, it’s not the only method. About 27 percent of female contraceptive users reported that the pill was their prefered method, meaning three-quarters use another option (though this survey included male condoms and vasectomies, which aren’t covered by the law and make up a big chunk of contraceptive use). Other birth control methods may be more effective or more preferable for certain patients, but they are also a lot more expensive at the point of purchase, said Alina Salganicoff, vice president and director of Women’s Health Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Like intrauterine devices, which can cost $500 to $1,000 without insurance. So when Gardner asks ""what’s the difference between me and Mark Udall on contraception,"" but only provides a plan for the pill, he’s leaving out a lot of people who medically cannot use the pill or chose another option. Absent the Affordable Care Act, these other methods would undoubtedly be more expensive for consumers. Similarly, it would definitely be ""easier"" for a lot of individuals to obtain the pill over-the-counter instead of going to a doctor first to get a prescription, especially those who live in rural areas where a doctor’s office is not nearly as close as the corner pharmacy. But this again does not address all contraceptives, just the pill. Gardner’s campaign also noted that the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued an opinion in 2012 expressing medical support for over-the-counter access to oral contraceptives. However, the group also maintained its support for the Affordable Care Act provision that provides women access to the pill without cost-sharing, noting that ""numerous studies have shown that even small cost-sharing requirements can limit use of needed preventative care."" Our ruling Gardner said his plan on contraceptives is ""cheaper and easier for you"" than Sen. Mark Udall’s plan. This is based on his support for a plan to allow for over-the-counter sales of the pill. Gardner’s plan is lacking in concrete details that would allow a thorough evaluation. There’s some evidence that health care costs generally go down when drugs are made available over-the-counter, but those studies did not look specifically look at the pill. There is a lot of uncertainty and experts — from advocates to economists — question whether Gardner’s proposal would be cheaper to most consumers or the health care system compared to the Affordable Care Act. And Gardner’s plan would only address one type of contraceptive, meaning the many people who choose other methods of birth control would see higher costs. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F934C0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/08/cory-gardner/cory-gardner-says-his-plan-contraceptives-namely-p/

Has Social Security never contributed one cent to the federal deficit?
","U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., running for re-election against Republican challenger Monica Wehby, addressed Social Security during a meeting with about a dozen Bend-area senior citizens in August. The claim: Just in case PolitiFact Oregon had forgotten about that roundtable, Wehby’s campaign seized on the opportunity to remind us by sending along a video clip in which Merkley defended Social Security’s fiscal soundness. ""Social Security has never contributed one cent to the deficit,"" he said. ""Not one cent."" We decided to check. The analysis: Social Security constitutes one of the federal government’s most important functions. The program pays out about $60 billion in benefits each month to about 60 million recipients. About two-thirds of those are retirees. The rest are disabled workers, survivors or the spouses and children of retired or disabled workers. The program is financed mainly by payroll taxes paid by covered workers and their employers. Any surplus must be used to buy nonmarketable U.S. government bonds. The issue has jumped to the front burner because, after years of rolling up surpluses, Social Security in 2010 began paying out more in benefits than it was collecting. Current projections show the gap continuing to widen as aging baby boomers retire, then running dry by 2033. We contacted Merkley’s office and asked how a program that’s leaking money avoids adding to the deficit. Campaign spokeswoman Lindsey O’Brien, in an email, said Merkley was talking about Social Security’s status as an ""off-budget"" program -- a federal budget category encompassing programs that aren’t included in the annual congressional budget process. She passed along articles and columns defending her boss’s point -- that Social Security is legally prohibited from contributing to the deficit. This from the Center for Economic and Policy Research: ""Under the law, Social Security cannot possibly contribute to the on-budget deficit. It can only spend money that has been collected from the designated payroll tax or from the investment of past surpluses."" And this from Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik: ""By law, it can’t contribute to the federal deficit, because Social Security isn’t allowed to spend more than it takes in."" We called Paul Norr, a California-based financial expert who has written extensively about Social Security. Legally, the program is totally self-contained, Norr said. ""Its finances NEVER intermingle with the overall federal allocations of funding,"" he wrote in a follow-up email. ""SS either has or doesn’t have enough funds."" Other PolitiFact checks around the country, however, have arrived at a different conclusion on what happens when the program bleeds red ink. ""When Social Security runs a deficit,"" according to PolitiFact New Hampshire, ""the program draws on interest from the Social Security bonds, forcing government officials, already operating at a deficit, to borrow more money from other sources to make up the difference."" PolitiFact Wisconsin weighed in on the topic last year: ""Since 2010, Social Security has been paying more in benefits than it has collected in payroll taxes. To meet its payments, Social Security began redeeming the bonds, plus interest, from the federal government. … Because the government had to borrow money in order to pay the interest on Social Security, that contributes to the deficit."" The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, in a 2013 ""Social Security Primer,"" said this: ""Because the federal securities held by the trust funds are redeemed with general revenues, this results in increased spending for Social Security from the general fund."" The ruling: Merkley told a gathering of seniors that ""Social Security has never contributed one cent to the deficit."" Until 2010, that was true. However, the program has chalked up increasingly large deficits each year since, requiring money to be taken from its bonds to make up the difference. The senator argues, reasonably, both that Social Security is by law a closed system, and that its trust fund is sufficient for now to cover the current gap. It’s also true, however, that these gaps do affect other parts of the federal government because they require borrowing elsewhere to make up the difference. We rate Merkley’s claim Half True.

Loesch: Obama slashed funding for gun safety program
","For well over a decade, gun owner groups have promoted the use of trigger locks to protect children from weapons around the home. One long-standing effort is Project Child Safe, run by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the voice of gun makers, shooting ranges, and retailers. Conservative radio host and commentator Dana Loesch went to Twitter to berate President Barack Obama for neglecting this approach. ""Obama admin gutted @ProjChildSafe budget to provide trigger locks and safety kits,"" Loesch tweeted Sept. 4, 2014. We wanted to see whether the current administration drove down spending for this particular trigger lock program. We emailed Loesch’s show for evidence to back up the statement, but we did not hear back. The senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Lawrence Keane, explained that Project Child Safe is a nonprofit run by his group and is largely sustained by the foundation and private donations. But during the administration of President George W. Bush, it received a great deal of government support. ""There was grant funding from the Department of Justice,"" Keane said. ""There were a number of different grants. They varied in size. Over time, they totaled $90 million over 8 years."" The foundation used the money to buy trigger locks and safety manuals. It partnered with over 15,000 state and local law enforcement agencies across all 50 states to distribute these safety kits for free to gun owners. Keane said since 2001, the program has provided over 36 million kits, with no government money going toward salaries or overhead. There’s no question the federal money is a fraction of what it was. Whether that happened on Obama’s watch is another matter. A more complicated picture We went to USA Spending, a government website that gives anyone the chance to see how federal agencies spend the taxpayers’ money. 2002 was the high-water mark for federal grants to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. That year, the Justice Department awarded it nearly $50 million to cover the costs of trigger locks and other safety materials. 2003 was also a strong year. Washington provided another $25 million. But as this chart shows, after that, the flow of government dollars to the foundation plummeted.  In 2006, the Department of Justice gave the foundation $917,850. By 2008, the amount fell to $500,000. These declines took place under the Bush administration, three years before Obama took office. The chart also shows a shift in the federal agency that supported the distribution of safety kits. In 2009, the Department of Veterans Affairs began granting the National Shooting Sports Foundation to provide the kits to veterans. ""The VA approached the National Shooting Sports Foundation because of concerns they had, and have, with returning vets having post-traumatic stress disorder,"" Keane said. Under the Obama administration, the VA provided the foundation about $3 million through 2012 to deliver about 1.5 million Project Child Safe safety kits, according to Keane. On an annual basis, that is slightly more than the amount spent in the last year of the Bush administration. Keane said the work with the VA is ongoing with an estimated additional $2 million in the pipeline. According to the Justice Department, the foundation had provided 32 million kits by 2005. In the seven years since, about 4 million kits have been delivered. Our ruling Loesch said that the Obama administration gutted the budget for Project Child Safe. In reality, the deepest cuts took place during the Bush years. Obama inherited a program funded at $500,000. In 2009, the funding agency changed from the Justice Department to Veterans Affairs. While the funding for Project Child Safe itself ended, the same kind of kits were distributed to peoples’ homes, although through different channels. Funding increased very slightly from the last year of the Bush administration. The work between the foundation and Veterans Affairs continues.

Gillespie says Obamacare ""cuts seniors' Medicare""
","GOP Senate candidate Ed Gillespie says Obamacare won’t help you grow old. ""It’s a law that cuts seniors’ Medicare,"" Gillespie said in a campaign email listing reasons why  he opposes the health care law. This is a well-traveled claim that PolitiFact has met frequently over the years. Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, backed up the statement, in part, with blurbs from fact checks written by our colleagues in two other PolitiFact bureaus. He pointed to a 2013 PolitiFact National article examining a claim by Scott Brown -- the Republican U.S. Senate nominee in New Hampshire -- that Obamacare ""raises taxes and cuts Medicare."" PolitiFact rated the two-pronged statement Mostly True, saying the law ""definitely raises taxes,"" to help pay for its costs. But our colleagues also said the claim that Obamacare cuts Medicare is a complicated issue that undercut the accuracy of Brown’s full claim. PolitiFact has looked askance at bare statements that Obamacare cuts Medicare, rating them either Half True or Mostly False depending on how they are worded. Obamacare, to help cover its costs, also imposed a series of savings. Among them are measures that will reduce the increase in Medicare by $716 billion from 2013 to 2022, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate. It’s important to note that Medicare spending will continue to rise, but at a slower pace than they it would have without the law. And the savings are focused on lowering payments to hospitals and insurance companies -- not beneficiaries. Gillespie’s says that Obamacare cuts ""seniors’ Medicare."" That suggests the law isn’t just reducing Medicare spending but is actually slicing Medicare benefits. To support that line of reasoning, Logan pointed to a couple of PolitiFact articles in which experts suggested that the reduced payments the law calls for could affect patients’ access to services. PolitiFact Wisconsin noted in October 2012 concerns that slowing growth in Medicare payments might discourage some health care providers from accepting Medicare patients. One area of concern is the Medicare Advantage program, which is run by private insurers and offers greater benefits than traditional Medicare for things such as dental care, free eye glasses and gym memberships. About 30 percent of the 54 million Medicare beneficiaries in the U.S. are enrolled in those plans, according to Kaiser Family Foundation estimates. Those privately run plans cost more per beneficiary than traditional Medicare, and Obamacare  seeks to even out those costs. Some health care analysts have said the law’s Medicare Advantage cost savings might lead to its enrollees’ paying higher premiums or losing some of their extra benefits On the other hand, Gillespie does not mention that the health care law actually adds some new services: It gradually closes that gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage known as the ""doughnut hole,"" funds illness prevention benefits and expands preventative care benefits. Logan also referred us to statements issued by for former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va. In March 2010, Webb said said Obamacare would make ""dramatic cuts in Medicare"" and lamented the reductions in Medicare Advantage. Here’s a quick note on the timing of Gillespie’s email. Logan told us it was originally sent in January and was resent by the campaign on Aug. 25 after the Daily Press in Newport News -- which published a weekly PolitiFact Virginia digest --signed up recently to get automated email updates from the campaign. ""Unless you want to single out that particular signup, it would be more accurate to refer to it as a January email rather than an Aug. 25 email,"" Logan said. Because the email is part of the campaign’s ongoing communications about Obamacare -- one that the Gillespie campaign feels free to resend -- we think it’s fair to judge it as a current line of attack from Gillespie’s campaign on the law. Our ruling Gillespie says Obamacare ""cuts seniors’ Medicare,"" a statement that implies the law is reducing benefits across the board. There’s debate among analysts over how the law’s cost savings measures will impact some beneficiaries, particularly seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers. Some of those seniors -- who comprise about 30 percent of Medicare recipients -- may lose some of the extra benefits they had before the law or could see higher premiums. Overall, the health care law slows Medicare’s growth, but spending will still rise significantly and some new services for seniors were added. So we rate Gillespie’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4C55C0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/08/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-obamacare-cuts-seniors-medicare/

Paul Ryan says Miller Brewing and Anheuser-Busch are no longer American companies
","During an appearance in Milwaukee, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan delved into the growing controversy surrounding inversions, the practice of U.S.-based companies buying foreign firms and then relocating their own headquarters to another country to enjoy lower taxes. Bloomberg News reported that nine U.S. companies are planning tax inversions this year. The most recent and highest profile case came in August 2014 when Burger King said it planned to buy Canada-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons and relocate its own headquarters from the United States to Canada. In an appearance before the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club, Ryan was asked if inversions should be banned. He said that the U.S. tax code needed reform and that American-based companies pay far more in taxes than their counterparts in other countries. ""The trend we have seen lately are foreign companies buying U.S. companies for many reasons, like tax reasons,"" said Ryan, R-Janesville. ""Simply putting up a fortress around America with these anti-inversion rules, all that we'll end up doing is accelerate the takeover of U.S. corporations by foreign corporations."" Ryan then popped open a claim involving one of Brewtown’s icons. ""Miller is not a U.S. company any more. Neither is Anheuser-Busch,"" he said. ""Think of what this does to our communities. The royalties, the headquarters and all that."" Yes, beer and politics get mixed up again. A few weeks back, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke told an ABC News interviewer that she favored New Glarus Brewing Co.’s Spotted Cow to Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy, because Spotted Cow was available only in Wisconsin. After asking around to see if that was widely known, we checked it out and rated it True. When we asked our beer drinking cohorts about where Miller and Bud were based, we got some of the same stumped looks. After all, Milwaukee is where Frederick J. Miller bought the Plank Road Brewery and founded Miller Brewing Company in 1855. ""He brewed his delicious beer using yeast that he carried in his pocket from Europe,"" the company’s history says. Although Miller is still brewed in Milwaukee (and elsewhere), the company is no longer based here. In 2002, South African Breweries, already one of the largest breweries in the world, bought Miller. That created SABMiller. In 2008, SABMiller added the the U.S. business of Molson Coors, creating MillerCoors. The new company moved its headquarters from Milwaukee to Chicago, while the corporate parent is based in London. Brewery employment has remained about the same in Milwaukee at about 750 workers, the company said in June of 2013. The number of corporate office jobs in Milwaukee, including sales and marketing and executives, declined by about 370 to 607. What about Bud? Meanwhile, TV ads for Anheuser-Busch’s flagship brew, Budweiser often feature a heavy Americana feel, with red, white and blue and tributes to returning soldiers and small towns. But today the corporate parent is a long way from St. Louis, where its roots date to 1852. In a hostile takeover, the international conglomerate InBev bought Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion in 2008. Anheuser-Busch is now one of many subsidiaries and the deal resulted in hundreds of jobs being cut, including many in St. Louis. The full name of the company is now Anheuser-Busch InBev. The headquarters is in Belgium. The company leaped over SABMiller to become the largest brewer in the world. Before the company bought Anheuser-Busch, InBev grew from a combination of Belgian breweries, the addition of Labatts in Canada and breweries in Russia, China, Germany and Brazil. Since then, the company has added Mexico’s Grupo Modelo, according to a  history on the company’s website. ""I don't think the tax code was a driving factor for any of the mergers,"" said Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketer’s Insights, a trade publication. ""AB InBev was more about other synergies,"" he said. ""They probably don't mind a lower tax rate, however."" In addition, moves into new markets are necessary because beer sales are flat in the United States and Europe, according to a Sept. 3, 2014 profile of AB InBev in Forbes. ""Amid stagnating beer sales in developed markets, comprising North America and Western Europe, the brewer has looked to tap into the growth potential of emerging beer markets such as Brazil, Mexico, China and South Korea, mainly by acquiring small regional brands and leveraging its strong marketing and advertising muscle,"" the article said Our rating Ryan cited two well-known beer makers -- including one founded in Milwaukee -- when asked about inversions. He said the parent companies of Miller and Anheuser-Busch are located overseas. They were part of a long-standing and rapid world-wide consolidation of the major breweries. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809789D780>],/factchecks/2014/sep/08/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-miller-brewing-and-anheuser-busch-a/
