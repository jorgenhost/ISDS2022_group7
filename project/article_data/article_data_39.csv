""The NFL and our clubs will continue to work collaboratively with NFL players to support programs to address criminal justice reform, police reforms, and economic and educational advancement,"" a statement from the league says. It doesn’t mention Black Lives Matter. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell recently said ""Black lives matter"" in a video outlining the league’s position, and the league has condemned racism, according to a story in the Undefeated. This new pledge expands on a deal with Players Coalition, a group that negotiated with owners on behalf of players who kneeled during the national anthem to protest police brutality, the story says. Since that agreement more than two seasons ago, the NFL has donated $44 million to fund social justice work by awarding grants to 20 organizations and 350 grassroots programs. ""Now that fund will balloon to $250 million in all,"" according to a story on the NFL’s website, ""with the league working with players to identify and work with programs that address criminal justice reform, police reform and economic and educational advancement for African Americans.""

No, Black Lives Matter is not a terrorist organization
","A Facebook post that spins BLM as ""Burn Loot Murder"" shares an image that shouts this claim in all-caps: ""BLACK LIVES MATTER IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION."" Earlier in July, a city councilor in Massachusetts made the same attack, and Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, said Black Lives Matter ""will be shown to be a terrorist organization.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim isn’t entirely new. In 2016, a petition asking President Barack Obama’s administration to designate Black Lives Matter a terrorist organization received 140,000 signatures in two weeks. Sympathizers of Black Lives Matter have warned the movement to do more to discourage violence at its protests. But Black Lives Matter does not fit the federal definition of a terrorist organization, nor does it appear as a terrorist group in an extensive database that tracks terrorism attacks globally. ""Black Lives Matter is not a terrorist organization nor a terrorist movement, and no responsible source would describe it as such,"" David Sterman, an international security senior policy analyst at  the New America think tank, told PolitiFact. Black Lives Matter, a domestic group, has not been designated as a terrorist organization on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations.  When reviewing potential targets for designation, the department ""looks not only at the actual terrorist attacks that a group has carried out, but also at whether the group has engaged in planning and preparations for possible future acts of terrorism or retains the capability and intent to carry out such acts."" ""None of those criteria are descriptive of Black Lives Matter,"" Sterman said. National security experts have told PolitiFact there is no legal process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. While what constitutes terrorism has been debated for years, federal law defines domestic terrorism as acts dangerous to human life that violate the criminal laws of the United States or of any state, and which appear to be intended to: • intimidate or coerce a civilian population; • influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion: or • affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping. Black Lives Matter is mentioned in four incidents in the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database, which includes 200,000 terrorist attacks dating back to 1970, but the group is not listed as a perpetrator group in any incidents in the database. Here are the four cases in which the group is mentioned: • Assailants opened fire on a Black Lives Matter rally in Minneapolis on Nov. 23, 2015, injuring five people. No group claimed responsibility for the incident, but ""sources attributed the attack to white supremacists and identify one of the assailants as a member of the Sovereign Citizen movement. Four individuals were arrested in connection with the attack."" • Lakeem Keon Scott claimed responsibility for opening fire on police officers and civilians in Bristol, Tenn., on July 7, 2016. One person was killed and four others, including a police officer and the assailant, were injured. Witnesses reported Scott shouting, ""Police suck! Black lives matter!"" during the attack. Law enforcement at the time said Scott, who served in the U.S. Army and was a National Guard reservist, acted alone. • Also on July 7, 2016, Micah Xavier Johnson claimed responsibility for opening fire on police officers at a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas. Five police officers were killed and nine people, including officers and civilians, were injured. Johnson stated that he ""wanted to kill white people"" before being killed during a standoff with police. Johnson was an Army veteran who served in Afghanistan who told investigators he acted alone.  • ""An unknown anti-police extremist group claimed responsibility for"" a person throwing an incendiary device at a parked police vehicle in Daytona Beach, Fla., on July 17, 2016, and ""in a note left at the scene and stated ""’Black Lives Matter.’""  The fact-checking organization Snopes reported in July on a claim that a ""convicted terrorist"" has served as a leader of an organization that provides fundraising and fiscal sponsorship for the Black Lives Matter Global Movement. Snopes found that Susan Rosenberg was an active member of revolutionary left-wing movements whose illegal activities included bombing U.S. government buildings and committing armed robberies, and that in 1985 she received a 58-year prison sentence that was commuted by President Bill Clinton in 2001. ""That's not to suggest that no one associated with BLM — or any particular movement — never engages in some criminal behavior,"" Joshua Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism and former deputy legal advisor, both at the National Security Council, told PolitiFact. ""But the relevant question is whether the organization itself engages in the type of activity laid out by statute. And, on that, there's been no evidence provided to indicate as much."" Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors addressed the experience of being called a terrorist in ""When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir."" She wrote: ""I carry the memory of living under that terror — the terror of knowing that I, or any member of my family, could be killed with impunity — in my blood, my bones, in every step I take. And yet I was called a terrorist. The members of our movement are called terrorists. ...We are not terrorists. I am not a terrorist."" Also in 2018, Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza said in an interview: ""Not only are Black Lives Matter activists not terrorists, but fundamentally what we are trying to do is point out the failings in the basic premise of the founding of this country, that there would be liberty and justice for all. We are pulling back the curtains on really despicable deeds."" Black Lives Matter advocates against state-sanctioned violence against Black people. ""We embody and practice justice, liberation, and peace in our engagements with one another,"" it says in its online statement of beliefs. A widely shared Facebook post claimed: ""Black Lives Matter is a terrorist organization."" We didn’t find any evidence of this.

Group of Southern Democrats, not all Democrats, held up 1964 Civil Rights Act
","When lawmakers want to delay legislation from moving forward, they filibuster. In simple terms, that means they talk for a long time to hold up the bill. On social media, some users are presenting mangled history about the filibuster to take a swipe at Democrats over civil rights.  The posts, which have appeared on Facebook and Twitter, say: ""The longest filibuster in U.S. history was 75 days. It took place in 1964, when Democrats tried to block the Civil Rights Act. It’d be a shame if this went viral."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  There was a lengthy fight in Washington before the Civil Rights Act was signed into law, but the post gets some aspects of history wrong and lumps all Democrats together in opposition. Democrats introduced the legislation and led its passage.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and provided protection of voting rights, banned discrimination in public facilities and established equal employment opportunity. Getting it passed wasn’t easy. The longest continuous debate in U.S. Senate history was brought on by a group of Southern Democrats over the legislation. But many northern Democrats supported the bill, and the filibuster lasted 60 days, not 75, according to the Senate’s website. Robert Gordon, a legal historian and law professor at Stanford University, told PolitiFact the post’s claim is misleading and pointed to Democratic support of the bill. ""The nay Democratic votes were all from the Southern bloc of the party. The former Confederate states had been effectively one-party states since Reconstruction,"" Gordon said. ""The Civil Rights Act was promoted by a former Southern Democrat, President Lyndon Johnson of Texas, and passed with the help of Northern Democrats and 27 Republicans."" Shortly after President John F. Kennedy publicly called for a robust Civil Rights Act, Emmanuel Celler, a New York Democrat, introduced the House version of the bill on June 19, 1963, according to an article in the Smithsonian Magazine. Following Kennedy’s assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson strongly pushed for the measure and addressed a joint session in Congress days later, urging members to pass the bill. The House passed the measure in February 1964. Once it hit the Senate, it was met with opposition from a group of southern Democratic senators. The group, known as ""the Southern bloc"" of the party, represented former Confederate states and was predominantly led by West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan. At the time, a two-thirds vote, or 67 senators, were required to invoke cloture and end the debate. That happened on June 10, when a coalition of 27 Republicans and 44 Democrats ended the filibuster with a 71-29 vote.  On June 12, 1964, 46 Democrats and 27 Republicans voted for the legislation, and 21 Democrats and 6 Republicans voted against. It was signed into law July 2, 1964. Social media posts claim that Democrats hold the longest filibuster in U.S. history, which lasted 75 days, when they blocked the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It’s true that Democrats hold the longest filibuster in Senate history over the legislation, but it was led by a group of southern Democrats, not all Democrats, and lasted 60 days, not 75. Many Democrats from non-Southern states supported the bill and helped end the debate. Democrats wrote the bill and Democrats led its passage in the Senate.  The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Wisconsin GOP lawmaker wrong that masks have been ""proven ineffective"" against COVID-19
","As coronavirus cases climb in Wisconsin, more and more face mask policies have been put into effect. Some apply to specific settings, such as stores or government-owned buildings, others more universally, such as in Dane County and the cities of Milwaukee and Green Bay.  Indeed, on July 30, 2020, Gov. Tony Evers issued a statewide mask order. Most mask mandates have come with exceptions, such as for young children and people whose medical conditions may make it unsafe to wear one.  Opponents argue mask mandates endanger personal freedoms, that wearing a mask can cause carbon dioxide poisoning (an idea that has been debunked by scientists) and that some types of face coverings won’t do anything to stop transmission of the coronavirus.  State Rep. Michael Schraa, R-Oshkosh, voiced that theory in an interview with the Oshkosh Northwestern on July 24, 2020, after sharing links to sources on Facebook that suggest masks do not work as they are intended. His comments come as the city of Oshkosh weighs a mandate on masks in public spaces.  ""If you think the government should be mandating us wearing masks that are proven ineffective just for the sake of giving a false sense of security for people, what else are you going to agree to?"" Schraa told the Northwestern.  Is Schraa correct when he claims that wearing masks has been ""proven ineffective""? No.  Let’s take a look. New guidance to match a new virus  When asked for backup, spokeswoman Linda Palmer said the comment was aimed at whether governments should be allowed to mandate masks, and that ""he did not make a direct statement that all masks are always totally ineffective.""  But Schraa did say — here and in other forums — that he believed masks weren’t effective. In conversations on his Facebook page, he linked to articles stating that masks do not prevent transmission of viruses.  It’s important to note that, at one point, federal health officials were not recommending that everyone wear masks, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began advising widespread mask use in April and hasn’t changed its stance since.  Critics often use that reversal to argue against the effectiveness of masks.  But because this is a novel virus, the CDC, the medical community and everyday Americans alike are learning about it at the same time — and as more evidence emerged about how many asymptomatic people could be spreading the virus, guidance on who should wear masks shifted with it.  (The CDC now estimates that 40% of infections could be among people who feel perfectly healthy.) If you’re not a health care worker, you’re likely wearing a cloth mask instead of an N95 respirator, which filters the large majority of airborne particles and thus protects the wearer and the people around them.  The role of the cloth mask is largely that of source control — that is, to prevent you from transmitting the virus to others if you are infected.  A growing body of evidence supports the idea that a cloth face covering will cut down on COVID-19 transmission. This includes:  A review of 172 studies worldwide from the medical journal The Lancet found that face mask use could result in ""a large reduction"" in risk of infection A study of Mass General Brigham, the largest health care system in Massachusetts, found that rates of positivity among workers dropped after a universal mask policy was implemented  Researchers at Texas A&M University compared trends in China, Italy and New York City and found that wearing a face mask reduced the number of infections by tens of thousands in Italy and New York A laboratory study that visualized droplets with laser lighting as people spoke found that the trajectory of the droplets nearly disappeared when the person wore a face covering  A CDC study that found two Missouri hairdressers who wore masks while working with clients and diagnosed with COVID-19 shortly after did not pass the virus on to any of the clients who had been exposed  What about the other way around? Do masks protect you from others? For cloth mask wearers, research is less clear on this front, but evidence is growing here, too.  For example, a new paper led by a professor at the University of California, San Francisco and set to be published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine asserts that people wearing a mask will take in fewer coronavirus particles, making it easier for their immune systems to seek out and stamp out the ones that do get in.  As evidence about masks reducing infections has grown, leaders who previously decried their use have now shifted their tone. In Texas, for example, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott instituted a statewide mask mandate as cases spiked after previously resisting such an order. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, issued a similar mandate in July, after saying in May that a statewide order wouldn’t work. And President Donald Trump, another Republican, endorsed masks on July 21 after months of critiquing their use. The sources Schraa has linked to in online conversations about mask usage include stories from SOTT.net, which has landed on a list of sites found to be publishing misinformation about the coronavirus, and a video featuring an Infowars host on the website banned.video.  The sources that back up claims of mask effectiveness, stem from large research universities, prominent labs and medical journals, and the CDC.  In a critique of local governments’ ability to require people to wear masks, Schraa said that masks are ""proven ineffective"" at cutting down transmission of the coronavirus.  But a growing number of studies — and a growing consensus among leaders, including President Trump — have shown the opposite to be true. We rate the claim False.  ",/factchecks/2020/jul/30/michael-schraa/wisconsin-gop-lawmaker-wrong-masks-have-been-prove/

As we’ve reported, regarding a possible vaccine: Worldwide, as of early July, there were roughly 160 vaccine projects under way worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Scientists are expressing cautious optimism that a vaccine can be ready to go by the late spring of 2021, although it’s unclear how much longer it would take to distribute the vaccine widely. Five possible vaccines, including one being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and Cambridge, Mass.-based biotechnology firm Moderna, are in phase 3 clinical trials; once those trials are completed, they would be candidates for approval. Another 12 vaccines have begun phase 2 trials. And more than 100 other vaccines that haven’t begun clinical trials are in the pipeline. No COVID-19 vaccine trials in Ukraine are listed in the federal ClinicalTrials.gov database, which tracks privately and publicly funded clinical studies conducted around the world; and none are listed in the ISRCTN registry, another global research registry. The article claims that, using a vaccine that had not been tested on people in the United States, American virologists tested residents in the area of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. A spokesman for what was identified as the People’s Militia of the LPR was quoted as saying that of 15 people tested, five died ""from complications caused by the infection.""  Of the 15 allegedly tested, 10 were said to be from the Ukrainian military, as were four of the dead.

How many Texans can’t access health insurance coverage during the pandemic?
","After a primary campaign extended by the coronavirus, MJ Hegar was selected by Democratic voters in Texas to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in November. Hegar celebrated her primary election win with a virtual victory party hosted on Facebook, with appearances from state officials and members of the Texas Democratic Party. During the event, Hegar talked about the coronavirus and its impact in Texas, stating that ""we had a health care crisis in this state before COVID-19."" ""Before the pandemic, nearly 1 in every 5 was without access to health care coverage,"" Hegar said. ""And now: 1 in 3. Nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don’t have access to health care insurance because of the record unemployment and because of our health care model that is failing Texas."" Texas consistently ranks as the state with the highest uninsured rates, but is Hegar right about the number of people without insurance coverage during the coronavirus pandemic? Pre-pandemic insurance levels Hegar’s campaign shared multiple news articles about Texans without health insurance published before and during the pandemic, including recent reporting from the Houston Chronicle highlighting how job losses are leading to a growing population of uninsured Texans. Let’s start with the rate of uninsured Texans before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The Kaiser Health Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research organization, publishes state health facts using detailed data from the Census Bureau, including the insurance status of people under 65 in Texas. More than 4.8 million people under 65 are uninsured — about 19.9% of the population that age, or about 1 in 5 people, according to the latest Census Bureau data published in 2019. Of those Texans who are insured, about 66% are covered through their employer and 21.6% are covered by Medicaid. Texas is one of 13 states that has not expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which allows people between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (considered middle class) to receive tax credits to offset the cost of insurance plans purchased through an online marketplace. The act also grants free coverage under Medicaid to anyone earning less than 138% of the federal poverty level (which this year is $26,200 for a family of four) in states that have opted to expand the program. Since Texas has not expanded the program, eligibility requirements for the program are more strict and are not based solely on income. In order to qualify, a person must have an annual income below a certain threshold ($51,876 for a family of four) and be pregnant, be a parent or caretaker of children, have a disability or a family member with a disability or be 65 years or older. Pandemic insurance levels Since Texas first shut down segments of the economy to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the unemployment rate has fluctuated, spiking to a record 13.5% in April before falling to 8.6% in June. For comparison, in June of 2019 the unemployment rate in Texas was 3.4%. As people lost their jobs, many also lost their health insurance coverage. The actual calculation of the number of people without coverage is a moving target, as people find new jobs or secure coverage elsewhere after becoming unemployed. But two national studies show that between 650,000 and 1.6 million Texans could have lost coverage since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. In May, the Kaiser Health Foundation released a report estimating the number of people losing job-based health insurance coverage during the pandemic and how many of those individuals are eligible for coverage through Medicaid or through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace tax credits. Nationally, the report estimates that as many as 26.8 million people will become uninsured, including workers, adult dependents and children. Of those, the report estimates that half are eligible for coverage through Medicaid and others through tax credits. In Texas, that report estimates that 1.6 million people will lose insurance coverage, which would bring the state’s uninsured rate to about 26.5% for people under 65 — or about 1 in 4 people without health insurance coverage. But these figures don’t speak exactly to Hegar’s claim, which is about the number of people who ""don’t have access to insurance.""  Even though Texas has opted not to expand Medicaid coverage to people with incomes below the poverty line, the report states that unemployment benefits and the temporary $600 weekly payments approved by Congress are likely to push annual income for many of these unemployed workers to levels that would make them eligible for Medicaid coverage in Texas. This means they will be able to access Medicaid coverage and marketplace tax credits for the remainder of the calendar year. Other people who lose coverage could switch to insurance offered through a spouse’s or parents’ employer and others may qualify for coverage but opt not to enroll, according to the report. So even though an estimated 1 in 4 Texans will now be without health insurance coverage, the actual number of people who are uninsured and ""don’t have access to healthcare insurance"" is likely even lower. A July report from Families USA, a research and advocacy non-profit that supports policies that make healthcare more accessible, offers a closer estimate.  The report tried to pin down the number of uninsured adults who would be unable to obtain new health insurance coverage after losing employment during the coronavirus pandemic. The report estimates that about 5.4 million people across the country became uninsured after losing their jobs between February and May of this year and could not find new coverage. In Texas, an estimated 659,000 adult workers lost insurance coverage after losing jobs and could not find coverage elsewhere, bringing the rate of uninsured adults in the state at the end of May to 29%, or about 1 in 3 adults, the report found. But these figures are just about workers, and don’t account for children and other dependents who may have been covered by another adult’s health insurance plan through an employer, which means the total number of people who are uninsured is likely higher than this estimate. Our ruling Hegar said 1 in 5 Texans did not have health insurance coverage before the pandemic, and now ""nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don’t have access to health care insurance."" Hegar is right about how many Texans under 65 were previously uninsured. The number of Texans without access to health insurance during the pandemic is harder to pin down, but her ""nearly 1 in 3"" remark reflects the latest available estimates. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2020/jul/30/mj-hegar/how-many-texans-cant-access-health-insurance-cover/

Who are the officers detaining protesters in Portland?
","Federal officers have detained people protesting against police brutality in Portland, Ore. But some Facebook users say they’re not who they claim to be. ""Word on the street: Portland goon squads were Blackwater contractors not federal officers,"" wrote one Facebook user on July 20. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar versions have been shared thousands of times over the past couple of weeks, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool owned by Facebook. Portlanders have been protesting against police brutality since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in late May. In mid-July, reports started to surface that federal law enforcement agents were using unmarked cars to detain protesters. Videos show demonstrators being whisked away by camouflaged agents and beaten with batons. (Screenshot from Facebook) But how do we know they’re federal officers — and does Blackwater have anything to do with what is unfolding in Portland? PolitiFact took a look. The Department of Homeland Security sent law enforcement teams to Portland as part of the federal government’s response to ongoing protests over police brutality. President Donald Trump has announced plans to send additional forces to Chicago and Albuquerque, N.M. As of now, there is no publicly available evidence that Academi, a private military company previously known as Blackwater, is standing in for federal agents. First, let’s look at what’s happening on the ground in Portland. The forces are part of new ""rapid deployment teams"" that Homeland Security formed in response to a June 26 executive order from Trump, which instructs federal agencies to provide ""personnel to assist with the protection of federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property."" The teams are backing up the Federal Protective Service, which is tasked with guarding federal property. Rapid deployment teams are made up of personnel from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, and Customs and Border Protection, according to the New York Times. The U.S. Marshals Service also has officials in Portland.  Stephanie Malin, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection, told PolitiFact in an email that the agency ""has only sworn agency personnel deployed in Portland."" The Coast Guard told us in an email that it has not deployed any personnel to Portland to address civil unrest. We reached out to Homeland Security and ICE for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Despite what the Facebook post says, there are federal officials in Portland. But what about Academi, formerly known as Blackwater? We found no publicly available evidence that the private military company is part of the federal government’s ""rapid deployment teams."" Blackwater was founded in 1997 by former Navy SEALs, providing contract security globally.  During the Iraq War, the company won more than $1 billion in contracts with the U.S. government. It gained notoriety in 2007, when a group of its employees killed 17 Iraqi civilians and injured 20 in Baghdad’s Nisour Square.  The guards, who were working for the U.S. State Department at the time, mistakenly thought they were under attack by insurgents. In 2015, four of the guards were sentenced in a U.S. court. Blackwater rebranded twice before a group of private investors purchased its North Carolina training facility in 2010. The new company, Academi, is now owned by a holding company called Constellis. Public documents show that Academi has a contract with the federal government to provide security training for law enforcement and first responders. Three related companies — the Centerra Group, Omniplex and American K-9 Detection Services — also have contracts with the federal government, two of which are to provide ""protective service occupations,"" which can include security guards. RELATED: The federal government crackdown in Portland: What you need to know The Federal Protective Service oversees more than 13,000 contract security guards who ""conduct security screenings at federal buildings,"" according to a 2015 Homeland Security fact sheet. Those contracts made up about 70% of the FPS budget during the 2015 fiscal year. However, public officials have made no public statements about using defense contractors in lieu of federal agents to quell protests in Portland. And we could find no news reports or public documents that say that’s the case. We reached out to Constellis for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. A Facebook post claims that officers detaining protesters in Portland are from Academi, not the federal government. We found no publicly available evidence to support that claim. Homeland Security personnel have been sent to Portland amid ongoing protests against police brutality. Officials say they are backing up the Federal Protective Service to defend public property. The FPS does have thousands of contract security guards. Academi has a contract with the federal government to provide security training for law enforcement officers and first responders, and two related companies have contracts to provide security personnel.  But we could find no statements from public officials, public documents or news reports about the government using contractors in lieu of federal agents to quell protests in Portland. There may well be Academi-linked contractors defending federal buildings in the city, but the Facebook post said they are standing in for federal officers. That claim is inaccurate, and we rate it False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/29/facebook-posts/who-are-officers-detaining-protesters-portland/

No evidence toxic masks are being sent in the mail, but watch out for ‘brushing’ scam

A spokesperson for the Better Business Bureau said in an email to PolitiFact on Nov. 10 that it has not received any ScamTracker reports recently regarding toxic masks.  The FBI’s website does not list any current consumer alerts about unsolicited packages or toxic masks.

The claim of an irritant in the masks in that 2020 post was unverified, Snopes said. We found no recent news reports in the U.S. of unsolicited masks coming from China. However, an October news report out of Britain suggested unsolicited packages had become a growing problem there. The story, which was also referenced in The Guardian, cited specific incidents that happened in October and December of 2020 and May of this year. Amazon did not return a request for comment, but its customer service page urges users to report unsolicited packages and said that it ""investigates reports of ""brushing"" and will take action on bad actors that violate our policies.""  A search of Amazon’s customer service Twitter account @AmazonHelp shows responses to several recent customer reports of unsolicited packages.

Iowa is 45th for internet connectivity, Axne says
","After Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act on Nov. 5, U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne, D-Iowa, wrote in a tweet that her vote for the bill would change Iowa’s ranking as 45th in the nation for internet connectivity. The bill includes a $550 billion package to fund transportation, broadband and utilities across the country. Specifically, $65 billion is to be spent expanding internet connectivity. At minimum, $100 million is to go to each state, while $42 billion is to be spent on underserved areas.  Axne tweeted after the House vote: ""Iowa ranks 45th in the U.S. for internet connectivity. Yesterday, I voted to change that forever – by sending the largest rural broadband investment in history to the President’s desk. #IA03"" Saying Iowa ranks poorly for internet connectivity can be used as a political tool to explain a ""yes"" vote on the bipartisan but also controversial infrastructure bill. But, the statistic also can be used to push points about political opponents who voted ""no,"" which Democrats are doing to Republicans who opposed the bill. All of Iowa’s Republicans in Congress voted ""no"" except for Sen. Chuck Grassley, who voted ""yes"" when the Senate approved the bill in August. Ian Mariani, communications director for Axne, wrote in an email to PolitiFact that the tweet was referencing a report by BroadbandNow.com. The website reports Iowa’s average state-wide speed as 74.3 megabits per second. Only 18.5 percent of Iowa’s residents have low-price plan access. The website ranks Iowa as 45th in the U.S., for state broadband access, the report said. BroadbandNow.com pulls its data from the Federal Communications Commissions and the U.S. Census Bureau. Axne used the source because it ranks states specifically, Mariani said in a phone interview with PolitiFact. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds also mentioned Iowa ranking 45th in the nation when introducing her plan to increase broadband access in her second term as governor. She said Iowa also has the second slowest internet in the U.S. and cited BroadbandNow.com in a post on her website.  Reynolds announced her commitment to the expansion of broadband in Iowa at her January 2021 Condition of the State Address.  All six Iowans who make up the state’s Washington delegation, including the four voting no on the infrastructure bill, have said they support broadband expansion.  Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, wrote in an Iowa Torch article in May that she supports and wants to move forward with broadband initiatives. Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, joined the Congressional Rural Broadband Caucus in February to call for internet expansion across the country. His first action in the caucus was to help write a letter to President Joe Biden advocating for broadband expansion. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, called on her campaign website for expanded internet connectivity, especially in rural America. And, both Grassley and Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, have worked with other members of Congress to advocate for broadband in the past year.  The U.S. Census Bureau reported between 2015 and 2019, 80.8% percent of Iowa households had broadband internet subscriptions. Sixteen states had a smaller percentage of its households with subscriptions, including Missouri, Indiana, and North and South Dakota.  The FCC reported nearly one-fourth of the population in rural America lacks access to broadband service. Across the country, 14.5 million people are impacted. Axne tweeted, claiming Iowa was the 45th state in the country for internet connectivity.  Various sources confirm Iowa falls behind other states, including BroadbandNow.com ranking the state as 45th for state broadband access in comparison to the rest of the United States.  Axne’s claim of Iowa’s U.S. ranking for broadband connectivity is confirmed through reliable sources, so we rate it True. ",/factchecks/2021/nov/12/cindy-axne/iowa-45th-internet-connectivity-axne-says/

CDC study on COVID-19 vaccination and spontaneous abortions did not contain major error
","For many months, vaccine skeptics have been sounding false alarms about the effect of COVID-19 vaccines on pregnancy and fertility. Concerns about the risk of spontaneous abortion, also known as miscarriage, have resurfaced following a November report in Science, Public Health Policy & the Law, a journal run by James Lyons-Weiler. ""Report Finds Increased Risk of Spontaneous Abortion Following COVID-19 Vaccination During Pregnancy,"" reads the headline on a post from Lyons-Weiler, who seeks to summarize the report’s findings. ""Epidemiologists Find CDC Study Contains Major Error."" Lyons-Weiler, whose claims about COVID-19 we have previously fact-checked, claims in his piece that the authors of the report found a ""major error"" in a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June. The miscarriage rate, the authors asserted, was seven to eight times higher than the CDC study presented. The authors' calculations, however, misrepresent the CDC study findings by manipulating and cherry-picking data, using a similar method to previously circulating claims on social media about the same CDC study. The blog post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The authors of the original CDC study, titled ""Preliminary Findings of mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine Safety in Pregnant Persons,"" used data from three federal reporting systems monitoring vaccine safety. They contacted 3,958 people enrolled in one of these systems about three months after they had received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Of those people, 712 had given birth to healthy babies, 104 experienced miscarriages and one had a stillbirth. Ten people had ectopic pregnancies or induced abortions. The remaining 3,131 participants were either still pregnant or had not yet completed follow-up. They found 104 miscarriages out of 827 completed pregnancies, which divides to a 12.6% miscarriage rate — comparable with the average miscarriage rate of 12.5% to 18.7% in the general population. The authors of the report in Lyon-Weiler's journal claim that this figure is incorrect, presenting alternative calculations that result in a much higher miscarriage rate of 82% to 91%. They arrived at these figures by using the same flawed method that was used in social media posts that we saw circulating in July. Those posts, which we fact-checked, had excluded 700 people vaccinated in the third trimester, when fetuses are more developed and the risk of miscarriage is reduced. Likewise, the authors excluded 700 people who were vaccinated after 20 weeks of pregnancy, the cutoff period that defines miscarriage. This left just 127 completed pregnancies. The 104 miscarriages out of 127 pregnancies amounted to 82%. This 82%, however, is not the miscarriage rate. Determining the effects of vaccination early in pregnancy means looking only at people who were vaccinated before 20 weeks, but it’s misleading to apply the narrow denominator of 127 to the preliminary data in the NEJM paper. ""[Y]ou can’t do that because the data set is looking at all pregnancy outcomes,"" said Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB-GYN, in a blog post. ""Of course when you remove those 700 pregnancies the miscarriage rate looks artificially high, because the only way a person got into the data set … was if the pregnancy had ended and they had been vaccinated."" Likewise, the upper range of their estimate, 91%, used a denominator that only counted people with loss of pregnancy. This included 104 people who had spontaneous abortions and 10 people who had ectopic pregnancies or induced abortions, essentially dividing the number of miscarriages by itself. Determining the frequency of a certain outcome (i.e., miscarriages) using a sample that grossly overrepresents that outcome necessarily produces an inflated figure that cannot be applied to the general population. A more precise assessment of whether vaccination before the third trimester increases miscarriage rates would require following these pregnancies to completion. ""These pregnancies will eventually form the denominator to look at vaccination in the first and second trimesters, but these pregnancies have to end and all data needs to be collected before they can be used,"" said Gunter. ""There is no conspiracy to hide miscarriages here, just an abuse of statistics,"" said Gunter. Since the CDC study was originally published, more data has become available. The authors of the CDC study have both acknowledged that there was an error in the denominator that they used, because it included people vaccinated after the 20-week cutoff. They published another paper on Oct. 14 with updated data that now included 2,456 pregnant people. They found that the cumulative miscarriage risk for those at 6 to 20 weeks of pregnancy was 14.1%, which is still comparable to the average miscarriage rate in the general population. Other studies corroborate these findings. A September paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association analyzed 105,446 pregnancies drawn from medical record data from eight health systems in the U.S. and found no increased risk for miscarriage following vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC issued an urgent health advisory on Sep. 29 strongly recommending COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant and recently pregnant people, noting their increased risk of severe illness. An April multinational study found that people at any stage of pregnancy or delivery who contract COVID-19 are 22 times more likely to die than those without COVID-19, and their newborns are twice as likely to require intensive care or die after birth. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also updated its guidelines on Nov. 3, 2021, to recommend that pregnant and recently pregnant people receive a COVID-19 booster dose. A blog post claims that a new report had found a major error in a CDC study, alleging that the miscarriage rate for pregnant people who received the COVID-19 vaccine was several times higher than presented in the study. The authors of the report, however, arrived at these figures by cherry-picking and manipulating data from the CDC study, and failing to account for all completed pregnancies.  The CDC study has since published follow-up data that supports its original findings that there is no increased risk of miscarriage following COVID-19 vaccination.

Steil’s claim that Biden admin will pay out $450,000 to illegal immigrants is lacking information
","Immigration and families separated at the border have once again bubbled to the top of political conversation -- and the debate is as partisan and divisive as ever. On Oct. 28, 2021, U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Janesville, sent out this tweet: ""Our border is wide open and now (President Joe) Biden is in talks to pay illegal immigrants $450,000. This is unbelievable.""  Is the Biden administration really in talks to pay out $450,000 to illegal immigrants? Let’s just say it’s far more complicated than the tweet suggests. Steil’s tweet includes a link to a Wall Street Journal article from Oct. 28, 2021, and an image of an excerpt, with $450,000 circled. The article covers the fact the U.S. is in talks to pay settlements of ""around $450,000 a person"" to resolve lawsuits filed on behalf of parents and children that were separated at the border during the Trump administration.  Those lawsuits -- and the fact federal taxpayers may be on the hook for major payouts if the government loses -- were not mentioned in Steil’s claim. When asked for backup for the claim, Steil’s office simply pointed us to the same article. Let’s look at what happened.  About 5,500 children were separated from their parents at the southern border under President Donald Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" policy, mainly in spring 2018, according to an Oct. 28, 2021 New York Times report.  Under the Trump-era policy, thousands of children ranging from infants to teens were taken from their parents, with no provisions to later reunite them. During their time away from their families, many children suffered from issues including heat exhaustion, malnutrition, freezing temperatures and a lack of medical attention.  The family separation policy was a key component of the administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, aimed at deterring people from coming to the U.S.  The policy also affected families that were legally entitled to asylum due to persecution in their home countries. So, in those cases, the families were not ""illegal immigrants"" at all, but people who followed the protocols for seeking asylum.  Under the policy, Border Patrol agents charged parents with illegally entering the U.S., imprisoned them and placed their children in government-licensed shelters around the country, the New York Times report said. In early summer 2018, a judge ordered the government to rescind the policy, but government officials then struggled to reunite families.  Lawsuits filed regarding the border separations have described mental-health problems for the children, resulting from the trauma of not having their parents during months of hard conditions, the Wall Street Journal report said.  Justice department lawyers have been working to settle the cases, and Biden has assembled a task force made up of representatives of the departments of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services and State, to reunite migrant families that remained separated and determining how to make amends for the harm caused by the policy, according to the New York Times.  All of that said, the final payment figures are far from clear -- as is the question of when the various lawsuits will be resolved, be it through settlements or at trial. According to the Wall Street Journal report, sources said families could receive payments close to $1 million in payments -- $450,000 per family member impacted by the policies -- but final numbers could shift. Many families, the article said, would likely get smaller payouts, depending on their circumstances. The total potential payout could be $1 billion or more.  In theory, if the cases were lost in court, the payouts could be higher. Only a minority of the families may be eligible for financial compensation, according to the Times report, because many impacted families have not filed complaints, perhaps for fear of reprisal from the government, the Times report said. Even Biden himself has weighed in on the payments, with his staff saying that he is comfortable with a settlement with families now in litigation, according to a Nov. 7, 2021 Politico report, though he has seemingly expressed disagreement with the $450,000 figure. Steil claimed that the federal government ""is in talks to pay illegal immigrants $450,000.""  But that vastly oversimplifies what is happening. The potential payments are the result of the Trump-era policy that saw thousands of children separated from their parents after crossing the southern border. And in some cases the families involved applied legally for asylum, and are not ""illegal immigrants"" at all. While the actual amount for the payouts is still under negotiation, some sources say that individuals could receive $450,000 or more. But that number is far from certain, and only a small percentage of the 5,500 families affected have filed claims. We rate this claim Half True. While it is partially accurate, it leaves out important details or takes things out of context.   ",/factchecks/2021/nov/12/bryan-steil/steils-claim-biden-admin-will-pay-out-450000-illeg/

No scientific basis for claims of ivermectin’s success in Uttar Pradesh, India

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A similar headline from Gateway Pundit, a conservative U.S. site, said: ""HUGE: Uttar Pradesh, India Announces State Is COVID-19 Free Proving the Effectiveness of ""Deworming Drug"" IVERMECTIN.""  Claims regarding the supposed success of ivermectin in preventing COVID-19 in India have been around for months, and have recently popped up again as India’s case numbers subside. India stopped recommending the use of ivermectin for management of the virus in September, citing a lack of scientific evidence of its benefits. In the U.S. The FDA has approved ivermectin for use in humans for treating such things as parasitic worms, head lice and rosacea, but advises against taking it to prevent or treat the coronavirus.  Uttar Pradesh, which is India’s most populous state, with more than 200 million people, reported on Nov. 7 that it had just 85 active COVID cases, according to the Times of India. More than 67% of the eligible population had received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 22% were fully vaccinated. The government has credited its success to using ivermectin as a preventive measure, according to an article in the Indian Express in May.    But is their low case count credible? And does it have anything to do with ivermectin?  We spoke with Dr. Lee Riley, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of California Berkeley, who said that there is no peer-reviewed randomized control study that shows that ivermectin is the reason why cases are going down in Uttar Pradesh. Any study would have to include a placebo group, and control for other measures, such as use of masks and social distancing, which Uttar Pradesh was using, he said.  Confirmed COVID cases are down in India, and in other places, Riley said, but he questioned how widely Uttar Pradesh is testing. If there are fewer tests, there will be fewer recorded cases.   Asked about claims that Uttar Pradesh’s low case numbers were due to ivermectin, Riley said said that there would be no biological reason why the drug would be effective at preventing the disease, but not in treating it, as studies have shown. No other place in the world has shown that ivermectin is effective at preventing COVID-19, Riley said.   Another medical doctor has researched claims of ivermectin’s success, both scientific and anecdotal, and found them lacking.   Dr. Nick Mark, who works with critical care and pulmonary patients at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, has examined claims that ivermectin has had dramatic success in Uttar Pradesh.  ""This is not even remotely the case,"" he said during a lecture with other doctors on Oct. 15. While there are claims that the state began using ivermectin in May 2021, during the height of India’s COVID-19 crisis, the government actually said it began giving the drug in August 2020.  ""Not only did it not hasten the end of that alpha wave, but it didn’t prevent the delta wave,"" Mark said.  Mark cited research where scientists looked at data for all deaths in India, and found that certain populous districts in Uttar Pradesh had no reported deaths at all for several months.  ""So either you have to believe that ivermectin prevents you from dying of everything — car crashes, cancer, homicide, suicide — or, that the data is just garbage and you can’t interpret it,"" he said.   The New York Times documented problems with India’s COVID-19 data in September, and found that political considerations interfered with open scientific inquiry.  The Indian Council of Medical Research, funded by India’s government, had recommended use of ivermectin for COVID-19 in May, but revised its guidance months later. Indian health authorities warned that the risk of bias is high in studies claiming that ivermectin is beneficial for COVID patients.  A review of available research published in Cochrane Library in July found that the available reliable evidence ""does not support the use of ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID‐19 outside of well‐designed randomized trials."" In May, PolitiFact checked a  similar claim, that COVID-19 cases dropped in India after the government promoted ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, and ruled it Mostly False. The government did promote use of those drugs, and cases did fall, though the relationship between those events is unproven.  Health Feedback, a member of the International Fact-checking Network at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, found that there was no evidence of a causal relationship between the use of ivermectin and declining COVID case counts in Uttar Pradesh. The site found that other factors likely helped reduce case counts, including immunity from previous infection, vaccination and lockdowns.  Claims that Uttar Pradesh reduced its COVID-19 case count by using ivermectin have spread on social media.  While cases appear to have fallen in Uttar Pradesh, it’s not clear why. There is no scientific, randomized controlled study showing that ivermectin led to a reduction in the spread of the virus in Uttar Pradesh. The available research regarding the drug’s use to prevent or treat the virus is either unreliable or inconclusive. Scientists have said that more study is necessary.  We rate this claim False.    ",/factchecks/2021/nov/12/facebook-posts/no-scientific-basis-claims-ivermectins-success-utt/

Biden botches claim about Virginia elections
","President Joe Biden recently flubbed Virginia history while trying to avoid blame for Democrat Terry McAuliffe’s loss to Republican Glenn Youngkin in the Nov. 2 gubernatorial election. ""No governor in Virginia has ever won when...he or she is the same party as the sitting president,"" Biden, a Democrat, said during a Nov. 3 news conference.  No doubt, it’s been a very reliable trend for 44 years that Virginians in their odd-year gubernatorial races elect the candidate from the opposite party of the president. Usually, there’s some dissatisfaction with the incumbent president that plays a role in the gubernatorial election. And the party that lost the presidential election a year earlier is often highly motivated for the gubernatorial race.  But the trend is not etched in stone. McAuliffe bucked it in 2013 when he was elected governor while Democrat Barack Obama was in the White House.  You have to go back to 1973 to find the previous time it happened. Republican Richard Nixon was president and Mills Godwin, a longtime Democrat who defected to the GOP, was elected governor. In 1969, while Nixon was in the first year of his presidency, Linwood Holton became the first Republican to win Virginia’s governorship in 100 years. Until 1969, Virginia had been dominated since the end of Reconstruction by a segregationist Democratic Party that won 21 straight gubernatorial elections dating to 1885. Eleven times during that span, they were elected with fellow Democrats holding the presidency. Biden said, ""No governor in Virginia has ever won when...he or she is the same party as the sitting president."" He’s wrong. Although it’s been extremely rare in the last 44 years for Virginia to elect a governor of the president’s party, it did happen in 2013. And it was quite common prior to 1977.  We rate Biden’s statement False.  ",/factchecks/2021/nov/12/joe-biden/biden-botches-claim-about-virginia-elections/

Dennis Prager’s Pants on Fire claim that it was ‘inconceivable’ that gay men were seen as ‘pariahs’
","The coronavirus pandemic has brought back discussion of an earlier pandemic: The AIDS crisis of the 1980s. Dennis Prager, a conservative commentator, said in a Nov. 8 interview with Newsmax that it was ""inconceivable"" that gay men would have been seen as ""pariahs"" during the AIDS crisis. Prager said, ""During the AIDS crisis, can you imagine if gay men and intravenous drug users … had they been pariahs the way the non-vaccinated are? But it would've been inconceivable""  Dennis Prager: ""During the AIDS crisis, can you imagine if gay men and intravenous drug users...had they been pariahs the way the non-vaccinated are? But it would've been inconceivable"" pic.twitter.com/GQsOq4X63u Prager did not respond to an inquiry for this article. But we checked with multiple historians of the period and each was mystified by the characterization that the AIDS epidemic somehow spared gay men and intravenous drug users from being treated as outcasts. Gay men were pariahs in public opinion, under the law, in the media, and among government officials. Prager’s comment ""is entirely ahistorical and inconceivably upside down,"" said David France, a filmmaker and author of the book, ""How to Survive a Plague: The Story of How Activists and Scientists Tamed AIDS."" ""Willfully ignorant,"" said Eric Marcus, who addressed the first dozen years of the AIDS crisis in his audio memoir, MakingGayHistory.org. ""Utterly ridiculous,"" said Lillian Faderman, author of the 2016 book, ""The Gay Revolution: The Story of the Struggle."" Let’s walk through the evidence of how gay men, as well as intravenous drug users, were treated as pariahs during the years after 1981, when the virus that causes AIDS was first identified.  The pariah status was traceable to two distinct, but linked, beliefs.  One concerned AIDS itself. Initially, the disease was poorly understood and appeared to be a death sentence. Even after it became clear that the virus could only be passed only by close contact of bodily fluids, it took years for many Americans to become comfortable in proximity to people who had the virus. Charles Kaiser, the author of ""The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America,"" recalls the era as being ""a period of absolute terror"" for gay men. Kaiser said he was so worried about finding out that he might be infected that he refused to take a screening test for ""several years."" Only when his physician ran a test on him surreptitiously did he learn that he was negative. One public watershed came in 1987, when Diana, the Princess of Wales, was photographed shaking hands with an AIDS patient at Middlesex Hospital in London. ""She was the first famous person to be seen touching someone with AIDS in public,"" Kaiser said. ""That was six years of people with AIDS being literally untouchable."" The second source of the pariah status was the fact that AIDS hit gay men the hardest. While cultural acceptance of gays and lesbians began to increase in the 1970s, majorities of Americans remained uncomfortable with homosexuality, even among family members. For many, the AIDS crisis only reinforced negative perceptions. The pollster Gallup has twice asked the question, ""Do you feel that homosexuality should be considered an acceptable alternative lifestyle or not?"" In 1982, only 34% said it was acceptable, while 51% said it was not acceptable. When Gallup asked the question a decade later, only 38% said it was acceptable, while those who said it was not acceptable grew to 57%. Gallup also asked whether respondents thought ""gay or lesbian relations between consenting adults should or should not be legal."" In four surveys taken during the AIDS crisis — twice in 1986, once in 1987, and once in 1988 — the response ""should be legal"" attracted the support of only between 32% and 35%, while ""should not be legal"" ranged from 54% to 57%. Since then, sentiments have changed substantially. Earlier this year, Gallup asked the question, ""Do you think marriages between same-sex couples should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages?"" It found that 70% of respondents said such marriages should be recognized. Legal restrictions on gay men and lesbians weren’t just preferred by a majority of Americans; they actually existed in most places in the United States. In 1981, at the start of the AIDS crisis, ""gay sex was illegal — sodomy laws were not federally overturned until 2003,"" said Sarah Schulman, author of the 2021 book, ""Let the Record Show: A Political History of ACT UP New York, 1987-1993."" Even in comparatively liberal New York City, gays and lesbians had few codified legal protections until 1986, Schulman said. Also in 1986, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the right to consensual homosexual sex in the case Bowers vs. Hardwick, meaning that ""in the middle of a mass-death experience, laws against gay sex were upheld,"" Schulman said. Randy Shilts, one of the early chroniclers of the AIDS crisis and the late author of the book ""And the Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic,"" wrote that by the beginning of 1983, ""it was virtually an article of faith among homosexuals that they would somehow end up in concentration camps."" If this sounds overblown, Shilts countered that ""humans who have been subjected to a lifetime of irrational bigotry on the part of mainstream society can be excused for harboring unreasonable fears. The general apathy that the United States had demonstrated towards the AIDS epidemic had only deepened the distrust between gays and heterosexuals."" In 1986, fringe politician Lyndon LaRouche secured signatures from 700,000 California voters to place on the ballot a measure that would have made people with AIDS subject to being placed in quarantine camps.  ""The initiative was leading in the polls until a concerted effort was made by the gay community and it was defeated,"" Faderman said. Initially, many Californians ""saw absolutely nothing wrong"" with the idea, she said. Public commentators regularly raised alarms about AIDS and people who had it. In a 1983 opinion column in the New York Post, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan wrote that ""the poor homosexuals ... have declared war upon nature, and now nature is exacting an awful retribution."" He went on to write that homosexuals should be barred from food handling jobs and that the Democratic Party’s decision to hold its 1984 convention in San Francisco would expose delegates, spouses and children to ""homosexuals who belong to a community that is a common carrier of dangerous, communicable and sometimes fatal diseases."" Three years later, fellow conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr. wrote a column in the New York Times in which he urged that ""everyone detected with AIDS should be tattooed in the upper forearm, to protect common-needle users, and on the buttocks, to prevent the victimization of other homosexuals."" For a time early in his career, talk radio host Rush Limbaugh had a regular feature that mocked people dying of AIDS. He stopped the segments after a few weeks and acknowledged that he had ""missed the mark totally"" and that they were ""very insensitive to people who were dying,"" according to a biography of Limbaugh by Ze'ev Chafets. Sharp words had a real-world impact, Schulman said. In an era before hate crime laws, ""street violence against gay people, called ‘gay bashing,’ was a regular occurrence, and gay people had no authority figure to turn to for protection or response,"" she said. Deaths from AIDS skyrocketed between 1981 and 1993, reaching almost 40,000 a year. But the government’s response was slow. While part of this was due to the difficulty of tackling a newly emergent disease, there were widespread indications that government officials — all the way up to the White House — were initially lackadaisical in their response. Critics attributed this attitude to a broadly felt discomfort with homosexuality.   In 1982, reporter Lester Kinsolving asked President Ronald Reagan’s press secretary, Larry Speakes, about the epidemic at a White House press conference. ""I don't know a thing about it,"" Speakes said. When the reporter noted that the disease was becoming known as ""the gay plague,"" Speakes and reporters laughed. ""I don't have it. Do you?"" Kinsolving continued asking about AIDS in White House briefings over three years; at one point, Speakes joked about the reporter’s ""abiding interest"" in ""fairies.""   Reagan himself did not mention the word ""AIDS"" until the death of his old Hollywood friend Rock Hudson in 1985, Faderman wrote. Relations between the gay community and Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health were often tense, due to a perceived lack of aggressiveness of scientific research. RELATED VIDEO   Such anger prompted the creation of the activist group ACT UP, which pushed government and scientific institutions to act more aggressively. And on the local level, a lack of trust helped give birth to a parallel health and support system for gay Americans, especially those with AIDS. ""The most important evidence of how poorly gay men were treated in that era was that LGBT people had to form their own organizations in order to respond to the collective absence of the federal government, the medical profession, public authorities, and even the media to address the crisis,"" said Jim Downs, a Gettysburg College historian and author of the 2016 book ""Stand by Me: The Forgotten History of Gay Liberation."" In New York City, for instance, the Gay Men's Health Crisis started a ""buddy"" program to assign volunteers to people with AIDS, ""just to hang out with them and keep them company, or run basic errands,"" Schulman said. Marcus recalled that when he was a volunteer for the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, ""I could only find one funeral home in Manhattan that would take the body of my client who had died from complications of AIDS. That was in December 1984."" ACT UP also sought to change minds about intravenous drug users, another group that Prager cited in his Newsmax interview. Seeing calls to abstinence as ineffective, ACT UP promoted the new concept of ""harm reduction,"" which was ""based on the idea that ‘dead addicts cannot recover,’"" Schulman said. ACT UP also advocated for needle exchanges in New York City. Despite initial public opposition, the approach eventually gained support and is now common, if at times controversial, across the country. All told, institutions focused on AIDS and the needs of gay Americans ""emerged in virtually every community throughout the U.S.,"" Downs said. ""LGBT people had to address the crisis on their own. They had to alert the public, they had to provide comfort and care to patients, they sought therapeutics, and they raised money for scientific research."" The ""hero"" of the Reagan administration, Kaiser said, in reducing AIDS stigma was Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.  In 1986, Reagan asked Koop to prepare a report on AIDS, which he delivered in October of that year. It explained the disease and the risk factors in a nonjudgmental way, and it urged that if abstinence wasn’t a realistic option, condoms should be used to stay disease-free. ""We are fighting a disease, not people,"" Koop said. ""Those who are already afflicted are sick people and need our care, as do all sick patients. The country must face this epidemic as a unified society. We must prevent the spread of AIDS while at the same time preserving our humanity and intimacy."" Two years later, he sent the booklet ""Understanding AIDS"" to every household in the United States. Ultimately, the science improved to the point that having HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was no longer a death sentence. The first combination protease inhibitor, or AIDS"" drug cocktail,"" was unveiled in 1995 and became widely available the following year. ""If you were HIV-positive and had access to the medicine, you would survive,"" Kaiser said. Today, more than 1.2 million people are living with HIV in the U.S., and only a small fraction will die every year from AIDS. Historians said that the federal government learned significant lessons from the AIDS crisis that were applied to the coronavirus pandemic.  ""As soon as COVID-19 broke out, the government at all levels responded,"" Downs said. ""While some criticize how the government responded, or the fact that the federal government did not act as quickly or as effectively, the point was that COVID patients did not have to turn to street activism and public demonstrations to raise awareness that COVID was a crisis. The media, the medical professionals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization all articulated that it was a crisis immediately. That was not the case for HIV."" France agreed that Prager’s comparison between the AIDS crisis and the coronavirus pandemic is wrong and that there’s ""no moral equivalence."" ""People rejecting vaccine mandates do so by choice,"" he said. ""There are many regulations in modern life. All the other vaccines are also mandatory. Clothing is mandated by law. Licenses and related training courses and tests are mandated for driving, cutting hair, practicing medicine. Car insurance is a requirement. Some jobs require uniforms. All of these policies have rational bases. There are consequences for any infraction, just as there is for vaccine refusers.""  Prager said, ""During the AIDS crisis, can you imagine if gay men and intravenous drug users … had they been pariahs the way the non-vaccinated are? But it would've been inconceivable."" To suggest that gay men and intravenous drug users were not considered pariahs during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s is entirely inaccurate. The evidence of the opposite abounds: contemporary survey data on attitudes about homosexuality; the existence of laws against consensual gay sex; the near-passage of an AIDS quarantine law in California; calls by prominent commentators for banning HIV-positive people from certain jobs or even tattooing them; jokes about the disease by White House officials; and the need for the gay community to build their own institutions to grapple with the disease because existing institutions were insufficient.

No truth to claim that vaccination provides 'no added safety to the public'
","Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, who has 840,000 followers on Facebook, shared an image on Facebook that claims the general public does not benefit from people who are vaccinated against COVID-19. The image is of a tweet from conservative radio talk show host Joe ""Pags"" Paglilarulo that said, in part: ""Your health choices are your business.  There is no added safety to the public if you're vaccinated. Period."" Miller wrote, ""Right on Joe Pags! You are 100% right!"" in his post, which was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim is wrong. A person who is vaccinated does provide additional safety to the public. First and foremost, a person who gets vaccinated reduces the chances they will get or spread the disease. Vaccination has helped eradicate or substantially contain the spread of such communicable diseases such as smallpox, polio, measles and mumps.  ""Vaccination reduces one's risk of getting sick in the first place — one cannot transmit if one is not infected,"" said Dr. David Dowdy, an epidemiology and international health professor at Johns Hopkins University. ""It is generally accepted that vaccination reduces the risk of transmission to others. This is the impetus behind vaccination campaigns."" With COVID-19 vaccines in particular, the vaccines have been shown to reduce a person’s chances of both contracting and spreading the infection and of becoming seriously ill from the disease if they get a breakthrough infection. Unvaccinated people are more likely than the vaccinated to get COVID-19 and are more likely to spread it, according to a study led by the University of Oxford and one in China, in addition to being much more likely to become seriously ill or die. Another study in the Netherlands found that vaccinated people infected with the delta variant are 63% less likely to infect people who are unvaccinated. People who are vaccinated have shorter durations of infectiousness with COVID-19 than those who are unvaccinated, according to a study led by a Harvard researcher. The public-health benefit is clear, said Kent State University public health professor Tara Smith.  ""One, vaccinated individuals are less likely to contract an infection if exposed to virus,"" Smith said. ""Two, if vaccinated individuals do have a breakthrough infection, they are less likely to spread the virus to others than unvaccinated individuals. Three, if vaccinated with a breakthrough infection, they are less likely to have a serious outcome and need hospitalization, which protects the community by keeping those beds free for other illnesses and emergencies."" The CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines to people ages 5 and older as a safe and effective means of protection from serious short- and long-term complications and death: ""Getting everyone ages 5 years and older vaccinated can protect families and communities, including friends and family who are not eligible for vaccination and people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19."" Epidemiologist Joshua Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said ""there is pretty robust evidence that fully vaccinated people who are infected with SARS-Cov-2 can and do transmit to others at times, but the risk of that ongoing transmission is lower than if they had never been vaccinated.  This means there is a benefit to vaccination that extends beyond just protection of the individual in the form of reduced transmission risk to household members, co-workers and community members.""

Yes, it is possible for low-wage workers to be taxed into poverty
","After months and months of the ongoing debate over the various plans and proposals being considered in Washington D.C., it’s rare to see a new argument emerge. But in an Oct. 30, 2021 appearance on MSNBC, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, offered this case for supporting President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan. ""The framework is much more than a social safety net program,"" Moore said on ""Velshi,"" an MSNBC program hosted by author and finance correspondent Ali Velshi. ""I think these programs contribute as much to our growing economy as anything. What good is growth if we’re taxing our workers into poverty?"" Moore went on to say: ""If you’re a low-wage worker and you’re single and don’t have children, we’re literally taxing you into poverty."" Is Moore right? When asked to provide backup for the statement, Moore’s office directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a July 2020 report from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  The report focused on a provision in the plan that would temporarily extend the Earned Income Tax Credit to about 17 million low-wage workers. The report said, in part:  ""The federal tax code currently taxes about 5.8 million low-wage workers aged 19-65 into or deeper into poverty, because the payroll and (in some cases) federal income taxes they pay exceed any EITC they receive."" That’s generally on point, but does not cover the ""single"" and ""no children"" aspect of Moore’s claim. So, we reached out to other experts on the topic. Let’s start with the terms involved and some basic data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Labor, does not use the phrase ""low-wage worker."" However, the agency does publish an annual report and data on workers with hourly earnings at or below the prevailing Federal minimum wage. According to the February 2021 BLS Report:  In 2020, 73.3 million workers age 16 and older were paid on an hourly basis, or about 55.5 percent of all workers. About 1.1 million of those, or 1.5 percent, were paid at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. What’s more, according to the report, among workers paid an hourly wage, those who were single were more likely than married workers to earn the federal minimum wage or less.  And about 60 percent of those in the hourly-wage category worked in the hospitality industry, meaning bars, restaurants and food services. Low wages are common in these fields, in part because workers typically supplement their pay with tips.  When asked about Moore’s claim, Christopher Wimer, senior research scientist at Columbia University’s Center on Poverty & Social Policy, told us he would need more precise definitions for ""low-wage,"" ""worker"" and even ""single without children."" Since Moore’s statement did not address those details, Wimer, who conducts research on the measurement of poverty and disadvantage as well as historical trends in poverty, constructed his own measurement. He chose 2017 to 2019, because 2020 was an unusual year with COVID-19 job losses, stimulus payments and more. He defined low-wage as being in the bottom quartile -- that is the bottom 25% -- of annual income from wage and salary income (among those with at least some wage and salary income, so a ""worker""). Then he selected adults who lived with no other family members (including any children, so single with no children).  The bottomline: ""For those folks, their poverty rates are indeed higher after you use after-tax income.""  That is, about 49 percent fall under the poverty rate after taxes, but if you take out federal, state and payroll taxes, the figure would be more like 41 percent. Elaine Maag, a principal research associate in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said Moore's comment ""is not only plausible, but in limited contexts -- true."" Maag pointed out that in 2020, the official poverty threshold for a single person under age 65 with no children in the home was $13,465. (For a married couple younger than 65 with no children, the threshold was $17,331.) ""If I select a household with income just above that threshold, you can see that after tax, their income will be below $13,465,"" Maag said.  Moore said ""If you’re a low-wage worker and you’re single and don’t have children, we’re literally taxing you into poverty."" Moore, in her statement, did not define the terms she was using, but experts we talked to were able to create plausible scenarios and found that -- in at least limited scenarios -- she is on target.  For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2021/nov/11/gwen-moore/yes-it-possible-low-wage-workers-be-taxed-poverty/

Claim about Gavin Newsom’s reaction to a COVID-19 booster shot is conjecture
","A tech millionaire is floating an unsubstantiated theory that California’s governor experienced a rare illness after receiving a COVID-19 booster shot. Steve Kirsch posted an article Nov. 9 on Substack headlined, ""Gavin Newsom is out of sight likely because he has Guillain-Barre syndrome from his booster shot."" Within hours of publishing it, Kirsch changed the headline to remove the reference to Guillain-Barre and wrote instead that it was likely Bell's palsy. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Evidence does not support the claim that Gov. Gavin Newsom has either Guillain-Barre syndrome or Bell's palsy. We did not find any news reports about it by credible outlets, and the information Kirsch provided to support his theory is speculative and cites unnamed sources. Also, Newsom’s spokesperson told a media outlet that the governor did not have an adverse reaction to the vaccine. Guillain-Barre is a rare disorder in which the immune system attacks the body’s nerves. The single-shot Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine was linked to a tiny risk —  about 0.0008% — of being diagnosed with Guillain-Barre, according to the Cleveland Clinic. None of the other COVID-19 vaccines are associated with a risk of the illness. Newsom received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in April 2021 and a Moderna booster in October, his office reported. During the drug trial for the Moderna vaccine, Bell’s palsy, a type of facial paralysis, occurred in four of 30,000 participants. Later analysis showed that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines ""did not have a higher reported rate of facial paralysis than other viral vaccines,"" according to MedPage Today. Newsom received a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot on Oct. 27. A few days later, he canceled a planned trip to the United Nations climate change summit in Scotland, citing family obligations, and remained largely out of the public eye for more than a week. His lack of public appearances, unusual for him, fueled speculation and misinformation. During that time, however, Newsom did attend a high-profile wedding on Nov. 6, and his staff also said he was working at the state Capitol. On Nov. 9, he attended the California Economic Summit. Kirsch’s writing cited a changing list of factors to support his theory about the governor’s health. When he posted his initial version of the article with the headline about Guillain-Barre, it said he was relying on information such as Twitter reports of facial paralysis, a ""soft"" confirmation from a friend who ""absolutely"" knows Newsom; and information from Alex Jones, who runs a website known for disseminating fake news and conspiracy theories. ​​Later, when Kirsch changed the article headline to say he believed Newsom has Bell’s palsy, he provided a different list of factors influencing his theory. Those included a homegrown analysis of VAERS data that shows an elevated risk of Bell’s palsy after vaccination; his belief that Bell’s palsy is common after receiving the Moderna vaccine; and confirmation he received from ""someone who would absolutely know for sure."" He also wrote that his unnamed good friend ""knows people who are very close to the Governor who confirmed he was vaccine injured."" We contacted Kirsch for comment. In response, he provided two sets of screenshots of Newsom, taken from videos of the governor’s public appearances. One set, which Kirsch called ""Newsom before,"" shows the governor on June 16 as a guest on ""The Late Late Show with James Corden."" The second set of photos, which Kirsch called ""Newsom after,"" is from the governor’s first public appearance after being out of the public eye, on Nov. 9 at the California Economic Summit. In his Substack article, Kirsch wrote that he had shown the videos to an unidentified neurologist ""who said ‘100%’ (Newsom) is recovering from Bell’s palsy due to lingering ‘telltale’ signs."" Kirsch told PolitiFact in an email, ""I don’t think anyone came up with a hypothesis that is a better fit to all the data."" Kirsch founded a group called COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund, which had a promising start testing drugs that are FDA-approved for other diseases as treatments for COVID-19. But in the spring, the group’s entire scientific advisory board resigned, citing Kirsch’s ""alarming dangerous claims and erratic behavior,"" according to reporting by MIT Technology Review. A Substack article said, ""Gavin Newsom is out of sight likely because he has Guillain-Barre syndrome from his booster shot."" The article is based on speculation and conjecture and cites numerous unnamed sources, including doctors, making it impossible to replicate or verify the claim. We did not find any news reports about Newsom’s condition by credible outlets, and Newsom’s spokesperson told a media outlet that the governor did not have an adverse reaction to a COVID-19 booster.

Italy didn’t lower its COVID-19 death toll ‘by over 97%.’ The count exceeds 132,000
","It’s been well reported that the COVID-19 pandemic hit Italy hard and early. But some are claiming that the country’s struggles with the virus are fraudulent because it significantly lowered its COVID-19 death toll, putting it on par with the seasonal flu. ""Italy drastically reduced the country’s official Covid-19 death count by over 97%,"" a Facebook post said. ""This means Covid killed fewer people than…an average seasonal flu. 2020. The Year of the Fraud."" The post, which also features a headline by a website called ""Technology News & Trends,"" was shared by America’s Frontline Doctors, a group that became famous for voicing unproven, false and misleading claims about COVID-19.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is a misinterpretation of data. The Italian National Institute of Health didn’t lower its COVID-19 death toll by 97% — it released a detailed analysis on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients who have died in the country. A spokesperson with the agency called the claim ""completely wrong."" The Oct. 5 report detailed 130,468 COVID-19 deaths in the country up until that point. In one section, the report analyzed the cases of 7,910 people who died from COVID-19 in hospitals and looked for the most common comorbidities, meaning they had two or more health conditions at the same time.  That analysis found that 2.9% of the deceased COVID-19 patients had no comorbidities, 11.4% had one, 18% had two, and 67.7% had three or more. The conditions included heart disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity and autoimmune diseases.  This is where the distortion comes in. Of all the deaths, 97.1% had one or more conditions listed aside from COVID-19, while the other 2.9% had none.  Some have used this information to falsely claim that the Italian health department was ""lowering"" its COVID-19 death toll by 97% because those people had been previously diagnosed with other illnesses. But pre-existing conditions present a risk factor for people who contract COVID-19, and chronic diseases in the elderly population are common. The presence of another condition by itself isn’t evidence that a person didn’t die of COVID-19. The Italian National Institute of Health addressed these rumors in an Oct. 25 news release. The agency reiterated that the 2.9% figure, also reported in previous editions, refers to the percentage of patients who died after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and who had no other conditions diagnosed before infection.  ""The joint ISTAT-ISS reports drawn up on the basis of death certificates show that COVID-19 is the directly responsible cause of death in 89% of deaths of people positive to the SARS-CoV-2 test,"" the agency said in the release. ""In view of the fact that chronic diseases represent a risk factor for death from COVID-19 and that these are very common in the general population, it is not surprising the high frequency of these conditions in the SARS-CoV-2 positive deceased population."" ""This is completely wrong,"" Italian National Institute of Health spokesperson Mirella Taranto told PolitiFact via email. Taranto added that COVID-19 was the primary cause of death for the 130,468 people mentioned in the report. In those cases, ""even if a patient has previous illnesses,"" like hypertension, diabetes, or obesity, ""the virus is responsible for their death,"" she said. She pointed to the number of excess deaths in Italy as further proof. The same diseases were present in the population at similar levels both in 2019 and 2020, but according to Italy’s National Statistics Institute (ISTAT), the country registered more than 100,000 excess deaths in 2020—after the pandemic started. An interactive map maintained by the Italian Department of Civil Protection shows that Italy’s COVID-19 death toll currently stands around 132,500. A Facebook post claimed that Italy lowered its COVID-19 death toll ""by over 97%."" This is inaccurate and misconstrues a report by the Italian health department that highlighted the most common diseases that people already had when they died after being diagnosed with COVID-19.  Pre-existing conditions are a known risk factor for COVID-19, and the agency said its analysis shows that COVID-19 is the direct cause of death in 89% of people who test positive for the virus. We rate the claim False. UPDATE, Nov. 15, 2021: This fact-check has been updated to include comment from a spokesperson for the Italian National Institute of Health.

Schools aren’t giving kids the COVID-19 vaccine without parental consent
","Now that the U.S. has authorized Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 5-11, children across the country are getting vaccinated. But some people are claiming that schools can vaccinate kids without their parents’ consent. In a video by Infowars, a far-right conspiracy oriented website, host Harrison Smith said that by sending their kids to school, parents are giving schools ""implied consent"" to vaccinate their kids for COVID-19. ""They might send out a consent form and try to get you to sign it for your child,"" he said in the video. ""But even if you don’t sign it, you should know that sending your child to school that day is implied consent."" TikTok identified videos with similar claims as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) Smith cited a World Health Organization document that discussed implied consent for vaccinating kids. That’s a real document that describes three types of informed consent — written, verbal and implied — for kids to get vaccinated. For implied consent, the document says that parents are notified of upcoming vaccinations for their kids and that the presence of their kids at a vaccination session ""is considered to imply consent."" It says parents are expected to take steps — like not allowing their kids to go to school on a vaccination day — if they don’t want their kids to be vaccinated. But the Infowars video takes that WHO document out of context. For starters, the document is from 2014, long before the COVID-19 pandemic. It also isn’t meant to serve as binding rules for the world as the Infowars video suggests. Instead, it gives countries and states guidelines to consider when developing their own parental consent requirements. So WHO isn’t making the rules. Countries and states are. In the U.S., there’s no federal requirement for informed consent relating to vaccination, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But all of the states and Washington, D.C., have rules for parental consent for kids to get vaccinated. States do not use implied consent for vaccinations, said Stacey Lee, a public health professor at Johns Hopkins University. ""Implied consent is usually used for emergency-type situations, well-grounded in the U.S. value that we respect life, and that if you’re unconscious, you would want to live,"" said Lee. For vaccinations, states typically require that parents actively consent before their minor children can be immunized. Such consent requirements usually take the form of the parent providing verbal or written permission, though there are exceptions — for children who have been emancipated or who don’t live with a parent or guardian, for example. The age of consent for vaccinations varies by state, though most states put it at 18, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. In Wyoming, ""written parental consent is always required,"" a spokesperson for the Wyoming Department of Health told PolitiFact in an email. ""There is nothing like ‘implied consent’ here."" Kids under 18 in Wyoming need consent from at least one parent to get vaccinated, with some exceptions. In New York, parental consent for kids 16 and 17 can be given in person, over the phone and sometimes in a written statement. For kids 5-15, an adult caregiver also should be present for the  vaccination. Implied consent is not an option. ""Parents in New York State are not giving schools implied consent to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 by sending their children to school,"" a spokesperson for the New York Department of Health told PolitiFact in an email. While most states — including Wyoming and New York — require parental consent for kids under 18 to get the COVID-19 vaccine, a handful of states plus Washington, D.C., have variations on that requirement. A few states, such as Washington, adopted what is known as ""the mature minor doctrine,"" which allows providers to waive parental consent for minors deemed sufficiently mature. Others, like Oregon, have lower consent ages, from 14 to 16, while Nebraska puts it at 19. In Washington, D.C., the age of consent for vaccines is 11. There have been rare occasions when states haven’t adhered to their own parental consent requirements for vaccines. Louisiana requires parental consent for kids under 18 and has a COVID-19 vaccination consent form for parents to sign. But in late October, a Louisiana parent said her 16-year-old son was vaccinated without her consent at his school, where there was a mobile vaccination clinic. The clinic operator, Ochsner Health System, apologized and told the son’s school system that it was investigating the incident. The Infowars video cites a WHO document about parental consent to argue that U.S. schools are using implied parental consent to give kids COVID-19 vaccines.  The 2014 WHO document is guidance, not binding law. Countries, states and cities make the rules. And in the U.S., no states use implied consent for vaccinating kids.

Astroworld music festival venue has a capacity of 200,000, not 20,000
","Last week’s Astroworld music festival in Houston, where eight people died in a crush of fans, took place at a venue that was an appropriate size for the event, despite social media claims to the contrary. A viral Facebook post said event organizer Live Nation scheduled the 50,000-person Astroworld festival at a venue with a capacity of 20,000. The post also claimed that Live Nation was responsible for other supposed shortcomings at the event, including a lack of water stations and medical personnel. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The venue for the event, NRG Park, has a capacity of 200,000, based on fire codes. Despite the larger capacity, city officials limited attendance at the festival to 50,000, the city’s fire chief told the Associated Press. Anecdotal reports have emerged about a lack of water stations and medical personnel, but they have not been substantiated by Houston officials. NRG Park is a 350-acre complex with four facilities, including NRG Stadium that’s home to the Houston Texans NFL team. The park hosts concerts, exhibitions, sporting events and conventions, and its outdoor spaces are used for festivals, runs and sporting events. The Astroworld festival was held outdoors. Medical care for the festival was provided by a third-party contractor that was in charge of bringing in doctors, emergency medical technicians and others, Houston’s fire chief told local TV station KXAN. The fire chief said he could not determine yet whether the third-party vendor had sufficient resources on site. The multi-day Astroworld festival was created by rapper and festival headliner Travis Scott in 2018, following the release of his third album, also named Astroworld. The crowd surge occurred Nov. 5 during Scott’s performance. Scott has been arrested twice and charged with inciting riots at his concerts. He pleaded guilty to minor charges including reckless conduct and disorderly conduct, the New York Times reported. Live Nation, which reported $2.7 billion in revenue for its third quarter, is the world's largest live-event company. A viral Facebook post said event organizer Live Nation scheduled the 50,000-person Astroworld festival at a venue that has a capacity of 20,000. The venue has a capacity of 200,000, based on fire codes, and attendance was capped at 50,000.  The claim also said that the event lacked sufficient water stations and medical personnel, but those reports are anecdotal and have not been substantiated by city officials.

No, Ariz. Department of Education didn’t give ‘green light’ for mask mandates, critical race theory
","The Arizona Supreme Court upheld a lower-court decision that state laws banning mask mandates and limiting what schools can teach students about race were unconstitutional.  The Arizona Informer, a conservative publication, posted a letter about the case from the Arizona Department of Education on Instagram, and wrote that the department gave schools the ""green light on face mask and vaccine mandates, as well as implementing Critical (Race) Theory."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The letter posted by the Arizona Informer is real, but the post misrepresents the substance and impact of the letter. The state Supreme Court on Nov. 2, upheld a lower-court ruling from September, in which a judge said that Arizona legislators violated the title and single-subject rules in the state’s constitution (Article IV, Section 13) by adding unrelated bills to a series of budget bills.  Among the bills affected by the ruling were a ban on mask mandates and a ban on teaching critical race theory in schools. The state education department sent the letter simply to pass along information about the court rulings, and has no authority to give a green light to those policies, the agency wrote in an email to PolitiFact. RELATED VIDEO: The department does encourage mask wearing. Its website says: ""In accordance with the CDC and the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS), face coverings are recommended and encouraged for all individuals in K12 schools, regardless of vaccination status.""  The Associated Press reported that 29 school districts in Arizona had issued mask mandates before the laws were passed. Concerning critical race theory, the education department notes in teacher guidance on its website that the ban is no longer applicable, but it encourages teachers to use the ""best practices for standards-based instruction."" While the standards are adopted at the state level by the Arizona State Board of Education, it says, decisions on curriculum and instruction are made at the local level. An Instagram post said the Arizona Department of Education issued a letter giving schools a ""green light"" to impose mask mandates and teach critical race theory. An Arizona Supreme Court ruling voided state laws that barred school districts from enforcing mask mandates and teaching critical race theory.  The Arizona Department of Education letter informed schools of the ruling, but the agency didn’t give them the ""green light"" to implement mask mandates and teach critical race theory, and it didn’t have the authority to do so.

Ron Klain exaggerates improvements in employment, coronavirus death rate
","Just days after Democrats suffered a setback by losing the Virginia gubernatorial race, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain appeared on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" to paint a more optimistic picture for President Joe Biden and his party. On the Nov. 7 show, Klain favorably compared the administration’s stewardship of the economy and the coronavirus pandemic with that of his predecessor, Donald Trump. The Biden administration, Klain said, inherited gains of ""50,000 jobs a month. We're now finally back to 500,000 jobs a month. We inherited a country where 4,000 people a day were dying from COVID. That's now down 75%."" These two metrics have improved under Biden, but Klain exaggerated the numbers on the difference between the records of the two presidents. First, we looked at the monthly change in nonfarm employment during the five months prior to the first full jobs report on Biden’s watch. Those were September, October November, and December 2020, and January 2021. (Trump and Biden effectively shared responsibility for the January 2021 figures.) During one of those months — December 2020 — employment shrank, by 306,000 jobs. In the other four, employment increased, and by a lot more than 50,000. It rose by 716,000 in September 2020, 680,000 in October 2020, 264,000 in November 2020, and 233,000 in January 2021. All told, the average gain during those five months, even including the big drop in December, was a bit over 321,000 per month, or more than six times what Klain said. After Biden took office, the job gains did increase. From February 2021 to October 2021, the average monthly gain was 620,000, or almost twice the rate during Trump’s last five months.   The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but we suspect Klain’s comparison was based on initial job figures for January 2021 that were reported on Feb. 5. The initial figures suggested that jobs increased by only 49,000. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that tabulates the official employment data, revises the data in later months, so the final figures usually differ from the initial release. In this case, the BLS revised the January 2021 figure upwards from 49,000 to 233,000, or almost five times larger than the initial figure that Klain appeared to be citing. (The October 2021 gain of 531,000 that Klain touted will also be revised either downward or upward over the next few months.) Even if we use the initial January 2021 figure of 49,000, that would ignore some significantly stronger figures during the fall of 2020. The initial, unrevised employment gains released by the BLS were 661,100 in September; 638,000 in October; and 245,000 for November. Klain exaggerated the degree of improvement on COVID-19 as well. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data compiled by the Washington Post shows that the seven-day rolling average for daily coronavirus deaths on Jan. 20 — when Biden was sworn in — was 3,065. On Nov. 7, the day Klain appeared on ""Meet the Press,"" the equivalent figure was 1,185. That’s a decrease of 61%, or less than the 75% decline that Klain cited. Here, too, we think we know where Klain was getting his number. On Jan. 20, there were 4,400 coronavirus deaths. However, there are variations in when coronavirus deaths are reported, with the figures typically dropping on weekends when many public health offices are closed. So researchers recommend using a seven-day rolling average, which counts the previous seven days in order to smooth out the variations in data reporting. For this reason, it’s not unusual for a weekday — like Jan. 20, which was a Wednesday — to have a higher death total than the seven-day rolling average. In fact, the seven-day rolling average has never exceeded about 3,300 deaths per day during the entire pandemic. Klain said the Biden administration inherited gains of ""50,000 jobs a month. We're now finally back to 500,000 jobs a month. We inherited a country where 4,000 people a day were dying from COVID. That's now down 75%."" The Biden administration can trumpet gains in both areas, but they are not as dramatic as Klain said.  The job gains under Biden are almost twice as big as they were late in the Trump administration, not 10 times bigger. And the rate of coronavirus deaths has fallen by 61%, not 75%, on Biden’s watch.
