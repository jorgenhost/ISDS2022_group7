Trump wrongly claims ‘big victory’ after close down-ballot Nevada race moves toward revote
","President Donald Trump declared a ""big victory"" in his flailing efforts to overturn the election results in Nevada, falsely claiming that one county’s move to redo a close down-ballot contest would have a ""major impact"" on the race he lost to President-elect Joe Biden. ""Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada,"" Trump wrote Nov. 16 in a retweet of a post by Adam Laxalt, a campaign co-chair in Nevada. ""The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy.   Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact! https://t.co/TLHnFKNN6g ""Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security,"" he added. Trump’s claim was debunked by local and national news outlets, reporters and fact-checkers, including the Nevada Independent reporter whose coverage of the County Commission’s meeting to certify the results prompted Laxalt’s original tweet. In reality, the news out of Nevada’s most populous county was not a ""big victory"" for Trump — nor did it reveal any evidence of widespread voter fraud, as other allies of the president claimed. On the contrary, Trump’s tweet was wrong or misleading in at least three ways: There was no ""large scale voter discrepancy"" in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and nearly 75% of Nevada’s population. Officials found a tiny number of discrepancies, which could have only affected one down-ballot race that was separated by 10 votes. There was no ""big victory"" for Trump. The county commissioners certified the county’s results for the presidential election. Biden won the county by more than 90,000 votes. The race for the County Commission seat that may be headed for a special election is not ""all Democrat."" The candidate who finished down 10 votes is a Republican. ""This isn't accurate,"" wrote Erik Pappa, a spokesperson for the county, in a reply to Trump’s tweet. ""The @ClarkCountyNV Commission today certified the results in each race except for 1 local race where there was a 10-vote difference & more than 10 discrepancies."" The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The episode in Nevada is Trump’s latest attempt to highlight a small irregularity as proof of his false claims that the election was stolen by voter fraud.  But the reality is not nearly the firestorm that Trump made it out to be. On Nov. 16, the Clark County commissioners voted to certify the results of all the county’s elections except for one. The lone exception was the tightly contested race for the County Commission seat representing District C, an area that includes parts of Las Vegas.   The commission moved to send that race to a special election because the margin of victory was too small to rule out the possibility that it was affected by discrepancies among ballots, which were also limited in number. There were 153,162 ballots cast in District C, and Democrat Ross Miller received just 10 more votes than Republican Stavros Anthony.  Joe Gloria, the Clark County registrar of voters, told the county commission that among those 153,162 ballots, his office identified discrepancies involving 139 of them, or roughly 0.091%. ""That’s the only race in the entire election where we have any concern related to the outcome, and it’s because of the close margin,"" Gloria, the elections chief, told the county commissioners. Discrepancies are common, Gloria said. They are not necessarily indicative of fraud. For example, they can occur when people vote more than once, when ballots are inadvertently canceled, when signatures on mail ballots cannot be verified, or when there is a different number of voter check-ins recorded at a voting site than actual ballots cast.  ""There is no election that goes without discrepancies that are identified,"" Gloria said, adding that although the number of discrepancies was relatively low, it could still affect a 10-vote margin.  Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria speaks at the Clark County Election Department in North Las Vegas, Nev., on Nov. 7, 2020. (AP) The Nevada Independent reported that the discrepancies cannot be reconciled through a recount because the privacy of ballots prevents canvassers from recording personal information that could help them track down the people who turned in faulty ballots. Nevada has a history of holding special elections in down-ballot races when the results are too close to certify. They did so in 2018, when Republican primary candidates in the race for public administrator were separated by just four votes, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.  ""It is important to be transparent with the public,"" Clark County spokesperson Dan Kulin said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""When we find discrepancies, we report them, and when the number of discrepancies is larger than the margin of victory, we hold a runoff election."" In Clark County more broadly, Gloria reported that there were 936 discrepancies identified out of 974,185 ballots cast, meaning there were problems with 0.096% of all ballots in the county.  That’s a far cry from the ""large scale discrepancy"" Trump tweeted about.  It’s not a ""big victory,"" either, since it didn’t reveal massive fraud or change the fact that Trump lost Nevada. Gloria said six people voted twice, but the county doesn’t know if those incidents were fraud. The results of every other election in Clark County were certified, including the results of the presidential election. Biden received more than 90,000 more votes than Trump in the county, and he leads Trump by more than 33,000 votes in Nevada.  If the District C race goes to a special election, the race for president will not be on the ballot. ""As the voters can see, this issue did not affect any other outcomes, and to claim otherwise is simply untrue,"" Kulin told PolitiFact. Lisa Mayo-DeRiso, the campaign manager for the Republican candidate in the race for the District C County Commission seat, distanced the campaign from Trump’s claims.  Mayo-DeRiso told the Nevada Independent that the campaign ""has never subscribed to the conspiracy side of that"" with regard to the discrepancies.  Miller, the Democratic candidate, has sued to prevent the race from going to a special election. The Trump campaign has filed a lawsuit asking the court to overturn the results of Nevada’s election in favor of Trump or annul the results entirely, the Nevada Independent reported. Trump claimed, ""Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy."" The Clark County Commission declined to certify the results of one local race where there was a 10-vote difference and more than 10 discrepancies with ballots.  The discrepancies were not ""large scale."" They were limited to less than one-tenth of a percent of ballots. And the news is not a ""big victory"" for Trump, since it does not change the results of the presidential election in Clark County, which the commission certified. The race that may go to a special election was not ""all Democrat,"" either. We rate this statement False.

Fact-checking Donald Trump’s tweet firing Christopher Krebs
","In a Nov. 17 tweet, Donald Trump fired his most senior cybersecurity official for affirming the security of the 2020 presidential election.  Christopher Krebs, a Trump appointee, headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at the Department of Homeland Security and directed efforts to shore up election security. He has repeatedly contradicted Trump’s baseless claims that voter fraud swung the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden.  ""The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud,"" Trump tweeted. ""Therefore, effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated.""  The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud - including dead people voting, Poll Watchers not allowed into polling locations, “glitches” in the voting machines which changed... The statement Trump was referring to was released by officials from two Department of Homeland Security committees — the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council and the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council overseeing cybersecurity. Krebs’ agency released the statement, but his name is not attached. Although the statement did not mention Trump directly, the officials contradicted his claims that the Nov. 3 election was rigged against him. They called it the most secure election in U.S. history. ""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,"" the statement reads.  Even though Krebs lost his job, his assessment of the election wasn’t wrong. Evidence shows it's Trump’s claim that is lacking in accuracy. The CISA statement that led to Krebs’ ouster is supported by a multitude of evidence. Fifty-nine election and cybersecurity experts agreed in a public statement that claims of a ""rigged"" election ""either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent."" David Evans, a professor of computer science at the University of Virginia, told PolitiFact that he signed the joint statement because ""there is no substance ... no credible specifics, and no evidence to support any of the claims"" of a rigged election.  ""It is always difficult to prove something did not occur, which is why people who work in security are so careful to avoid strong statements,"" Evans said. ""But in this case, because of the size of the margin, all of the security measures that were in place and worked as intended, and the lack of any evidence of anything fraudulent happening, one can be highly confident that there is no credible possibility that the results of the election are invalid."" Dan Wallach, a professor of computer science at Rice University who studies the security of election voting systems, also co-signed the statement. ""It’s one thing to say we’re aware of vulnerabilities"" in our election system, he told PolitiFact. ""It’s a whole other game to claim that vulnerabilities have been actively exploited. Making that claim requires evidence."" As evidence for his claim that the statement was ""highly inaccurate,"" Trump said in his tweet that ""dead people"" voted in the election, Republican poll watchers were barred from polling locations, ""glitches"" in voting machines changed votes from Trump to Biden, voters were allowed to vote late, ""and many more.""  We have fact-checked all of these claims and found them lacking evidence. Trump and his campaign have so far failed to prove that fraudulent votes cast in the name of dead people altered the outcome of the election. (See examples from Detroit, Michigan, Virginia, Nevada and Wisconsin.) We have found that many people whose names appear on viral lists of dead voters are still living, did not vote in the election, or were mistakenly recorded as having voted because they shared a name with a living person.  The claim that Republican poll watchers were barred from polling locations is False. In both Pennsylvania and Michigan, the two states where Trump has claimed that Republican poll watchers were shut out, hundreds of Republican challengers were allowed into polling stations to observe the count. Trump’s lawyers have acknowledged this fact in lawsuits and court hearings.  The claim that glitches in voting machines swapped votes from Trump to Biden is also baseless. Many of these claims center on Dominion Voting Systems, which makes software and hardware for election officials to use around the country. Minor issues reported after the election were either the result of human error or temporary malfunctions, and they were quickly resolved. Experts told us that many of the claims about Dominion show a misunderstanding of how voting administration actually works.  Finally, Trump’s claim that voters were allowed to vote late is misleading. Some states allow mailed ballots that are postmarked on or before Election Day a grace period if they arrive shortly after Election Day. All such votes would be legally cast under state law. Trump tweeted that ""the recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud."" A multitude of evidence supports the statement released by Krebs’ former agency that the election was not rigged. Trump’s claim is not grounded in evidence.

Fact-checking how accessible COVID-19 tests are in Iowa
","Before announcing more stringent regulations Nov. 16, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds made a statement in a Nov. 10 press conference about concerns that Test Iowa — the state’s COVID-19 testing program — was not conducting enough tests. This was the press conference where Reynolds announced a limited mandate requiring people to wear masks and social distance at certain gatherings. Reynolds said then Iowa can test up to 6,000 people per day with Test Iowa through the State Hygienics Lab, based in Iowa City, and listed other ways Iowans can receive a COVID-19 test: ""So, just remember though that if you can’t get a test through Test Iowa, there are multiple other sites — your doctor, your clinics, your pharmacies, the stroke detection clinic centers. I mean, there are the antigen tests, you can buy a test at Costco. I mean, there are a lot of options out there and we’ll continue to build that out."" Options exist, but how accessible are they? Here are some things to know. Unlike Test Iowa, which offers free COVID-19 tests to Iowans regardless if they have infection symptoms, other options Reynolds mentioned either require people wanting a test to be deemed eligible for one or cost money, sometimes both. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends reaching out to local health-care providers to get a test, according to its website.  The stroke detection clinic Reynolds referred to in her statement is Health Gauge, formerly called Stroke Detection Plus, Reynolds’ Communications Director Pat Garrett wrote in an email. The health and wellness business offers free COVID-19 testing to people at its Ames, Clive, and Urbandale locations in Iowa. People going to Health Gauge don’t have to meet conditions such as having symptoms or having been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 to receive a test but have to pay $100, according to Health Gauge’s website.  Costco shows a COVID-19 saliva testing kit for purchase on its website, available with or without video observation with a member of the Azova Patient Services Team, who manufactures the tests. Without the video option, the testing kit costs $129.99; the kit costs $139.99 with video observation.  In Iowa City, tests are available at University of Iowa Health Care and Mercy Iowa City once patients have been evaluated by a health-care provider. Care providers at UI Health Care determine someone is eligible to receive a test if the person displays COVID-19 symptoms or has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. UI Health Care Public Relations Manager Laura Shoemaker wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan that the test may cost money but is covered by most insurance providers.  Beyond health care clinics, pharmacies at stores such as Hy-Vee and Walgreens offer free COVID-19 tests by appointment. Both pharmacies require people to fill out an online survey to determine if they are eligible for tests, then have them pick a date and time. Both pharmacies state on their websites that they follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines as well as state and local guidelines to determine if someone should receive a test. There are 63 Hy-Vee pharmacy locations in Iowa offering tests, but also sites in neighboring Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Walgreens lists five Iowa locations offering tests, in Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Des Moines, and Sioux City, and notes on its website that the plan is to expand testing capabilities to more locations in the coming weeks.  The state operates 26 Test Iowa sites and clinics, in Black Hawk, Buena Vista, Carroll, Cass, Crawford, Des Moines, Dickinson, Dubuque, Kossuth, Mitchell, Page, Linn, Polk, Plymouth, Pottawattamie, Scott, Sioux, Story, Union, Wapello, Winneshiek, and Wright counties. A Daily Iowanreview of each location on Tuesday, Nov. 17, showed time slots available Thursday, Nov. 19, at the earliest at every location, except those in Polk and Sioux counties.  On Nov. 12, two days after Reynolds made the statement, Test Iowa sites in Linn, Scott, Black Hawk, and Polk counties had no time slots available.  Test Iowa states on the program’s questionnaire to determine whether a person qualifies for a Test Iowa test that ""over the next few days and weeks, additional testing sites in the state of Iowa will be set up.""  The CDC states that people who should be tested include those with COVID-19 symptoms, who have been within 6 feet of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 for more than 15 minutes, and for whom a health-care provider, state or local health department has recommended a test. A quick check of the facts shows all of the areas Reynolds mentioned offer COVID-19 tests, though some are more accessible than others. Testing avenues such as Health Gauge and buying a test from places like Costco cost money, and organizations offering free testing might have qualifications to receive a test, and are not always in the most accessible locations for patients. We rate this statement as Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2020/nov/18/kim-reynolds/fact-checking-how-accessible-covid-19-tests-are-io/

No, COVID-19 vaccines won’t alter your DNA and control you
","Two companies have announced promising early results from their coronavirus vaccine trials, cheering some Americans as COVID-19 cases surge.  Other Americans wary of vaccines have spread misinformation about what will happen to those who inoculate themselves against the disease. One recent Instagram post that has been widely shared claims that vaccines ""will alter the DNA with a RNA Coding that will remove parts of your DNA and replace it with GENETIC CODING (TECHNOLOGY)."" According to the post, that will then ""disable the ability of spirituality and cause people to HAVE to cooperate with the New World Order/One World Order."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Moderna and Pfizer — the companies that announced promising preliminary vaccine results — are indeed developing what are known as mRNA vaccines.  However, there is no evidence that the vaccines would remove any part of your genomic DNA and replace it with any other DNA.  Converting RNA into DNA isn’t possible outside of a special enzyme contained on some viruses, and COVID-19 isn’t one of them, said Brent Stockwell, a professor at Columbia University who studies cell and molecular biology.  ""So there is no obvious mechanism by which a person’s DNA could be altered by an mRNA vaccine,"" he said. ""The DNA of people who take mRNA vaccines is unaffected.""  The m in mRNA stands for messenger, and the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 involve injecting genetic material into cells that produce coronavirus proteins that then trigger an immune response, teaching the body how to fight off a real COVID-19 infection, said Mark Lynas, a fellow at Cornell Alliance with Science at Cornell University. They don’t affect DNA at all.  This is the first time this type of vaccine has reached this point in the process of readying vaccines for general use, Lynas said, and because these vaccines involve injecting genetic material in human cell as opposed to traditional vaccines, which involve injecting an inactivated or weakened virus directly into the body, they could be easier to adjust as this coronavirus mutates. As for whether these vaccines can affect someone’s spirituality, or control the behaviors of people who get them, ""that’s in the realm of science fiction,"" Lynas said.  We rate this Instagram post Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2020/nov/18/instagram-posts/no-covid-19-vaccines-wont-alter-your-dna-and-contr/

Recounts have swung elections in Wisconsin, but nowhere near the 2020 margin
","Recounts are the topic de jour in Wisconsin, where the official canvass shows President Donald Trump lost the state by a more than 20,000-vote margin out of more than 3.2 million ballots.  We learned Nov. 18, 2020 that Trump will seek a partial recount, focused on the state’s two largest (and Democrat-leaning) counties, though the chances of flipping the outcome is considered a longshot at best. A recount in the 2016 presidential race in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 22,000 votes added just 131 votes to Trump’s margin. And a statewide recount in the 2011 Wisconsin Supreme Court race changed the margin by just 310 votes, retaining a 7,000-vote win for David Prosser. Even former Republican Gov. Scott Walker has noted on Twitter that Trump is unlikely to see a recount change the outcome.  Meanwhile, Meagan Wolfe, director of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, has said her agency had ""not received any report of any irregularities"" — despite repeated claims to the contrary from Trump and his team, made without evidence. Nevertheless, some Republicans have pushed forward on the idea of a statewide recount, including U.S. House Representative-elect Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau.  Speaking before the completion of the statewide canvass that confirmed the 20,000-vote margin, Fitzgerald said Nov. 8, 2020, on WISN-TV’s UpFront program it appeared the state was in ""recount territory."" Then he said this about recounts: ""That is a very back-and-forth type of process in which arguments are made as to whether or not to keep a ballot, or throw a ballot out, and I’ve seen elections change as a result of those. I know some say that’s a high margin to really change but, you know, it can happen.""  Have recounts really flipped Wisconsin elections? Yes. But not any statewide races or ones with the margin of difference seen here. Fitzgerald, the current state Senate majority leader, did not respond to repeated requests from PolitiFact Wisconsin to provide evidence for his claim. So we checked with experts and news archives to see what we could find. Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said to his knowledge no statewide race in Wisconsin has ever flipped due to a recount.  Since 2000, only three statewide races have flipped anywhere in the United States, according to a 2020 Survey and Analysis of Statewide Election Recount from FairVote, which advocates for ranked choice voting. They were a 2004 governor’s race in Washington, a 2006 auditor’s race in Vermont and a 2008 U.S. Senate seat race in Minnesota. All had initial margins of less than 300 votes. The FairVote study found the average statewide recount shifted results by 430 votes between the frontrunners, representing 0.024% of the vote in those elections.  But results have shifted in local races on multiple occasions in Wisconsin given the smaller vote totals involved. A few we came across in our research: In a 1996 race for Appleton mayor, a recount flipped the race from an eight-vote loss to a 14-vote win for the challenger.  In an April 2009 race for chairman in the Town of Wausau, a challenger had defeated an incumbent by a card draw after a tied vote, but a recount yielded one extra vote in favor of the incumbent.  In 1997, the former town chair of the Town of Fayette in Lafayette County ran as a write-in and won by a single vote in the initial count, but after a recount he lost by two. Other recounts have broken or created ties, including a 2004 mayoral election in South Milwaukee that initially ended in a tie, but showed a one-vote margin upon a recount.  And an April 2011 Oshkosh Common Council election showed a 14-vote victory, but a recount ended in a tie, forcing the candidates to draw cards to determine the victor.  Recounts are conducted by the County Board of Canvassers, made up of a county clerk and two other electors appointed by the clerk, one from each party. A candidate who lost a race but was within 1% of the winner’s total can request a recount. For races with at least 4,000 votes, the candidate must pay for the recount unless the margin is less than 0.25%. In those tightest races the municipality bears the cost. The board of canvassers decides whether to hand-count votes or use a machine tabulator. Magney said there can be a ""back and forth"" at a recount, in line with Fitzgerald’s claim. ""If there is an objection to the counting of a particular ballot, there could be a situation where arguments are made on both sides that the recount board of canvassers hears, it is documented in the minutes, the board of canvassers makes a determination, the decision is noted, and they move on,"" Magney wrote in an email. ""The issue is preserved for any potential legal challenge to a decision made by the recount board of canvassers."" Under state law, board members might discuss votes if a petitioner for a recount believes an error has been made (9.01(1)(b)9), if they need to determine voter intent (9.01(1)(b)8s), or if the person demanding a recount object to the counting of a ballot in a recount (9.01(1)(b)11). Amid discussions of a potential presidential recount in Wisconsin, Fitzgerald said Wisocnsin appeared to be in ""recount territory"" and ""I’ve seen elections change as a result of"" recounts. Some local races have indeed flipped, which lines up with Fitzgerald’s claim.  But he made this comment in the context of a potential recount affecting the presidential race, and no races of that magnitude or vote-gap have flipped in Wisconsin. Nationwide, a total of three statewide races flipped in a recount between 2000 and 2020, but none had margins anywhere near the 20,000 we see in Wisconsin. So races have flipped, but not races like this. We define Half True as a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.",/factchecks/2020/nov/18/scott-fitzgerald/recounts-have-swung-elections-wisconsin-nowhere-ne/

Joe Biden did not hire the mob to fabricate ballots in Philadelphia
","If you’ve seen a post that claims Joe Biden hired the Philadelphia mob to rig the presidential election results, you should forget about it. In a Nov. 17 Facebook post, Jeremy Herrell, a Donald Trump supporter and hip-hop artist who runs a popular conservative page whose handle is @TheHipHopPatriot, said Biden hired the mob to ""crate (sic) fake ballots by the thousands."" ""We have breaking news of how the mob, reportedly at this point, has helped Joe Biden get thousands and thousands and thousands of fraudulent votes,"" he said during a Facebook Live video. ""You cannot make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen."" Actually, you can — the claim is baseless.

(Screenshot from Facebook) We reached out to his page for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. During his video, Herrell cites a Nov. 14 report from the Buffalo Chronicle with the headline: ""How a Philly mob boss stole the election — and why he may flip on Joe Biden."" The Buffalo Chronicle website is owned by businessman Matthew Ricchiazzi. It has published false claims about prospective members of the Biden administration, Canadian politics and New York’s response to COVID-19. This new Buffalo Chronicle article cites anonymous sources to say the Biden campaign paid $3 million to ""Skinny Joey"" Merlino, a reputed mafia veteran in Philadelphia, and Merlino’s associates to fabricate 300,000 ballots in the battleground state. On Election Night, the site claims, Merlino and his team were creating 6,000 fraudulent ballots per hour. ""They were then packaged into non-descript cardboard boxes and dropped off outside the Philadelphia Convention Center,"" the article says. ""The ballots were purchased in cash."" The Buffalo Chronicle wrote that Merlino ""might just be willing to flip on Biden"" if Trump expunges his criminal record. Merlino would ""really like a job with the National Parks Service,"" according to the site’s anonymous source. There is no evidence the Biden campaign hired a mob boss to fabricate hundreds of thousands of ballots in Pennsylvania. The article plays into other baseless claims that widespread voter fraud in battleground states affected the outcome of the presidential race. On Nov. 16, the Buffalo Chronicle story was shared on Twitter by attorney Jordan Sekulow, who — along with his father Jay Sekulow — is a member of Trump’s legal team. The Sekulows have helped the president mount legal challenges in battleground states over the election results. ""This is being reported by the Buffalo Chronicle,"" Herrell said in his video. ""And it is verified by Jordan Sekulow."" Jordan Sekulow shared the link and said ""follow all leads."" Meanwhile, Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer who recently falsely claimed there were hundreds of thousands of ""unlawful votes"" in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, told Fox Business the allegation was ""far-fetched."" We reached out to the Buffalo Chronicle for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia — and certainly not hundreds of thousands of fabricated ballots favoring Biden. ""We just had the most transparent and secure election in the history of Philadelphia,"" said Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt, a Republican who sits on the city’s elections board, in a Nov. 11 interview with CNN. ""I have seen the most fantastical things on social media, making completely ridiculous allegations that have no basis in fact at all.""

As for Merlino, the purported mob boss has been on supervised release in South Florida since 2018, when he took a plea deal in a racketeering and conspiracy case. During his most recent trial, Merlino said he had retired from the mob and was focused on running an upscale Italian restaurant in Boca Raton, Fla. Merlino’s lawyer denied his client was part of any voter fraud scheme in Pennsylvania.  ""My client categorically denies all the allegations and Joey would rather die than ever be a snitch,"" John Meringolo told the New York Daily News.

No, Michigan has not refused to certify the election results
","President Donald Trump continues his quest for victories in states that he lost at the ballot box, this time with a dubious claim to a procedural win in Michigan. ""Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results."" Trump said in a Nov. 17 tweet. ""Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!"" He was wrong. Michigan didn’t refuse to certify its election results. In fact, the Board of State Canvassers, which is tasked with certifying the results, has not yet met to do so. The meeting is scheduled for Nov. 23. Trump appeared to have confused the state board with the Board of Canvassers in Wayne County, the state’s largest. On Nov. 17, the four-member county board briefly deadlocked when its two Republican members initially voted against certifying the results. They later joined their Democratic colleagues to unanimously certify the results. The Wayne County board met Nov. 17 to consider the election results for the county’s 43 jurisdictions, which include Detroit. The Republican members of the board — chairperson Monica Palmer and William Hartmann — initially voted against certifying the county’s results, pointing to discrepancies in some Detroit precincts and absent-voter counting boards between the number of ballots recorded as cast and the number of ballots counted. Precincts with such discrepancies are considered ""out of balance,"" unless the gaps are accounted for and explained in polling records. Of Detroit's 503 Election Day precincts, 85 were out of balance, as were 94 of the city's 134 absent-voter counting boards. Most of them recorded discrepancies of three votes or fewer; 10 Election Day precincts and 43 counting boards had larger discrepancies. The discrepancies amounted to roughly 400 votes, out of the roughly 250,000 votes cast in Detroit, according to unofficial election results. During the meeting, Palmer said she would be open to certifying the election results for jurisdictions outside Detroit, even though some of them also had precincts that were out of balance. The Republican votes drew a strong public outcry. Commenters weighing in on the Zoom call accused the the two Republicans of racism for suggesting excluding votes from Detroit, the state’s largest city, which is nearly 80% Black. Palmer and Hartmann changed their minds and ultimately voted to certify the election results and passed a resolution to have Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson audit the county's results. Now that canvassing boards in all 83 Michigan counties have certified their results, the Board of State Canvassers is scheduled to meet Nov. 23 to certify the statewide results. A federal lawsuit filed by the Trump campaign asks the U.S. District Court for Western Michigan to stop the certification of Michigan’s election results. The court has not ruled on the case yet. The lawsuit largely bases its claims on hundreds of affidavits filed by Republican election challengers present at TCF Center, where Detroit election workers counted absentee ballots cast by the city’s voters. Claims of election fraud in Detroit have so far been rejected in court. Steven Liedel, a Lansing attorney specializing in state constitutional law, said state board members are obligated to certify the statewide results. ""They have taken an oath to uphold the U.S. and Michigan Constitution, and they have a clear legal duty to certify the results if they have results presented to them,"" he said. Trump claimed that Michigan ""refused to certify the election results."" That’s not true. The State Board of Canvassers that certifies the statewide results has not met yet. The board is scheduled to meet Nov. 23 to vote on certification. In Wayne County, two Republican members of the county canvassing board initially voted against certifying the results but later changed their votes.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine does not contain aborted fetal tissue
","An effective COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be key in bringing the pandemic to heel. However, that hasn’t stopped some social media users from spreading false claims about various vaccine candidates.  One of these claims originated in a Facebook video posted by the anti-vaccination group We Are Vaxxed. The video, broadcast live on Nov. 15, claims that the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca contains cells from an aborted male fetus. ""CONFIRMED- aborted Male fetus in Covid 19 vaccine,"" reads the title that appears above the video on Facebook.  The video shows the packaging for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine while an offscreen narrator breaks down what led her to conclude that the vaccine contains aborted fetal tissue. The narrator then shows a screen grab from a scientific study of the vaccine.  The narrator reads aloud one portion of the text where the authors describe analyzing the vaccine in ""MRC-5 and A549 cell lines.""  The video then shows the Wikipedia page for MRC-5 cell lines. The narrator points out that the cell line was originally developed from research ""deriving lung tissue of a 14-week-old aborted Caucasian male fetus."" ""There you have it peeps,"" she says. ""One thing (this vaccine) definitely has is the lung tissue of a 14-week-old aborted Caucasian male fetus."" The post, which has been viewed over 150,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because it’s wrong.  As the video points out, MRC-5 was created when a cell isolated from an aborted fetus was multiplied to produce a ""cell line"" of the same genetic makeup. The MRC-5 cells were obtained in 1966 from a 14-week-old fetus electively aborted in the United Kingdom. According to Jenny Hursit, an AstraZeneca spokesperson, the company didn’t use the MRC-5 cell line to develop the vaccine.  David Matthews, a scientist at the University of Bristol and a co-author of the study cited in the video, told us that the narrator misleadingly summarized his paper.  ""This paper looked at how the Oxford vaccine behaves when it is inside a genetically normal human cell. The vaccine is NOT itself made in MRC-5 cells,"" he wrote in an email.  Matthews explained that he and his colleagues were attempting to analyze the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine before it was tested on humans. To achieve this goal, researchers at Oxford and the University of Bristol injected the vaccine into the MRC-5 cell line to see how it reacted in human cells. Contrary to the video’s claims, the study never says that MRC-5 is an ingredient in the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. However, Matthews noted that the development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine did involve the HEK 293 cell line, which was grown from a kidney derived from an aborted fetus.  The cell line has been widely used in biological and medical inquiry. According to Paul Offit, the director of the vaccine education center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the HEK 293 is originally derived from kidney cells that were grown in a tissue culture. The first source of the cells was a fetus legally aborted in the Netherlands in the 1970s.  The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine takes the form of a modified virus that trains your immune system how to identify cells infected with the coronavirus, Matthews explained. The modified virus is grown in the HEK 293 cell line. These cells are then purified away to ""exceptionally high standards"" to create the vaccine.  After the purification process, the final vaccine contains trillionths of a gram of fragmented DNA from the cell line. This is about the amount of DNA in edible fruits and vegetables.  A Facebook video claims that there is ""aborted Male fetus"" in the Oxford-Astrazeneca ""Covid 19 vaccine."" The video incorrectly identifies the cell line used to grow the virus for the vaccine. The post also gives the impression that fetal tissue is included in the vaccine. The vaccine is created from a virus grown in a cell line derived from aborted fetal tissue. However, the cell line is purified away from the vaccine before it is used. It is inaccurate to claim that the vaccine ""contains"" aborted fetal tissue.  The claim is not accurate. We rate it False. ​",/factchecks/2020/nov/18/facebook-posts/oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-does-not-contain-aborte/

Donald Trump’s jab at Georgia recount ignores key voting principles
","In his effort to challenge votes in states he lost, President Donald Trump focused on the hand recount of over 5 million ballots in Georgia. ""The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified,"" a fundraising email from Trump said. ""Georgia’s secretary of state won’t let the people checking the ballots see the signatures for fraud. Why? Without this, the whole process is very unfair and close to meaningless."" Trump has cast doubt on the validity of mail-in ballots for months. In Georgia, he is asserting that not only should the count of votes be checked, but the authenticity of each mail-in ballot, too. This overlooks a core principle of American democracy: How you voted is your business, and no one else’s.  For voting in person, the voting booth guarantees your privacy. For mail-in ballots, the process is different. Each mail-in ballot comes in a sleeve or envelope that the voter must sign. Election workers then match the signature to their voter records. ""They review the signature, and if it complies with the law, the ballot is separated from the envelope to maintain secrecy,"" said David Becker, head of the private Center for Election Innovation and Research. ""There is no way to go back and review signatures after they’ve been separated from the ballots, and there’d be no reason to do so."" Every state follows the same basic steps, Becker said. Once the ballot is verified, it becomes an anonymous vote just like a vote cast in person. Signature verification is critical for ensuring that only valid ballots are counted, and Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, explained that his office doubled down on the steps to maximize accuracy. ""We strengthened signature match,"" Raffensperger wrote on Facebook. ""We helped train election officials on Georgia Bureau of Investigation signature match — which is confirmed twice before a ballot is ever cast."" There was a disagreement this year in Georgia over the steps election officials should take when a ballot arrives well before Election Day and there’s time to get back to the voter to fix an issue with their signature. A March 6 settlement agreement spelled out a process acceptable to both parties and the state. Becker noted that Trump and his team raised their objections to the procedures late in the game, including a Nov. 16 tweet from Trump. Becker said none of this could be a surprise to them. ""The Trump campaign and its allies knew the rules of the election well in advance of the election, and those rules had been set by a legislature and a governor friendly to the campaign, and were enforced by a secretary of state of the president’s own party,"" Becker said. ""It’s only after they lost the election that they’ve raised any concerns, and they still have found no evidence of any issues with the ballots. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Trump said Georgia’s secretary of state won’t allow people recounting ballots to check the signatures for fraud. This reflects a flawed understanding of how mail-in votes work. Before a mailed ballot is counted, the voter’s signature has already been verified. In Georgia, it is verified twice. To protect the privacy of the vote, after verification, every state separates the ballot from the signed envelope it came in. By design, there is no way to reunite the two pieces of paper. A recount can only be a recount of ballots, and Trump and his campaign knew that months ago. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

Inaccurate early vote count in one Michigan county was a human error, not a failure of the software
","Musician Ted Nugent has been a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and recently implored followers of his Facebook page to help ""stop the steal,"" alluding to baseless claims that Democrats stole the election for Joe Biden. In the post, Nugent, a Michigan native, asked residents to demand an audit of the state’s election results, saying the votes are ""potentially fraudulent"": ""Our MI Secretary of State is about to certify our votes in just a couple days (by the 17th)! Once the votes are certified, they CANNOT be audited for fraud!!! 47 additional counties used the same software that caused a ‘glitch’ in Antrim County (that switched 6,000 votes from Trump to Biden in that county)."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Nugent has some facts mixed up. Sixty-five Michigan counties, not 47, use the Dominion Voting Systems software, including Antrim County. And while Antrim County discovered an incorrect tally that made it appear as if Biden was winning there by about 3,000 votes, it was the only county to experience such an incident.  Also, the ""glitch"" had nothing to do with the technology — it was a mistake made by the clerk.  The day after the Nov. 3 election, while votes were still being counted, Antrim County appeared to have swung to Joe Biden by about 3,000 votes. On Nov. 5, county officials changed that to show Trump winning by about 2,500 votes. We reached out to Nugent and didn’t hear back. But the difference between these two figures — 5,500 votes — may be the source of the ""6,000"" figure he used to describe votes he said were switched to Biden. J. Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan professor and voting systems expert, dug into the problem and told our partners at the Detroit Free Press that county elections officials had left an old version of a key file on some machines in their digital voting system. As a result, those machines failed to properly match votes to candidates when tallies at some precincts were added to the county total. The inaccurate count was never an official result and the Michigan secretary of state’s office also said it came down to a human error by the Antrim County clerk, not a failure in Dominion’s system. ""Because the clerk did not update software, even though the tabulators counted all the ballots correctly, those accurate results were not combined properly when the clerk reported unofficial results,"" the Nov. 6 statement said. Dominion Voting Systems has become the subject of online disinformation that seeks to tie it to Democrats or blame it for clerical errors in the ballot-counting process. RELATED: No evidence Dominion Voting Systems caused widespread tabulation errors that flipped votes for Biden  ""No credible reports or evidence of any software issues exist,"" Dominion says on its website. ""While no election is without isolated issues, Dominion Voting Systems are reliably and accurately counting ballots. State and local election authorities have publicly confirmed the integrity of the process."" Michigan resident Ted Nugent said in a Facebook post that ""47 additional counties used the same voting software that caused a ‘glitch’ in Antrim County"" and said that votes in the state are ""potentially fraudulent.""  Nugent’s post contains an element of truth — Dominion Voting Systems was used in several Michigan counties and in Antrim, which experienced an incorrect early tally in favor of Biden — but it ignores the critical fact that the ""glitch"" was a human error limited to that county and that the technology itself didn’t simply switch votes.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has repeatedly said there is no evidence of fraud affecting the state’s presidential election results. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Nov. 16 that officials had found more than 2,600 ballots in Floyd County, located northwest of Atlanta, that hadn’t been tallied.

That is +778 for President Trump that will be reflected in the certified result."" To win Georgia, which has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1992, Trump would need to make up thousands more votes. State election officials do not expect that will happen — and even if it did, Biden would still have enough electoral votes to win the presidency. The Floyd County ballots weren’t counted after Election Day because local officials did not upload votes from a memory card in a ballot scanning machine.

Hartzler’s right: There’s some bounce in the labor report
","In 2020, it’s hard to find good news. But according to Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler, R-Missouri, the economy is looking up.  Hartzler, the 4th District representative, posted on Twitter about the latest Department of Labor report on Nov. 6. ""Great October jobs report! @USDOL reports 638,000 new jobs last month, beating the 530,000 economists expected. Unemployment rate falls to 6.9%, also beating expectations,"" Hartzler wrote. ""Labor force participation rate rose 0.3 points to 61.7%. America is bouncing back!"" According to Department of Labor data, Hartzler’s data is correct. But we wondered whether the numbers mean the U.S. is ""bouncing back"" from the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic. We tried to contact Hartzler but received no response. So, we decided to talk to economics experts to see if Hartzler is right.  According to a news release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate in February 2020 was under 4%. In April, as the COVID-19 virus spread, it skyrocketed to over 14%. Since then, the unemployment rate has been steadily declining. As of the October report, it was around 7%.  Though we are still not back to where we were in February, MU economics professor Alina Malkova says the economy looks good. She says the current recession is different from the recessions we have seen before, like in 2008.  ""We can predict that we will recover quickly,"" Malkova said.  In 2008, people were running out of money or going into debt. That recession took years to recover from. In early 2020, people had money, but they couldn’t spend it because of business closures and shut-downs.  ""And when the economy started to open again,"" Malkova said, ""they started to spend money very quickly."" This results in what economists call a ""V curve"" or a ""V-shaped recovery."" This occurs when economic recovery creates a V-shaped curve on a graph, signaling an economy is bouncing back.  The graph is not currently a full ""V"", and experts say we still have months to go. In comparison to the 2008 recession though, MU economics and public affairs professor Peter Mueser says this is a quick recovery. Mueser says there are some things we should keep an eye on though, such as people who have been unemployed long term.  ""In fact, there are more long term unemployed people,"" Mueser said. ""There's a substantial number of people who are sort of waiting for jobs. But nonetheless, you can't say that the statistics don't look encouraging.""  According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, temporary unemployment fell by 1.4 million from September to October. Long term unemployment actually increased by about 1.2 million in that same time period. Long term unemployment is defined as someone who is jobless for 27 weeks or more.  For context, in February 2020, over 1.1 million people were unemployed long term. In October, there were about 3.6 million people unemployed long term.  If COVID-19 cases continue to increase and businesses shut down, we could see another increase in unemployment. But, Malkova said similar dynamics for a recovery should apply, too. Citing new jobs numbers, Hartzler said that ""America is bouncing back."" The unemployment rate, which had risen by more than 10 points from February to April, is steadily falling again. However, there is other jobs data that shows reason for continued concern about the state of the economy.  For example, the number of people with long term unemployment actually grew by about 1.2 million from September to October.  Because Hartzler’s claim was accurate but left out some details, we rate her claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2020/nov/18/vicky-hartzler/hartzlers-right-theres-some-bounce-labor-report/

Trump’s exaggerated claim that he ‘saved’ HBCUs with 2019 funding bill
","President Donald Trump exaggerated his contributions to historically Black colleges and universities during the final presidential debate, claiming he ""saved"" the minority institutions when he signed a bill to permanently extend a stream of federal funding beyond 2019. According to the story Trump told on stage with former Vice President Joe Biden, HBCUs were repeatedly sending representatives to meet him in the White House. They kept coming back, Trump said, and when he asked why, they told him their schools had ""no funding."" ""President (Barack) Obama would never give them long-term funding, and I did,"" Trump said Oct. 22. ""Ten-year, long-term funding, and I gave them more money than they asked for because I said, ‘I think you need more.’ … But I saved historically Black colleges and universities.""  When Trump signed the bipartisan FUTURE Act in 2019, he did make permanent $255 million in annual funding for minority-serving colleges, including roughly $85 million earmarked as mandatory funding for historically Black colleges and universities under a Title III program. But it’s inaccurate for Trump to claim that he ""saved"" HBCUs, or that they had ""no funding"" before him. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. The Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities program has given Congress an avenue to award grants to HBCUs for decades.  The Title III program, authorized as part of the Higher Education Act of 1965, is funded with annual discretionary appropriations and the additional annual mandatory appropriations made permanent by the FUTURE Act, according to the U.S. Education Department.  Before the FUTURE Act kicked in, HBCUs had to ask Congress each year to renew the mandatory funding, as PolitiFact has reported. The act marked a significant change, and organizations that support HBCUs heralded the move. But Trump’s claim likely overstated the role he played in making the law a reality. The president did sign the bill when it hit his desk, but it’s not clear that he did other legwork to get it there. ""The only words the president contributed were his signature, ‘Donald J. Trump,’"" Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C., an original sponsor of the bill, told Inside Higher Ed in August. Total funding for the program has trended up under Trump. However, the president’s budget proposals for the last three years show the White House repeatedly requested less in discretionary funding through the program than Congress provided. The White House has also tried to trim funding for federal TRIO programs, which are designed to provide services to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. That doesn’t mean the Trump administration hasn’t been supportive of HBCUs. In 2018, for example, Education Secretary Betsy Devos issued full forgiveness on hurricane relief loans granted to four HBCUs in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. But as other fact-checkers have noted, Trump’s insistence that he ""saved"" HBCUs goes too far. His debate-night claim also ignored that HBCUs received money via the Title III program every year under Obama, according to the U.S. Education Department.  ""President Trump did no more for HBCUs than any other U.S. president, but I don’t know of anything that he has done that has had a disproportionately negative impact on HBCUs,"" said Ivory Toldson, a professor at Howard University who served as an HBCU liaison for the Obama administration. Toldson added that presidents have limited control over the federal budget. The program impacted by the FUTURE Act isn’t the only source of federal funding for HBCUs, although experts said it makes up a sizable amount. The schools can seek funding through grants, contracts and cooperative agreements with federal agencies, Toldson said.  The campus of Morehouse College in Atlanta on April 12, 2019. (AP) Money also flows indirectly to students in the form of Pell Grants, said Krystal L. Williams, an assistant professor of higher education at the University of Alabama, who co-authored a 2019 report on HBCU funding sources for the American Council on Education.  Those funding sources predate both the Trump and Obama administrations, Williams said. Public HBCUs are generally more reliant on federal, state and local funding than their non-HBCU counterparts, the report found. Private HBCUs also lean more heavily on money from tuition than their non-HBCU counterparts, where private gifts are more common. Toldson and Williams crunched the numbers on HBCU funding for PolitiFact using data on the individual institutions’ reported revenues from the National Center for Education Statistics. Due to a reporting lag, the data excludes the most recent years under Trump and does not account for emergency funds delivered as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. HBCUs received a total of $1.9 billion from the federal government in appropriations, grants and contracts in 2017-2018, compared with $1.8 billion in 2016-2017 and between $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion annually under Obama, Toldson said. Both Toldson and Williams said the highest investment occurred in 2009-2010, as the nation recovered from the Great Recession. ""There is no evidence that the Trump administration's investment in HBCUs is the highest compared to previous administrations,"" Williams said, countering another administration claim. Trump said, ""President Obama would never give them long-term funding, and I did … I saved historically Black colleges and universities."" Trump signed the FUTURE Act into law, making a major funding stream for HBCUs permanent beyond 2019. But it’s a stretch to say he ""saved"" them from financial ruin.

No, suicides have not outpaced COVID-19 deaths
","If you or someone you know is considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/ Super Bowl champion Tom Brady told his Instagram followers that suicide accounts for more death than COVID-19. ""More suicide deaths than coronavirus death past two months,"" Brady had on his Oct. 27 post. ""So wash your hands and wear your mask, but don’t forget to be nice to people and yourself."" We reached out to Brady to learn where he got his numbers and did not hear back, but government numbers and experts show he’s wrong.  There’s a general sense in the mental health community that disruptions in daily life, whether through social isolation or the loss of jobs, increases the risk of suicide. But Brady’s statement goes too far. ""There’s no way this can be true,"" said president of the American Association of Suicidology Dr. Jonathan Singer. The most reliable statistics on suicides come from the National Center for Health Statistics and are from 2018. That year, there were 48,312 reported suicides, or an average of 4,026 every month. Coronavirus deaths per month in the United States have been four times higher or more in recent months. Going back to June — a month when deaths were falling — it was about 19,000. Now, it’s about 22,000 people per month.This chart shows the ebb and flow of deaths, measured as a seven-day rolling average. The point is, no matter which recent months you take, COVID-19 has killed far more people than suicide has per month historically. Is something happening different in 2020? Well, we don’t know; and neither does Brady. Singer noted that preliminary numbers of reported suicides for 2019 show a slight decline since 2018 in the suicide rate. And Singer said there are no national numbers that are current. ""Reporters ask us what is the effect of the coronavirus on suicides, and we don’t know,"" Singer said. ""Because we don’t have the data."" Some counties track suicides nearly daily, but Singer said there is no way to estimate national trends based on limited local information. ""For this to be right, you would need a rise in the suicide rate that is just impossible,"" Singer said. Brady said that in the past two months, there have been more deaths from suicide than COVID-19. There are no national numbers that back this up. COVID-19 has been killing people at a rate that is at least three times greater than suicide historically. A leading researcher we reached said even in the absence of firm data, it is impossible for the suicide rate to have increased to surpass the COVID-19 death rate.

Conservative group’s claim that Joe Biden backs sex changes for kids is False
","In a tweet promoting its new attack ad, a conservative super PAC  claims: ""Joe Biden says he supports sex changes for kids."" The 30-second spot by the American Principles Project doesn’t go quite as far as the tweet, but strongly suggests that Biden endorses sex changes for kids. Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, has stated opposition to discrimination against transgender people, not support for sex changes for children. In what appears to be a medical operating room, a voiceover says: ""Sex changes for kids?"" and the same words on the screen. ""Most Americans say that’s going way too far, but not Joe Biden,"" the narrator says. Then the ad shows a clip of Biden saying, with his words also shown on the screen: ""An 8-year-old child decides, I want to be transgender; that’s what I think I’d like to be."" The ad ends with the narrator saying: ""If Joe Biden is willing to endorse sex changes for second-graders, what won’t he support?"" The clip is from an Oct. 15 town hall in Pennsylvania that aired on ABC. Biden answered a question from Mieke Haeck, who said she has an 8-year-old daughter who is transgender.  Biden does not state that he supports sex changes for children. He states opposition to transgender discrimination.  Haeck: ""The Trump administration has attacked the rights of transgender people, banning them from military service, weakening non-discrimination protections, and even removing the word transgender from some government websites. How will you, as president, reverse this dangerous and discriminatory agenda and ensure that the lives and rights of LGBTQ people are protected under U.S. law?"" Biden: ""I will flat out just change the law. Eliminate those executive orders, number one. ... My dad was a high school-educated, well-read man who was a really decent guy. And I was being dropped off to get an application in the center of our city, Wilmington, Delaware, the corporate capital of the world at the time. And these two men —  I’m getting out to get an application to be a lifeguard in the African-American community, because there was a big swimming pool complex. ""And these two men, well-dressed, leaned up and hugged one another and kissed one another. I’m getting out of the car at the light, and I turned to my dad. My dad looked at me. He said, ‘Joey, it’s simple. They love each other.’ The idea that an 8-year-old child or a 10-year-old child decides, ‘You know, I decided I want to be transgender. That’s what I think I’d like to be. It’d make my life a lot easier.’ There should be zero discrimination. And what’s happening is too many transgender women of color are being murdered. They’re being murdered. I think it’s up to, now, 17. Don’t hold me to that number, but it’s higher now?""  Haeck: ""Yeah."" Biden: ""And that’s just this year. And so I promise you, there is no reason to suggest that there should be any right denied your daughter, or daughters, whichever, one or two.""   Haeck: ""One."" Biden: ""One. Your daughter, that your other daughter has a right to be and do. None. Zero. And by the way, my son Beau, who passed away, was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. He was the guy who got the first transgender law passed in the state of Delaware. And because of a young man who became a woman, who worked for him in the attorney general's office."" American Principles Project spokesman Paul Dupont argued to PolitiFact that ""implied in the assertion that there should be zero discrimination"" is that children should ""have access to any medical treatments that will facilitate"" a sex change. But Biden made no such statement. Dupont also cited Biden’s support of the federal Equality Act. But that measure would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, education and public accommodations. On his campaign website, Biden criticizes the Trump administration’s decision to block the ability of transgender individuals to openly serve in the military. That section does not mention children.  Biden’s campaign did not reply to our requests for information. American Principles Project claimed: ""Joe Biden says he supports sex changes for kids.""

Trump wrong to claim U.S. is padding COVID-19 stats
","Speaking at one of his many recent Wisconsin rallies, President Donald Trump said skewed stats mean the COVID-19 pandemic is overblown. The pandemic response under Trump has been a central issue of the presidential campaign, with Democratic nominee Joe Biden and an array of third-party groups hammering Trump in campaign ads for what he has — and hasn’t — done to address COVID-19. Pushing back on this point in Waukesha on Oct. 24, 2020, Trump pointed to how the country is counting COVID-19 deaths and funding COVID-19 healthcare coverage. ""Some countries, they report differently. If somebody's sick with a heart problem, and they die of COVID, they say, ‘They died of a heart problem,’"" Trump said. ""If somebody's terminally ill with cancer (in the U.S.), and they have COVID, we report them (as a COVID death). And you know, doctors get more money and hospitals get more money. Think of this incentive. … Then you wonder, ‘Gee, I wonder why their cases are so low.’ (The U.S.) and their reporting systems are really not doing it right."" Trump’s contention is that we are counting deaths we shouldn’t actually attribute to COVID-19. And his implication — by mentioning the cost — is that this is being done to financially benefit the healthcare industry. This gets at a core question for many COVID-19 skeptics — whether the widely-publicized tallies are deaths from COVID-19 or with COVID-19. Let’s dig in. Trump is right that a terminal cancer patient’s death could be counted as a COVID-19 death. But experts say he’s wrong that there’s anything illogical about that. The decision how to report cause of death is made independently at the local level by a physician, medical examiner or coroner, then listed on each person’s death certificate. The federal agency that oversees mortality data said what is listed as the ""underlying"" (i.e. primary) cause of death comes down to timing. ""If a terminal patient still had, say 6 months to live, but was infected by the virus and died, the certifier might determine that COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death because of the timing,"" Bob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, said in an email. ""In the same way, if that same terminal cancer patient was in a car accident and died from that trauma, the car accident would be the underlying cause. If, on the other hand, death from terminal cancer was imminent or COVID-19 symptoms were mild, COVID-19 might be viewed only as a contributing factor —not the underlying cause — or, if the patient was asymptomatic, it might not be viewed as a factor at all — and therefore, not reported on the death certificate."" The approach to identifying an underlying cause is laid out by the World Health Organization, which  says a ""death due to COVID-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma)."" The Center for Health Statistics says this guidance is ""used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death."" In other words, Trump is wrong about U.S. stats being skewed because other countries take a different approach. And his hypothetical about how other countries would classify a person with heart disease who died of COVID-19 is wrong as well. Among the COVID-19 deaths tallied by the Center for Health Statistics (based on death certificates), COVID-19 was the underlying cause in 92% of them. So roughly speaking, that’s the group that medical professionals determined on an individual basis died from COVID. The remaining 8% are closer to the dying with COVID category — though listing COVID-19 at all means officials believe it played a role in that person dying at that point. In short, this distinction between dying from COVID or with COVID isn’t nearly enough to alter the scale of the national pandemic, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans. We should note minimizing COVID by attacking the death figures is hardly a new tactic from Trump. Trump said in a Sept. 1, 2020 interview on Fox News, ""I saw a statistic come out the other day, talking about only 6% of the people actually died from COVID, which is a very interesting — that they died from other reasons."" Trump was referring to CDC data listing comorbidities that went viral due to widespread misinterpretation. The report lists other medical issues people had when they died of COVID-19 — and noted that 94% of people who died of COVID also had another medical issue. RELATED: No, the CDC did not ‘quietly adjust’ US coronavirus deaths PolitiFact National rated Trump’s claim Pants on Fire  after detailing an array of expert input on the nature of this tally. Since Trump is applying similar logic in his latest claim, let’s review what experts told our fact-checkers at the time: ""The point that the CDC was trying to make was that a certain percentage of them had nothing else but just COVID-19,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a Sept. 1 interview with ""Good Morning America."" ""That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID didn’t die of COVID-19 — they did."" ""The numbers that you’ve been hearing, the 180,000-plus deaths, are real deaths from COVID-19. Let there not be any confusion about that."" So why do 94% of death certificates that mention COVID-19 also list other conditions? When a coronavirus patient is admitted to the hospital, the virus is listed on their medical record. Since the coronavirus attacks the lungs, perhaps they develop respiratory failure, which would also be listed on their record. Unfortunately, they die after going into cardiac arrest, so doctors take note of that, too. All three of those conditions would be listed on the patient’s death certificate, but COVID-19 started the process. ""The people dying were not going to die but for the acquisition of COVID,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Lastly, let’s examine Trump’s claim that doctors and hospitals have an ""incentive"" to code a certain way because they get paid more. It is true that hospitals get an extra 20% for Medicare patients being treated for COVID-19. This was part of a coronavirus relief bill Trump himself signed on March 27, 2020. Medicare (which covers about 40% of all hospital patients) provides a flat rate payment based on the patient’s diagnosis, and the CARES act included additional payment to address the complications and costs that typically accompany COVID-19 patients. But Trump’s implication that something nefarious is connected to this is unsupported. We’ve seen no evidence health officials are misidentifying COVID patients for financial gain on any significant scale, and doing so for a Medicare patient would be prosecutable as fraud, experts say.  A similar claim questioning whether COVID counts are inflated because of the financial incentive was rated Half True by PolitiFact National in April. The fact-check noted the additional payments are real but there is no evidence of numbers being padded a result. To the contrary, researchers have noted the U.S. is likely undercounting COVID-19 deaths due to lack of testing, since the number of people dying nationwide in 2020 is well above normal rates.  The CDC reported Oct. 23 that the U.S. has had 300,000 more deaths in 2020 than would be expected in a typical year, two-thirds of which can be attributed directly to COVID-19. Analyses by the Washington Post, Yale University and others said the remaining deaths are likely from two main sources: Deaths related to COVID-19 where COVID wasn’t listed on death certificates and ""deaths at home or in nursing homes from heart attacks, diabetes, strokes and Alzheimer’s disease, among people afraid to seek care in hospitals or unable to get it,"" the Post reported Trump said at a Waukesha rally the U.S. is ""really not doing (COVID-19) reporting right"" because deaths are being improperly counted and hospitals have an ""incentive"" to pad stats. This is wrong on every point. The U.S. is following the same COVID-19 death reporting guidelines as nearly every other country, which come from the World Health Organization. Under those guidelines, someone with heart disease, cancer or any other disease whose death is hastened by COVID-19 would be listed as COVID-19 death. And while COVID-19 patients do generate slightly higher payments to hospitals if they’re covered by Medicare — due to a bill Trump himself signed — there’s no evidence this has led to any widespread fraud or incorrect reporting as Trump implies. We rate this claim False.  ",/factchecks/2020/oct/27/donald-trump/trump-wrong-claim-us-padding-covid-19-stats/

Donald Trump says you can change your vote in most states. That’s misleading
","Exactly a week before Election Day, President Donald Trump tweeted some voting advice to his supporters, saying they could change their votes from Joe Biden to him. ""Strongly Trending (Google) since immediately after the second debate is CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE? This refers changing it to me. The answer in most states is YES. Go do it. Most important Election of your life!"" Strongly Trending (Google) since immediately after the second debate is CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE? This refers changing it to me. The answer in most states is YES. Go do it. Most important Election of your life! The answer is actually most likely no. (We’ll deal later on with whether the question ""Can I change my vote"" was trending on Google.) Voting experts say this tactic is not as widely available as Trump suggested. It depends heavily on the status of your ballot.  ""It is not correct that most states allow you to cancel an already cast absentee ballot,"" said Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""It depends on when processing begins and what processing means in that state. The majority of states would not allow voters to cancel already cast ballots."" The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Here are some scenarios when it comes to your ballot.  This is the category that gives voters the most options. Obviously, if you haven’t marked your ballot yet, you can simply mark your current choice and submit it. It gets a bit trickier if you’ve marked your ballot, want to change your vote, but haven’t turned in the ballot yet.  An analysis of state election laws by ProPublica found that most states will allow people to cancel an as-yet unreturned ballot as long as they come in to vote in person and work with election officials to make sure their records indicate that the in-person vote is the one that should count. In some states, the voter will have to cast a provisional ballot in this situation. Often, election officials will need to take possession of the un-cast ballot and destroy it. Experts say there are three states — Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan — that specifically allow you to change your mind and cast a new ballot before Election Day. But it depends on when you change your mind. ""Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan have clear rules about canceling an already cast absentee ballot,"" Weil said. However, Weil added that Minnesota’s deadline for doing this has already passed. In Connecticut, you may be able to change your mind, depending on what township you’re voting in, added Jessica Huseman, who is the lead reporter for ProPublica’s Electionland project, which covers election administration. The key in all cases is whether your ballot has been tabulated yet. If it’s been counted, you can’t call it back. ""Once the ballot envelopes are verified for eligibility and the ballots are removed from the envelope and put through a tabulator, that’s the ball game,"" Weil said. ""Once a ballot is in a tabulator, it can’t be canceled, because you can’t link it back to a specific voter."" So, in a state that only starts counting ballots on Election Day, such as New York, it is possible for a person to vote in person and have that take precedence over a mail ballot you cast earlier. In other states, however, ballots are counted before Election Day, making this approach impossible. If you’ve voted in person, you’re out of luck. ""I cannot think of a way for a person to change an in-person vote, because votes are secret and you can’t call it back,"" Huseman said. ""This is the same reason that you can’t recast an already-counted mail in vote, because after it leaves the envelope it is no longer traced to you."" Experts said they aren’t aware of solid data on how often ballots are called back because the voter changed their mind, but they said it’s probably rare. ""It cannot be a huge number, since we know that most absentee ballots that are requested are ultimately counted as submitted,"" Weil said. For the record, there was a spike in Google searching of ""Can I change my vote"" during the week of Oct. 18 to Oct. 24, though it had been rising fairly consistently since early September.    Still, Trump’s statement doesn’t tell the whole story. One potential reason that the phrase spiked on Google could be that, as Election Day gets closer, more voters are starting to research the voting process. That jibes with other Trends data that reveal an influx of searches for early and mail-in voting. In 2016, there was a similar uptick in searches for ""Can I change my vote?"" in the days leading up to Election Day. This year, search interest in other voting-related phrases, such as ""Where can I vote?"" and ""early voting,"" also spiked around the same time that ""Can I change my vote?"" started to tick up. Google Trends says the top election-related searches from the past week are generic, such as ""election"" and ""polls."" Google warns against reading too much into the data. ""A spike in a particular topic does not reflect that a topic is somehow ‘popular’ or ‘winning,’ only that for some unspecified reason, there appear to be many users performing a search about a topic,"" Google says in an FAQ page. ""Google Trends data should always be considered as one data point among others before drawing conclusions."" Trump tweeted, ""CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE? ... The answer in most states is YES."" This may be feasible for voters who have not yet returned their mail ballot, as long as they go in to vote in person and work with election officials to cancel their original ballot. This fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more However, only a handful of states explicitly allow ballots that have been cast to be called back prior to Election Day.

Great Barrington herd immunity document widely disputed by scientists

""BREAKING NEWS,"" one post on Facebook reads. ""The world renowned experts in their fields, after a 4 day conference regarding COVID-19, declare that WE SHOULD ALL GO BACK TO LIVING NORMALLY, PRACTICING SIMPLE HYGIENE & STAYING HOME WHEN SICK (NO FACE MASKS OR SOCIAL DISTANCING) and only protect the most vulnerable populations with more protective measures!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The social media post doesn’t provide the full picture. It’s accurate that three scientists authored a letter that endorses herd immunity and supports a completely reopened society for those with no underlying health conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Since its publication in early October, however, the document has been widely criticized by scientists and denounced by top health officials and thousands of doctors around the world.  The document was drawn up following a meeting hosted by the libertarian think-tank American Institute for Economic Research. Named the ""Great Barrington Declaration"" after the Massachusetts town in which it was drafted, the paper was signed by scientists and health experts across the world. But a British broadcast station found that some of those who signed the letter online used fake names, including ""Dr. Person Fakename"" and ""Dr. Johnny Bananas."" The signatures were later made private. The plan was put together by three scientists from prestigious universities: Dr. Sunetra Gupta of Oxford University, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University, and Martin Kulldorff of Harvard University. But none in the group have published any peer-reviewed studies about the coronavirus, and some have advocated for herd immunity over lockdowns for months, telling policymakers that the virus isn’t that deadly. The plan, which they describe as ""focused protection,"" calls for only protecting ""vulnerable"" people and for otherwise healthy people to live life as normal, as if the virus doesn’t exist, thus opening up the avenue for them to get infected with COVID-19. It reads, in part:  ""The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk... ""Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity."" The controversial idea falls in line with the Trump administration’s position on reopening the United States during the pandemic, and the authors discussed the strategy in a meeting with Alex Azar, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Scott Atlas, a Stanford neuroradiologist on the White House coronavirus task force, Buzzfeed News reported. White House officials also embraced the paper. The document was quickly and emphatically rejected by the greater scientific and medical community, including top U.S. health officials, the World Health Organization and the United Kingdom government. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called the declaration ""ridiculous"" and ""total nonsense"" in an interview with ABC News: ""If you talk to anybody who has any experience in epidemiology and infectious disease they will tell you that that is risky, and you will wind up with many more infections of vulnerable people, which will lead to hospitalizations and deaths. So I think we just gotta look that square in the eye and say it’s nonsense."" ""Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak, let alone a pandemic. It is scientifically and ethically problematic,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news conference on Oct. 12. Matt Hancock, the UK’s health secretary, attacked the document in Parliament on Oct. 13, saying that many infectious diseases never reach herd immunity, and called it a flawed goal without a vaccine. Hancock also took issue with the paper’s idea of separating the elderly and vulnerable. ""That is simply not possible,"" Hancok said. ""As the medical director of the NHS said yesterday, we cannot somehow fence off the elderly and the vulnerable from risk while everyone else returns to normal. It is neither conscionable nor practicable — not when so many people live in intergenerational homes, not when older people need carers who of course themselves live in the community, and not when young people can suffer the debilitating impact of long COVID. ...If we let this virus continue unchecked, the loss of life would be simply too great to contemplate.""  Thousands of other experts have also spoken out against the declaration.  A counter-memo, first published in the Lancet medical journal and signed by a group of 80 researchers, called the idea ""a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence."" More than 6,400 scientists, researchers and healthcare professionals have since signed the memo. A Facebook post says ""world renowned experts in their fields"" have determined that the vulnerable should still be protected amid COVID-19, but those without underlying medical conditions should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Three scientists authored a declaration that calls for what they termed ""focused protection"" — shielding the vulnerable while otherwise healthy people to return to schools, offices and restaurants. Readers who see the social media post and nothing else will be left with the wrong impression about the safety of such a plan. It was immediately denounced by top health officials and thousands of doctors and scientists around the world, who say that the plan is dangerous and nearly impossible to execute in a world where vulnerable populations cannot ethically live in isolation.

No, this photo of Paul Pelosi Jr. doesn’t show him abusing a girl, isn’t linked to laptop
","Social media misinformation is trying to implicate relatives of powerful Democrats in the saga about a recovered computer hard drive. One post shared on Oct. 26 shows Paul Pelosi Jr., the son of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in an image with what appears to be a young Asian girl with bandages on her arms.  The caption reads: ""Just Nancy Pelosi’s son with a tied up Asian girl doing lines of coke.

The stories detail an alleged relationship between Pelosi Jr. and a woman named Karena Feng, who is identified in the stories as a ""Taiwan-born woman living in San Francisco."" The photo is one of many in the story that appears to depict Pelosi Jr. with Feng’s children. It shows the girl is cutting a cake with material wrapped around her elbows and wrists.

In Texas House race, Kulkarni distorts Nehls’ take on mask mandate and communists
","In a tight contest for an open House seat in the Houston area, Democrat Sri Preston Kulkarni is attacking his Repubican opponent, Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls, over his response to COVID-19 safety precautions.  In a Facebook ad, he claims Nehls ""called wearing masks 'un-American' and called those who do 'communists.'"" But the attack gets the facts wrong. Kulkarni, a former U.S. foreign-service officer, and Nehls are running for the seat being vacated by Republican Pete Olson, who decided not to run again.  The race is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. It’s rated a tossup by the Cook Political Report. We rated Half True a super PAC’s claim that Kulkarni attended ""notorious desert drug parties"" and was arrested for cocaine. The party reference was to Burning Man, the Nevada arts and spirituality festival; and his drug arrest was when he was 18. Kulkarni’s campaign cited comments Nehls made in a post on his campaign Facebook page on April 22, the day that Judge Linda Hidalgo, the top official in neighboring Harris County, issued an order that residents age 10 and over wear a face covering when outside the home, or face a fine of up to $1,000.  Nehls wrote, in part:  ""I encourage people to wear a mask if they have one, I encourage people to wash their hands frequently, I encourage people to do the right thing to help protect our most vulnerable, but this government MANDATE from Harris County is unnecessary, unconstitutional, and unAmerican. It’s an unprecedented overreach which looks more like a communist dictatorship than a free Republic."" The broader context of Nehls’ comment makes clear that he was not referring to the wearing of masks, or to the people who wear them, as Kulkarni’s ad suggests. Nehls was describing the Harris County order as un-American. Kulkarni claimed that Nehls ""called wearing masks 'un-American' and called those who do 'communists.'""

No evidence Hunter Biden had photos of Coons’ daughter
","The unproven claims of a Delaware Senate candidate have inspired a rash of conspiratorial Facebook posts about Joe Biden’s son. An Oct. 24 post claims a conservative news outlet reported that a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden contains illicit images of the daughter of Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. ""BREAKING: The daughter of Sen. Coons (D-DE), along with 7 other underaged girls are featured on Hunter’s laptop! - Breitbart News,"" the post says. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim has also made its way to TikTok and YouTube. Since the New York Post published a story Oct. 14 in which it claimed to have information from a computer hard drive owned by Hunter Biden, similar unproven attacks against him have swirled on social media. So we took a closer look at this claim. (Screenshot from Facebook) There is no evidence that a computer hard drive previously belonging to Hunter Biden contains illicit images of Coons’ teenage daughter. The claim comes from a U.S. Senate candidate who has previously shared posts related to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory about child sex trafficking. On Oct. 24, Lauren Witzke, a Republican who’s running against Coons to represent Delaware in the Senate, tweeted an audio clip from an interview with Breitbart News. The post has been shared more than 8,700 times and amplified by conservative outlets like the Gateway Pundit. During the interview, Witzke made a variety of accusations against Joe Biden, including that he is ""owned by China."" While discussing Hunter Biden’s purported laptop, she said: ""Chris Coons' daughter, in addition to seven other underage girls, are also featured on the laptop."" Breitbart did not independently report this as news, as the Facebook posts make it seem. Coons is one of Joe Biden’s biggest supporters in Washington, and his daughter has previously been the subject of disinformation that falsely claims Biden is a pedophile. One often-used photo shows Biden touching her arm as he leans in to whisper something. In her interview with Breitbart, Witzke cited ""sources close to and that have deep knowledge in the investigation."" We reached out to her for evidence to substantiate her comments, but she did not offer any. We haven’t heard back from the Biden campaign. Her comments play into QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that claims President Donald Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of Democratic, Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles. Before winning Delaware’s Republican primary in September, Witzke tried to distance herself from QAnon. But Witzke has been photographed wearing a T-shirt sporting a giant ""Q"" and tweeted a slogan used by its supporters. There is no publicly available evidence to support Witzke’s claim — and neither Breitbart nor the New York Post have reported such a finding. RELATED: Fact-checking claims about Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, and China The New York Post’s story about Hunter Biden relies on information from a computer hard drive that the tabloid said it received from Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer. The computer was supposedly left unclaimed at a Delaware computer shop, the owner of which called the FBI and a Giuliani associate after noticing a sticker for the Beau Biden Foundation on the laptop. We are not able to verify the emails cited in the Post’s article, which claims Hunter Biden set up a meeting between his father and a Ukrainian businessman. But the story does not establish that such a meeting ever took place, and the Post did not report that Hunter Biden possessed images of minors. The FBI declined to comment for a previous fact-check due to its practice of ""neither confirming nor denying the existence of an investigation."" Giuliani also hasn’t returned our messages about the hard drive. No other news organizations have seen or corroborated the data supposedly on the laptop.  Because of that, we can’t say for certain what is or isn’t on the hard drive at the center of the New York Post’s story.  The Facebook posts say, ""The daughter of Sen. Coons (D-DE), along with 7 other underaged girls are featured on Hunter's laptop!"" The posts are attributed to Breitbart, but the conservative news and opinion site did not publish such an allegation. A U.S. Senate candidate, running against Coons, repeated this claim in an interview with Breitbart. The candidate offered no evidence to back up her claim about illicit material on a computer hard drive connected to Hunter Biden.

Trump wrongly accuses DC mayor of calling for removal of Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial
","President Donald Trump attacked Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, wrongly accusing her during a campaign rally of recommending that the city get rid of two storied landmarks. ""We have a mayor in D.C. who formed a commission with recommendations,"" Trump said Oct. 24 in Circleville, Ohio. ""Her recommendation is: Take down the Washington Monument, close up the Lincoln Monument. No, no. These are serious. You read about it.""  ""I said, ‘No, thank you. No, thank you. No, thank you, madam mayor. We're going to keep the Washington Monument just the way it is.’ These people. These people are crazy.""  Trump’s comment mischaracterized the recommendations of a city commission that spent the summer reviewing the namesakes of more than 1,300 schools, buildings, parks, streets, public spaces and monuments throughout the nation’s capital.  The working group suggested that the city rename a number of its properties, often because of the namesakes’ connections to slavery, systemic racism or other forms of social injustice. It also called on Bowser to urge the federal government to ""remove, relocate or contextualize'' eight federal statues and memorials, including the Washington Monument. But Bowser never recommended that the city ""take down"" the Washington Monument or ""close up"" the Lincoln Memorial. The Lincoln Memorial was never mentioned in the commission’s report, which has since been edited to remove the recommendations for federal properties. Situated on the National Mall, both the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial are on federal land, putting them outside of the control of Bowser or the city government. Renaming them would require action from Congress, according to DCist. The mayor’s office and Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Bowser convened the working group in July following unrest in Washington and elsewhere over the May police killing of George Floyd, a Black man from Minneapolis.  The purpose of the commission, Bowser said on Twitter, was to ensure that the legacies of people honored with their names on buildings or other public spaces were consistent with the city’s values. In a 24-page report published in September, the commission laid out whether certain city-owned facilities should be ""removed, renamed or contextualized."" The group looked primarily at whether the namesakes had ""key disqualifying histories,"" such as participation in slavery, systemic racism or the mistreatment of minority groups. It suggested that the city rename 21 of its public schools; nine of its residential buildings and campuses; 12 of its parks, fields and playgrounds; and seven of its government buildings. Relevant to Trump’s claim, the commission also recommended that Bowser use her position on the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission to lobby the federal government to ""remove, relocate or contextualize"" eight federal properties.  The report did not specify what it was recommending for each of the properties listed, which included iconic landmarks such as the Jefferson Memorial and Washington Monument, both named for former presidents who enslaved people.  But the rollout of the report was met with criticism from the White House and the president’s allies, some of whom misrepresented the report’s intentions as calling for the removal of the Washington Monument, according to the Washington Post.  To address the confusion, Bowser had the report shortened by a page, removing the page related to federal properties. LaToya Foster, a spokesperson for Bowser’s office, told the Washington Post the commission’s proposal for the federal properties was ""contextualizing, not removing."" ""Mayor Bowser has asked the (committee) to clarify and refine their recommendations to focus on local D.C.,"" Foster said, according to the Washington Post.  Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser speaks during a news conference on Sept. 4, 2020, in Washington. (AP/Brandon) ""My expectation of the report was that it would not include any recommendations on federal buildings,"" Bowser said in a Sept. 3 press conference. ""When I saw the final report, and I could see immediately how its recommendations could be easily misconstrued or purposely misconstrued, so we removed it."" FactCheck.org, the Associated Press and USA Today previously debunked social media posts that, like Trump, wrongly accused Bowser of calling for the Washington Monument’s removal.  Trump said, ""We have a mayor in D.C. who formed a commission with recommendations. Her recommendation is: Take down the Washington Monument, close up the Lincoln Monument. No, no. These are serious."" Bowser has not petitioned for tearing down the Washington Monument or Lincoln Memorial.  A report from a working group she established in July did urge her to encourage the federal government to ""remove, relocate or contextualize"" the Washington Monument, not the Lincoln Memorial. But the mayor had the references to federal monuments deleted from the report, and her office quickly clarified that the commission’s call was for ""contextualizing, not removing.""  We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/oct/26/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-accuses-dc-mayor-calling-removal-was/

Pa. Rep. Scott Perry airs debunked claim that Wuhan lab ‘constructed’ coronavirus
","Editor’s note, May 20, 2021: When this fact-check was first published in October 2020, PolitiFact’s sources included researchers who asserted the SARS-CoV-2 virus could not have been manipulated. That assertion is now more widely disputed. Read our May 2021 report for more on the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. That dispute notwithstanding, the claim that COVID-19 was constructed at the Wuhan institute remains False. Facing a tight reelection race, U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., turned to an anti-China media outlet to pitch his bill seeking to designate the Chinese Communist Party as a transnational organized crime group. His interviewer was Simone Gao, who is affiliated with The Epoch Times and sister TV station NTD News. In the Oct. 17 interview, posted a few weeks after Perry introduced his bill, Gao turned to COVID-19. She asked Perry what has been the effect of President Donald Trump’s contracting the virus. Perry said Trump’s recovery ""gives us hope as Americans in our ability to conquer the virus that came from China, in my opinion, was constructed in the Wuhan Institute of Virology and then was spread around the world, either by accident or on purpose.""  Perry’s campaign didn’t respond to our requests for information to back his statement. Despite numerous such claims, there is no evidence that the coronavirus was created at the Chinese institute. Perry, in Congress since 2013, is being challenged by Democrat Eugene DePasquale, the state’s auditor general, for the seat  representing Pennsylvania’s 10th congressional district, which surrounds Harrisburg, the state capital. The race is rated a tossup by the Cook Political Report. It is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.  Here’s what we know from having fact-checked several claims that the virus that causes COVID-19 was created in a lab — a conspiracy theory that has been debunked since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic: The consensus of the scientific community and international public health organizations is that the coronavirus emerged from bats and later jumped to humans. The first outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China. Scientists worldwide have publicly shared the genetic makeup of the coronavirus thousands of times. If the virus had been altered in a lab, there would be evidence in its genome. But there isn’t. That doesn’t rule out the possibility that Chinese researchers were studying the virus in a lab when it managed to spread outside the lab, which is something that the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency has considered. But the agency has also said there is ""no credible evidence to indicate SARS-CoV-2 was released intentionally or was created as a biological weapon."" Perry said the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was ""constructed"" in a Wuhan, China, lab. There’s no evidence to support this. Scientists who’ve studied the virus’s genetic makeup say that it is a naturally occuring virus. We rate Perry’s statement False.

Bipartisanship rankings show Joni Ernst toward the top
","Republican Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst touted her bipartisan record at a debate against Democratic opponent Theresa Greenfield on Oct. 15, saying she was ranked as one of the most bipartisan senators in the last 25 years.  ""I am so honored to be named as one of the most bipartisan senators in the United States Senate in the last 25 years,"" she said. It was similar to a more specific statement about the rating’s source that she made at a Sept. 28 debate between the two candidates: ""I have been ranked as one of the most bipartisan Senators by Georgetown University over the last 25 years from any state of either party,"" Ernst said at the earlier debate. Ernst is seeking reelection against Democrat Theresa Greenfield, and has been criticized by Democrats for sticking with Republican President Donald Trump when voting in Congress.  We checked the Georgetown University Bipartisan Index and saw that Ernst was ranked 34th among 98 senators actively serving in the U.S. Senate in 2019. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConell and minority leader Chuck Schumer were excluded from the analysis.  The Bipartisan Index, a joint project of the Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University, also showed Ernst’s voting record as ranking 39th out of 250 senators in the last 20 years.  Ernst’s campaign said the Bipartisan Index rating puts her in the top 15 percent of most bipartisan senators, campaign spokesperson Brendan Conley wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan. A check of the index shows Ernst in the top 15.6 percent. Dan Diller, the policy director at The Lugar Center, wrote in an email that the Index is not a subjective judgment. Rather, he said, it is based on objective statistics applied to every senator to determine the frequency with which a member co-sponsors bills introduced by the senator’s opposing party, and the frequency with which a member’s own bills are co-sponsored by a member of the opposite party. He said senators are then compared with the average score of peers over the 25 years of data. ""Using this standard, Sen. Ernst scores very well, though not in the very top echelon,"" Diller wrote. ""Her lifetime score places her roughly in the 84th percentile of senators measured. I don’t know Senator Ernst’s precise words, but it would be for…Iowa voters to decide whether they were accurate based on her rankings.""  While Diller wrote that Ernst has earned high scores – well above the historical average  – indicating frequent cooperation with Democrats at the time legislation was introduced, he added that other measures of bipartisanship exist. So, we’ll take a stab at her statement by looking at the data, and other measures, knowing that any U.S. senator votes more often with their own party than they do with the opposition party.  Ernst may cooperate with Democrats at the time legislation is introduced, but she votes in line with Republican President Trump’s position 91 percent of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight, which tracks the president’s political positions and how senators vote on them.  Raw vote counts aren’t an absolute measure either, according to Ian Ostrander, an assistant professor of American politics at Michigan State University. ""Some votes matter much more than others,"" he wrote to PolitiFact in September. In another measure, though, Ernst is ranked as the second most conservative senator by GovTrack, behind Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. The GovTrack ideology score measures senators ""according to their legislative behavior by whether they sponsor and co-sponsor overlapping sets of bills and resolutions with other Members of Congress."" Overall, 26.4 percent of the bills Ernst co-sponsored in 2019 were introduced by a Democrat. GovTrack ranked her 52nd among senators for the percent of bills co-sponsored that were introduced by the other party. She introduced 18 bipartisan bills in 2019, which put her in a five-way tie for 38th place among senators for the number of bills introduced, according to GovTrack.  Of the 48 bills Ernst introduced during the 119th Congress, 20 were cosponsored by Democrats, but only two of the bills Ernst introduced passed the Senate. Both were bipartisan votes on veterans issues, according to the U.S. Congress record of bills introduced.  Ernst said she is ranked one of the most bipartisan senators in the Senate over the last 25 years.  Ernst has high scores of frequent cooperation with Democrats when legislation is presented, higher than the historical average. That indicates she is willing to work across the aisle when introducing legislation, especially according to the Georgetown University Bipartisan Index. An overall claim that she is one of the most bipartisan U.S. senators may be slightly misleading because 38 current senators ranked in front of her in The Bipartisan Index’s 2019 rankings. Moreover, a senator’s bipartisanship also can be determined through voting records, rhetoric, and other factors. Ernst votes in line with the Republican president 90 percent of the time, and is considered by GovTrack, which gauges bills she sponsors and co-sponsors, to be one of the most conservative senators ideologically. Her score from other groups tempers the absolute claim of working in a strong, bipartisan fashion more often than her colleagues. Still, Ernst places relatively high in two rankings of bipartisanship. So we rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/oct/26/joni-ernst/bipartisanship-rankings-show-joni-ernst-toward-top/

Viral image of migrant ‘cages’ is from 2019, not Obama years
","The final presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden grew heated when Trump criticized the Obama administration for detaining migrants in chain-link enclosures along the U.S.-Mexico border. ""They built cages,"" Trump said. ""They used to say I built the cages ... And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him. They built cages."" Over the next few minutes, the president repeated the line, ""Who built the cages?"" four times. After the debate, the line inspired a slew of widely shared memes on Facebook. ""Who built the cages, Joe?"" reads text over an image of President Barack Obama wearing a hard hat and posing in front of what appear to be migrants inside an enclosure. The post was published Oct. 23 by Dinesh D’Souza, a conservative political commentator. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Using CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool, we found hundreds of similar posts that have been shared thousands of times. (Screenshot from Facebook) The Obama administration did hold immigrants in chain-link enclosures described as ""cages"" at border processing facilities. But the photo shared in the Facebook posts is not from his tenure. The image shows overcrowded migrant detention facilities in summer 2019 — during the Trump administration. The image comes from a July 2019 Homeland Security Inspector General report on overcrowding at immigrant detention facilities in the Rio Grande Valley area of Texas. The report says the photo shows ""overcrowding of families observed by OIG on June 10, 2019,"" in McAllen, Texas. A memo included in the report was addressed to Kevin McAleenan, who was acting Homeland Security secretary.  ""Specifically, we encourage the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults in the Rio Grande Valley,"" then-acting Inspector General Jennifer Costello wrote in the memo. Still, the post has a point about the Obama administration’s use of chain-link enclosures along the southern border — the barriers seen in the photo were erected under Obama. In 2014, the Obama administration faced an influx of migrants entering the U.S. illegally. Some Border Patrol stations were so overcrowded that agents used other areas, including warehouses, to hold migrants. Border Patrol used chain-link fencing to separate different groups, as documented in photos from that time period. ""We needed to have places like the one we set up temporarily in Arizona to house the kids until they could be placed with (Health and Human Services),"" said Jeh Johnson, a former Homeland Security secretary during the Obama administration, in a July 2019 interview. ""And the partitions you see, some call them cages, are meant to separate the women from the men, the girls from the boys. But these were temporary."" RELATED: Fact-checking Biden on use of cages for immigrants during Obama administration The Trump administration has also used chain-link enclosures, but the Obama administration differed in a key way: It did not have a policy to separate children from their families. The Trump administration’s ""zero-tolerance"" policy prosecuted all adults who crossed the border illegally and sent their children to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. The Facebook post uses a misleading image to make a point about immigrants in federal custody during Obama’s presidency. While the enclosures in the photo were built under Obama, the photo was not from his time as president — it’s from 2019.  The post is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
