Ad says Barack 'Obama’s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt.'
","
In a new ad, the pro-Republican group American Crossroads takes aim at President Barack Obama’s economic policies. At one point, the narrator says, that ""Obama’s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt.""

We previously examined a similar -- but opposite claim -- when Obama said that ""over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but 90 percent of that is as a consequence of"" President George W. Bush’s policies and the recession.

We ruled Obama’s claim False, and a recalculation of the same numbers can shed some light on the American Crossroads claim as well. We contacted American Crossroads for this fact-check, but a spokesman did not respond to our inquiry.

First, the bottom-line number on the debt: Yes, it has grown by $5 trillion during Obama’s tenure. Total debt has increased by $5.5 trillion since January 20, 2009, while the share of that debt held by the public has increased by $5 trillion.

But it’s not entirely correct to hang that increase on ""Obama’s spending"" alone.

In our previous item, we looked at calculations by the Treasury Department based on data from the Congressional Budget Office, the independent number-crunching arm of Congress.

To figure out what caused the accumulation of deficits over the past decade, CBO tracked the surplus it had projected back in 2001 and compared it with the actual cumulative deficits that resulted instead. CBO specifically broke out how much several laws contributed to the deficit, some of which started under Bush and some under Obama.

Because American Crossroads was only referring to the debt added during Obama’s tenure, we only looked at fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. And because the American Crossroads ad does not reference how much the deficits fell below the surpluses that had been forecast by CBO, we’re going to exclude from our calculations a category CBO called its own ""failures to predict economic conditions accurately.""

We added up the lost revenue and additional spending each year and then calculated their percentage of the deficits over those three years.

Spending
   
Spending initiated by Bush policies: 4 percent of total deficits in 2009, 2010 and 2011
Spending initiated by Obama policies:  11 percent
Other increases in discretionary spending: 32 percent
Other increases in mandatory spending: 6 percent
   
Revenue reductions
   
Revenue reductions initiated by Bush policies: 11 percent
Revenue reductions initiated by Obama policies: 13 percent
Other unclassified revenue reductions: 5 percent
   
Interest

Net interest: 19 percent

The spending increases traceable to programs clearly attributable to Obama, combined with the increase in discretionary spending on his watch, account for about 43 percent of the three years worth of deficits.

So if you’re talking about what ""drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt,"" then a clear majority stemmed from sources other than ""Obama’s spending.""

If you expand the definition from ""Obama’s spending"" to ""Obama’s spending and tax cuts,"" you get to a total of 56 percent. Throw in 13 percentage points for the added interest costs of Obama’s policies and you’re at 69 percent.

Our ruling

The American Crossroads ad claims that ""Obama’s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt."" 
But not all of the $5 trillion can be attributed to Obama's spending. Much of it can be attributed to his tax cuts and the policies of President Bush.  On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B3A280>],/factchecks/2012/oct/09/american-crossroads/ad-says-barack-obamas-spending-drove-us-5-trillion/

Obama ties Romney to Chinese exporter
","
President Barack Obama continues to go after Mitt Romney for investing in companies that sent jobs overseas.

A recent Obama ad combines the outsourcing charge with an attack on Romney’s claim that he would take a tougher line than the president on trade with China.

It features grainy photos of Chinese factory workers in assembly plants. An announcer says: 
""These appliances could have been made here in America. But a company called Global-Tech maximized profits by paying its workers next to nothing under sweatshop conditions in China. 
  
When Mitt Romney led Bain, they saw Global-Tech as a good investment even knowing that the firm promoted its practice of exploiting low-wage labor to its investors. 
Mitt Romney, tough on China? Since when?"" 
We have done other fact checks on claims related to Romney’s investments in firms that engaged in outsourcing. This time, we decided to examine whether it is accurate to say that Global-Tech's appliances ""could have been made here in America.""

Romney and Global-Tech

Of course, any product could be made in the U.S. if a manufacturer built a plant. For this fact-check, though, we'll explore whether Global-Tech's small appliances could reasonably have been made here.

Romney’s investment company, Bain Capital, bought a 10.3 percent share in Global-Tech Appliances through a subsidiary in 1998, according to a July article in Mother Jones. In a prospectus that year, Global-Tech described that it had two factories in China that produced coffee makers, bread makers, and other small appliances for some of the best known brands, such as Sunbeam, Hamilton Beach, Mr. Coffee, Oster and others.

It boasted that the combination of retail trends, superior manufacturing technology and low wage rates had fueled a three-fold rise in sales from $31 million in 1995 to $96 million in 1998.

The Romney campaign rebutted the ad’s claims saying, ""This is another 'overboard' ad from a president who is trying to distract from his failure to stand up to China."" However, the campaign did not correct any of the ad’s details about Bain and Global-Tech.

What was brewing with small appliances

The ad’s larger point is that Romney boosted the trend toward low-cost overseas production at the expense of American jobs. The ad sets that up by saying ""these appliances"" -- meaning those coffee makers and hair dryers made by Global-Tech -- could in fact have been made in the U.S.

But is that a fair assumption?  We tried to get a picture of what was going on with the business of small home appliances in 1998, the year Romney invested in the Hong Kong based company.

Coffee makers are a good example. According to the United Nations Commodity Trade database, in 1993, China exported about $23 million worth of coffee makers to the U.S. By 1998, business had doubled to $46 million. Add in the exports from Hong Kong to America and the total reached over $100 million. Goods made in China destined for the U.S. often flowed through Hong Kong.

Americans seemed to have an almost insatiable demand for imported coffee makers and Chinese/Hong Kong imports satisfied over a third of it. At the time, the U.S. share of total world exports of coffee makers was about 3 percent, or $30 million.

Gary Hamilton, a professor of international studies and sociology at the University of Washington who focuses on consumer goods, says the situation with coffee makers was typical.

""The manufacture of most such consumer goods had already left the U.S."" before Bain bought its stake in Global-Tech, Hamilton said. ""Some as many as 10 to 15 years earlier.""

Hamilton said this was the result of forces that had begun to take shape in the 1970s. It wasn’t just low wages in China and other countries. Western companies invested in technology like barcodes and scanners that allowed them to manage inventory and supply chains across the globe. Container ships got bigger, which made transport much cheaper. The companies that made goods, such as Sunbeam, bought out similar brands and consolidated, while the on the retail side, firms such as Wal-Mart built enormous buying power.

The end result made American production of these goods increasingly less competitive.

""There is every reason to think that the manufacture of these items would not then and would not now return to the U.S.,"" Hamilton said.

The remaining manufacturers

There are still U.S. companies making things such as coffee makers and blenders but they occupy a tiny sliver of the market. David Riley runs Americans Working, a website that lists goods made in the U.S.. Riley noted that Bunn, an iconic coffee machine brand, is still operating in Illinois. But, ""I think only high end personal units and commercial,"" he said. A similar website, Still Made in USA, said the same thing. We called Bunn and never heard back.

There are exceptions, but in general, the more expensive the item, the better the odds it can be made profitably in the U.S.

KitchenAid makes mixers and blenders at its plant in Greenville, Ohio, according to the website Still Made in USA. But its coffee grinders are largely made in India with final assembly in the U.S. It is not uncommon for manufacturers to outsource their more affordable lines while keeping the costlier versions domestic.

We took a look at companies in Germany, Switzerland and Italy where exports of coffee makers remain robust. In recent years, Italy favored the world with some $500 million a year in espresso and latte makers. But there too, those countries succeeded at the high-end of marketplace and some firms outsourced their more garden variety products to low-wage nations.

We should note that some big ticket products such as refrigerators and stoves retain a sizable footprint in America. General Electric told Consumer Reports it is investing $1 billion to expand its line of washing machines and dryers in Louisville, Ky..Frigidaire, owned by Sweden’s Electrolux, produces dishwashers in Kinston, N.C.

If the Obama ad had referred to a broader set of home goods than just the ones made by Global Tech, then there is some basis to find that the appliances could have been produced in the U.S. But the ad was fairly specific about what products it had in mind. And in 1998, as now, those products were overwhelmingly made in other countries.

Our ruling

The Obama campaign ad said, ""These appliances could have been made here in America.""

For the coffee makers and other items that Global-Tech produced, that is conceivable but unlikely. The U.S. had the technology and the trained people to do the work. But the economics of global trade made that unworkable well before Romney and Bain invested in the firm.

We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971D7D40>],/factchecks/2012/oct/09/barack-obama/obama-ties-romney-chinese-exporter/

American Crossroads attacks Bill Nelson on health care and Medicare, and that oft-repeated ""deciding vote""
","
American Crossroads makes multiple claims about health care and Medicare in a recent ad attacking U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla.

The ad shows a bleak photo of an empty examining table: ""This is where seniors could find out their Medicare benefits have been rationed or don’t cover their treatments,"" states the narrator.

Then the scene moves to a boardroom table: ""And this is where 15 unelected bureaucrats could decide to cut Medicare spending, cuts that could go into effect without Congressional approval. And this is where Sen. Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board decide what gets covered here,"" showing pictures of the U.S. Capitol and a hospital hallway.

The claims by the conservative PAC are similar to other claims we’ve fact-checked, but the wording is slightly different. We will evaluate whether Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board make coverage decisions. (We contacted American Crossroads for their evidence, but we didn't hear back.)

Deciding vote?

Accusing Nelson of casting ""the deciding vote"" on the health care law has become a conservative talking point as he faces U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers. Ads from outside spending groups such as American Commitment, the 60 Plus Association and Mack himself have all made similar claims.

As we explained in an earlier fact-check, the health care law was passed with several very close votes. One of the key votes happened on Dec. 24, 2009, when 59 Democrats and one independent voted together in favor of the bill. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters.) The ad cites a vote on Dec. 23 on a cloture motion which passed 60-39 with Nelson voting in the majority to move the bill forward.

Opponents of the law have argued that any of those 60 cast the deciding vote, because every vote was needed to pass the bill.

We find that argument unpersuasive (see our previous report), because there’s evidence in the record to show that some of those votes were more critical than others. On the health care law, some senators did hold out until the last minute -- but Nelson -- as in Bill Nelson of Florida -- wasn’t one of them.
  
The Los Angeles Times, which wrote extensively about the negotiations in passing the law, reported that some of the most crucial votes came from Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.; Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb.; and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.

Nelson was initially quiet about health care reform, angering some Democratic activists. But in October 2009, Nelson joined other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee in voting for the health care plan. Nelson wasn’t a leading early activist of the bill, but he wasn’t a last minute supporter, either. This part of the ad claiming that Nelson cast ""the deciding vote"" is wrong.

Does the health care law cut Medicare spending by $700 billion?

We’ve seen a long list of claims about the health care law and a $700 billion Medicare cut. How accurate the claims are depend on the wording.

As we explained in our previous fact-checks, neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program’s budget.

Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. In its most recent estimates, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law reduced Medicare outlays by $716 billion.

The reductions include the amount of annual increases health care providers would receive from Medicare, administrative changes and alterations to Medicare Advantage.

PolitiFact has repeatedly ruled that these don’t represent cuts, but rather an attempt to curtail future Medicare spending. The program is still projected to grow, the Congressional Budget Office predicts, just at a slower rate under the so-called Obamacare guidelines.

An unelected board

The ad also says that the health care law is ""letting an unelected board decide what gets covered here"" and says Medicare patients could find out their benefits have been ""rationed.""  

We’ve checked a whole slew of claims about the health care law and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. (The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation has a good primer about the board and a longer paper.)

In many cases, political ads have falsely claimed that the board will ration care and deny treatments to patients.

We have previously explained  that the health care law directs the new board — with 15 members who are political appointees — to identify Medicare savings. It's forbidden from submitting ""any recommendation to ration health care,"" as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue. Finally, the board only makes recommendations if Medicare is exceeding its budget targets.

What it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives, this could lead to reductions in services.

But the board wouldn't make any health care decisions for individual Americans. Instead, it would make broad policy decisions that affect Medicare's overall cost.

The does mean the board decides what gets covered, at least in some cases. We should note, though, that Congress can override the board’s decisions if it makes up the cuts some other way.

Our ruling

American Crossroads packs a bunch of claims into one sentence in its ad: ""Sen. Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare,cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board decide what gets covered here.""

Let’s summarize on the three points:

• Nelson cast a vote in favor of the health care law, but news reports suggest he was not even one of a few final hold outs. He did not cast ""the"" deciding vote.

• The health care law cuts future growth of Medicare spending by about $700 billion but it still grows. This part of the ad has some truth to it but requires further explanation.

• The unelected IPAB board is tasked with finding Medicare savings. It can reduce how much government pays for services, and some fear that could lead doctors to not order certain treatments. It does not make decisions for individual patients, but it can recommend changes to bring down costs, including about what gets covered. Its powers are limited, however, and its decisions can be changed by Congress if Congress is willing to identify other savings.  

The Crossroads ad phrases its statements more carefully than some others we’ve seen, but it still gives a misleading impression about what the health care law means for Medicare beneficiaries. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C53180>],/factchecks/2012/oct/09/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-attacks-bill-nelson-health-car/

Did Amanda Fritz oversee an audit that won Portland $2 million?
","
Portland City Council member Amanda Fritz talks a lot about the money she’s saved the city. It’s a central theme in her pitch for a second term on the council.

In a recent campaign mailer, Fritz highlights some of the places she’s been able to earn her keep -- such as when she oversaw the Office of Cable Communications and Franchise Management (now the office for Community Technology). ""Saving money with tough audits,"" the mailer reads. ""Amanda Fritz oversaw an audit that won the city $2 million in franchise fees.""

Any time a politician takes credit for an audit we get a little suspicious -- often they’re not directly involved in the process. So we decided to check this one out.

We called Fritz’s policy adviser, Tim Crail, who told us the audit in question was on XO Communications Services. As Crail explained it, an audit of the city’s contract with the company revealed that it had paid none of the franchise fees due to the city for nearly a decade. The city was owed nearly $2.5 million.

Initially the city was poised to settle for some $1.3 million, he said, but Fritz, who oversaw the office at the time, ""did not want to settle"" and pushed to recoup the full amount. Eventually, the city succeeded in doing just that. Crail forwarded us an email that backed up this version of events.

We also pulled a copy of the agenda item that approved final settlement with the city’s e-file document archive. It backed up the $2.44 million figure that we’d received from Crail. But it also raised a few questions for us.

The item showed a timeline for the audit and eventual settlement that began well before Fritz was in office. The initial audit took place in 2006 and was further bolstered by further investigation in 2007. Fritz didn’t take office until 2008.

To be sure, that was the year that negotiations toward a settlement began in earnest.

It’s probably also worth noting that even if Fritz had been the commissioner in charge of the bureau when it began, she would not have been involved all that much in it.

We spoke with Mary Beth Henry, the manager for Community Technology, and she explained that most audits are done according to a routine schedule, usually a three- or five-year cycle.

It’s not until a company is ""not responding to our information requests and we begin to suspect they're not paying the right amount"" that the office will go to the commissioner in charge for permission to litigate.

That’s around the time Fritz became involved. The city granted permission to litigate and, according to the agenda item, ""negotiations resumed, and the parties … agreed to settle the issues for the full amount of past due principal and interest.""

In her mailer, Fritz said that she ""oversaw an audit that won the city $2 million in franchise fees."" Indeed, while she oversaw the Office of Cable Communications and Franchise Management, the city settled a franchise dispute worth nearly $2.5 million. Still, some clarification is necessary -- namely that the audit began well before she was in office and also that the city was poised to get $1.3 million of the amount due before she intervened. She did push to get more than initially offered, but it’s not as though the city would have left empty-handed otherwise.

We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971C27C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/09/amanda-fritz/did-amanda-fritz-oversee-audit-won-city-2-million/

Ad says Barack Obama promised the jobless rate would be 5.6% if Congress passed the stimulus
","
A new ad claims President Barack Obama broke his promise about the impact of the economic stimulus plan.

The ad uses a familiar Republican talking point, that Obama ""promised"" low unemployment if the stimulus was passed. We've checked many claims it would stay below 8 percent, but this ad says it would drop to 5.6 percent.

It's a flashy ad from pro-Republican super PAC American Crossroads, using gleaming Minority Report-style graphics manipulated by a narrator in an empty warehouse. The version we've seen still running this week uses an outdated number, saying unemployment is ""actually"" 8.1 percent. The latest monthly report, which came out Friday, says it is now 7.8 percent.

In this fact-check, we’re focusing on what Obama said the jobless rate would be if Congress passed a stimulus plan.

Separately, we are checking the ad’s claim that ""Obama’s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt.""

Here’s the full narration: 
The screen displays the line, ""We can’t afford 4 more years.""

 What Obama said

We asked American Crossroads for material to support the ad. Spokesman Jonathan Collegio referred us to a Jan. 9, 2009, report prepared before Obama took office, and a speech by the president-elect.

The report, designed to help Obama argue for an aggressive response to the burgeoning jobs crisis, featured projections for the effect of a stimulus plan.

Those estimates include a chart, ""Unemployment Rate With and Without Recovery Plan,"" that displays a post-stimulus jobless rate around 5.6 percent in mid 2012, like the chart in the American Crossroads ad.

But Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser, also wrote that their estimates were ""subject to significant margins of error,"" and ""considerable uncertainty.""

We’ve previously ruled that the report was not a promise, but a projection, noting its several caveats.

How about the president-elect’s speech introducing the report?

Here, too, we find it's a stretch to describe it as a promise. It doesn’t get into specific jobless rates, but does talk about projected job gains if a stimulus plan — which Congress had yet to write — were to pass.

Collegio pointed out that Obama:

• Said the report presented ""what this plan will mean,"" not ""roughly what this plan might mean.""

• Said ""we’ll create jobs"" not ""could create jobs.""

""Obama did promise it,"" Collegio said.

But Obama’s speech first presents the report’s findings as ""projections,"" and later says that a stimulus plan would ""likely"" save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs. Only then does he simplify his language to say, ""we’ll create"" as he talks about a focus on jobs in energy, health care and infrastructure.

Here’s how he sets it up: 
And as we mentioned, the report carried Romer and Bernstein’s warnings about the uncertainty of their projections, including that ""the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""

As we now know, as the pair prepared their estimates, the economy was already far worse than the best numbers at the time captured. The unemployment rate hit 8 percent even before Obama signed a stimulus package into law in February 2009.

 Our ruling

An ad from American Crossroads says, ""This is what President Obama said the jobless rate would be if we passed the stimulus: 5.6 percent.""

But we find that's a stretch. In the evidence the group provided, Obama doesn’t mention that statistic. Rather, he introduced ""projections"" that included a chart showing the jobless rate falling to 5.6 percent under a recovery plan. The report highlighted the estimates’ ""significant margins of error"" and high uncertainty due to a recession that was ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity."" The economy was, in fact, much worse than economists knew. The chart is now infamous, but it was never pitched as a promise.

Group attempts to link Deal to Koch brothers
","
When it comes to the game of big-money politics, there are few competitors more influential than the Koch brothers -- and supporters of President Barack Obama don’t like the way they play.

Charles and David Koch support libertarian and tea party principles of lower taxes and smaller government, using some of their vast wealth to back causes and candidates that often oppose the president’s policies. The Koch brothers, who own myriad businesses under the umbrella company Koch Industries, have a combined reported fortune of $35 billion.

One group recently came to Georgia to ask Gov. Nathan Deal to denounce the Koch brothers for ""funding laws like voting restrictions that hurt Georgians."" Georgia is one of several states in recent years to pass laws requiring various forms of photo identification at the polls, to the dismay of civil rights groups and Democrats.

""Deal has taken at least $15,600 from the Kochs, their businesses, and their employees,"" Patriot Majority USA, which describes itself as a bipartisan organization, wrote in the news release. The group held a news conference at the state Capitol on Oct. 1 as part of its national tour to push solutions that it says will encourage economic growth.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether this group had its numbers right and whether any context was missing.

Patriot Majority USA describes itself as an organization hoping to empower all Americans. Its action plan includes providing more money for public schools, improving the nation’s roads and bridges, supporting the federal health care law’s provision that allows parents to keep their children on their insurance until the age of 26, and closing tax loopholes for special-interest groups.

Efforts to reach Deal’s office for comment were unsuccessful.

Deal spent $8 million during his successful 2010 campaign for governor. Christy Setzer, a media representative for the organization, sent us a weblink that listed five separate contributions to Deal from individuals it claims are employees who work for companies owned by the Koch brothers.

One of the individuals mentioned was James S. Balloun, a longtime leading Atlanta businessman and civic leader. State records show Balloun has made campaign contributions to a number of prominent Republicans, including Casey Cagle, Karen Handel, Sam Olens and Sonny Perdue, as well as to Deal. Balloun was named a director of Georgia-Pacific in 1998. The company was purchased by Koch Industries in 2005.

As Patriot Majority USA stated, Balloun made contributions of $5,000 and $2,500 to Deal in 2010, according to state campaign finance records. Balloun, however, listed himself as retired when those two contributions were made.

Setzer acknowledged that Balloun retired as a Georgia-Pacific director well before he made the contributions to Deal. She said, though, that Balloun was no ""run of the mill"" employee and that ""there has been speculation in various blogs that Balloun continues to carry water for G-P.""

The other contributions Patriot Majority USA mentioned came from Georgia-Pacific and donors who work at the company.

Balloun said he has never met the Koch brothers and noted that he had retired from Georgia-Pacific when Koch Industries bought the company. Balloun said he was a supporter of Perdue, who was governor from 2003 to 2010. He felt Deal would govern with a similar approach, he said, so he gave money to the Deal campaign.

As for Patriot Majority USA’s claim that Balloun continues to carry water for Georgia-Pacific, he said: ""There’s speculation that the Earth is flat, too.""

PolitiFact Georgia also found some contributions made by Georgia-Pacific and at least one executive, Curley Dossman, to Democrats in Georgia, including former Attorney General Thurbert Baker and former state Sen. Dubose Porter. Those contributions totaled $2,000.

So does that mean the Koch brothers support the policies of these two Democrats because of these contributions?

To sum up, Patriot Majority USA says Deal accepted $15,600 in campaign contributions from businesses owned by the Koch brothers or employees who work for those companies. One of those employees cited had retired by the time he made two contributions to Deal totaling $7,500, nearly half of what Patriot Majority USA mentioned in its news release. The information in the release is not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967A3E80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/09/patriot-majority-usa/group-attempts-link-deal-koch-brothers/
"['Immigration', 'Rhode Island', 'Brendan Doherty']","
 Brendan Doherty says U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, as Providence mayor, “espoused a sanctuary city”
","Between trading shots about bowling and who was more trustworthy during ""10 News Conference,"" on WJAR on Sept. 30, 2012,  Republican Brendan Doherty and incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. David Cicilline had a pointed exchange on immigration policy. 
As Cicilline, Doherty and independent David Vogel were talking about the implications of federal immigration policy, Doherty interjected: ""Congressman Cicilline, when he was the mayor of Providence, espoused a sanctuary city.""

Cicilline responded instantly. ""That’s absolutely not true! Mr. Doherty, and you know that,"" he said. ""That is not true and you know that.""

Well, we don’t know what Doherty knew, but we wondered whether Cicilline had ever espoused Providence as a sanctuary city.

The term ""sanctuary city"" generally means a municipality that has decided not to enforce federal immigration laws or cooperate with the federal government in enforcing them.

In New Haven, Conn., for example, the city issues identification cards to residents regardless of their federal immigration status. In San Francisco, the city and county passed ordinances that say no city or county employee or resources can be used ""to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law or to gather or disseminate information regarding the immigration status of individuals in the City and County of San Francisco"" unless such assistance is required by federal or state law or a court decision.

In 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice was concerned enough to conduct an audit to see  whether any state or local government that received more than $1 million from the Department of Homeland Security was failing to enforce federal immigration law.

The 2007 survey found that San Francisco and the state of Oregon had declared themselves sanctuaries and the mayor of New York City had issued an executive order limiting how local police could enforce immigration law. But even in a case as extreme at San Francisco’s, the department said they operated within the law.

Doherty said he based his statement on his experiences as commander of the Rhode Island State Police during the summer of 2008. Cicilline was Providence mayor at the time and Doherty’s boss, Governor Donald Carcieri, had called on local police departments to check the immigration status of people they arrested or investigated.

Then-Providence Police Chief Dean Esserman -- now the chief in New Haven -- balked.  The department would check the status of arrestees, but would not check unarrested individuals without cause because his department depended on the trust of the city’s immigrant population and doing so could jeopardize that trust.

The difference of opinion became an issue in July 2008, after a Guatemalan man in the country illegally kidnapped a woman in Warwick, took her to Roger Williams Park and raped her.

The man had been previously ordered deported by an immigration judge, but Providence police had picked him up on a misdemeanor before the rape and released him.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) blamed the Providence police for missing the deportation order, saying the locals should have contacted ICE’s Vermont office after they arrested the man on the misdemeanor charge. The Providence police said they’d found nothing when they checked a national arrest warrant database and had faxed a copy of the man’s arraignment sheet to ICE but got no response.

Carcieri harshly criticized Providence’s position. Doherty said it was his impression, after discussing the issue with Esserman, that Providence was intending to become a sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants.  

Cicilline shot back, in news releases and interviews.

""The governor’s assertion that Providence is a ‘sanctuary city’ is wrong,"" Cicilline wrote in a July 16, 2008, Providence Journal commentary. ""A single member of the City Council proposed the idea, which I opposed, and it was never even voted on by the council.""

Our ruling

Brendan Doherty said David Cicilline ""espoused Providence as a sanctuary city.""

But he offered no evidence that Cicilline had ever supported such a position.  In fact, when others suggested Providence was a sanctuary city, Cicilline aggressively disputed it.

Unlike San Francisco and New Haven, no governing body in Providence ever declared a policy of non-cooperation with the federal government on immigration issues. When the idea was proposed by a City Council member, Cicilline opposed it and it never even got to a council vote. Cicilline never issued an order to any departments to that effect.

We find Doherty’s statement False.

Obama says tax code rewards firms for shifting jobs overseas
","
President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have sparred over tax policy for many months. They have argued over the treatment of the middle class, small businesses and whether the Bush-era tax cuts should be extended for the wealthiest 2 percent. The first presidential debate sparked debate on a different point -- the taxes paid by companies doing business overseas.

So far, this topic has not played a prominent role in the campaign, although American-based multinational firms have a huge stake in the outcome. By one conservative estimate, this part of the tax code is worth $30 billion a year.

During the debate, Obama tried to score points on Romney by highlighting the tax breaks companies get when they move jobs overseas.

""When it comes to our tax code, Gov. Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.""

Romney responded, ""The idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.""

In this fact-check, we'll examine the president’s statement and ask if there are tax incentives for companies that set up foreign operations.

In the narrowest sense possible, Romney’s rebuttal is accurate. There is no clause in the tax code that rewards a company when it relocates production beyond U.S. borders. But if a plant moves at all, whether it’s from Ohio to Tennessee or Ohio to Malaysia, it is eligible for deductions.

""There is certainly a tax break for U.S. companies that move operations or people abroad,"" said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida. ""It is simply a business expense like any other legitimate expense.""

Richard Harvey, a former partner at the accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and now at Villanova School of Law, went even further.

""A company would be arguably negligent if they did not claim the deductions,"" Harvey said. ""In addition, the current tax law would allow a tax deduction for the costs of shutting down a U.S. operation.""

But both tax experts said the moving expenses were trivial compared to the hefty tax savings that companies can realize after they move their operations. There are two provisions in the code that allow them to shelter income from the IRS.

 Tax break #1: Keeping profits overseas

When an American firm opens a foreign division, it typically sets up a separate company that does not pay U.S. taxes.

""That foreign subsidiary is a new entity, organized and created in a foreign country, ""said McGill. ""And responsible for its own taxes."" Profits earned by the subsidiary need not show up on the parent company’s tax return.

The subsidiary pays taxes in the country where it's located. Those rates are often lower than in the U.S., where the corporate rate is 35 percent. So long as profits remain overseas, U.S. taxes are deferred.

The company can declare that none of that money will return to the U.S.

McGill, along with colleagues Edmund Outslay and Michael Donohoe, picked apart the public financial statements of Apple and other high-tech companies such as Google and IBM. With Apple, they found the company had built up $23.4 billion in earnings the company said would stay overseas permanently. And for good reason: Apple was paying an effective tax rate overseas of 1.2 percent on those profits.

Tax break #2: Selling to yourself

An American firm with a global network of subsidiaries has another way to trim its tax bill. All of those companies can buy and sell among themselves. It’s perfectly legal and very lucrative. Take the example of Google.

In just one quarter, the owner of the world’s most popular search engine had nearly $2.8 billion in net income and over half of that came from outside the U.S. That would put Google in good shape regardless, but the foreign earnings would be especially valuable. In 2009, the company’s foreign tax rate was 2.4 percent, reported Bloomberg News.

Google helped keep its taxes low by licensing its algorithms and other digital wizardry to an Irish subsidiary which then sold advertising around the world. The Irish tax rate on that income was 4 percent. But Google was able to drive its tax bill even lower by creating Google Ireland Holdings based in Bermuda where the tax rate is 0.6 percent. The Irish subsidiary sheltered its income by paying royalties to the subsidiary based in Bermuda.

These transactions are supposed to cost the same as if they were conducted at arm’s length. Harvey, the former Pricewaterhouse Coopers partner, said they are anything but.

""It is relatively clear most U.S. multinational corporations are aggressively shifting taxable income to low-tax jurisdictions,"" Harvey said. ""I believe that anyone who believes the IRS can effectively enforce the arm’s-length standard is an eternal optimist — or delusional.""

Tallying the cost

Harvey said the tax tools that multinationals can use give them a competitive advantage over domestic firms. He points to the work of Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit news service. Sullivan told the House Ways and Means Committee that the tax revenues lost through deferral and transfer pricing were worth between $30 billion to $60 billion a year.

Sullivan also noted that American firms with international operations had shed American jobs while increasing their overseas employment.

""Between 1999 and 2008, U.S. multinational corporations cut their domestic employment by 1.9 million. Over the same period U.S. multinationals increased their employment overseas by 2.4 million,"" Sullivan said.

But the picture is more complicated than that might seem. There is strong debate over the role that tax rates play in those job shifts. Some analysts, including Harvey, believe the real drivers could be lower wage rates and being closer to important markets around the globe.

However, regardless of the initial motivation, once companies make the move, in Sullivan’s words, ""a toehold of real investment allows a truckload of profit to follow.""

Our ruling

President Obama said there are ""loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.""

Independent analysts agree that firms with international operations can take advantage of tax loopholes that domestic firms can not. The value of these is in the billions. Such tax laws might not be the deciding factor for companies to locate in foreign countries, but they make that choice more lucrative.

Obama ad accuses Romney of cutting Mass. K-12 education by $248.7 million
","
A new Web ad from Barack Obama's campaign portrays Mitt Romney as a promise-breaker who cut Massachusetts education spending in his very first budget.

The ad starts with grainy campaign video of Romney in 2002, saying, ""The services delivered to our children in schools … we're not going to cut that.""

A reproachful Ronald Pacy, former superintendent in Attleboro, Mass., follows: ""Gov. Romney said he was not going to cut education, and then the next thing we knew, those cuts were made.""

Then, in type on screen, the claim:

In Romney's first budget, he cut $248.7 million from K-12 education.
— Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, FY2004 Conference Budget, 6/26/03

We wondered, did Romney cut that amount from K-12 education right out of the gate?

 Massachusetts’ fiscal crisis

In 2003, the new governor faced a fiscal emergency.

Our colleagues at the Tampa Bay Times have examined Romney’s response to an economy still recovering from the dot-com bubble and the 9/11 recession.

As Romney entered office, the state’s lawmakers — required to pass a balanced budget — faced a budget gap even after tax hikes and emergency spending cuts the year before. Romney got authority to make emergency cuts his first month and asked the Legislature to make more. Then he proposed a budget with savings of close to $3 billion.

Did that include a $248.7 million cut from K-12 education?

Not explicitly. But the budget he signed did.

 Budget games

The number cited in the ad isn’t what Romney proposed.

His state budget, in fact, suggested a modest overall increase of $8.9 million in two main categories of state K-12 spending. But he proposed a steep reduction in broader local spending that governments also used for education — a drop of $349.4 million, down nearly 30 percent from the prior year.

The Democratic Legislature spread the cuts around differently, ultimately reducing those two education-specific categories by $248.7 million while restoring nearly half of broader ""unrestricted"" local aid. That’s the cut that ultimately survived Romney’s vetoes and the Legislature’s veto overrides.

But none of that was clear from the report cited by the Obama team, which examined neither Romney’s proposal for fiscal year 2004 nor the budget that emerged after vetoes and veto overrides, but something in between known as the ""conference budget.""

All three of those options were available in reports from the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, an independent, nonprofit think tank partly funded by unions that’s affiliated with the liberal Washington, D.C., Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

The  ""conference"" budget was the one that made it through the House and Senate and awaited the governor’s signature (and line-item veto). So, it’s a stretch to say any numbers in it were fully Romney’s. It was, in fact, more accurately the budget belonging to Democratic lawmakers who agreed on their own version — then generally blocked the governor’s vetoes.

""The Democrats had veto-proof majorities in both chambers and rewrote Romney’s budget, as they have with all governors’ budgets, to what they wanted,"" Fred Bayles, director of the Boston University Statehouse Program told PolitiFact in May.

Still, when Romney took his veto pen to that conference budget, he moved to chop millions more from the Legislature’s proposed school funding, including $10 million in kindergarten expansion grants (a cut overridden by lawmakers).

Our ruling

An Obama for America ad uses a big number to attack Romney’s record on school funding in Massachusetts, saying, ""In Romney's first budget, he cut $248.7 million from K-12 education.""  ""Romney’s first budget"" sounds like a proposal coming from the governor. Romney actually proposed a modest increase in state K-12 spending categories and larger cuts elsewhere. The $248.7 million in education-specific cuts reflected primarily the work of the Democratic Legislature in a time of serious financial crisis that predated the governor.

Romney, tasked with closing a substantial budget gap, ultimately signed a document that embodied the Legislature’s cuts — and then tried to use his veto to cut further. But he shares responsibility for that $248.7 million with the veto-proof majority of lawmakers.

Ad says workforce smaller under Barack Obama than any time since Jimmy Carter
","
The American Future Fund, a group that advocates ""conservative and free-market"" principles, has released an advertisement that -- like other ads and Web videos in this election cycle -- seeks to compare President Barack Obama to his one-term Democratic predecessor, Jimmy Carter.

""Remember where we were four years ago: 11 million people out of work, a $10 trillion debt,"" the narrator says in the ad, which was released Oct. 1. ""But four years later, 13 million people out of work, $16 trillion debt, and now the lowest workforce in 31 years."" As the narrator mentions the size of the workforce, the visual on the screen shows the line ""lowest workforce since Carter"" against an image of Carter’s face dissolving into Obama’s.

We thought we’d check whether under Barack Obama, the U.S. now has the ""lowest workforce since (President Jimmy) Carter.""

Some contradictions

Before looking at the substance of the comparison, let’s point out a few internal problems with the ad.

First, 31 years ago was October 1981 -- 10 months after Ronald Reagan took office. Given the reverence Republicans have for Reagan, it’s easy to see why this ad focused on Carter instead. But ""31 years"" and the Carter reference can’t both be right. One of them has to be incorrect.

Second, the ad uses the term ""lowest workforce."" The term ""workforce"" refers to an absolute number of people who are either employed or are seeking work. Using this statistic, the group’s claim is way off, because of the nation’s overall population growth during the last three decades as well as the expansion of women in the workforce through the 1990s.

In 1980 and 1981, the size of the civilian labor force was a bit over 100 million. Today, even after a drop due to the most recent recession, it’s more than 150 million -- a 50 percent increase.

The American Future Fund didn’t respond to us for this story, so we can’t be entirely sure what they meant. 
We wonder if they were referring to a different statistic -- one that takes into account the size of the nation’s population. That statistic is called the civilian labor force participation rate -- essentially, the labor force divided by the nation’s total population.

Comparing labor force participation rates

So what happens when you look at the labor force participation rate? By the numbers, the ad isn’t far off.

The figure for August 2012 -- the most recent month at the point the ad began airing -- was 63.5 percent. (On Oct. 5, the new figures for September showed it ticked slightly upward to 63.6, but we'll use the numbers that were current when the ad started to run.) The last time the rate was as low as 63.5 percent for more than one consecutive month was in 1979, when Carter was president.

However, it’s worth noting a few caveats.

First, the rate did dip to 63.5 once during Reagan’s presidency, in September 1981.

Second, if you smooth out monthly volatility, labor force participation rates were close to indistinguishable during the final year of Carter and the first year of Reagan, most of which was a recessionary period. The average labor force participation rate in 1981 under Reagan was only one-tenth of 1 percentage point higher than it was in 1980 under Carter.

So the focus on Carter has a grain of truth, but even there the ad overplays its hand a bit. 
That's because economic factors are not the only things that affect the labor force participation rate. The other big one is demographics, particularly the aging of the population.

In the 2000 Census, the number of Americans aged 60 to 69 -- that is, those who had recently hit retirement age or would do so within a few years -- was to about 20 million. But thanks to the Baby Boomers, the number surged in the 2010 Census to more than 29 million, almost a 50 percent increase. This matters because the more people aged 60 to 69, the more people who are passing into retirement age -- or, to put it another way, leaving the labor force. Even though more people proportionally are remaining in the workforce after retirement age, the difference isn’t big enough to cancel out the flood of new retirees.

Our ruling

The ad says the U.S. now has the ""lowest workforce since Carter,"" emphasizing the point by morphing Carter’s face into Obama’s.

The ad includes a significant inconsistency about dates, and it uses the word ""workforce"" incorrectly. During the Carter administration, the size of the civilian labor force was a bit over 100 million. Today, even after the most recent recession, it’s more than 150 million. By a different measure -- the civilian labor force participation rate -- its claim is not far off. In general, the last time the rate was consistently this low was under Carter.

However, not all the blame for the low participation rates today has to do with the recession and slow recovery under Obama. A portion of the decline has been driven by long-term demographic trends that have nothing to do with the person or the party in the White House. 
Because it garbles the facts on a number of fronts, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3C1080>],/factchecks/2012/oct/08/american-future-fund/ad-says-workforce-smaller-under-barack-obama-any-t/
"['Campaign Finance', 'Virginia', 'Wayne Powell']","
Wayne Powell says Eric Cantor ""took $5 million"" from casino owner Sheldon Adelson
","
In a recent debate, Democrat challenger Wayne Powell accused U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor of receiving a fortune in contributions from a a billionaire Las Vegas casino owner.

""You took $5 million from Sheldon Adelson,"" Powell said.

Cantor denounced the accusation as ""untrue.""

We checked Powell’s claim that the House majority leader received $5 million from Adelson, chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. casino empire who is making massive contributions to Republican political action committees this year. Adelson is chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition, an organization that is trying to get Jews to support GOP candidates. Cantor is a member of the coalition.

Powell’s campaign cited a July 15, article in Politico about how Adelson and his wife, Miriam, donated $5 million to the YG Action Fund, a super PAC that Politico said is ""backed"" by Cantor. The story said the couple together had also given another $5 million in February to another Republican super PAC -- the Congressional Leadership Fund -- ""backed"" by Cantor and other House leaders.

We verified the contributions through records through a database kept by the Center for Responsive Politics of political contributions reported to the Federal Election Commission. It showed Adelson and his wife each gave $2.5 million to the YG Action Fund on April 30 of this year.

The super PAC, as Politico noted, had been lagging in fundraising before the Adelsons stepped in, collecting just $55,000 for the first three months of the year.

YG gets its name from the ""Young Guns"" label given to a triumvirate of House Republican leaders: Cantor; vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan; and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Ca. The three co-authored a 2010 book titled, ""Young Guns: a New Generation of Conservative Leaders.""

On its website, the super PAC said it is ""dedicated to supporting conservative candidates to elected office who hold true to the Young Guns movement.""

Two former Cantor aides play key roles in the super PAC. John Murray, the House majority leader’s former deputy chief of staff, is president and treasurer. Brad Dayspring -- also a former deputy chief to Cantor -- is an advisor to the super pac, according to a synopsis from Center for Public Integrity.

Super PACs arose in the wake of a 2010 Supreme Court decision that allowed unlimited corporate and union spending on elections. Super PACs can raise unlimited amounts of money from corporations, unions, and individuals and spend it to advocate for or against political candidates.

But under law, super PACs are not allowed to coordinate their spending with any particular campaign or candidate. They are barred from giving directly to political candidates.

Powell’s campaign also pointed to a Politico article that said Cantor’s former aides who run the super PAC still provide the House Majority Leader with messaging advice.

Every Republican is Crucial (ERIC) PAC, controlled by Cantor, contributed $5,000 to the YG Action Fund on March 28 -- a month before the Adelsons’ big donations.

In early March, Cantor irritated many Republicans by taking sides in a GOP primary in which two House incumbents from Illinois were forced to run against each other because of redistricting. Cantor endorsed freshman Rep. Adam Kinzinger over 10-term Rep. Don Manzullo. Three weeks later, the YG Action Fund paid $52,000 to air a pro-Kinzinger radio commercial.

So is donating to YG the tantamount to giving money to Cantor, as Powell says?

Ray Allen, Jr., a Cantor adviser, said no. The super Pac and Cantor’s congressional re-election fund are ""distinctly different and legally separate entities.""

""Just as people do not confuse donating to the Republican Party with donating to Cantor for Congress, people understand the difference between donating to the YG Action Fund and donating to Cantor for Congress,"" Allen said in an e-mail.

Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, offered a different take. ""Cantor is technically correct that he didn’t accept the money, but in the big picture, Adelson has gained influence with Cantor by donating $5 million to the Young Guns,"" he said. ""Does Cantor personally call the shots at the YG Action Fund? No. But if Eric Cantor wanted some candidate to be funded by the YG Action Fund, you can rest assured that would happen.""

Since 2001, the Adelson’s have contributed $30,800 to Cantor’s re-election campaigns and $15,000 to Eric PAC.

Our ruling

Powell said Cantor ""took $5 million from Sheldon Adelson.""

That’s not correct. Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the YG Action Fund. Cantor has close ties to the super PAC, which is run by two former senior advisers to the majority leader. The group takes its name from ""Young Guns,"" the title of a book Cantor co-authored.  

Powell would have been correct in saying a super PAC closely tied to Cantor took $5 million from the Adelsons. But he exaggerated when he said Cantor took the money; the YG Action Fund is required to operate independently of Cantor.

So we find an element of truth in a largely inaccurate statement. We rate Powell’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A61400>],/factchecks/2012/oct/08/wayne-powell/wayne-powell-says-eric-cantor-took-5-million-casin/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Joe Straus']","
Joe Straus says lawmakers increased the share of state spending on public education
","
Asked if public school advocates should prepare for lawmakers to wield knives afresh next year, the speaker of the Texas House challenged the premise.

Joe Straus, featured at a Texas Tribune Festival breakfast, said: ""We worked really hard to ensure that public education, higher education, is the largest piece of the budget pie. We did that in this last session too. The pie got smaller, but the piece for public education actually got larger."" His comment was noted for us by Joshua Fechter, a University of Texas journalism student.

We’ve previously checked Straus, a San Antonio Republican, summarizing legislative decision-making by the Republican-steered 2011 Legislature. In May 2011, he said a House-Senate deal on the state budget ""funds nursing homes, our public schools and universities, and provides financial aid for college students while keeping substantial revenue in reserves and avoiding any new taxes.""

Unsaid: Public schools were poised to field $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would have gotten under established funding formulas. Higher education, except for community colleges, was likewise due to sustain funding cuts and nursing homes were about to be left with lower rates than they had after the 2009 legislative session.

Such reductions were put into play as lawmakers wrapped up a total 2012-13 budget, counting state plus federal funds, of $173.5 billion, down $14 billion from the 2010-11 total, according to the advisory Legislative Budget Board’s January 2012 ""Fiscal Size-up"" report. The latest budget reduces state general-revenue spending to $81.3 billion, a nearly 1 percent drop from 2010-11, the report says.

So, Straus was correct the agreed-upon budget ""funded"" the cited items, but his statement failed to acknowledge the funding levels were mostly ratcheting down. We rated his statement as Half True.

Other leaders subsequently distorted legislative actions affecting public schools.

State Rep. Myra Crownover, for instance, said lawmakers increased state education spending by $1.6 billion. 
That was about right solely per the state’s Foundation School Program, which is supposed to ensure each school district has adequate resources. But her claim did not account for more than $5 billion in school funding reductions, leading us to rate her statement as Pants on Fire. 
Specifically, lawmakers did not fund the costs of projected enrollment increases and cut by $2 billion a year what schools were accustomed to drawing down via longstanding finance formulas. Members also postponed to the next two-year budget period a regular distribution of state education aid, lately estimated to total $1.9 billion. Finally, schools were hit by a $1.3 billion reduction in funding for targeted programs including teacher incentive pay, dropout prevention funding and grants for pre-Kindergarten Early Start.
   
A similar claim by State Comptroller Susan Combs also caught fire on the Truth-O-Meter. Combs, who oversees state finances, incorrectly told a Brazos County group that lawmakers had not cut school aid.

Conversely, we rated as True a March 2012 statement by state Rep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, that the legislative decisions mean the state’s public schools are spending, on average, $500 less per student than before.

Back to Straus’s recent statement: Could it be that despite the much-noted reductions, the 2011 Legislature devoted a bigger piece of state spending to public education than before?

Straus spokesman Jason Embry, drawing from the ""Fiscal Size-up,"" told us by email that state money flowing to schools through the Texas Education Agency in the two-year budget exceeds the comparable share of such funding in the 2010-11 budget. In the previous budget, Embry said, the agency accounted for $30.3 billion, or 37 percent, of $81.9 billion in all state spending. He said lawmakers budgeted $30.5 billion for the agency in 2012-13, accounting for 37.4 percent of all the general-revenue spending.

Curious, we also checked on whether public education comprised a greater share of all spending in the budget, meaning state general revenue plus federal aid.  It did. Some $47 billion in education agency funds comprised 27.3 percent of all spending, compared to 26.7 percent of the full 2010-11 budget.

Finally, we asked the Texas Association of School Boards, which represents school districts, for a longer look at the share of state spending devoted to public education over recent years. Spokesman Dominic Giarratani, drawing information from budget-board reports, said by email that since 2002-03, the public education share of state spending topped out at 40 percent in 2008-09. He said the period’s low-water mark, set in 2004-05, was 36 percent -- or 1.4 percentage points below education’s share of state general-revenue spending as described by Straus.

Our ruling

As Straus says, public education made up a greater share of state spending in the 2012-13 budget than in the 2010-11 budget. Bur this statement lacks vital clarifying information -- that school funding still took a substantial hit. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809738A400>],/factchecks/2012/oct/08/joe-straus/joe-straus-says-lawmakers-increased-share-state-sp/

U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez claims state Sen. Joe Kyrillos voted six times against women’s health care funding
","
Funding for women’s health care in New Jersey has become a line of attack in the race between U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and his Republican challenger, state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, R-Monmouth.

In their first debate Thursday before the general election on Nov. 6, Menendez claimed that Kyrillos has voted six times to oppose women’s health care funding.

""When he had an opportunity to vote for women in terms of their health care, not once, not twice, but six times, he voted against women’s health care in our state,"" the Democratic senator said near the start of the debate.

He repeated the claim in his closing statement: ""And not once, not twice, but six times he voted against funding for women’s health care in our state, while I was bringing millions of dollars for those women to get health care.""

The senator’s claim is on solid ground. Between June 2010 and June 2012, Kyrillos voted six times against providing about $7.5 million for family planning services, which could include breast exams, pregnancy testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. The money could not be used for abortion procedures.

Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, responded in a statement: ""New Jerseyans know that Joe Kyrillos is a pro-choice Republican who's voted for millions of dollars in women's health initiatives, and that's a fact.""

Let’s go through those six votes.

Since Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, eliminated the money in his budget for fiscal year 2011, the Democrat-led state Legislature has tried unsuccessfully to restore it. As we found in a previous fact-check, that funding reduction led to the closure of six family planning centers across the state.

The first set of Kyrillos’ votes occurred on June 28, 2010, when the state Senate considered a bill that would restore the roughly $7.5 million. The Senate cast two sets of votes to pass the bill, and Kyrillos voted no each time.

The state Assembly later passed the bill, but Christie vetoed it.

On Sept. 20, 2010, the Senate failed to get enough votes to override the veto. Kyrillos voted against the override.

On May 23, 2011, the Senate put forward another bill that would restore the funding for fiscal year 2011, and Kyrillos voted no. That bill passed the Senate, but was not voted on in the Assembly.

Soon afterward, the legislature included the $7.5 million in the fiscal year 2012 budget sent to the governor, but Christie eliminated that funding as part of his line-item vetoes.

On July 11, 2011, when the Senate fell short of having enough votes to override that veto, Kyrillos voted against the override.

The most recent vote occurred on June 25, 2012, when the Senate passed a bill that would restore the funding for fiscal year 2012. Kyrillos voted no.

The Assembly also passed the bill that day, but Christie later vetoed it.

Here’s a chart breaking down Kyrillos’ votes against funding for family planning services: 
*Due to an error in the original bill, the Senate voted twice on final passage of the legislation. 
Our ruling

In a debate last week, Menendez said in reference to Kyrillos: ""When he had an opportunity to vote for women in terms of their health care, not once, not twice, but six times, he voted against women’s health care in our state.""

The senator’s claim is on target. Between June 2010 and June 2012, Kyrillos voted six times against providing about $7.5 million for family planning services.

Did Donald Trump turn around U.S. record at the WTO?
","During a visit to a new Shell plant outside Pittsburgh, President Donald Trump attacked the World Trade Organization, the international entity that decides trade disputes. ""We were losing all our cases until I came along,"" Trump said in Monaca, Pa. ""We were losing all our cases in the World Trade Organization. Almost every case, ... lost, lost, lost. They thought we were stupid. They were the ones ruling. And then I came along. Now we’re winning a lot of cases because they know that they’re not on very solid ground."" Is that accurate? We found that certain aspects of the U.S. record at the WTO are slightly better. But overall, we found no dramatic turnaround. More than 160 nations have joined the World Trade Organization, an institution that serves as a forum for resolving international trade disputes.  Before proceeding to litigation, countries can work out their differences through a ""conciliation and mediation"" process. Trade experts told PolitiFact that roughly 60% of claims are settled this way, without the WTO rendering a ""winner"" or ""loser"" at all. In the roughly 40% of cases that remain unresolved, the dispute goes to a WTO-approved panel of three, none of whom are from a country involved in the dispute. So, for starters, Trump ignored that most WTO cases don’t produce a winner or loser. Kent Jones, an economist at Babson College, called the conciliation system a benefit of the WTO because it encourages the disputing parties to negotiate a mutually acceptable resolution of the case. Another point that Trump glossed over is that ""countries typically do not bring WTO dispute cases unless they are confident that they will win,"" Jones said. This produces a longstanding and distinct pattern of wins and losses: The complaining country usually wins. And that cuts both ways for supporting Trump’s assertion. Dan Ikenson of the pro-free-trade Cato Institute looked at the U.S. record in WTO trade disputes between 1995 and 2017. He found that when the United States was defending against a complaint, it lost 89% of the time. That would seem to support at least part of Trump’s assertion — but it leaves out the other side of the coin.  In cases where the United States was the complaining party, Ikerson found a 91% U.S. victory rate. (Also worth noting: The United States was the most active complaining party.) The U.S. record — strong as a complainant, weak as a defendant — is mirrored by the records of most other countries, trade specialists said. Trade experts said they were unaware of comprehensive studies that went past March 2017. But Elena V. McLean, a political scientist at the University at Buffalo-State University of New York, did a ""very quick estimate"" of recent cases for PolitiFact and found a slightly improved record for the United States. From 2017 to 2019, she said, the United States brought two cases as a complainant and won both, which is in line with past results. In seven cases brought against the United States, the United States won three, or 43%. That’s a bit better than the U.S. long-term performance, though it’s still a losing record. We did not hear back from the White House and the U.S. Trade Representative when we asked for any additional supporting data for Trump’s assertion. It’s unlikely that Trump’s positions changed the WTO’s ruling patterns, trade experts agreed. WTO cases often take years to reach a final decision, so some of the decisions McLean tallied were inherited from the period before Trump came to office, she said. The United States did win one notable, if ""arcane,"" case during Trump’s tenure that broke with a pattern of previous losses on the same issue, said Stuart S. Malawer, a professor of law and international trade at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government. The case involves Canada and concerned the methodology of determining the price of imports in dumping cases, he said.  However, Malawer said that there was no indication that a change of policy by Trump had anything to do it. The decision ""seems to be based principally on the technical aspects of the issue,"" he said. Experts said it was ironic that Trump was trumpeting his victories at the WTO when his administration has blocked new judges for appointment to the WTO’s appellate body. ""In a matter of months, this U.S. action will deplete the roster of judges and deprive the WTO of a working dispute settlement system,"" Jones said. If that happens, McLean said, ""the politics of trade will become much less cooperative, and escalation to all-out trade wars will become much more likely. And the overall effect of trade wars on economies, global and domestic, is not something that can be described as ‘winning,’ no matter how you slice it."" Trump said, ""We were losing all our cases in the World Trade Organization. ... And then I came along. Now we’re winning a lot of cases because they know that they’re not on very solid ground."" This statement contains multiple problems. For decades, the United States, like essentially all countries, has tended to lose most WTO cases in which it was a defendant. But it has won most cases when it was the complaining party. Under Trump, there are some indications of an improved (though still losing) U.S. record in cases it’s defending against. But trade experts say this has had little to do with Trump’s policies, which have in fact put the WTO’s continued operations at risk. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DEC840>],/factchecks/2019/aug/16/donald-trump/did-donald-trump-turn-around-us-record-wto/

"['Crime', 'Illinois', 'Guns', 'Adam Kinzinger']","
Are handguns used to commit nearly all murders?
","In the wake of mass shootings in California, Texas and Ohio, and continued summer violence in Chicago, Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger has come out in favor of some gun restriction measures. Kinzinger represents Illinois’ 16th district, a 14-county area that wraps around Chicagoland from Wisconsin to Indiana. In February, he voted against a bipartisan House bill to expand background checks for gun purchases. Now, he is now advocating for universal background checks, along with laws to make it easier for authorities to take guns from unstable individuals, raise the legal age of purchase for all firearms to 21 and ban some large-capacity magazines. But he won’t yet go so far as to support a ban on assault-style weapons like the semi-automatic rifles used in recent mass shootings, a point he was asked to address in an interview with Fox 32’s Mike Flannery. ""Your Republican colleague, Rep. (Mike) Turner from the Dayton area, he’s now saying he's ready to vote for banning the assault rifles,"" said Flannery, referencing Dayton, Ohio, where a recent shooting left nine people dead. ""Is that an idea you’d consider?"" ""Not right now,"" Kinzinger responded. ""I mean, look, I think it’s like 97% of murders occur with handguns. That’s really where the big problem is."" Most murders are committed with firearms, a majority of them handguns, federal data show. Even so, Kinzinger significantly stretched the facts by claiming handguns are used to commit nearly all murders. To assess Kinzinger’s claim, we turned to data catalogued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 2017, the latest year for which figures on murder weapons were available, handguns were used in 46% of all homicides — far from the 97% Kinzinger cited. We asked Kinzinger’s office to explain the discrepancy, but did not receive a response. If Kinzinger was referring to the share of firearm homicides that involve a handgun instead of murders overall, he would have gotten a little closer to the mark. However, those figures still fail to back up his claim. Firearms were used to commit 73% of all murders in 2017, FBI data show. And in at least 64% of those cases, the firearm was a handgun. In another 28% of murders committed with firearms, local police agencies did not specify the type used when reporting those cases to the FBI. But experts told us it’s reasonable to expect instances in which the firearm was not identified would likely follow the same pattern as those that were categorized. After adding nearly two-thirds of the unidentified cases reported in 2017 to the handgun category, the share of firearm murders committed with a handgun rises to 82%. That’s substantially higher, but still well below what Kinzinger claimed. In addition, we reviewed 10 years’ worth of FBI data and found the pattern held steady over time, something experts we spoke with also noted. ""That (97%) is too high a number,"" said David Hemenway, who directs the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. ""But to say that most people in the United States who are murdered are killed with guns and the large majority of people who are killed with guns are killed with handguns, that’s true every year."" As for Kinzinger’s assertion that handgun murders are ""the big problem,"" it is clear that handguns are far more commonly used in murders than assault-style rifles, or rifles in general. The FBI does not define assault weapons. But that doesn’t mean shootings committed with high-capacity semi-automatic firearms that allow a shooter to quickly kill many people in a short amount of time don’t pose serious problems for lawmakers to address. Indeed, much of Kinzinger’s recent proposal centers on the issue in response to the shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio that left 31 people dead. ""If you said, I want to do one thing that reduces overall homicide in the United States, it would not be to ban assault weapons,"" Hemenway said. But addressing mass shootings requires lawmakers to consider policies not directly aimed at reducing total homicides, Hemenway added, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Kinzinger claimed 97% of murders are committed with handguns. That figure is off-target. In 2017, 46% of all murders were committed with handguns, federal data show. Firearms were used in more than 70% of all homicides, however. And in at least two-thirds of those cases, the firearm was a handgun, making them by far the most common murder weapon. We rate Kinzinger’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE — The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

What’s new in Trump’s policy for legal immigrants on welfare
","The Trump administration recently announced a new rule broadening the government’s ability to deny visas and permanent residency to legal immigrants who get public benefits. The rule, set to take effect on Oct. 15, is a new interpretation of an older immigration law and the latest effort by President Donald Trump to restrict certain types of immigration to the United States. But there’s some confusion over what this new rule will do and how drastic it is. On the Aug. 14 episode of ""Fox & Friends First,"" anchor Rob Schmitt moderated a discussion over the new policy, which he introduced as ""changes to immigration laws that could deny green cards to migrants who need welfare in this country."" ""This rule has been around for a while,"" he said at one point. ""This is not a new thing that the president is trying to implement here, that the United States has been this way."" That made our ears perk up, so we decided to dig into the history of laws that zero in on those considered likely to become ""public charges,"" or burdens to American taxpayers.  Our finding: Schmitt’s statement is partially accurate. While a public charge law has been on the books for more than 100 years, the Trump administration’s broad interpretation of it is unprecedented.  Fox News declined to comment. Public charge laws are regulations that say immigrants to the United States can be turned away if they are likely to depend on public assistance programs.  Schmitt is right that the public charge law is nothing new. But his claim that ""this is not a new thing that the president is trying to implement"" leaves out some important details. ""There is a long history of public charge law in this country, but the new regulation represents a big expansion in how this law is interpreted and applied,"" said Julia Gelatt, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank in Washington. ""We have never before had such a broad interpretation in place of who might become a public charge."" A public charge law first appeared as part of the Immigration Act of 1882. Back then, immigrants generally had to show they had cash to spare and enough money to buy a ticket to their ultimate United States destination, Gelatt said. The public charge rule was reaffirmed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and has held its place in the immigration system ever since. But for a long time, the law offered no clear definition for determining whether a person was a potential public charge. Eventually, a 1996 bill said the Immigration and Naturalization Service should consider a person’s age, health, family status, financial resources, education, skills and ability to secure a sponsor’s written support when deciding if he or she would likely become a public charge. In 1999, the INS clarified that the term ""public charge"" applied specifically to immigrants who were ""primarily dependent"" on government cash assistance or long-term, institutionalized care. The Trump administration’s new rule expands that definition, experts told us, and it will affect hundreds of thousands of immigrants who come legally to the United States each year and apply to stay permanently.  Once the rule goes into effect, immigration officials will be able to deny legal immigrants visas if they are deemed ""more likely than not"" to use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers. Immigrants who are in the United States legally on temporary visas and have relied on such benefits in the past could also have more difficulty getting a green card. The rule will not affect people who already have green cards, refugees and asylum-seekers, as well as certain members of the military, pregnant women and children. The Trump administration has defended the move as preserving public benefits for eligible U.S. citizens and promoting self-sufficiency in immigrants to the United States. But Gelatt said the rule could be used to deny many more green card applicants than before and, as a consequence, ""have dramatic impacts on the level of legal immigration to the country, and on the characteristics of legal immigrants."" Kevin Johnson, dean of UC Davis School of Law, noted that the enforcement of immigration laws has already changed drastically under Trump.  He said the number of visa denials for Mexican immigrants has ""skyrocketed,"" pointing to a Politico report that said the State Department denied 5,343 visa requests from Mexican immigrants on public charge grounds between Oct. 1 and July 29. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services did not weigh in on the accuracy of Schmitt’s claim, but the agency’s press office told us: ""Public charge has been a part of U.S. immigration law for more than 100 years, appearing as far back as the Immigration Act of 1882, as a ground of inadmissibility, and has existed in its current form since 1996."" Schmitt said, ""This rule has been around for a while. This is not a new thing that the president is trying to implement here, that the United States has been this way."" Public charge as a standard of inadmissibility has been a staple of immigration law since 1882. But Trump’s new policy will significantly change the way immigration officials decide which legal immigrants should be disqualified from getting visas or green cards. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. So we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FA1440>],/factchecks/2019/aug/15/rob-schmitt/whats-new-trumps-public-charge-immigration-policy/

Robert Byrd wasn’t a Grand Wizard of the KKK but he once led a local chapter
","An old photograph of former Vice President Joe Biden has been circulating online as some social media users try to tie the Democratic presidential candidate to the KKK.   ""Biden with the Grand wizard of the KKK,"" the Aug. 9 post says. ""So who again is playing you, lying to you, using you for the votes, Creators of the KKK, opposed civil right (sic) of blacks. Yup thats (sic) the Democratic party."" The black and white photo beneath the words shows Biden holding hands with then-Democratic U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who the post identifies as a ""KKK leader."" The post, which had been shared more than 1,400 times by Aug. 15, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The image is authentic. It was shot by Associated Press photographer Bob Bird in October 2008 as Biden, then a Democratic senator from Delaware and Barack Obama’s Democratic vice presidential candidate, attended a campaign rally in downtown Charleston, W. Va. Also in the photo are the state’s then-Gov. Joe Manchin and then-U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, also a West Virginia Democrat. When Byrd died in 2010, he had served in the Senate longer than anyone else; the New York Times described him as ""a pillar of Capitol Hill."" In a statement, then-President Barack Obama called him ""a voice of principle and reason."" Biden said Byrd was ""a dear friend."" He was also once a member of the Ku Klux Klan.  ""It has emerged throughout my life to haunt and embarrass me and has taught me in a very graphic way what one major mistake can do to one’s life, career, and reputation,"" Byrd wrote in a 2005 memoir.  In West Virginia in the 1940s — late 1941 or early 1942, according to Byrd’s memoir — he organized and led a 150-member chapter, or ""Klavern,"" of the Klan as the ""Exalted Cyclops."" In Klan hierarchy, according to Slate, each Klavern is led by an Exalted Cyclops typically elected by his fellow Klansmen. The Exalted Cyclops reports to a ""Grand Giant"" (provincial leader), ""Grand Dragon"" (state director) and ""Grand Wizard"" (national chair).  In his book, Byrd says he worked as a recruiter, or ""Kleagle,"" for the Klan until early 1943 and then left the state for a welding job in Baltimore. He returned to West Virginia after World War II ended and sent a letter in 1945 to Theodore Bilbo, a Democratic senator and segregationist from Mississippi, complaining about efforts to integrate the military.  ""Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels,"" he wrote.   He was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates the following year and again in 1948. In 1950, he was elected to the state Senate and in 1952, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives. It was then that political opponents revealed his former ties to the KKK, according to a 2005 article in the Washington Post titled ""A Senator’s Shame."" Byrd acknowledged he belonged to the Klan from ""mid-1942 to early 1943"" and said he joined ""because it offered excitement and because it was strongly opposed to communism.""  He said he quit after a year but contemporaneous newspaper accounts and letters show that Byrd was involved with the Klan throughout much of the 1940s, according to the Washington Post. In 1946, for example, he said in a letter to the Grand Wizard that ""the Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia."" Still, Byrd won his election and ""then spent decades apologizing for what he called a ‘sad mistake,’"" according to the Times. His civil rights record is mixed. He voted for civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 but he filibustered against the 1964 Civil Rights Act because he said the measure infringed on states’ rights. He said he voted against the 1965 Voting Rights Acts and its renewal in 1970 for the same reason. After becoming a party leader, he consistently supported civil rights legislation and he backed Obama’s presidential bid, as seen in the photo used in the Facebook post.  Our ruling The Facebook post claims that Joe Biden was photographed with Robert Byrd, Grand Wizard of the KKK. That exaggerates Byrd’s role in the KKK.   In the 1940s, Byrd organized and led a local Klan chapter as its Exalted Cyclops, but he wasn’t a Grand Wizard. And he ultimately renounced his views from that period of his life though his past and former ties to the KKK were raised throughout the rest of his life. By the time this photo of Byrd and Biden was taken, Byrd’s public expressions of regret and shame over his earlier involvement in the KKK was well-documented and often-repeated.    We rate this Facebook post Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096764580>],/factchecks/2019/aug/15/viral-image/robert-byrd-wasnt-grand-wizard-kkk-he-once-led-loc/

Cars vs. wheat: Donald Trump distorts US-Japan trade
","President Donald Trump visited a Pennsylvania chemical plant to talk about energy and manufacturing. He touted the economic improvements on his watch, from growing steel production to rising energy sales. Trump launched into an anecdote of sorts that painted a picture of a turnaround in trade with Japan.  ""I told Prime Minister Abe — great guy — I said, ‘Listen, we have a massive deficit with Japan.’ They send thousands and thousands — millions — of cars. We send them wheat. Wheat. That’s not a good deal. And they don’t even want our wheat. They do it because they want us to at least feel that we’re okay. You know, they do it to make us feel good. ""But the deficit is massive, which is changing rapidly. But what they're doing is, they're buying a lot of our stuff, including our military equipment."" We’ll check the accuracy of each main point. ""They send thousands and thousands — millions — of cars."" Trump inflates the total, but not by much. The U.S. Trade Administration says Japan sent about 1.7 million new cars and light trucks to the United States in 2018. ""We send them wheat."" Well, the United States does export wheat to Japan, but Trump makes it sound as though this is a large share of U.S.-Japan trade. It isn’t.  In 2018, wheat represented less than 1% of total U.S. sales to Japan. Corn brought in many more dollars — $2.8 billion compared to $0.7 billion from wheat. The top ranking U.S. product (based on dollar value) was civilian aircraft, engines, equipment, and parts, which produced $5.6 billion in sales. Industrial machines and liquified natural gas came in second and third, each with about $4.5 billion in sales. Wheat ranked 32nd. With the exception of liquefied natural gas sales, which took off in 2016, the sales numbers for aircraft, industrial machinery and other leading products have been fairly steady over time. Trump also singled out sales of military equipment. All told, it accounted for about 1.8% of total sales to Japan. No type of military product ranked higher than 26th. ""The deficit is massive, which is changing rapidly."" The overall trade deficit with Japan in goods and services has stayed relatively level at about $57 billion a year since 2016. But not only is it not changing quickly, it rose slightly each year.  The most recent data runs through the first quarter of 2019. Comparing just the first quarters in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 shows a rise from $13.7 billion in 2016 to $15.5 billion in 2019. We reached out to the White House and they had no comment. Trump talked about U.S.-Japan trade in terms of Americans buying Japanese cars while the Japanese bought American wheat. He also said the trade deficit is changing rapidly. Trump distorted the actual trade relations in many ways. While he was reasonably correct on the scale of cars imported to the United States, he cast wheat as a major part of U.S.-Japan trade. It accounts for less than 1% of sales. Trump sidestepped the top ranking items of civilian aircraft and related goods, and industrial machinery.  The numbers also undercut his implication that the trade deficit is changing rapidly for the better. It has held steady, although getting a bit worse each year. Trump was close on the car and truck imports, but missed the mark in every other respect.

Did Lady Bird Johnson sic the CIA on Eartha Kitt?
","During an episode of Comedy Central’s ""Drunk History,"" comedian Nicole Byer described a conflict between the late Lady Bird Johnson and actress and singer Eartha Kitt when Johnson was first lady. During a July 2 episode, Byer said: ""Lady Bird calls the CIA and she goes, 'Yo listen, this b----? I don't like this b----. You better find everything you can about her so I can send it to other people so she doesn't work. Lady Bird is just like, ‘Destroy her,’ "" Byer said. We had to know whether Byer’s description of Texas icon Lady Bird Johnson was accurate. Comedy Central did not return a request for more information, so we consulted archival news coverage and spoke with historians to check this claim. Kitt was one of 50 women invited to the White House on Jan. 18, 1968, for a ""Women Doer's Luncheon"" to discuss crime among young people, according to a Jan. 19, 1968, New York Times story. Johnson frequently recorded her thoughts and reflections throughout her husband Lyndon Johnson’s presidency, according to the LBJ Presidential Library and Museum. A transcript from a Jan. 18, 1968, recording details the day of the luncheon. Other women in attendance included governors’ wives, senators’ wives, journalists, and members of the National Emergency Committee on the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, according to Johnson’s audio diary. Both President Lyndon Johnson and the first lady were at the luncheon. When Kitt rose to speak, she offered a sharp condemnation of the Vietnam War, according to the New York Times story. In her audio diary, Lady Bird Johnson said that Kitt took a step toward her, ""looking with intense directness at me,"" when she offered her critique. ""You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed,"" Kitt said during the luncheon, according to the Times. ""They rebel in the street. They will take pot and they will get high. They don’t want to go to school because they’re going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam."" Johnson said Kitt’s speech stunned the room into silence. Kitt wasn't the only entertainment icon to criticize the Johnson administration over the Vietnam War. Michael Gillette, a former historian at the LBJ Presidential Library, said journalist Walter Cronkite and actress Jane Fonda were among the public figures who spoke out against the war. Kitt’s comments were well documented in the press, as they caused quite a commotion. An anonymous letter to the first lady on Jan. 22, 1968, included racist language about Kitt and said she ""defiled the White House and made us all ashamed."" A woman named Clarence Nowack left a message for Johnson on Jan. 20, 1968, to say she was proud of her son for volunteering to serve in the war, where he was killed. Warren E. Burger, then a federal appellate judge who would be named a year later to the U.S. Supreme Court, said in a Jan. 19, 1968, letter to Johnson that he and his wife were proud of how she composed herself during the luncheon. ""The unhappy episode at your recent luncheon impells me to write you to say that Mrs. Burger and I took a deep pride in the courage and composure you exhibited in the face of a gross breach of your hospitality and of good elementary manners,"" Burger said. A letter to the editor published on Jan. 27, 1968, in the Times said in part: ""There are even a few of us who believe that it is not really decent, or fair, to attack a man by insulting and humiliating his wife in the presence of other guests and the press."" Kitt told the Times, according to a Jan. 23, 1968, article, that she had received telegrams, phone calls and mail from supporters who agreed with what she had said. Kitt later said in a June 7, 2006, video interview that she had not realized that the debacle at the White House affected her career until investigative reporter Seymour Hersh called her about the CIA’s file on her. ""I didn’t realize I was being rejected in the United States and I couldn’t find work. I thought maybe my popularity is waning, my records sales are not up,"" Kitt said. Byer said Johnson asked the CIA to find damaging information on Kitt after the luncheon. We couldn’t find evidence of this direct request. But the Secret Service did request information about Kitt from the CIA the day after the women’s luncheon, according to Hersh's Jan. 3, 1975, story in the Times. Historians say it is unclear who directed the Secret Service to make the request. Secret Service officials said they asked the CIA for information on Kitt to see if she was a threat to President Johnson or others under their protection, according to the Times. The CIA gave a three-page report on Kitt to the Secret Service, a file the agency had maintained since at least 1956, because Kitt had done work overseas, the Times reported. The report stated that Kitt had a ""very nasty disposition"" and described her as ""being a spoiled child, very crude and having a vile tongue."" We submitted an open records request to the CIA seeking the information in the report. The CIA responded: ""we did not locate any responsive records that would reveal a publicly acknowledged CIA affiliation with the subject."" John Wilson, an archivist at the LBJ Presidential Library, said he doubts Lady Bird Johnson would have asked the CIA to investigate the star, and if she did, she would not have put it in writing. ""As far as actual power, first ladies don’t have very much, but people would tend to listen, I would think,"" Wilson said. ""Whether or not she should or could ask is one thing, but if she did ask them informally, they would be a lot more likely to pay attention."" Gillette said that Johnson would not have wanted to fan the flames around the Kitt incident. ""I knew her a long time and I knew a lot of people who knew her better than I did, and that’s so out of character for her that it’s almost laughable,"" Gillette said. ""Drunk History"" claimed former first lady Lady Bird Johnson demanded the CIA find damning information on singer Eartha Kitt. While the Secret Service did request information from the CIA following the luncheon, there is no evidence to support the idea that Lady Bird Johnson asked for the information. The Secret Service said the request was made for security purposes, not to ""destroy her."" We rate this claim Mostly False.

Gavin Newsom’s ridiculous claim: ‘Vast majority’ of San Francisco’s homeless people come from Texas
","There are many reasons for San Francisco’s homelessness crisis: Gentrification. Job losses. Evictions. Mental health and substance abuse struggles. But … Texas?  California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently blamed the Lone Star State for somehow producing the bulk of the city’s homeless population. Newsom was mayor of San Francisco from January 2004 through January 2011.  The Democratic governor was asked during a June interview on ""Axios on HBO"" why San Francisco’s homeless population did not experience a net decline during his tenure as mayor. Newsom said most of the homeless people on the street when he left office were not from California, but added ""we took responsibility"" for them.  He then made the head-scratching claim about Texas.  ""The vast majority (of San Francisco’s homeless people) also come in from — and we know this — from Texas. Just (an) interesting fact,"" Newsom said.  San Francisco has struggled for decades with a large homeless population, which reached 8,011 in January — up 17 percent from two years ago, according to the city’s most recent point in time count.  We examined Newsom’s mayoral record on homelessness in a previous fact check. And we’re tracking his gubernatorial campaign promise to tackle the issue statewide through our Newsom-Meter project.  The Los Angeles Times first pointed out Newsom’s questionable statement about Texas, leading the California Republican Party to later call it ""a baseless claim.""  We decided to dig in for our own fact check.  Our research Newsom’s statement is contradicted by San Francisco’s own point in time homeless counts. Those reports are conducted every two years.  They consistently show a large majority of people surveyed said they lived in San Francisco prior to becoming homeless.  A smaller share said they lived in another California county. Often the smallest percentage said they lived out of state before becoming homeless in San Francisco.  The 2019 report found 70 percent had lived in the city; 22 percent in another California county and 8 percent out-of-state. Of that 70 percent, more than half, or 55 percent, reported living in San Francisco for a decade or more before losing their home. Just 6 percent said they had lived in the city for less than a year.  Going back a dozen years, the city’s 2007 point-in-time count shows 62 percent reported being from San Francisco; about 16 percent were from outside the state and 15 percent were from another county in the state. ""The data shows (Newsom’s statement) is completely and totally incorrect,"" said Jennifer Friedenback, executive director of San Francisco-based Coalition of Homelessness. ""Newsom knows better, by the way.""   Shanna Couper Orona sits outside her RV in San Francisco. A federally mandated count of homeless people in San Francisco showed a 17 percent increase from 2017 to 2019. It was driven, in part, by a surge of people living in vehicles. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Newsom’s response To support the claim, a spokesman for Newsom provided data from San Francisco’s Homeward Bound, a program that gives homeless people bus tickets to travel to friends or family within or outside the state who have agreed to take them in. Some homeless advocacy groups have criticized it as simply moving the problem elsewhere. The data includes travel destinations for the program from 2004 through 2018. It shows approximately 20 percent of Homeward Bound’s trips, or about 2,400, took place inside California during that period. About 80 percent took place out of state.  Texas was the most popular destination outside of California, with 827 trips or 6.7 percent of the program’s 12,268 trips since it started. The next most popular were Washington state, at 5.8 percent, and Florida, at 5.4 percent. At 6.7 percent, Texas in no way can be described as accounting for ""the vast majority"" of San Francisco’s homeless population. It also doesn't mean all those who took a trip to Texas were necessarily from that state.  All it means is ""you have someone you can stay with"" in that state, not that you were born or raised there, Friedenbach noted. She added that some African Americans who have been displaced and left homeless in San Francisco in recent years have family ties in Texas or other southern states, but did not necessarily grow up there.  Homeward Bound’s requirements say nothing about needing to be from a particular state.  Here’s what they do say: ""The Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing can provide you with a bus ticket home if you: are homeless/low income and living in San Francisco; and have family or friends at the destination that Homeward Bound staff can verify as willing and able to provide you a place to stay and ongoing support; and are medically stable enough to travel unassisted to the destination; and are sober and able to abstain from alcohol or using other substances en route."" Calls to San Francisco’s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing were not returned.  Our ruling California Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed the ""vast majority"" of San Francisco’s homeless people come in from Texas. San Francisco’s own homeless surveys contradict this. They show a large majority reported living in the city before becoming homeless, and just a fraction coming in from out-of-state.  Newsom’s office pointed to data from San Francisco’s bus ticket program for homeless people. But that defense doesn’t hold up. It shows just a small fraction, less than 7 percent, left for Texas, and doesn’t demonstrate that they originally came to San Francisco from that state.  In the end, we found Newsom made a ridiculous claim.  We rated it Pants on Fire.

Trump-backed ex-pitcher Curt Schilling misleads saying self-defense gun use stops 2.5 million crimes
","Curt Schilling, a former Major League Baseball pitcher and former ESPN commentator known for controversial views, says he is considering a run for Congress in Arizona. The news quickly drew a cheer from President Donald Trump. Three days earlier, Schilling threw a fastball of a claim about guns that caught our attention. A TV reporter in Charlotte, N.C., had tweeted that an armed patron with a concealed carry permit shot two armed robbery suspects at a 7-Eleven, killing one of them. A sales manager for the U.S. Concealed Carry Association responded with a tweet saying, ""You mean to tell me a law-abiding, responsible gun owner actually DID stop crime?"" Schilling replied to that tweet with a reference to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying: ""Happens 2.5 million times a year per the CDC."" That’s actually not a count but an estimate, on the higher end, and it wasn’t done by the CDC. A spokesman for Cameo, a service Schilling promotes on his Twitter profile that pays him and other celebrities to create ""personalized video shoutouts"" for purchase, said he could not forward our request to Schilling for information that would back up his statement.  However, responding to a critic on Twitter, Schilling cited an opinion article on Forbes.com, which in turn references a 2013 report. The report was requested by the CDC, but was done by what is now known as the National Academy of Medicine, a federally chartered nonprofit.  The report did not produce its own estimates; rather, it cited estimates from studies. It also made clear that estimates vary widely. ""Defensive use of guns by crime victims is a common occurrence, although the exact number remains disputed,"" ranging from 108,000 to 3 million instances per year, the report stated.  Both the 3 million figure, and a 2.5 million figure mentioned in the report, stem from one gun researcher, Florida State University criminal justice professor Gary Kleck. Kleck said in an interview with PolitiFact that the 2.5 million comes not from the CDC but from a national survey he and Florida State colleague Marc Gertz did in 1993, asking a random sample of adults if they had used a gun in ""self-protection"" or in protection of property in the past year, and how they had used it.  So, that’s a survey that is 26 years old. The study estimated that Americans use guns for self-protection — that is, the person using the gun, though not necessarily firing it, believed that a crime, such as burglary or assault, was being committed — up to 2.5 million times per year. Kleck also provided us a 2018 article he wrote summarizing the findings of 20 other surveys that asked at least one question about defensive gun use. The ""implied number"" of defensive gun use incidents ranged from 600,000 to 6.1 million per year, according to the article.  Other gun researchers we contacted view Kleck’s 2.5 million estimate as extremely high.  Surveying people about events that rarely occur always produces overestimates, said Harvard University professor of health policy David Hemenway. The best survey of crime is the National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the U.S. Justice Department and the Census Bureau since 1973, Duke University professor of public policy studies Philip Cook told us. ""There are subtle differences"" between it and Kleck’s survey, in how questions about self-defense are asked, ""but the difference in the resulting estimate of how often guns are used in self-defense is huge,"" he said. In recent years, the NCVS-based estimate is less than 100,000 per year, Cook said. Both figures have their critics. The 2.5 million is ""not plausible given other information that is more trustworthy, such as the total number of U.S. residents who are injured or killed by guns each year,"" the RAND Corp. said in a 2018 analysis. ""At the other extreme, the NCVS ""almost certainly underestimates the true number."" Kleck criticized the NCVS estimates as ""wildly out of line"" with other estimates because its surveys only ask crime victims whether they tried to protect themselves, which means those who used a gun would have to ""volunteer"" that information. Schilling said law-abiding gun owners stop crimes ""2.5 million times a year,"" according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. The number of such instances is not known, and no estimate has been done by the CDC. A report requested by the CDC cites various studies, including one by a Florida State University gun researcher based on a 1993 survey which estimates that people use guns about 2.5 million times per year in self-defense, when they believe a crime is being committed.  That study did not try to determine whether the people in those instances were actual gun owners or whether they were law abiding during the incident. But the researcher says studies as recently as 2018 have produced estimates as high as 6.1 million. Other gun researchers, however, say 2.5 million is an extremely high estimate. They point to surveys that estimate about 100,000 such incidents per year. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Democrats advocated for stricter gun laws after Alexandria shooting
","Democratic presidential candidates are campaigning for stricter gun laws in the wake of mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, but online, some social media users are wondering where those calls to action were when Republican lawmakers came under attack. ""I tried to kill a bunch of Republican Congressional Softball Players with my rifle,"" reads an Aug. 6 Facebook post with a photo of James Hodgkinson, the man who fired dozens of rounds at a Republican congressional softball team on June 14, 2017, in Alexandria, Virginia. ""Not one Democrat called for Gun Control.""    This post, which had been shared more than 7,000 times by Aug. 8, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what you should know. U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, then the House majority whip, and four others were wounded when Hodgkinson shot at them during their baseball practice. Hodgkinson, who was angry with President Donald Trump and posted rants against Republicans online, was killed by police. In the weeks after, conservative lawmakers called to loosen gun restrictions. Republicans introduced legislation to allow lawmakers to almost always carry a concealed weapon and to allow concealed carry permits obtained in other states to be recognized in the District of Columbia, the New York Times then reported. Democrats opposed the measures. U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the House’s nonvoting member from D.C., said it ""is the last place you want to condone or allow concealed-carry weapons"" and ""they are certainly not going to be successful if I have anything to say about it.""  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Rahm Emanuel, then Chicago’s mayor, among other Democrats, offered a resolution as part of the U.S. Conference of Mayors to oppose concealed carry bills. Rep. Joe Crowley, then the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said arming lawmakers was not the solution to improve congressional safety. ""It makes it very difficult to slide into second base when you have a pistol on your side,"" he said. Other Democrats explicitly called for more gun control after the shooting.  Terry McAuliffe, then the Democratic governor of Virginia, called for more background checks and closing the ""gun-show loophole,"" according to USA Today.  NBC News noted that some Democrats were quick ""to use the incident to call for new gun restrictions opposed by many in the GOP.""  ""Democratic State Rep. Mark Levine, who represents Alexandria, let his voice rise as he ticked through the gun control legislation that Republicans have blocked in the Virginia General Assembly,"" the NBC story said. Much of the coverage in the Alexandria shooting’s aftermath focused on partisanship and rhetoric and accusations that both sides of the aisle were fueling discord across the country. As Republicans introduced legislation to loosen gun control restrictions, Democrats pushed back, and some called for more restrictions.

No, the daughter of a Trump appointee didn’t pose as an El Paso or Dayton shooting victim
","As the survivors and family members of victims of mass shootings recover and grieve, their pain is increased by accusations that they’re not real survivors or family members of victims. According to conspiracy theorists whose claims often go viral, they are crisis actors playing parts in a fabricated tragedy.  Add to that false narrative the skepticism of President Donald Trump’s critics and you get a social media post like like this one.  It features two photos. The first is of Trump leaning over a person in a hospital bed. The second is of Ivanka Trump standing with her arm around a girl’s shoulder.

Our reporting shows she is a survivor of the mass shooting outside a bar in Dayton on Aug. 4 that left 10 people dead, including the suspect. She is an adult, though, not a little girl as the Facebook post suggests, and there is no evidence that she is a crisis actor, much less the daughter of a Trump appointee.  The first photo was published among others on The White House’s Instagram page on Aug. 7 with this caption: ""The President and First lady met with survivors and family members in Dayton, Ohio, this afternoon."" Sharon Howard, a spokesperson for the Miami Valley Hospital, would not comment directly on the Facebook post’s allegations. But she told us that all of the hospital’s patients are adults and all of the photos the White House released following the president’s visit are legitimate.  While Trump was at the hospital, Howard said, he met with the three patients who were still checked in following the shooting, and he met with their families, first responders and the medical team that treated the patients.  He did not meet with any other patients while he was there, she said.  Ivanka Trump posted the second photo on Twitter on Aug. 7 and tweeted: ""Thank you @WHAAsstSecty Kim Breier for your friendship and service. While Jared and I will miss working with you, we are happy that Emma will now get to see more of the mom she is so proud of!""  On Facebook, Ivanka Trump’s photo was cropped to exclude the image of Kimberly Breier, the assistant secretary of state for the western hemisphere, who resigned this month.  These images are of two different people.

No, Ilhan Omar has not been arrested 23 times
","A recent Facebook post adds criminal and daughter of a terrorist to the list of baseless accusations that have been made about U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. The photo, published Aug. 1 by a conservative Facebook page called Tactical Hospitality, makes a variety of claims about Omar, some of which are related to previous fact-checks about her family history and comments about al-Qaida. Two claims were new to us: The post said Omar has been ""arrested 23 times"" and is the ""daughter of (a) Somali terrorist."" ""From jail cell, to Congress,"" claims the photo, which includes images of Omar’s purported mugshot and another of her being sworn in as a congresswoman. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) PolitiFact reached out to Tactical Hospitality to see where it got the image. The page told us that it ""grabbed it from an individual whom shared it"" and that it wasn’t sure of the origin. When we looked into the claims, we found that Omar has not been arrested 23 times and there’s no evidence to suggest either of her parents are involved with terrorist organizations. We checked public records and found that Omar was arrested once — not 23 times. The Facebook post conflated the congresswoman’s traffic violations with arrests.  Snopes fact-checked a related claim that the representative ""was arrested in 2013 for trespassing."" The post included the same mugshot pictured in the photo that Tactical Hospitality shared. Snopes rated that statement true. The fact-checker pointed to a police report from January 2013. It says Omar was arrested on two misdemeanor charges for trespassing and refusing to leave a Minneapolis hotel. She was booked into Hennepin County Jail. She was 30. Omar’s trespassing charges were later dropped, the Associated Press reported in October. The congresswoman refused to leave a hotel lobby that was filled with people following the Somali president, who was in town to give a speech. Omar snuck back in and after police cleared the lobby. PolitiFact could not find the incident in a public database of Minnesota court records. Her campaign did not comment. What we did find in the database were 24 traffic violations from the past 10 years, the most recent being a parking ticket from January, in which Omar was convicted of a petty misdemeanor for parking ""overtime in a meter zone."" Under Minnesota law, a conviction means ""a plea of guilty; or a verdict of guilty by a jury or a finding of guilty by the court."" The other 23 charges include several such parking violations, as well as two expired plates and one speeding ticket. In winter 2016, Omar paid two tickets for not following ""snow emergency parking restrictions,"" which set specific times in which drivers cannot park on certain roads. Jail time is not listed for any of those traffic violations — and being charged with petty misdemeanors is not the same as being arrested. PolitiFact reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department for more details about Omar’s record. The MPD’s Records Information Unit sent us a document indicating that Omar had only been arrested once — in 2013 for the trespassing charge. The second claim in the Facebook post is much more serious, alleging that Omar is the daughter of a Somali terrorist. A spokesman for Omar’s office sent two articles with biographical information about Omar, without further elaboration. City Pages, an alternative newspaper in the Twin Cities, reported in November 2016 that Omar’s mother died when she was little. And, before civil war broke out in the early 1990s, her father trained teachers in Somalia.  The family was sent to a refugee camp in Kenya during the conflict, The Washington Post reported July 6. They were granted U.S. asylum in 1995, eventually settling in Minneapolis, where Omar’s father worked as a cab driver and, later, at a post office. We could not find any evidence that either of Omar’s parents were terrorists or war criminals in Somalia. Snopes similarly could not determine whether Omar’s father, Nur Omar Mohamed, was a ""war criminal"" in Somalia, as The Gateway Pundit claimed, for a July 25 fact check. The conservative news site, which PolitiFact has fact-checked in the past, reported July 16 that Omar’s father was connected to Siad Barre, president of Somalia from 1969 to 1991. But, as Snopes noted, The Gateway Pundit didn’t offer proof of this. Instead, the site mentioned another man, Yusuf Abdi Ali, and claimed — without evidence — that the two were connected. (Here’s more about him from a CNN report.) A viral photo on Facebook claims that Ilhan Omar has been arrested 23 times and is the daughter of a Somali terrorist. She was arrested once and the charges were dropped. Minnesota court records show that Omar has had 24 traffic violations in the past 10 years, not arrests. We could not find any evidence that either of Omar’s parents were involved in a terrorist organization in Somalia. The post is not accurate.

Does a portion of every Bang energy drink purchase go to Trump re-election efforts? Not exactly
","Loads of people on the internet are convinced that a portion of every Bang energy drink sale goes directly to President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign or other Trump 2020 efforts.  The connection between the energy drink company and President Trump is not as direct as this rumor makes it out to be. A viral Facebook post shared Aug. 5 has amassed more than 500 comments and 3,600 shares. It features an image of a Bang energy drink with someone holding up their middle finger in front of it. The body of the post reads,""Didn’t know but just found this out that every-time you purchased a bang a portion of your money helps re-election Donald Trump & goes to the fund campaign for MAGA! This is a break up ..... I can’t support a company that helps support a Man that puts children in cages, who promotes racisms, who is a white supremacist etc."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, a portion of every Bang energy drink purchase does not directly fund Trump’s re-election efforts, but the parent company of Bang — Vital Pharmeceuticals — did donate a large sum of money to a pro-Trump PAC. The rumor started after Axios published a story on July 31, 2019, that reported pro-Trump super PAC America First Action and its affiliated nonprofit, America First Policies, raised nearly $18 million in the first half of 2019. The story identified some of the committee’s top donors: real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer gave $2 million, former Small Business Administration leader and wrestling executive Linda McMahon gave $1 million, and Vital Pharmaceuticals donated $250,000. According to Federal Election Commission filings, it is the only contribution the company has made. The website Popular Info picked up on the Bang-Vital Pharmaceuticals connection from the report and published a subsequent story on Aug. 1 with the headline, ""Every can of this energy drink helps Trump get re-elected."" It didn’t take long for the claim to spill over into social media posts of former Bang devotees saying they are giving up the energy drink because of its political affiliation. But the story and social media posts overstate the energy drink’s connection to Trump’s re-election campaign or related PACs. Yes, its parent company donated $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, but there is no direct distribution from a portion of every energy drink purchased. Neither Bang’s website nor its social media accounts advertise any kind of political fundraising campaign. PolitiFact also reached out to the company, but did not immediately hear back. However, Vital Pharmaceuticals CEO and Bang energy drink founder Jack Owoc and his wife Meg Liz Owoc have been outspoken in their support for Trump in the past. @realDonaldTrump Your brilliance has fueled the most epic turn of events in the history of politics. God bless the inevitable – Trump wins! #TrumpAddress I LOVE MY PRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump 🇺🇸❤️ It can be argued that the energy drink’s sales may have boosted the amount the parent company chose to donate and could help fuel future donations, but it is inaccurate to say a portion of each Bang energy drink purchase directly funds Trump’s re-election campaign or other Trump 2020 efforts.

Bloomberg correct that NRA’s Wayne LaPierre once supported background checks
","Billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg took a familiar swipe at NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre during an Aug. 11 interview on CBS’s ""Face the Nation."" Host Margaret Brennan asked Bloomberg, who helped launch the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, if he thought the NRA would be able to ""bankroll"" in 2020 like it did in 2016, when it gave millions to President Donald Trump’s campaign. Numerous mass shootings have taken place since Trump’s election, including two in the span of 24 hours last weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. ""I think the NRA has been very badly hurt by this,"" Bloomberg said. ""Ninety percent of NRA members are in favor of background checks, so the NRA is not in the place of most of its members. And in fact, if you go back, you can see Wayne LaPierre, who runs the NRA, testifying before Congress in favor of background checks 15 or 20 years ago."" Related: ""Do majority of NRA members support background checks for guns?"" Bloomberg made almost the exact same claim about LaPierre’s testimony in 2013. Former President Barack Obama did, too.  It’s still accurate. We wanted to revisit the history in light of the NRA’s typically staunch resistance to gun control efforts and the Washington Post’s recent report that LaPierre called Trump to warn against pushing for background checks.  On May 27, 1999, a month after the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. LaPierre, also the chief executive at that time, listed a number of gun-related actions and laws the group believed would be ""reasonable."" Mandatory background checks for guns at gun shows was one. ""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show,"" he said. ""No loopholes anywhere for anyone.""  ""That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system,"" he continued. ""This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances."" ""We think it’s reasonable to provide for instant gun checks at shows, just like at gun stores and pawn shops,"" LaPierre said, echoing a message at the heart of an NRA advertising campaign from that year.  In 2013, LaPierre and the NRA acknowledged the change in position. In a January Senate hearing that year — this time following a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — LaPierre was asked by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., about his 1999 testimony on background checks. Leahy asked if the United States should ""have mandatory background checks at gun shows for sales of weapons."" ""Senator, I do not believe, the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors,"" LaPierre said. In response to a follow-up, he added: ""We do not (support mandatory background checks at gun shows), because the fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it’s working."" Also in January 2013, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN, ""The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work."" Plus, on March 12, 2013, the NRA signaled its opposition to background checks on its website: ""The NRA opposes criminalizing private firearms transfers between law-abiding individuals, and therefore opposes an expansion of the background check system."" Bloomberg said, ""If you go back, you can see Wayne LaPierre, who runs the NRA, testifying before Congress in favor of background checks 15 or 20 years ago."" In 1999 testimony before Congress, LaPierre said, ""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show."" Subsequent statements from LaPierre and other NRA officials have acknowledged that the organization’s position on background checks has since changed.

In many cases, the headlines tell the story: — Jan. 23, 2019, Gallup report: ""U.S. Uninsured Rate Rises to Four-Year High."" — April 25, 2019, Georgetown University Health Policy Institute: ""Updated CBO Estimates Find Uninsured Increased by 1.4 Million Between 2016 and 2018."" — Jan. 23, 2019, Forbes: ""Uninsured rate hits four-year high amid Trump’s Obamacare attacks.""  — May 9, 2019, USA Today: ""CDC: 1.1 million more American lost health insurance coverage in 2018.""  — Jan. 23, 2019, Los Angeles Times: ""Uninsured rate under Trump surges to highest level since Obamacare began.""  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics report on health insurance shows there were 28.6 million people uninsured in 2016, the year before Trump took office. That represents 9% of the population. In 2018, that number showed 30.4 million people, or 9.4% of people all ages were without insurance.  The numbers of uninsured had been in decline but now are beginning to tick  upward. So, Baldwin is in the ball park with the ""more Americans"" part of the statement.  But her claim ties the reduction in those with insurance to actions by Trump and his administration. How does she fare in that regard? Administration actions Trump campaigned on the issue of repealing the ACA. Since taking office in January of 2017, his administration has steadily taken steps to roll back the law. On Jan. 20, 2017, Trump issued an executive order that directed federal agencies to use their administrative powers to begin dismantling the Affordable Care Act ""to the maximum extent permitted by law.""  Currently, a federal appeals court in New Orleans has taken up the Affordable Care Act case, Texas v. United States, which has been brought by Republican-led states. A lower court judge already ruled the health law unconstitutional. The case could wind up before the Supreme Court, which in 2012 upheld the law saying its requirement that individuals buy insurance or pay a penalty was covered by Congress’ ability to levy taxes. Meanwhile, a July 7, 2019 CNN article headlined ""5 ways Trump is undermining Obamacare without the courts"" noted the administration has: Made it harder to sign up: That is, Trump cut the enrollment period in half and cut advertising about how to sign up. Broadened access to alternative plans: An October 2017 executive order allows more people to buy cheaper policies -- though ones with less coverage and fewer protections. Made enrollees pay more: Among other factors, moves that change how some of the law's provisions are adjusted every year mean policyholders will have to pay 2.5% more out of pocket. Let states alter Obamacare:  States, including Wisconsin, have applied for waivers so they do not have to apply parts of the law. Required Medicaid recipients to work: As the CNN article notes: ""The Trump administration is allowing states to require certain Medicaid enrollees -- particularly those who gained coverage under Obamacare -- to work in order to continue receiving benefits."" Meanwhile, on March 28, 2019, PolitiFact National checked a similar claim from Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro, who said Trump’s health care policies have ""left millions more Americans uninsured since he took office."" Castro’s claim specifically said ""millions,"" which differs from Baldwin’s much more general claim. At the time, the number was actually closer to 1.3 million. PolitiFact National concluded Castro had the trend right, but his numbers wrong, and rated his claim Half True. Our ruling Baldwin said ""more Americans are uninsured today than when Trump took office.""  Census Bureau statistics show that there was a steady decline in the number of uninsured Americans following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act -- a trend that reversed and began ticking upward under Trump. We rate Baldwin’s statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280972A43C0>],/factchecks/2019/aug/13/tammy-baldwin/us-sen-baldwin-right-more-americans-are-without-he/
"['Guns', 'Virginia', 'Philip Van Cleave']","
Van Cleave in ballpark on criminals who had gun background checks
","Beefing up background checks on gun buyers won’t reduce crime, says Philip Van Cleave, a Virginia gun lobbyist. Van Cleave is president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. During an Aug. 8 interview on WRVA Radio in Richmond, he was dismissive of calls for stronger background checks in the wake of fatal mass shootings this year in Virginia and other states. ""Criminals don’t go through background checks,"" he said. ""I think it’s like 3% go through a background check - 3%. Ninety-seven percent get the guns on the street."" We fact-checked Van Cleave’s claim.  Democrats in Virginia’s General Assembly and in Congress are calling for tighter background checks. Virginia and federal laws require all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling firearms - to run computerized checks to see if buyers have disqualifying criminal or mental health records. But gun sales between individuals not in the business - say, neighbors or hobbyists - are exempt. President Donald Trump has recently said he supports stronger background checks, but has not specified what changes he favors.  Van Cleave told us his 3% statistic comes from a 2016 survey of 24,848 state and federal prisoners by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. The bureau reported its findings in January 2019.  Of the inmates, 21% said they used or possessed a firearm while committing the crime that put them in prison, or about 5,200 of the sample, according to our calculation (the study did not break down its percentages into numbers of inmates). Of the prisoners who used or possessed a gun during the crime: Now, let’s focus on the 10% who bought their guns from a retailer. They’re important because the researchers identify them as the prisoners who were likely to have taken criminal background checks before they got their guns. Of that group of about 520 retail buyers, around 360 - or 69% - said they bought the gun using their own name. And about 350 of the retail buyers - or 67% - said they underwent a background check using their real name. (The survey doesn’t cite reasons why they passed the check, but perhaps they didn’t have criminal records at the time). Here’s another way of expressing the finding: About 350 of 5,200 inmates who possessed or used a gun during their crime - or 6.7% - said they went through a background check, using their real name.  Our ruling Van Cleave said, ""Criminals don’t go through (gun) background checks. I think it’s like 3% go through a background check."" He was referring to results from a 2016 survey of 24,848 state and federal inmates by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 5,200 of the prisoners said they possessed or used a firearm during their crime. Of that armed group, about 350 - or 6.7 percent - said they went through a background check to get the gun. Van Cleave slightly understates the percentage of gun-toting criminals who went through background checks, but the gist of his claim - that very few of them did - is sound. We rate his statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280976D92C0>],/factchecks/2019/aug/13/philip-van-cleave/van-cleave-ballpark-criminals-who-had-gun-backgrou/
