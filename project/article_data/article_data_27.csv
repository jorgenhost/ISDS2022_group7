Stefani Carter says black women are Texas’ fastest-growing group of concealed-handgun permit applicants
","
You might be surprised to learn who cares about the Second Amendment, lawmaker Stefani Carter suggested in a recent USA Today opinion article.

""What is the fastest-growing demographic group in my state of Texas seeking concealed handgun licenses? Black women,"" wrote Carter, a Dallas Republican running for re-election to the Texas House, in the Aug. 30, 2012, piece.

We decided to check out who’s taking advantage lately of Texas’ concealed-handgun law, which since January 1996 has allowed permit holders to carry such guns in most public places while excluding others, such as churches.

Katy Aldredge, a deputy district director for Carter, told us Carter’s main source was a July 12, 2012, post on The Volokh Conspiracy, a conservative-leaning legal analysis blog written by law professor Eugene Volokh of the University of California-Los Angeles. Aldredge also sent us links to annual reports on concealed handgun licenses on the Texas Department of Public Safety website.

Aldredge said Carter found Volokh’s blog and compared his data to the DPS reports of licenses issued. (We did the same, and the data matches.) Aldredge also said that despite the word ""seeking"" in her article, Carter was discussing licenses issued, not applications.

In his blog post, Volokh looked at how many of the permits issued in each year went to black men and women and white men and women. By email, he told us that he did not look at the DPS’ other race groupings because they were too small or too unclear. Those categories are ""American Indian or Alaskan Native,"" ""Asian or Pacific Islander,"" ""Multi-Racial"" and ""Other/Unknown."" Volokh’s post said that most Hispanics seem to be counted as ""white"" in the DPS numbers, ""following the modern demographic approach of treating Hispanic as an ethnicity rather than as a separate race.""

But Hispanics are Texas’ largest minority. According to the latest state QuickFacts sheet from the U.S. Census Bureau, Texas’ 2011 demographics (including some overlap) were: 44.8 percent white, 38.1 percent Hispanic, 12.2 percent black, 4 percent Asian, 1 percent ""American Indian and Alaska Native,"" 0.1 percent ""Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander.""

The DPS numbers, not separating Hispanic and white, show that of the CHL permits issued in 2011, 86.5 percent went to whites, 6.8 percent to black, 3.4 percent to ""other/unknown,"" 2 percent to ""Asian or Pacific Islander,"" 1 percent to ""multi-racial,"" and 0.33 percent to ""American Indian or Alaskan Native"" Texans.

Volokh’s analysis found that among black and white permit recipients, from 1996 through 2011, the percentage of women in the total was consistently smaller than the percentage of men but that this gender gap was narrowing slightly.

The uptick among black women, he said, was ""especially striking"": Black women got less than 1 percent of the 317,205 permits issued from 1996 through 2000, he said, but got 1.63 percent of the 558,190 permits issued from 2007 through 2011.

Seeking another expert view, we contacted conservative writer John Lott, whom we saw cited in an April 24, 2012, New York Times news story that discussed ""growth in the number of people with concealed-carry permits"" nationwide; the Times described Lott as ""a researcher of gun culture who has held teaching or research posts at a number of universities, including the University of Chicago.""

When we asked him by email about Carter’s statement, Lott took a look at Texas data from 2000 through 2011, comparing the number of permit recipients in a particular race category each year with the number of people in that race category who got permits in 2000.

The jump in multi-racial women permit holders from 2000 to 2011 was the most extreme, but Lott cautioned that result is exaggerated because the category is small -- meaning the addition of a few people can dramatically alter the percent change -- and because more people these days describe themselves as multi-racial than in 2000.

Throwing out that category because of its size -- as Volokh did -- Lott told us, ""Carter is correct that black females since 2000 have had the largest percentage increase.""

He created this chart of the Texas data for us:

That’s a lot of little colored lines, but we determined that the DPS numbers back up Lott’s finding: The biggest increase between 2000 and 2011 was in the category of multi-racial female permit recipients, which jumped from 28 in 2000 to 318 in 2011. That 139-person difference produced the 1035.7 percent change charted by the dark-brown line at top.

The number of black female permit-holders rose 554 percent from 2000 to 2011 -- a smaller percent change, but involving a larger number of people: 2,046. The records show 369 black women in Texas had CHLs in 2000 and 2,415 had them in 2011.

In a later interview, Volokh took a look at the multi-racial numbers and agreed they were statistically unreliable, for the same reasons: because it was such a small group and some of its growth likely came as people began adopting that term for themselves.

""I’d still say that black women were the fastest-growing demographic group of any substantial size,"" he told us.

But that observation, like Lott’s and Carter’s, is limited by the demographic groups DPS used. Without breaking out Hispanics -- nearly 40 percent of Texans -- separately, we see no way to give an accurate picture of the demographics and changes among Texas’ concealed-carry permit holders.

Carter’s piece didn’t mention the lack of data on Hispanics.

Why such changes occurred is murkier. Carter’s opinion article cites some statistics about crime against black women and mentions nationwide increases in women owning guns. Volokh limited his analysis to the numbers rather than the reasons behind them.

Lott told us that black women as a group overlap with the two categories of people who benefit the most from concealed-carry permits, according to his research: people who are physically weaker than assailants (primarily women and elderly people) and people who are likely victims of violent crime, including low-income residents of high-crime urban areas.


Our ruling

Carter claims black women are the fastest-growing group of permit-seekers.

We accept her explanation that she meant to refer to permits issued each year. And her statement fairly captures available data and research.

However, the lack of information on Hispanic permit recipients makes it impossible to conclude which Texas subgroups are getting permits most often.

We rate the statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2012/oct/05/stefani-carter/stefani-carter-says-black-women-texas-fastest-grow/
"['National', 'Debates', 'Education', 'States', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney said Massachusetts schools are ranked 1st in the nation
","
Republican Mitt Romney declared his love for ""great schools"" during the first presidential debate. Did he go overboard in calling his home state’s schools the best in all the land?

Romney’s comments came in response to a dig from President Barack Obama, who said Romney ""doesn’t think we need more teachers"" while Obama wants to hire 100,000 for math and science.

""Well, first, I love great schools,"" Romney replied. ""Massachusetts, our schools are ranked No. 1 of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.""

Many education experts say Romney is right about Massachusetts, which he governed for four years, boasting the nation’s best schools. (We should note that Romney did not say his actions specifically made the state No. 1, so we won't grade him on whether he gets credit or not. )

One prominent Twitter user -- Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, a Democrat and Obama surrogate -- strongly disagreed with Romney's brag.

""Hey, Governor @MittRomney, Maryland schools are #1 and have been for the last four years in a row. #Debates,"" tweeted O’Malley.

Look, no one wants a schoolyard rumble over which state has the best schools. We decided to intervene and analyze Romney’s claim.

Bay State students are testing beasts

Unfortunately for this check, there’s no clear-cut comparison of school quality by state. Too many states have their own annual assessments, for example, one of many factors making an apples-to-apples comparison pretty unobtainable.

Instead, education experts tend to go by one across-the-board measure they can get: the National Assessment of Education Progress, or NAEP, which is an exam administered to a sample of fourth, eighth and twelfth grade students every two years in reading and math. All states and DC have been included since 2003.

The NAEP is called ""the nation’s report card,"" and Massachusetts students have long been dominant.

That’s not to say Bay State students always outperform their peers on every administration of the exam, said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent, nonpartisan research to inform public education reform in Massachusetts.

""But they do score No. 1 on a majority of the assessments,"" he said, ""and taken as a whole, I think it’s fair to say they are among the top performers, if not the top performer.""

The state’s fourth and eighth graders have scored the highest or tied for first in reading on the NAEP since 2002. Fourth graders have been similarly strong math since 1996, and eighth graders have been the nation’s very best since 2007 after lingering near the top of the pack since 1992.

It’s worth pointing out that some groups, such as the National Education Association, do not think ""horse race"" state rankings based on NAEP scores is a good idea. The group pointed us to a paper by Bert Stoneberg, who directed NAEP at the Idaho Department of Education, that advises against ranking states without factoring in standard error, which would show more ties (our data showed the ties).

""This may be one of the reasons that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) specifically does not rank states,"" NEA spokeswoman Staci Maier said in an email.

Other evaluations

The state ranks well in other measures, too. Massachusetts placed first in a 2011 analysis of high school students’ performance in physics and calculus.

The Daily Beast featured Massachusetts in the top spot in its feature ""America’s Smartest Kids,"" which primarily relied on NAEP scores.

And a 2011 Harvard University study determined Massachusetts students perform at levels on par with some of the world’s most educated countries. The state had the country’s highest percentage of students at the advanced level in math (about 15 percent), running with countries like Belgium, Canada, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands.

So Massachusetts students have the highest testing outcomes of the nation. Some experts say it’s debatable whether the school system should get the credit.

Massachusetts has a high standard of living, high household incomes and a high-performing university system. Don’t these give their students an inherent advantage over states with more low-income students? It’s unclear.

Education experts also link student success with the aggressive education reform law Massachusetts passed in 1993. These reforms established a state accountability system that became the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS. The law also authorized charter schools and provided more money to the poorest school districts.

""Massachusetts has a number of factors in place that create a strong foundation for successful schools and high student performance,"" d'Entremont said. ""Over two decades of education reform have taken advantage of that to make sure students are doing well.""

We should also note that for all of its proficiency in reading and math, Massachusetts has an achievement-gap issue -- one that Romney said narrowed during his single term as governor (Half True). The achievement gap is the disparity in performance between primarily white, middle- and upper-class students, consistently the strongest students, and their black, Latino and low-income peers.

While Massachusetts ranks high for low-income and African-American students, its largest minority group -- Latino -- trails other states, most noticeably in eighth grade reading and science.

""Despite its high rankings, Massachusetts continues to have achievement gaps that are about as large, and sometimes larger, than the national average,"" said Blair Mann, a spokeswoman for the Education Trust. ""Despite all of its progress, the state still has a long way to go.""

Another area for improvement: its freshman graduation rate of public high school students. According to the United States Department of Education, seven states beat Massachusetts’ percentage of 83.3 percent in the 2008-2009 academic year.

So what about Maryland?

So where does all that leave Maryland and their proud governor, Martin O’Malley? Also on top, just by a different measure. Education Week has ranked Maryland as the nation’s overall best state for education for the past four years in Quality Counts, a special annual edition.

Massachusetts neared the top In the same four-year period, including a second-place overall finish in 2012. But Maryland had the edge in 2012 in categories such as teaching incentives and allocation, college readiness, early childhood education, and economy and workforce. Massachusetts finished first in more specific categories relating to K-12 achievement and adult outcomes.

Our ruling

Romney has good reason to say Massachusetts has the nation’s best schools. Although there’s no yardstick comparing the quality of schools by state, by several measures, including test results from a federal standardized test, he is right. His claim would be more airtight if he had said Massachusetts had the best testing outcomes.

That said, experts are not unanimous in heralding Massachusetts as the nation’s education leader. Education Week has given the state high marks but given its top distinction to Maryland for the past four years.

All considered, we rate the claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2012/oct/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-massachusetts-schools-are-ranked-/

Paul Sadler says he never supported a state personal income tax for Texas
","
A Dallas debate between U.S. Senate hopefuls Paul Sadler and Ted Cruz heated up over whether Sadler, the Democratic nominee, has advocated a state personal income tax -- which can be a third-rail issue.

Texas is one of nine states without a state income tax. The latest statewide elected official to publicly suggest one, the late Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, left office in early 1999, years after he briefly maintained that a state personal income tax made economic sense. The prospect proved so unpopular, Bullock ushered in a constitutional amendment requiring voter approval before a personal income tax could become law.

Sadler, meanwhile, was a member of the Texas House and once led a panel looking at ways to reduce property taxes while overhauling other taxes.

In the Oct. 2, 2012, debate hosted by WFAA-TV, Channel 8, Cruz said Sadler ""has championed in the state of Texas an income tax.""

Minutes later, Cruz said Sadler ""used to routinely introduce himself around the state as ‘I’m the guy that supports an income tax in the state of Texas.’"" Cruz’s campaign emailed us a Feb. 3, 1993, Houston Chronicle news article quoting then-state Rep. Sadler, of Hendersonville, introducing himself to Harris County parents as ""the guy for the income tax."" But Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton offered no other examples of this self-introduction nor did we find any.

At the debate, Sadler replied: ""That’s just a lie, Ted.""

Cruz rejoined: ""Did you support an income tax, yes or no?""

Sadler: ""I never supported an income tax.""

""I had the responsibility of looking at the tax system of Texas,"" Sadler continued, ""something you (Cruz) wouldn’t know anything about because you’ve never served in the Legislature. You’ve never had the responsibility of putting together a school finance program to pay for our children’s education, to fund education across this state. I did a review of every single tax available, a (value-added) tax, a sales tax, an income tax, you name it, I have done it.""

A day after the debate, Sadler issued a statement saying that in 1992, lawmakers confronting a Texas Supreme Court ruling mandating changes to the school finance system drafted many proposals. ""We drafted bills on consolidation of school districts, expansion of the sales tax, countywide school districts, a personal income tax, and every other possible option. We looked at every single thing that we could do to get Texas out of the courthouse,"" the statement says.

And, the statement says, as ""a leader on public education issues, I sponsored a House resolution to consider a personal income tax.""

According to legislative records, Sadler introduced House Joint Resolution 7, on Dec. 1, 1992, proposing a constitutional amendment ""relating to the authorization and limitation of certain taxes for funding public education."" If it had cleared the House and Senate, it would have awaited voter approval or rejection at the polls.

Voters would have seen this summary: ""The constitutional amendment providing for a personal income tax dedicated to public education, a reduction in the maximum local school property tax rate from $1.50 to 15 cents for each $100 valuation, a requirement that the voters of a local school district approve the levy of local school property taxes, and the deletion of the fuel tax dedication for public education.""

Our online search for news accounts, using the Nexis service, yielded an indication that Sadler advocated for a state personal income tax at the time, though it also brought to light Sadler saying years later that a state personal income tax was unrealistic.

A Nov. 24, 1992, commentary by Dave McNeely of the Austin American-Statesman opens: ""It's against the grain of the conventional political wisdom in Texas. Many consider it political suicide. But freshman state Rep. Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, is advocating an income tax to fund public schools. Openly.""

Sadler had studied education funding, the column says, and concluded that a broad-based statewide tax was needed as an alternative to plans, like the system ultimately passed into law, to transfer property-tax revenue gathered in some school districts to other districts.

McNeely quoted Sadler as saying he favored the merger of some school districts, using incentives, and the creation of a statewide funding source, ""either a statewide property tax or a state income tax, which is the fairest of all methods, because it puts everyone in the scheme.""

The column also quotes Sadler as saying the income tax would have to be sold to voters via a statewide TV blitz buttressed by lawmaker discussions with constituents and educators -- to ""tell them ‘this is what we're doing, this is why, and this is where we want to go with education, and this is how it will benefit you.’""

""If you do that, you could educate the public,"" Sadler said. ""We've not tried to do that, and so what you get from the constituency oftentimes is a knee-jerk reaction: ‘No, I don't want an income tax' -- even though they don't fully understand the relief they'll get from local property taxes and other taxes.

""And it is the fear of an income tax, from a legislator's standpoint, and having to face an opponent that will beat you over the head with that, that keeps most legislators from speaking out and saying what we all know is true,"" Sadler said.

In late 1992, Sadler’s proposed constitutional amendment was referred to a House committee, where it died.

Legislative records indicate that Sadler, who remained a House member into early 2003, did not file any other income tax proposals.

During the 1997 session, though, he resisted pressure to keep an income tax from being studied. At the time, he chaired the House Select Committee on Revenue and Public Education Funding, which weighed proposals by Gov. George W. Bush and others to drive down school property taxes by tapping revenue from other sources.

According to news accounts, Bush ruled out a state personal income tax, while Sadler said it should at least be discussed.  According to a March 4, 1997, American-Statesman news article, Bush’s plan envisioned covering cuts in property and other taxes with higher sales taxes, a new business levy and an available $1 billion state revenue surplus. Under Sadler's proposal, the story says, school property tax cuts would be covered by a combination of sales and business taxes and perhaps even a personal income tax.

""Bush has said he would veto any plan containing an income tax, but Sadler has refused to reject any option,"" the story says, quoting Sadler: ""To say something is off the table is foreign to me. I will not restrict this committee's deliberations.""

House members later passed a plan lacking an income-tax feature. It ultimately died in the Senate -- and Sadler subsequently said a state income tax was ""a dead issue,"" according to a news story in the Sept. 6, 2001, Dallas Morning News. The story says Sadler noted the constitutional provision requiring voter approval before an income tax is implemented before saying: ""The only way we would have an income tax is if the public votes it in, and that won't happen in Texas.""

In a telephone interview, Sadler told us that when he made his debate statement, he didn’t remember he had filed the 1992 proposed constitutional amendment. Sadler said, too, that he did not recall the November 1992 commentary presenting his case for an income tax or statewide property tax, though he said he did recall outlining what he then believed to be the criteria for a long-term school funding solution.

Our ruling

Sadler said he has ""never"" supported a state personal income tax. 
To the contrary, he authored a 1992 proposal that, with voter approval, would have resulted in a state personal income tax dedicated to education and five years later, he was clear about not ruling out legislative study of an income tax as members explored tax options.

Cruz may have been wrong in the debate when he said Sadler used to routinely introduce himself as the guy for an income tax. 
However, Sadler’s rejoinder -- that he never supported an income tax -- isn’t supported by his legislative record or his past comments. This ""never"" claim isn’t just incorrect. It’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/oct/05/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-he-never-supported-state-personal/

Are Portland's use of force standards stricter than the federal standard?
","
The Portland City Council's decision to fight the mandated rehiring of Portland police officer Ron Frashour -- the man responsible for the 2010 fatal shooting of Aaron Campbell -- has again stoked public discussion about use of force.

Central to the Frashour case is the question of whether the officer used the proper level of force in his interactions with Campbell two years ago. Frashour was initially fired after shooting an unarmed Campbell in the back, though a Multnomah County grand jury had found no criminal wrongdoing. The case then went to an arbitrator who heard  training officers testify that Frashour acted as trained.

The city is fighting that determination and the controversy over the policy and Frashour’s actions has stayed hot.

In a small Twitter dust up, one user (@nextchampjr) asked Mayor Sam Adams if he thought the federal standard for use of force, which the arbiter found Frashour met, ought to be reworked. The mayor replied that, in fact, ""Portland has higher standards than feds on allowed police use of force.""

We wondered whether that was accurate.

Before we get to our analysis, we note that we’re staying out of the debate over how Frashour was trained, and how well. We are only examining the policy.

First, we needed to establish the generally accepted federal standard. Such a standard exists,  but not in quite the way you might expect. There’s no series of agreed-upon federal guidelines that lay out exactly what sort of force can be used in a specific instance. Instead there’s a legal term called the Graham Standard or the Objective Reasonableness Standard.

Back in 1989, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Graham v. Connor that any questions regarding the use of force should be held to the Fourth Amendment rules of ""reasonableness."" Essentially, this means that any use of force should be such that it would be deemed necessary by ""a reasonable officer.""

""When we say reasonable, it's an objective standard,"" explains Tung Yin, a criminal law professor at Lewis and Clark. ""You judge it from the perspective of the reasonable officer on the scene.""

This caused some controversy at the time the case was decided because whether you perceive force as reasonable in the heat of the moment -- which is the standard -- is often different than how you perceive it after the fact, Yin said.

So, how is Portland’s policy different? Caryn Brooks, the mayor's spokeswoman, pointed us to Portland Police Policy 1010.20. According to that policy, adopted by former Police Chief Rosie Sizer, officers should use ""only the force reasonably necessary under the totality of circumstances to perform their duties and resolve confrontations effectively and safely.""

That piece just gets the bureau in line with the legal standards. But the policy also adds these two pieces of direction:

1) ""It is the policy of the Bureau to accomplish its mission as effectively as possible with as little reliance on force as practical.""

2) ""The Bureau expects members to develop and display, over the course of their practice of law enforcement, the skills and abilities that allow them to regularly resolve confrontations without resorting to the higher levels of allowable force.""

Yin described this text as more ""aspirational text, rather than any sort of legal requirement"" but said he felt the mayor’s characterization was accurate.

We agree with Yin. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2012/oct/05/sam-adams/are-portlands-use-force-standards-stricter-federal/

Obama says Romney would spend $2 trillion that the military hasn't asked for
","
Republican nominee Mitt Romney has said he plans to increase defense spending by about $2 trillion over the next 10 years if he’s elected president. In the final debate of the campaign, moderator Bob Scheiffer asked Romney, ""Where are you going to get the money?""

Romney said he would take it from other parts of the budget -- by abolishing Obamacare and by changing Medicaid to a block grant and turning it over to the states.

President Barack Obama said Romney’s plan for more defense spending is a bad idea, because it isn’t necessary. Romney ""wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for,"" Obama said.

In this fact-check, we examine the claim that Romney is promoting something the top brass don’t want.

Romney has outlined out his national security policy on his website. There, he warned that restoring the military ""will not be a cost-free process,"" and said he will ""begin by reversing Obama-era defense cuts ... with the goal of setting core defense spending — meaning funds devoted to the fundamental military components of personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement, and research and development — at a floor of 4 percent of GDP.""

 What’s 4 percent worth?

The Pentagon’s budget is expected to run in the range of 3.2 to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year. According to the Center for a New American Security, a group with ties to both Republican and Democratic administrations, even a gradual ramp up to 4 percent would increase defense spending by $2.1 trillion over the next ten years, as reported by CNN.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group focused on deficit reduction, uses that number too, as do other budget think tanks. Romney seems to accept it, so as far as the $2 trillion figure goes, it seems reasonably accurate.

In the past, when asked about increasing defense spending in tough economic times, the Romney campaign has emphasized that the 4-percent goal will take some time to achieve.

While the campaign website describes the goal as ""a floor"", campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul called it ""a target"" in an email to a Boston Globe reporter. The first priority, Saul wrote, is to reverse ""Obama-era defense cuts.""

In the same article, one Romney adviser, Mackenzie Eaglen with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, ""That’s not a hard number and anybody would be crazy to suggest it is. It would have to be a very slow ramp-up and they would be hard-pressed to even achieve a 4 percent base budget by the end of the first term.’’

This suggests there is some flexibility on Romney’s part, although the candidate himself has not expressed that.

 What the Pentagon is asking for

In the debate, Romney said, ""Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. We're now at under 285.""

In fact, the 313-ship plan reflects a 2005 strategic review. In April, the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, presented a new program that sets a goal of 300 ships. Mabus’s remarks came at a moment when Romney had been vocal in his opposition to the new approach.

""A lot of this criticism is based on either incomplete and/or inaccurate or outdated information, or a failure to see beyond the short term or a willingness to protect the status quo in spite of the changing world and in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary,"" he said.

The president’s budget calls for $487 billion in defense savings between now and 2021. His defense secretary, Leon Panetta, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, have both spoken up for the plan, as have the heads of all five branches of the military.

""We are developing today the Joint Force the nation will need in 2020,"" Dempsey told the Senate budget committee. ""We will be a military that is able to do more than one thing at a time—to win any conflict, anywhere.""

Panetta acknowledged that the budget comes with risks but he said the department’s plan was based on looking first at the threats the nation might face.

""The department would need to make a strategic shift regardless of the nation's fiscal situation.,"" Panetta told the budget committee. ""We are at that point in history. That's the reality of the world we live in.""

Administration critics say the reality was just the reverse. A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation said, ""the administration set a goal of slashing the defense budget, and then crafted a strategy justifying such draconian cuts.""

The president is the commander-in-chief. Panetta works for Obama and the military answers to him. To the analysts at the Heritage Foundation, the chain of command says it all. But in the past, when military commanders have disagreed with presidents, they have found ways to get their complaints to the public.

This is not to say that all commanders are pleased with the trade-offs they face. But Nora Bensahel, deputy director of studies at the Center for New American Security, said she believes the president put a great deal of time into discussions with the military, and by and large, the commanders support the plan.

""It’s hard to see daylight between the military and the White House on this,"" Bensahel said.

Broadly speaking, it is always possible that the service chiefs would disagree over funding of individual programs but that is within the overall budget limits.

 Our ruling

The president said Romney planned to increase defense spending by $2 trillion and that was money the military hadn’t asked for.

Military leaders have testified in support of the president’s spending plan, and we found no evidence of disagreement behind the scenes.

Budget backed by Democrat Tammy Baldwin spent trillions more than Obama, Republican Tommy Thompson says
","
In their race for a U.S. Senate seat, Democrat Tammy Baldwin and Republican Tommy Thompson depict each other as out of touch with the typical Wisconsin voter.

The Madison congresswoman brands Thompson as a wealthy insider who is ""not for you anymore."" And the former governor labels Baldwin an extreme liberal.

Thompson continued his line of attack on WISN-AM in Milwaukee on Sept. 27, 2012, hours before his first debate with Baldwin. He told conservative talk show host Jay Weber that Baldwin’s ""philosophy is to spend as much money as possible and forget about the consequences of the next generation, the consequences of the declining dollar, the consequences of our debt load.""

""In fact she is so liberal -- I don’t know if people out there really know this -- she joined the Progressive Caucus, which introduced a budget that spent trillions -- not billions, trillions -- more money than the Obama budget.""  

In the same vein, Thompson during the debate called Baldwin the House’s ""number one spender"" and alluded to her support of ""increased spending"" with the Progressive Caucus budget.

Let’s see if Thompson’s right about the trillions.

The caucus

The Congressional Progressive Caucus, according to its website, consists of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, and 75 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. Baldwin is a vice-chair of the group.

The caucus gained attention when U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., claimed in April 2012 that its members were members of the Communist Party. That rated a Pants on Fire from PolitiFact Florida, which confirmed through the Communist Party USA that no members of Congress are members of its party.

The fiscal 2012 budget proposed by the Progressive Caucus was what Thompson was referring to when he made his trillions more comment about Baldwin, Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe told us.

That plan, unveiled in April 2011, was offered as an alternative to budgets proposed by President Barack Obama and by House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee.

Baldwin did vote for the caucus budget, which was introduced as an amendment to Ryan’s budget. The amendment failed in the House, 347-77.

Budget comparisons

The Progressive Caucus budget would have spent $44.5 trillion from 2012 to 2021, according to an analysis done for the caucus by the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute.

To see how that compared with Obama’s plan over 10 years, we contacted experts from two nonpartisan think tanks: Taxpayers for Common Sense, a government spending watchdog; and the Concord Coalition, which seeks balanced federal budgets.

They agreed that Obama’s fiscal 2012 spending plan called for $46 trillion in spending.

That’s $1.5 trillion more than the Progressive Caucus Budget.

So, Thompson was wrong when he said the Baldwin-backed caucus would spend ""trillions more"" than Obama’s budget.

Thompson has said, in prepared statements before and after his radio interview, that the Progressive Caucus budget would have raised trillions more in taxes than Obama’s budget. And our experts agreed the caucus budget would have collected $42 trillion in taxes over 10 years, some $5 trillion more than Obama’s.

But that wasn’t Thompson’s claim on the radio.

What’s more, raising taxes doesn’t automatically mean a corresponding increase in spending. Indeed, The Economist magazine, among others, pointed out the Progressive Caucus budget would have reduced federal deficits more than both the Obama and Ryan budgets -- primarily because of its higher taxes and cuts in defense spending.

Our rating

Thompson claimed Baldwin supported the Progressive Caucus budget, which he said spent ""trillions more"" than a budget from Obama.

Baldwin did back the proposal, which would have raised taxes by trillions more than the president. But the caucus plan would have actually spent less money than the Obama plan.

U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez says Paul Ryan’s budget would transform Medicare into a voucher system
","
U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez yesterday attacked a Medicare reform proposal from Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan by claiming it would turn the health care program into a voucher system.

The Democratic senator made that criticism during a debate last night against his Republican challenger Joe Kyrillos, a state senator representing Monmouth County.

""But listen what I don’t want to do is what my opponent says, he basically embraces the Ryan budget. But what does the Ryan budget do?"" Menendez said. ""It ends Medicare as we know (it), makes it a voucher, privatizes Social Security, dramatically cuts assistance to education in our country.""

For this fact-check, we’re focusing on Menendez’s claim that the Ryan budget would turn Medicare into a ""voucher.""

We issued a Mostly True ruling on a similar claim in September from state Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula, and PolitiFact National issued the same ruling on a related statement by President Barack Obama in August.

Just as in those two cases, Menendez’s claim is mostly accurate.

Ryan has proposed providing ""premium support"" payments to future Medicare beneficiaries to purchase health insurance. There are some distinctions between the two terms, but the word ""voucher"" generally describes this approach.

The plan would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries and individuals who become eligible before 2023. Those individuals could remain in the current Medicare program.

But starting in 2023, newly eligible beneficiaries would receive a premium support payment to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The payments would either pay for or offset the cost of health care premiums.

The latest version of Ryan’s plan was approved in March by the GOP-controlled House as part of a budget resolution, but it was later rejected by the Democrat-led Senate.

It’s true that Ryan’s most recent plan more closely reflects a pure premium support, but substantively, it’s somewhere between the two approaches. As our PolitiFact colleagues noted, there are distinctions between the two terms, dealing with the type of inflation adjustment used and the degree of marketplace regulation imposed.

Our ruling

In a debate Thursday against Kyrillos, Menendez claimed Ryan’s budget would turn Medicare into a ""voucher.""

It’s accurate that Ryan’s plan, starting in 2023, would provide premium support payments for new beneficiaries to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The term ""voucher"" generally describes this approach.

While Ohio is up 123,000 jobs since 2011, auto jobs are down, John Kasich says
","
Ohio's economic condition is improving. That's good news for Gov. John Kasich, but it comes with an asterisk.

An improving economy is also considered good news for President Barack Obama. Kasich, a Republican, backs challenger Mitt Romney. 
The point came up, as it has before, during a recent Fox News interview.

""The Democrats are saying one of the big factors helping the president is the auto bailout, particularly in the northern part of the state,"" host Paul Gigot said, wondering if Kasich's boosting of jobs was helping Obama's campaign.

Kasich, as he has before, downplayed the role of the auto recovery.

""We're up 123,000 jobs over the last year and three-quarters,"" he said. ""We're actually, according to the Bureau of Labor statistics, down 500 jobs, auto jobs in Ohio.""

A loss of jobs? PolitiFact Ohio was interested.

We looked at figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, and we asked Kasich's office for his sourcing.

First, we noted that Kasich, in talking about ""the last year and three-quarters,"" was referring to the period from January 2011, when he took office, until August 2012, the last month for which figures were available.

BLS figures for Ohio show that total nonfarm employment went in that period from 5,064,600 to 5,187,600 -- an increase of 123,000 jobs, as Kasich stated.

In talking about auto jobs in that period, Kasich's staff said he was referring to jobs in the BLS categories of motor vehicle manufacturing and motor vehicle parts manufacturing.

The first category saw an increase of 700 jobs from January 2011 to August 2012, from 19,200 to 19,900.

In the second and larger category, employment went from 56,000 to 54,800, a loss of 1,200 jobs.
That's a net decrease of 500 jobs.

So Kasich’s numbers are correct. But additional information is needed to clarify his claim.

The timeframe Kasich used is an issue in itself, as we have noted before. In talking about Ohio jobs, the governor only used figures that covered his time in office, starting in January 2011. But the first federal aid to the automakers was made in 2008 while Republican President George W. Bush was still in office. It continued in early 2009 under Obama.

The auto industry hit bottom in June 2009, when vehicle manufacturing jobs in Ohio dropped to 14,200, down from 23,800 jobs one year earlier. By the time Kasich took office, after the auto bailouts, that number had increased by 5,000 jobs. That isn't reflected in the governor's tally.

Parts manufacturing, down 1,200 jobs since Kasich took office, is up 3,900 jobs from the trough of June 2009.

It is also worth noting that the figures the governor cited reflect only direct jobs in the auto industry. Some industry analysts, such as the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, also look at two other categories of employment in the industry -- intermediate and spin-off -- in considering the impact auto manufacturing has on the economy. Under that gauge, job growth in other businesses that have a connection to the auto industry also would be considered.

On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information rates Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/oct/05/john-kasich/while-ohio-123000-jobs-2011-auto-jobs-are-down-joh/

Joe Kyrillos says United States has highest corporate tax rate in the world
","
Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos said increased revenues are needed to deal with the national debt, but the path to that goal isn’t paved with tax hikes.

Rather, Kyrillos said, he wants to lower taxes to stimulate growth.

""Well, we're going to have to raise revenue and I want to do it through growth. I want to lower tax rates. I want to make sure that America doesn't have the highest corporate tax rate in the world, which is what we have now, and lower the rates for everybody,"" Kyrillos said during a debate tonight with his Democratic rival, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, that aired on NJTV.

Are corporations in the United States subject to the highest tax rate in the world?

The statutory rate for businesses is the highest among industrialized nations. But for the rate businesses actually pay -- what’s called the effective tax rate -- the United States ranks among the highest, but not at the very top, according to studies.

We checked a nearly identical claim that Kyrillos made during an Aug. 20 interview on WOR-AM. Then he said, ""we've got the highest corporate tax rate in the world."" We rated that statement Mostly True.

At that time, a spokeswoman for Kyrillos cited the nation’s top statutory corporate tax rate of 39.2 percent. That rate is a combination of federal, state and local tax rates before any tax breaks are factored in.

Japan used to have a higher statutory rate than the United States. But in April, Japan reduced its rate and the U.S. took first place among industrialized nations, according to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group.

So on that point, Kyrillos is right.

Since businesses receive a number of tax breaks, the effective tax rate for corporations in the U.S. isn’t the world’s highest, but it’s still up there.

More than a dozen of the most recent studies on effective corporate tax rates across the world found businesses in the U.S. paid an effective rate between 23 percent and 34.9 percent, according to a September 2011 report from the Tax Foundation.

The effective rate varied between the studies the Tax Foundation looked at because of different methodologies.

In those studies, the U.S. never ranked first in the world. But in 10 of the studies, the nation’s effective corporate tax rate ranked among the top five highest.

It’s worth noting that an analysis by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice along with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, found that 30 Fortune 500 companies, including General Electric, didn’t pay any federal corporate income taxes over the 2008-2010 period.

As for what is the better measure -- statutory rates or effective rates -- we found mixed views.

Scott Hodge, the president of the Tax Foundation, told PolitiFact New Jersey in August that because statutory rates are fixed they make for better comparisons, whereas effective rates are unpredictable and vary across different industries.

But Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said ""effective tax rates provide the best measure of comparison for overall tax burdens.""

Then Aparna Mathur, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said in an e-mail that ""both are equally valid measures of looking at the burden of the corporate income tax.""

Our ruling

Kyrillos repeated a claim he made before that the United States has the ""highest corporate tax rate in the world.""

That’s true for the nation’s statutory corporate tax rate among industrialized nations. When Japan lowered its statutory rate, the United States moved into first place.

Even when accounting for various tax breaks, the effective rate is still among the highest.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate this statement Mostly True.

Barack Obama says 'Donald Trump is a small business' in debate
","
Donald Trump is a tycoon who owns luxury high-rises, builds fancy golf courses and stars in a reality TV show.  Is it also possible that The Donald is actually a small businessman? President Barack Obama says that's how Mitt Romney would treat him.

During the first presidential debate in Denver, Obama attacked Mitt Romney over what constitutes a small business.

""Now, Gov. Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth,"" Obama said. ""So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue … the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.""

Obama continued, ""We do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Now, under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Gov. Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they’re the job creators. They’d be burdened. But under Gov. Romney’s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. And I know Donald Trump doesn’t like to think of himself as small anything, but that’s how you define small businesses if you’re getting business income.""

The Obama campaign has often tried to remind voters of Romney's relationship with Trump, who has been the most prominent person to question where Obama was born. In TV ads, the Obama campaign has frequently shown a photo of Romney in front of a Trump jet. But was Obama correct when he said that ""under Gov. Romney's definition ... Donald Trump is a small business""?

To explore what it means to be a ""small business,"" we'll first discuss whether Trump's companies meet the definition set by the Small Business Administration. Then we'll examine whether Trump would be eligible for a small business tax cut under Romney’s plan.

Does Trump qualify as a small businessman?

The definition of ""small business"" is more complicated than you might think. The most common rule of thumb is 500 employees -- a threshold used ""for research purposes"" by the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, an independent advocate for small business within the federal agency.

But for loans and other programs, the SBA uses a more complicated standard. The company has to be independently owned and operated and ""not dominant in its field."" Depending on the industry, the threshold can be either an average number of employees for the past 12 months or a three-year average of revenues.

For instance, a manufacturing firm could be considered ""small"" if it has anywhere from 500 to 1500 employees, depending on the type of product manufactured. Service providers would qualify as small if their annual receipts are lower than $2.5 million to $21.5 million, again depending on the particular service being provided. For retailing, the annual receipts threshold ranges from $5 million to $21 million.

So how do Trump’s companies measure up? The Trump Organization didn’t return our queries, but we were able to find a few data points on employment at Trump’s companies. The Trump Organization, the developer’s flagship company, had 22,450 employees in 2007. Several other resort and casino holdings have thousands of employees each, though it’s unclear whether there is overlap among all of these entities. And while there have been disputes over the years about just how much money Trump brings in, it's likely he would exceed any SBA revenue standard.

Now, it's possible that some Trump businesses could still qualify as small by the SBA's definition. According to news reports, Trump has some holdings that are much smaller than 500 employees and have relatively modest revenues. In a story about a tax cut proposal from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., the Huffington Post wrote that Cantor’s cut could benefit ""Donald Trump's Trump Tower Sales & Leasing, which has 20 employees and annual sales of about $960,000."" CNN reported that ""Trump also runs a number of other companies that employ fewer than 500"" people.

According to the SBA, however, a small business affiliated with a large business would not be eligible for an SBA-backed loan.

Comparing the Obama and Romney tax plans for small businesses

However, even if Trump managed to meet the technical definition of a small business, it’s not accurate to say that Romney’s tax proposal would treat him as a small business.

This highlights a fundamental difference in the candidates’ approaches to tax policy.

Obama has targeted small businesses by offering at least 16 tax cuts based on a company’s size, frequently limiting the taxes to companies much smaller than the SBA's 500-employee standard. Romney, by contrast, has sought to help small businesses through lower marginal tax rates for individuals. Romney calls lower rates ""incentives for job-creating businesses."" 
It's true that conservatives often contend that tax hikes on high earners would hurt small businesses -- not a surprising strategy, since ""entrepreneurs"" are a more sympathetic group to most people than ""the rich."" The Obama campaign backs up the president's Trump claim by arguing that hedge fund partners can count as small businesspeople, and that high-powered tax planning can structure very large enterprises in such a way that they’re considered small businesses. We've concluded in a previous fact check that the connection between high earners and small businesses is exaggerated.

Still, Obama’s attack during the debate was a bit of a red herring. He implies that a ""definition"" in Romney's plan would give unique treatment to Trump -- or any ""small business"" -- when the plan simply reduces rates on all individuals, regardless of whether they own a small business.

Other Republicans have advocated targeted small-business tax cuts -- such as the proposal earlier this year by Cantor that ""every small business that employs fewer than 500 people"" would get a 20 percent tax cut -- but Romney’s main tax proposal is to make a ""permanent, across-the-board 20 percent cut in marginal rates."" If Romney harbors any plans for targeted tax cuts for small businesses, he hasn’t revealed them.

Why does this matter? Because if Trump ends up getting a cut from Romney, it would be because he’s a taxpayer, not because Romney ""defines"" him as a small businessman.

Our ruling

Obama said that ""under Gov. Romney's definition ... Donald Trump is a small business."" But any tax cuts Trump would get from Romney would have nothing to do with whether he’s a small business or not.

Obama said health premiums in the last two years went up slower than any time in the past five decades
","
Mitt Romney likes to say that if he’s elected, he will repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law ""on day one."" During the Oct. 3, 2012, presidential debate, he predicted what would happen if he isn’t elected: The Affordable Care Act would take full effect in 2014 and ""health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.""

That prompted the following response from Obama:

""The fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we're already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate.""

For this fact-check, we’re focusing on Obama’s claim that, ""over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years."" We’ll also examine whether Obama was correct to suggest this slowing in premium growth is connected to reforms in his health care law.

Health care spending -- not premiums -- grew slower than at any time in 50 years

Obama’s statement about historically low growth is rooted in a real study. Economists from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published a report in January 2012 that said health care spending grew less in 2009 and 2010 than any time in 51 years. Preliminary estimates for 2011 show the same trend.

But Obama got himself into trouble by saying ""premiums"" instead of ""total health care spending."" It’s not his first time, either. We dealt with this linguistic confusion before when we evaluated Obama’s pledge to reduce health care premiums for the typical family by $2,500 -- a Promise Broken on the Obameter. Using Project Vote Smart, a database of public statements by politicians, we found evidence of Obama using the two terms interchangeably, which is a mistake.

Premiums, what people pay to buy health insurance coverage, are only one part of health care spending. Total health care spending includes out-of-pocket costs such as copays, coinsurance and deductibles; depending on the insurance plan, some medical services and physicians aren’t covered at all.

It’s worth noting that evidence exists to back up the part of Obama’s claim about premiums. A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group, found slowing growth in the cost of premiums.

Dr. Drew Altman, president and CEO of Kaiser, called annual growth in premiums -- along with total health care spending and per capita spending -- ""strikingly low."" The Kaiser survey, however, goes back 14 years, not 50.

Credit the recession, not Obamacare

We also wondered: Are premiums and total health spending growing at slower rates because of Obama’s health care law?  

Obama characterized the slowing growth of premiums as ""progress"" and mentioned rebates -- a piece of the Affordable Care Act -- in the same breath.

We asked for an assessment from Dr. Bradley Herring, a health economist who teaches a course on the history of U.S. health reform at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health.

""I don’t think it’s fair for one to attribute that slowed growth in healthcare spending to the ACA,"" Herring said. ""Most health economists attribute much of the slowdown (in) the growth in healthcare spending to the recession.""

Even the government study Obama used to make his claim gives credit to the economic downturn --  not the new health care law. It says the recession between 2007 and 2009 had a delayed effect on health care spending. When the economy goes south, high unemployment, losses in private health insurance coverage, drops in household income and companies’ reluctance to hire new employees result in less health care spending, according to the report.

The study noted that much of the Affordable Care Act isn’t in place yet, so its effect on recent health care spending has been minimal. For instance, the report estimated the law’s net impact on 2010 spending to be less than 1 percentage point.

""Most of the 2010 provisions, other than a few specific provisions affecting Medicare payments, had a negligible impact on total spending or shifted the distribution of spending without affecting the overall rate of growth,"" the report said.

Our ruling

Obama said health care premiums have gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years and suggested it was because of the Affordable Care Act.

He mistakenly referred to premiums, not all health care spending for 50 years. The historical data for premiums is generally consistent with his claim, but they only go back 14 years. He also vastly exaggerated the impact of his health care law on the costs. Experts say that's due to the recession, not the law.

Obama said Romney's plan could cost future retirees $6,000
","
Viewers of the first presidential debate got a heavy dose of Mediscare politics.

Mitt Romney attacked President Barack Obama for""cutting $716 billion from the program,"" which mostly covers seniors’ health care expenses. Obama attacked Romney for supporting a ""voucher""-like model to reform Medicare.

At one point, Obama stared straight into the camera and told certain viewers to listen up.

""If you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this, this will affect you,"" he said during the Oct. 3, 2012, debate at the University of Denver. ""The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman (Paul) Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.

""The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.""

Obama and other Democrats, including Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, have invoked premium hikes somewhere in the neighborhood of $6,000 before. We’ve quibbled with it because the figure is rooted in a study of an outdated Medicare plan by Ryan, the House budget chairman from Wisconsin.

Ryan released his initial Medicare plan in early 2011, and Democrats have attacked it as harmful to seniors ever since. Under this first version of the plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. Critics said those who fell under the new rules would face an increasingly large gap between what the government paid for their benefits and what their health care services cost.

This plan passed the GOP-led House but died in the Senate. Ryan has offered updated versions of the plan, the most recent being part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. It still offers seniors a defined amount toward private insurance rather than paying providers directly.

But there are two big differences between the new plan and the earliest one: The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice of using their payment to buy private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The amount of their payment would be set by the price of the second-cheapest plan. Romney indicated in an August interview that he supports Ryan’s most recent plan.

The Democrats have cited as evidence for their claims of the Romney-Ryan plan’s increased out-of-pocket costs a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. This 2011 report relied on analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that found the difference of out-of-pocket office costs between the Ryan plan ($12,500, in 2022) and traditional Medicare ($6,150) to be $6,350.

The problem with Obama using this estimate is simple: The CBO analysis was of the original Ryan plan, not the more recent one that Romney supports. Ryan has not yet asked for a more thorough analysis of his latest proposal.

Ryan’s current plan caps overall growth in Medicare spending, but it’s also a little more generous in how fast it allows subsidies to grow as health care costs increase. Ryan also made a number of other technical changes to address concerns that the credits wouldn’t keep up if medical costs kept going up and up. As we said earlier, the amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange.

The Obama campaign pointed us to an Oct. 2, 2012, memo from David Cutler, a Harvard economist who advised Obama’s 2008 campaign. Cutler’s memo summarizes an August 2012 analysis he co-authored for the liberal Center for American Progress regarding Romney-Ryan’s new Medicare plan.

""Overall, these results confirm the view that even under the revised voucher proposal, the
additional cost to enroll in Medicare for the vast bulk of people will be $6,000 annually or more,"" Cutler’s memo states.

Still, absent details from the Ryan camp and an updated CBO analysis, it’s not clear what would happen over time if the new, market-based payments grew faster than the Ryan plan’s cap on Medicare spending. Would savings still come from beneficiaries? Or providers? Or somewhere else? Competing claims about its financial impact on seniors remain speculative.

Obama is repeating a number about an old Republican plan because there isn’t an updated analysis of the new plan, which contains significant differences. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-said-romneys-plan-could-cost-future-retirees/

Romney says Obama promised to cut deficit in half
","
At the first presidential debate, Mitt Romney said President Barack Obama had broken an important promise.

""You've been president four years,"" Romney said at the Oct. 3, 2012, debate in Denver. ""You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. …""

He added, ""I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half. And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn't get the job done.""

We’ve heard the claim before that Obama promised to cut the deficit in half. Let’s review our findings.

Remarks from 2009

Obama indeed made the pledge on Feb. 23, 2009, following a ""Fiscal Responsibility Summit"" one month after his inauguration.

His words: ""Today I am pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office. Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.""

He said then that the nation’s $1.3 trillion deficit was the largest in the nation’s history. That figure was mostly unchanged through fiscal year 2011.
   
In 2012? It’s expected to be $1.1 trillion, according to the nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office in an August 2012 report.
   
The estimate marks the fourth year in a row with a deficit of more than $1 trillion, the CBO noted, although the projection is down slightly from the $1.2 trillion deficit that CBO projected in March.

""This year’s deficit will be three-quarters as large as the deficit in 2009 when measured relative to the size of the economy,"" the report noted.

So the deficit is shrinking, but it’s nowhere near half the level from 2009.

PolitiFact Florida previously asked the Obama campaign about the pledge. The campaign pointed us to Obama’s response when asked about it by an Atlanta TV station in February 2012.

""Well, we're not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized,"" he said. ""Everybody who is out there back in 2009, if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost, how bad the economy had contracted when I took office, everybody underestimated it. …""

Our ruling

Romney reminded Obama during the debate, ""you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half.""

The statement is accurate. Obama made the pledge shortly after taking office in 2009. Today, the deficit is smaller, but it’s not half the size it was. We rate Romney’s statement True.",/factchecks/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-promised-cut-deficit-half/

If she's right, Bill's a criminal
","During a campaign stop at a supermarket in Des Moines, Iowa, Hillary Clinton was asked by a shopper to autograph a dollar bill. She refused.
 
""I can't sign money. That's illegal,"" Clinton said, according to a CBS News video of the exchange. ""I'm so sorry.""
 
The shopper then showed reporters the dollar, which had apparently been autographed by Clinton's husband. ""Well,"" the shopper said, ""Bill signed it.""
 
So let's explore whether Sen. Clinton is correct, which would implicate her husband in a federal crime.
 
In fact, the Treasury Department says ""defacement of currency"" is against the law. The law specifies that ""whoever mutilates, cuts, disfigures, perforates, unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, Federal Reserve Bank, or Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such item(s) unfit to be reissued, shall be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.""
 
But if Bill is busted for violating Title 18, Section 333, then the feds will also have to prosecute some other prominent law-breakers, including treasury secretaries who have routinely autographed dollar bills, which are printed with their signatures.
 
Like so many laws, this one becomes a matter of interpretation. In this case, it's a question of whether an autograph is a deliberate attempt to deface a bill so it can't be used again.
 
The Treasury Department doesn't think so and says autographing dollar bills is permitted.
 
A department fact sheet says, ""Throughout the years, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer of the United States have autographed currency notes bearing their signatures at the request of private citizens. This practice is not considered as defacement since the autographs are generally provided to persons as keepsakes as opposed to circulating currency.""
 
Claudia Dickens, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, said it only becomes a violation when it is mutilated so much that it is"" unacceptable to a merchant or vending machine. That's defacing.""
 
She said autographing ""is certainly not something that the Department of Treasury encourages, but it's not disallowed.""

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Mitt Romney']","
Their shifts were less stark
","Under attack from Alan Keyes during a GOP debate on Dec. 12, 2007, Mitt Romney said he's not the only politician to have changed his position on abortion.
 
He cites three prominent Republican figures to make his case, but their shifts are far less stark than his. Let's take them one at a time.
 
We examined Romney's abortion record

here.

After supporting abortion rights early in his political career, he changed his mind after meeting a stem-cell researcher in 2004.
 
As governor of California in 1967, Ronald Reagan signed into law a bill legalizing ""therapeutic"" abortions, defined as those approved by medical staff where there is substantial risk to the physical and mental health of the woman, or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.
 
Biographer Lou Cannon, in his 2001 book

Ronald Reagan: The Presidential Portfolio,

writes that it was a difficult decision.
 
""Reagan did not know what to do,"" Cannon writes. ""His staff was divided (also largely on religious lines), and he was lobbied heavily from both sides. … After several days of indecision, Reagan reluctantly signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act. After he recognized its consequences, he became an opponent of abortions, except to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest.""
 
Thirteen years later, Reagan ran for president under a platform that included strong opposition to abortion.
 
Now, the case of Henry Hyde: In the early 1970s, in the Illinois legislature, he initially was receptive to a colleague's request that he co-sponsor a bill relaxing the state's ban on abortion. But after he read up on the issue, he declined.
 
""I had never really thought about abortion, so I read the bill and read a book:

The Vanishing Right to Live

, by Charlie Rice. I became convinced that abortion was an evil,"" Hyde says in a 2006

National Review

article, ""Hyde in Winter,"" by John J. Miller.
 
Hyde did not support the bill, rather he helped defeat it. As he went on to Congress, he became a strong abortion opponent, winning passage in 1976 of what became known as the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of federal funds for abortion.
 
George H.W. Bush's position on abortion was an issue as Reagan considered him as a running mate in 1980.
 
""While he personally opposes abortion, he is against passing a constitutional amendment to make it illegal,"" a

Newsweek

article said of Bush that year.
 
Reagan, running on a strict antiabortion platform, needed a vice presidential candidate who was right there with him. Richard Allen, Reagan's foreign policy adviser at the time and later national security adviser, writes about the angst in the Reagan camp in an article for the

New York Times

.
 
"" 'There's Bush,' I suggested, half expecting him to close off the discussion. Instead he paused and then said, 'I can't take him; that ""voodoo economic policy"" charge and his stand on abortion are wrong.' ""
 
Allen goes on to say that Bush was approached by Reagan himself about whether he could pledge to support the platform. That was the beginning of Bush's unwavering antiabortion support.
 
Planned Parenthood says Bush ""turned his back on reproductive health care to be Reagan's running mate,"" while the National Right-to-Life Committee endorsed him for president in 1988.
 
So, where does that leave us? Reagan had an abortion-rights moment early in his career. Hyde briefly considered backing the abortion-rights bill of a colleague. Bush at one time opposed outlawing abortion.
 
Still, it's difficult to compare records on this issue because of the way the political landscape and dialogue has changed over the years.
 
None of the three politicians Romney cites made so clear a change as he did, but he's not entirely wrong either. We rule Romney's statement Half True.

"['National', 'Education', 'Ron Paul']","
So true, he's understating it
","Fiscal conservatives have dreamed of abolishing the Department of Education since President Jimmy Carter created it in 1980. Ronald Reagan ran that year against Carter, pledging to kill it. After he failed to follow through, leading Republicans sponsored legislation to do the job in 1995, arguing that states should oversee education policy. But they couldn't persuade enough of their colleagues to go along.
 
For a budget hawk like Ron Paul, that failure is particularly galling, especially considering the GOP controlled the House from 1995 through 2006, the Senate for most of those years and the presidency starting in 2001. During that time, the Education Department has lived on — and enjoyed sizable budget increases.
 
At a debate in Iowa on Dec. 12, 2007,

Des Moines Register

editor Carolyn Washburn gave Paul an opening to raise the issue: ""What's the biggest obstacle standing in the way of improving education in the United States? And how would you address it?""
 
The ""federal government,"" Paul said, adding that — to his dismay — ""It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education. We finally get in charge and a chance to do something so we double the size of the Department of Education.""
 
In fact, Paul understates the shift. The size of the Education Department nearly quadrupled between 1994 and 2006, increasing from $27-billion to $100-billion. Even when adjusting for inflation — the 1994 budget rises to $36.8-billion when calculated in 2006 dollars — the increase is huge: nearly triple (172 percent).
 
Much of the increase came as a result of the 2001 education law known as the No Child Left Behind Act. In return for implementing a regimen of student testing and teacher accountability, states received an infusion of federal funds.
 
We should point out that federal funding contributes a small portion to education funding for grades K-12. Even under the No Child law, states and localities contribute 83 percent of K-12 education funding. The federal contribution is 8 percent; private sources provide 9 percent, according to Education Department calculations.
 
The $100-billion budget in 2006 was by far the largest ever, and something of an anomaly. It marked a substantial increase from the 2005 funding level of $71.5-billion. In 2007, the budget fell to $67.4-billion, a 75 percent increase over 1994 levels in inflation-adjusted terms — big but not quite double.
 
The bump in 2006 was the result of a massive increase in mandatory spending related to student loan processing and to a one-time infusion of $4.3-billion to cover shortfalls in funding for grants to university students. Student loans make up the bulk of the mandatory spending, meaning that federal law compels the department to cover the cost of guaranteeing and directly making loans to students no matter how the cost fluctuates due to interest rates or the number of student applications. Most other programs — including No Child Left Behind funding — are considered discretionary, meaning the amounts get decided each year.
 
But whether the spending is mandatory or discretionary, Paul, a libertarian who does not believe the federal government has a role to play in education policy, says it's better left to the states. Many of his Republican colleagues, as evidenced by the $73-billion increase in funding the Education Department enjoyed while they controlled Congress and the White House, apparently do not agree. Paul's statement, therefore, is True.

History supports McCain's stance on waterboarding
","
The morning after the CNN/YouTube debate in St. Petersburg, John McCain remained firm in his stand against the use of an interrogation technique called ""waterboarding."" He cited solid history to buttress his position.
 
""I forgot to mention last night that following World War II war crime trials were convened. The Japanese were tried and convicted and hung for war crimes committed against American POWs. Among those charges for which they were convicted was waterboarding,"" he told reporters at a campaign event.
 
""If the United States is in another conflict ... and we have allowed that kind of torture to be inflicted upon people we hold captive, then there is nothing to prevent that enemy from also torturing American prisoners.""
 
McCain is referencing the Tokyo Trials, officially known as the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. After World War II, an international coalition convened to prosecute Japanese soldiers charged with torture. At the top of the list of techniques was water-based interrogation, known variously then as ""water cure,"" ""water torture"" and ""waterboarding,"" according to the charging documents. It simulates drowning.
 
R. John Pritchard, a historian and lawyer who is a top scholar on the trials, said the Japanese felt the ends justified the means. ""The rapid and effective collection of intelligence then, as now, was seen as vital to a successful struggle, and in addition, those who were engaged in torture often felt that whatever pain and anguish was suffered by the victims of torture was nothing less than the just deserts of the victims or people close to them,"" he said.
 
In a recent journal essay, Judge Evan Wallach, a member of the U.S. Court of International Trade and an adjunct professor in the law of war, writes that the testimony from American soldiers about this form of torture was gruesome and convincing. A number of the Japanese soldiers convicted by American judges were hanged, while others received lengthy prison sentences or time in labor camps.
 
We find McCain's retelling of history to be accurate, so we give him a True.

Ad misleading about Iran hostage crisis
","Rudy Giuliani invokes his tough-on-terrorism image with a television advertisement about the Iran hostage crisis. He gets most of the facts correct but his insinuation that President Reagan deserves all the credit for the hostages' release is wrong.
 
Here is the transcript of his 30-second commercial, spoken as grainy black and white photos of hostages appear on the screen:
 
""I remember back to the 1970s and the early 1980s. Iranian mullahs took American hostages and they held the American hostages for 444 days. And they released the American hostages in one hour, and that should tell us a lot about these Islamic terrorists that we're facing.
 
""The one hour in which they released them was the one hour in which Ronald Reagan was taking the Oath of Office as President of the United States. The best way you deal with dictators, the best way you deal with tyrants and terrorists, you stand up to them. You don't back down. I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approve this message.""
 
The script is technically accurate. On Nov. 4, 1979, militant Iranian students — not mullahs, as Giuliani says — took control of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 hostages. Of those, 52 remained in captivity for 444 days.
 
The terms of their release is the Algiers Accord, an agreement negotiated by Jimmy Carter's administration on Jan. 19, 1981, according to State Department documents. The following day at 12:23 p.m. EST, less than one hour after Carter relinquished the presidency to Ronald Reagan, the hostages were let go.
 
But just because it happened on Reagan's watch, doesn't mean he deserves credit, said Warren Christopher, Carter's deputy Secretary of State and lead negotiator for the United States.
 
""It happened that they did not hit Algiers until (Reagan) was in office about a half-hour,"" Christopher said. ""But all the negotiations took place before the inauguration.""
 
Temple University professor David Farber and journalist Mark Bowden both wrote books about the Iranian hostage situation and reach similar conclusions.
 
""The whole direction is misleading,"" Farber said. ""Reagan had made no claims he would do something specifically different. There was no cause-and-effect relationship.""
 
""(Giuliani) is reporting one of the standard glib historical assessments of the hostage crisis,"" Bowden said. ""The idea that Reagan had any affect on their release is laughable.""
 
Bowden said waiting until Carter left office had more to do with the Iranian leaders dislike of Carter ""than a fear of Reagan,"" he added.
 
While Giuliani is technically correct that the hostages were released after 444 days in the first hour Reagan took office, Reagan wasn't responsible. So Giuliani's message doesn't match the facts. We rule this statement Barely True.

Hunter perpetuates common myth
","Appearing on Fox News in October, Duncan Hunter proclaimed his support for allowing a religious slant on the flag-folding ceremony at U.S. military funerals. To defend his position, Hunter tapped a reliable and potent source to justify weaving church and state: George Washington.
 
""This is supposedly done under the separation of church and state, but you can't separate a veteran from his flag,"" Hunter told interviewer Bill Hemmer. ""And, you know, our first president and our first commander in chief prayed every day. He had a field manual of prayers.""
 
Whether Hunter knew it or not, Washington wasn't the most religious founding father. And the story of his personal prayer book was debunked in the early 20th century.
 
His remarks actually tap into a debate among scholars about the extent of Washington's religious convictions. Many argue he was more a deist than a Christian.
 
""It's a tricky area that keeps coming up again and again,"" said Phil Chase, a senior editor at the Papers of George Washington Project at the University of Virginia. ""People tend to attribute their own views to someone in the past. ... It happens a lot with Washington.""
 
Evangelical minister Tim LaHaye, author of the

Left Behind

series, is the latest. In his book about the founding father's faith, LaHaye wrote that the fact that Washington ""was a devout believer in Jesus Christ and had accepted Him as His Lord and Saviour is easily demonstrated by a reading of his personal prayer book, written in his own handwriting.""
 
Except that's not true. Washington scholar Rupert Hughes wrote in 1926 that no evidence connects Washington to this prayer book, which was found nearly a century after his death in a old trunk. Hughes consulted a penmanship expert who proved it wasn't even in Washington's handwriting.
 
""We are very confident that this prayer book is not Washington's prayer book,"" Chase said.
 
Fortunately for Hunter, it's a common myth. Otherwise, we might give him a Pants-on-Fire ruling.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Need, not wealth, prompted estate taxes

","To justify her plan to use estate tax revenues for universal retirement accounts, Hillary Clinton told a voter in New Hampshire that history was on her side.
 
""People disagree about this, but the estate tax, which came into being by Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and others, and has been part of our tax system for a very long time, is there for a real simple reason: In America, we've never liked the idea of massive inherited wealth,"" she said during a town hall forum in Derry. ""Part of the reason why America has always remained a meritocracy where you have to work for what you get ... is that we never had a class of people sitting on generation after generation after generation of huge inherited wealth.""
 
Clinton's historical account, and dig at Republicans, shows selective memory.
 
Estate taxes — a tax on the property passed forward and received at death — were first levied in 1797 under President John Adams, a Federalist.
 
In that case, the revenue went to cover the cost of raising a Navy. The two subsequent times it was enacted, in 1862 and 1898, it paid for military conflicts (first the Civil War and then the Spanish-American War), before being repealed again.
 
Clinton is correct that Republican Theodore Roosevelt advocated renewing the estate tax. On Dec. 4, 1906, he told Congress, ""The man of great wealth owes a peculiar obligation to the State, because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of government.""
 
But Roosevelt left office before it became law in 1916 — under President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, who used the tax to help pay for World War I.
 
Another Democrat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, raised rates twice, in 1934 and 1935, to help fund federal programs during the Great Depression. At that time, he said, ""The transmission from generation to generation of vast fortunes by will, inheritance, or gift is not consistent with the ideals and sentiments of the American people.""
 
Since then, the estate tax has continued to increase as have the number and size of the exemptions. Under tax cuts passed by President Bush, it is being phased out by 2010. Clinton wants to abolish the tax cuts she said only help the wealthy and use the estate tax to fund a new retirement system.
 
While her sentiment closely resembles FDR's, her statements don't represent the full history behind the tax. We rule her statement Barely True.

"['National', 'Legal Issues', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Indeed, Bush did it his way
","
""(Bush) used (signing statements) as essentially a form of veto,"" Sen. Hillary Clinton said during a Democratic debate in December 2007. ""He did it through a piece of legislation I passed, where it was pretty simple. I said: 'If you're going to have a FEMA director, it should be somebody with experience handling emergencies.'... And when George Bush signed the bill it was part of, he specifically used a signing statement to say, 'I don't have to follow that, unless I choose to.'''
 
The legislation Clinton refers to came after the federal government's lackluster response to Hurricane Katrina. Included in a 2006 spending bill for the agency, a new requirement was added that said future Federal Emergency Management Agency directors must have a ""demonstrated ability in and knowledge of emergency management"" and ""not less than five years of executive leadership.""
 
Bush had appointed Michael ""You're doing a heckuva job, Brownie"" Brown to the top FEMA job in 2003, even though he didn't have much emergency experience. Brown was removed from his position in the poorly managed aftermath of Katrina and the background requirement for future directors was added to FEMA's budget bill.
 
Essentially, Bush rejected the hiring requirements added to the bill. Choosing to forgo a veto, he interpreted the new law with a ""signing statement,"" something his administration has done to challenge more than 1,100 laws — more than all previous presidents combined. (By comparison, Bush has vetoed seven.) The administration says the statements give Bush the right to ignore parts of the bill he deems unconstitutional, usually when power of the executive branch is at issue.
 
In this Oct. 4, 2006, signing statement, Bush took exception to the minimum standards for the FEMA director because they ruled out a ""large portion of those persons best qualified by experience and knowledge to fill the office.""
 
Bush said he would ""construe (the qualifications section) in a manner consistent with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution,"" which gives presidents wide authority to make appointments that must be approved by the Senate. It was a formal way of saying Bush believes Congress has no business trying to dictate standards for presidential appointments and that he would ignore them.
 
So, in effect, Clinton correctly characterized Bush's response to the FEMA minimum standards. He really was saying he wouldn't follow this requirement unless he chose to do so.
 
But there's a larger context to Bush's refusal.
 
The Bush administration has defended and expanded the powers of the executive branch. So it's no surprise that he doesn't want Congress meddling in his hiring decisions.
 
Historically, aside from the occasional scandal (see Teapot Dome, Watergate, Lewinsky), nothing pits the legislative branch against the executive branch more than a president's hiring and firing of personnel.
 
In 1868, when President Andrew Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, an angry U.S. Congress impeached him. In 1989, Bush's father got acquainted with this tension when he tried to appoint Sen. John Tower as defense secretary. The confirmation hearings got so ugly, reports of Tower's heavy drinking were made public and the Senate ultimately rejected him.
 
In 1993, Bill Clinton encountered troubles of his own, especially when he tried appointing an attorney general. Janet Reno was his third choice after Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood withdrew during a bruising confirmation process.
 
So it's through this presidential powers prism that the Bush administration resisted the limit on hiring FEMA's chief.
 
""The president has the authority to choose which of his subordinate officers he'll rely on,"" White House spokesman Tony Fratto told the

Washington Post

last year. ""The president has the authority to determine what the relationship is between them.""
 
We're not going to try resolving the constitutional dispute that's raised here. Bush may very well be right. But just because he is, doesn't mean Clinton isn't. Her statement about how Bush viewed the background requirements for a FEMA director is True.

A trillion is too much
","
A trillion dollars? Really? That's a lot of money — $1,000,000,000,000, to be exact.
 
Obama is accurately quoting that number from a report issued by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. The report states, ""If we were able to reduce obesity to 1980s levels, Medicare would save $1-trillion."" It attributes the number to the Centers for Disease Control and the Commonwealth Fund.
 
At issue is the increased prevalence of obesity. The percent of the U.S. population considered to be obese has roughly doubled since the 1980s. Researchers have documented that these people need more health care due to complications from obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancers and other illnesses. Researchers have also developed models to calculate costs for obesity-related health care.
 
We agree that obesity drives up health costs, but getting to $1-trillion just doesn't add up, according to our estimates. (Factcheck.org, a political fact-checking Web site at the University of Pennsylvania, found the same thing; check out their analysis

here

. ) The Centers for Disease Control cites a study on health spending due to obesity and overweight that shows numbers significantly less than $1-trillion.
 
We tracked down one of the authors of the study the CDC cited: Eric Finkelstein, a health economist with the research group RTI International who has studied the issue extensively and written several papers on the topic. Finkelstein said obesity accounts for excess health spending of about $90-billion a year. About half of that — about $45-billion — is billed to Medicare and Medicaid together.
 
Medicare's share of obesity spending therefore is between $20-billion and $25-billion. If obesity rates rolled back to 1980s levels, Medicare spending would be about half that, or about $12-billion a year.
 
Now we get to the slipperiness of Obama's quote. He says if obesity rates rolled back, Medicare would save $1-trillion. But he doesn't give a time frame, and neither does the report he's quoting from. Maybe he meant it would have saved $1-trillion since the 1980s.
 
But that doesn't make sense either. At the rate of $12-billion of savings per year, it would take more than 80 years to reach $1-trillion. Let's say our estimate is too conservative and it's $20-billion per year. It would still take 50 years to reach $1-trillion in savings. Inflation might get you there a bit faster, but not by that much. The number $1-trillion is just so big that increments of $10-billion won't get you there very quickly.
 
""I think it's a stretch,"" Finkelstein said.
 
We think so, too, and rate Obama's obesity claim False.

The ugly truths
","As she makes her case for the White House, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., promises voters that she'll do more to help the middle and working classes. Key to that pitch is the notion that things aren't going so well now.
 
""Productivity has risen 18 percent among American workers over the past six years, yet wages have stayed flat, and family incomes have fallen by nearly $1,000,"" she told a crowd in New York City on Dec. 5, 2007. ""There are 5-million more people in poverty here in our country than there were in 2000.""
 
The macroeconomic forces of a rapidly changing global economy are causing more trouble for many working people than the Bush administration, despite what Clinton and other Democratic candidates suggest.
 
U.S. Census Data from 1995 to 2005 show that those wages are down or stagnant for workers who have the least education, while earnings have increased for those with college degrees.
 
Increased competition from cheap foreign labor is squeezing U.S. factory workers and costing jobs, while wages have not kept pace with rising energy and health care prices, several studies say, including the 2006 State of Working America by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan advocate for the poor.
 
Productivity indeed is up about 18 percent since 2000, but income is down, and nearly 5-million more people are living in poverty than at the height of the last business cycle in 2000, government statistics show.
 
""All of that paints more of a picture about what individual households are seeing and reacting to,"" said Aviva Aron-Dine, a policy analyst for the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, a nonpartisan advocacy group for the poor.

Can't blame Bush
","In her speeches about the economy, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., often makes the point that the gap between rich and poor has grown during Bush's presidency.
 
""Thanks to President Bush's policies, the poor and middle classes are suffering economically, while the rich are prospering,"" Clinton said during a Nov. 19, 2007 speech in Knoxville, Iowa. ""The income gap is now higher than at any time since the Great Depression.""
 
In 2005, ""the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans held 22 percent of America's income. That's an astonishing figure, and it is the highest level of income inequality since the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929,"" she said.
 
Clinton's figures are essentially right. She gets them from an analysis of U.S. tax returns published in the

Quarterly Journal of Economics

in 2005 and updated this year, which found that the top 1 percent of earners, those making more than $350,500 per year, earned 21.3 percent of the nation's total income in 2005.
 
The U.S. Census Bureau shows a similar disparity, with the top 5 percent of Americans earning 22.3 percent of the income in 2006. Those in the top 20 percent earned about half of the nation's income, while the bottom 20 percent earned just 3.4 percent of the income.
 
However, while some of Bush's policies have favored the rich, economists say it is not fair to link the president to the rising income gap itself. This is a longtime trend that began to soar in the 1980s and has persisted throughout several presidencies. In fact, the income gap also reached new highs and grew more quickly during the administration of Bill Clinton, a Democrat and the husband of Sen. Clinton, than it has under President Bush.
 
Economists point to several reasons for the growth in disparity between the very rich and the rest of us, including the decline of labor unions, the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs to cheap labor overseas, rising executive pay, and the relative drop of the minimum wage from 1981 to 2007. While goods and services became more expensive, the minimum wage stayed the same.
 
Bush has, however, exacerbated the after-tax income inequality with tax cuts that disproportionately help the rich, economists said. He also has resisted congressional attempts to cut costs for the working poor, such as by opposing an expansion of a popular children's health insurance program that he says helps some who don't need it.
 
""(Bush) passively accepted many of the economic trends that pushed up inequality,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. ""But he is not mainly to blame for increased inequality.""
 
Clinton is correct, that the income gap is soaring. But she's wrong to lay the blame on Bush. We find her statement Half-True.

Creative math by an abortion-rights mayor
","At the

Des Moines Register

debate on Dec. 12, 2007, Rudy Giuliani acknolwedged a touchy point for his campaign: He supports abortion rights. But he emphasized that he dislikes abortion and repeated a claim he's made before, that while he was mayor of New York City, the number of abortions declined while adoptions rose.
 
""We reduced abortion. We increased adoptions by 135 percent,"" he said.
 
We've addressed his previous claims with

this ruling

and our article

""Giuliani's 'culture of life,' defined""

, but he used different wording and a different number this time, so we'll examine the new statement.
 
He's right that abortions went down. They declined 16.8 percent during Giuliani's eight-year tenure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 
However, his wording suggests he took an active, leading role in reducing abortions. That doesn't square with his record.
 
When we examined his tenure for our previous article, we spoke with key players familiar with his record, and they remembered a decidely abortion-rights mayor who went so far as to sign a proclamation for ""Roe vs. Wade Anniversary Day."" He also filled out a questionnaire for an abortion-rights group pledging his support for the cause.
 
So for him to say ""we reduced abortion"" seems like a stretch.
 
Two months ago, the Giuliani campaign maintained there was a link between the rise in adoptions and the decline in abortions. They now say he is not linking the two. But we believe many voters could be left with the impression that the two are related. And indeed, we couldn't find any research that showed an increase in adoptions led to a decrease in abortions.
 
There's no question that adoptions rose during his term. But to reach 135 percent requires some serious calculator gymnastics.
 
Two years into his first term, Giuliani created the Administration for Children's Services with a mission to improve the lives of the city's children. The agency aims to help kids in foster care, and it measures its success in large part by how many adoptions it facilitates each year. We focus on page 14 of the ACS 2003 Year End Review, which shows a bar chart of adoptions conducted through the city's child welfare system from 1989 to 2003.
 
Giuliani was mayor from Jan. 1, 1994, to Dec. 31, 2001. His new agency came on line in January 1996.
 
The chart shows a gradual increase in adoptions from 1989 through 1994, then a steeper increase through 1997 — the middle years of Giuliani's tenure. After that year, the numbers decline through 2002.
 
Giuliani has previously said the rate of adoptions went up 65 to 70 percent. His campaign calculated that number by taking adoption rates for the six years before ACS was created and comparing them to the six years after.
 
But now, Giuliani is citing a number twice as large: 135 percent. To get that number, his staff compared adoptions in all eight of his fiscal years against all eight of his predecessors'. This works out to a whopping 133 percent increase in adoptions, which Giuliani rounded up to 135.
 
That's one way to look at it. But a more traditional way, simply comparing adoption rates in the first year of his tenure and in the last year, shows the rate increased by only 17 percent, a point first made by our friends at FactCheck.org.
 
The Giuliani campaign said averaging the rates over two six-year (or now, eight-year) blocks helps smooth out peaks and valleys in individual years caused by social, economic and other forces. The first two years after ACS came on line, there was a spike in adoptions that Giuliani's campaign said was because of a backlog of foster kids waiting to connect with families.
 
It's true, the campaign aides say, the numbers go down significantly in Giuliani's final two years. But they're still higher than those of his predecessor, David Dinkins.
 
We find that's an unorthodox way of comparing the numbers and it relies on a different methodology than the abortion rate. For the abortion statistic, the Giuliani campaign looked at two points in time (the beginning and end of his tenure) and compared the two. Doing that for adoptions yields an increase of 17 percent. But here, they're trying some creative math to boost the number to 133.
 
So, we find that while he's got his numbers right on abortion rates, it's a stretch for the abortion-rights mayor to take credit. We also find he has inflated the adoption figures by getting fancy with his math. It's worth saying again that to arrive at the ""135 percent"" increase in adoption rates the Giuliani campaign had to change the way it had been calculating those rates just a few months ago. We find his overall claim Barely True.

Poverty numbers are right
","Sen. Chris Dodd must have had the U.S. Census Bureau's 2005 report in his notes, because he quotes it very precisely.
 
""In 2005, 37.0-million people were in poverty, not statistically different from 2004,"" it says.
 
""In 2005, the number in poverty remained statistically unchanged from 2004 for people under 18 and people 18 to 64 years old (12.9-million and 20.5-million, respectively),"" it goes on.
 
Dodd even says ""about 12-million or 13-million are children,"" not looking too flashy by quoting the precise number of 12.9-million.
 
The U.S. Census Bureau's 2006 report, released in August 2007, is ""not statistically different from 2005,"" although it lists the number of people living in poverty as 36.5-million and the number of children living in poverty as 12.8-million.
 
Either way, we rule Dodd's statement True.

Thompson's tax numbers add up
","Fred Thompson, in arguing that the tax cuts of the Bush administration should be renewed, said that 5 percent of Americans pay over half the income taxes in this country, and that 40 percent of Americans pay no income taxes at all.
 
Both figures are true.
 
The top 5 percent of all payers do pay more than half the income tax. They pay about 59.2 percent of all individual income tax, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan institute run jointly by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.
 
Thompson also said that 40 percent of Americans pay no income tax. This claim is supported by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group that promotes transparency in the tax code and economic growth.
 
There's a small caveat to the 40 percent number — it includes nonfilers, typically taxpayers who don't have to file returns because their incomes are too low. It's logical to assume that most nonfilers don't pay income taxes, but it's possible that some did if they had income taxes withheld by an employer. This is probably a very small number, because people with low incomes have an economic incentive to file a return and get a refund.
 
The U.S. income tax system is progressive, which means that rates increase as income increases. Given that structure, it makes sense that people with higher incomes pay more taxes, and people with low incomes might pay no tax at all. Thompson's numbers are on the money, and we rate them True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Chain email']","
Hillary's no red menace
","An anonymous chain e-mail maligns Hillary Clinton in the form of a ""gotcha""-style quiz. The quiz lists six quotations, then asks which famous communist said it. Choices include Karl Marx, Josef Stalin, Mao Tse-tung and other Nazis, fascists and dictators. (We'll leave aside as a minor quibble the fact that communism and Nazism are completely different political philosophies.)
 
Every quotation includes a ""none of the above option."" At the end of quiz, the punch line is that

all

the answers are ""none of the above"" — Hillary Clinton said those things! Get it?
 
The problem with the quiz is that every statement is either taken out of context or edited to look worse than it is. In none of the circumstances was Clinton advocating communist-style government for the United States or socialistic economic policies. In some instances she was criticizing out-of-control government spending or the excesses of Big Business; at other times she was saying that complicated issues will require political consensus. Let's look at the quiz items one by one.
 
• From the chain e-mail: ""We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.""
 
This is from 2004 remarks that Clinton made to a roomful of Democratic donors, some of whom paid $10,000 to attend the function, according to the Associated Press. She was discussing the need to end the Bush tax cuts in order to balance the budget. Her full quote was, ""We're not coming to you, many of whom are well enough off that actually the tax cuts may have helped you, and say 'We're going to give you more.' We're saying, 'You know what, for America to get back on track and be fiscally responsible, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good. ' ""
 
• From the chain e-mail: ""It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few, and for the few. ... And to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity.""
 
In this one, Clinton was giving a speech in May 2007 attacking the economic policies of the Bush administration. She slammed subsidies for oil and gas companies, tax incentives for companies that move jobs overseas, and excessive CEO pay, according to a report in the

Concord (N.H.) Monitor

. Notice the italicized phrases that were left out of the chain e-mail quote: ""It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few and for the few.

Time to reject the idea of an on-your-own society

and replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity.

I prefer a we're-all-in-it-together society.

""
 
• From the chain e-mail: ""(We) ... can't just let business as usual go on, and that means something has to be taken away from some people.""
 
Clinton was speaking at a forum on religion and public life hosted by CNN in June 2007. This quote was in reply to a question from a Catholic priest, who asked, ""In an age in which there is, oftentimes, narrow and excessive individualism, how will you speak to our country about the need for sacrifice, restraint, when it comes to the critical issues of taxes, gun control, health care, and energy consumption?"" Here's Clinton's more complete response about energy: ""You know, we can't keep talking about our dependence on foreign oil and the need to deal with global warming and the challenge that it poses to our climate and to God's creation and just let business as usual go on. And that means something has to be taken away from some people.""
 
• From the chain e-mail: ""We have to build a political consensus and that requires people to give up a little bit of their own ... in order to create this common ground.""
 
This quote is from the same CNN forum and question mentioned above, but on the health care issue. Clinton's full quote is a little more verbose and concerns the uninsured: ""I think we could reach that agreement, and then we would have to start doing the hard work of deciding what we were going to do to make sure that they were not uninsured, because an uninsured person who goes to the hospital is more likely to die than an insured person. I mean, that is a fact. So what do we do? We have to build a political consensus, and that requires people giving up a little bit of their own turf in order to create this common ground.""
 
• From the chain e-mail: ""I certainly think the free market has failed.""
 
This might be the most egregious of the quiz quotes, because it's taken from a long list of institutions that Clinton says have failed to help kids make good decisions. Clinton was responding to a question, again at the CNN forum, about how antiabortion and proabortion forces can work together to reduce abortions. Clinton said it was important for everyone to help teens make better decisions: ""We have so many young people who are tremendously influenced by the media culture and by the celebrity culture, and who have a very difficult time trying to sort out the right decisions to make. And I personally believe that the adult society has failed those people. I mean, I think that we have failed them in our churches, our schools, our government. And I certainly think the, you know, free market has failed. We have all failed.""
 
• From the chain e-mail: ""I think it's time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in (the) entire economy that they are being watched.""
 
Clinton's target here was oil companies. She alleged that they were gouging consumers by raising prices after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, according to a 2005

Washington Post

story. ""I think it's time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in our entire economy that they're being watched,"" she said in explaining her call for an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission. ""I think human nature left to itself is going to push the limit as far as possible, and that's what you need a government regulatory system for: to keep an eye on people to make the rules of the game fair, to make a level playing field and not give anybody some kind of undue advantage.""
 
So is Hillary Clinton advocating communism? Hardly. The masked e-mailer hopes you might think so after reading a political tyrants' Hall of Fame list alongside truncated quotes about taking things away and the collective good.
 
We give the mock quiz a failing grade, with extra points deducted for unabashed fearmongering. Its argument that Clinton advocates Marxism is not just False, it's Pants-on-Fire wrong.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Joe Biden']","
Yes, Biden spoke first
","A new TV ad from Joe Biden returns to the core theme of his campaign, that the Delaware senator has lots of experience with foreign policy.
 
The no-frills ad features Biden in front of a dark curtain, talking into the camera.
 
""Being president is not the same thing as running for president,"" he says. ""When this campaign is over, political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing. The next president has to act. The Biden plan to end the war in Iraq has already won bipartisan support. When Pakistan erupted in crisis, I spoke to Musharraf before Bush did. You don't have to guess what I'll do as president. Just look at what I've done.""
 
We have previously explored

Biden's claims about his Iraq plan,

so here we will focus on his statement that when Pakistan erupted, he spoke with President Pervez Musharraf before Bush did.
 
Indeed, Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke with Musharraf on Nov. 6, according to a statement from his office that day and wide news coverage of contacts with Musharraf.
 
In the statement, Biden described it as ""a very frank and detailed discussion. I told President Musharraf how critical it is for relations between our two countries that elections go forward as planned in January, that he follow through on his commitment to take off his uniform and that he restore the rule of law to Pakistan.""
 
President Bush spoke with Musharraf on Nov. 7, one day after Biden did. At a press availability that day at Mount Vernon, Bush's remarks were very similar to Biden's the day before. ""My message was that we believe strongly in elections, and that you ought to have elections soon, and you need to take off your uniform,"" Bush said. ""You can't be the president and the head of the military at the same time. So I had a very frank discussion with him.""
 
It's not clear why Bush didn't speak with Musharraf until after Biden, but the records indicate that Biden's claim is True.

One cost of illegal immigration -- accuracy
","
During an Oct. 9, 2007, debate, Tom Tancredo pressed to change immigration policy by making a dollars and cents argument. Tancredo said an average household with an undocumented worker costs the country more than it pays in taxes.
 
PolitiFact found nothing to disprove Tancredo's statistics, but no one who could verify them — including his campaign.
 
Asked where the statistics originated, Tancredo spokesman Alan Moore referred to the Center for Immigration Studies. Bryan Griffith, a center spokesman, said officials there know of no CIS report with those numbers.
 
However, Griffith pointed to a 2004 report that showed families with undocumented immigrants contributed $4,200 on average to the federal government, but cost Uncle Sam $6,950.
 
That's a long way from the $20,000 in costs and $10,000 in taxes line that Tancredo used. Pressed for more specifics, Tancredo's campaign at first asked for details on the very study it was citing. Weeks later, spokesman Moore pointed to another report.
 
In a 2007 study, Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, found that families with low-skilled immigrants cost taxpayers about $30,130 in 2004. Those households paid about $10,573 in taxes for 2004.
 
But that study includes all low-skilled, immigrant households in America, representing 15.9-million people. About 60 percent were entirely legal households, and 40 percent had undocumented workers. Tancredo's statement is about undocumented workers only, so this study is off point.
 
We found no other recent studies on the overall costs and benefits linked to families of undocumented workers. Moreover, critics point to flaws in the studies showing larger costs than contributions by undocumented workers.
 
Tim Vettel of the American Immigration Law Foundation said he was uncertain where Tancredo's statistics originated but lumped them with other reports that the foundation, which promotes immigration, has criticized.
 
Focusing more broadly on all immigration, the American Immigration Law Foundation said in November 2007 that most studies rely on one-year ""snapshots"" of the immigrant population without taking into account rising income and future tax contributions. The foundation also said the studies fail to count economic contributions such as consumer purchasing power.
 
The Congressional Research Service reached the same conclusion after reviewing studies in 2005.
 
Its report said information that typically is the basis for cost estimates is not collected, producing estimates based on assumptions and disagreement about accuracy. In the case of illegal immigration, analysts tend to disagree on how many government benefits undocumented workers actually use.
 
""It is very difficult to enumerate a population which is trying to avoid detection by the government,"" analyst Alison Siskin wrote.
 
Given the lack of information, and dispute over reports we did find, we rule Tancredo's statement Barely True.
