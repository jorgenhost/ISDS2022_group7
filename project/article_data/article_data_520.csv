Deal says more high-paying jobs have come to Georgia
","
Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal has spent much of his first term promoting Georgia as the premier state to start a business or to expand.

In his speech, the governor claimed his efforts are working.

""Since I stood before you last year at this address, we have announced more than 10,000 jobs, and many of these are on the high end of the employment scale,"" Deal said. ""More and more businesses are deciding to make Georgia their home.""

A Deal spokesman did not respond to a request for specifics to back up this claim. We began our research by reading each news release on Deal’s website since his 2012 State of the State address. More than two dozen of the releases include announcements of new jobs that would be created in Georgia. By our count, the total was slightly more than 9,000. The releases do not say whether all the positions are full-time jobs.

We interpreted Deal’s comments that many of the jobs were ""on the high end of the employment scale"" to mean that they will command high salaries.

There is some support for the governor’s claim on that point: 

The governor’s numbers were slightly off on the number of jobs, from what we found. It seems reasonable to believe that many of these positions will be on the high end of the employment scale. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EADF5A00>],/factchecks/2013/jan/29/nathan-deal/deal-says-more-high-paying-jobs-have-come-georgia/

Has Deal been frugal with state budget?
","
Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal made a claim on his Twitter page that initially had us stumped. 
""Spending of government money is 17 percent less than it was a decade ago,"" the message said as Deal delivered his State of the State address. 
Isn’t the state budget larger than it was a decade ago?

In fiscal year 2003, which began July 1, 2002, and ended June 30, 2003, then-Gov. Sonny Perdue and the Legislature approved a $16.2 billion general fund spending plan. In the proposed fiscal year 2014 budget, Deal wants to spend about $17.4 billion for the state’s general fund. The entire proposed state budget would be about $19.8 billion.

Deal explained the decrease in his speech.

""Using 2012 dollars, our per capita spending of government money is 17 percent less that it was a decade ago,"" the governor said.

Adjusted for inflation, the fiscal year 2003 budget would now be $20.15 billion. The difference between that budget and Deal’s proposed budget is about $3 billion, a 17 percent decrease.

Deal: Rainy Day fund is blossoming
","
The state of Georgia, as does most governments, keeps a reserve or ""rainy day fund"" in case it needs extra money. 
During his State of the State address, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal's Twitter page offered some specifics. 
""The 'rainy day' fund has increased by 226 percent"" since he took office, Deal's staff tweeted. 
Amid budget cuts and a sluggish economy, we wanted to know if the governor and his staff were correct.

Georgia had to borrow from its revenue shortfall reserve fund in 2009, after the Great Recession began. Georgia’s fund went from nearly $1.5 billion in 2007 to about $104 million two years later, according to state budget records. Most states also had significant declines in their reserves, according to the Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

During the 12-month fiscal year when Deal took office, Georgia’s reserve fund was $116,021,961. During fiscal year 2012, which ended June 30, 2012, the reserve fund was $377,971,440, records show. The increase, as the governor said, was approximately 226 percent.

Carolyn Bourdeaux, the former director of the Georgia Senate Budget and Evaluation Office, reviewed the numbers against the most recent annual state audit report and saw an even higher figure for the reserve, which was about $520 million. The current state budget is about $19.3 billion.

Bourdeaux, who teaches in the public management and policy department at Georgia State University, noted that Deal has made cuts in various areas and the state has seen modest economic growth in the past two years. Deal asked most state agencies last year to cut their budgets by at least 3 percent due to concerns about the economy. The governor said he wants to find $553 million in reductions through June 2014.

Some budget experts, such as the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute’s executive director, Alan Essig, say the budget cuts and midyear revenue adjustments have helped Deal increase the rainy day fund. Essig, though, believes the rainy day fund is still ""dangerously low"" and that the state needs to raise taxes. He believes the fund should be near 10 percent of the state budget, which would be close to $2 billion.

Most states currently have about 2 percent of their entire budget set aside for a rainy day fund, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Georgia has about 2 percent of its budget set aside in reserves.

We found nothing that contradicts the governor’s claim. Our rating: True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA28A40>],/factchecks/2013/jan/29/nathan-deal/deal-rainy-day-fund-blossoming/

Commenters say Ryan-Walker ticket would be unconstitutional because both live in Wisconsin
","
When two high-profile Wisconsin pols -- 2012 vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan and Gov. Scott Walker -- made a highly precocious Politico.com list of possible 2016 Republican presidential candidates, some Internet commenters cheered. Others jeered.

One political junkie’s Dream Ticket, it seems, is another’s Nightmare Express.

But as the online reaction unfolded, we noticed another spin on things as commenters speculated on the two longtime friends being on the same ticket. It’s a legal impossibility, some argued.

When Walker was to appear Jan. 21, 2013 on Greta Van Susteren’s ""On the Record"" show on FOX News, the commenter ""4knit"" called for a Ryan-Walker ticket when posting a comment on an item promoting that night’s appearance.

A follow up post by ""righteousva"" dismissed the thought: ""They couldn't carry Wisconsin for Romney in 2012; also not constitutional.""

Curious about the constitutional question, we surfed around a bit more … and found comments from late November 2012 speculating about an all-Florida ticket of former Gov. Jeb Bush and current U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio.

""Can’t happen unless one of them moves, ""karenhasfreedom"" wrote on HotAir.com. ""I remember back in 2000, Cheney had to move to WY to qualify as the VP because of some obscure thing that the entire ticket can’t come from the same state.""

Very interesting.

At this point, we paused -- ever so briefly -- to consider an admonition directed at the Journal Sentinel when Walker and Ryan surfaced on Politico’s watch list.

""Hey JS … Can we give it a rest for a little while and enjoy the holidays,"" wrote ""shadow1757"" ""No need to stoke the flames of political differences around the dinner table. Can we at least wait until inauguration day has passed to start speculation on the next POTUS race?"" 
Well, inauguration day has passed. 
And, while we typically check statements by politicians, parties and pundits, we have also looked at claims from chain emails, Facebook posts and bloggers, even a billboard. So, why not take on a claim being circulated by a bunch of Internet commenters? 
So, on to 2016 and this question: Would a same-state ticket run afoul of the Constitution?

We consulted several constitutional scholars, political scientists and experts on the Electoral College process and found there is a serious issue here that was a fascinating footnote in the razor-thin, controversial 2000 presidential race.

And it could come into play again … in theory.

In 2000, of course, with a boost from the U.S. Supreme Court decision ending the Florida recount, Republican George W. Bush topped Democrat Al Gore by five electoral votes even though he trailed in the popular vote.

Just weeks before the Electoral College met, lawyers for three Texas voters challenged the Texas delegation’s right to cast its 32 electoral votes for Bush, the Texas governor, and his running mate, Dick Cheney.

The lawsuit, which was dismissed in Texas courts before the electoral vote, claimed the U.S. Constitution’s 12th Amendment prohibited electors from voting for president and vice presidential candidates who live in the same state.

Cheney had lived and worked in Texas, but an appeals court ruled his residence was Wyoming, where he had switched his voter registration and drivers license just before becoming Bush’s running mate, according to media accounts from the time.

""Cheney tried to avoid the 12th Amendment issue by moving his voter registration and driver license from Texas to Wyoming in July, just before Bush announced him as his running mate,"" Cox News Service reported in January 2001.

Here’s what’s behind the issue.

Article Two of the U.S. Constitution says of the role of electors: ""The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves.""

The 12th Amendment, approved in 1804, slightly altered the language (italics added): ""The Electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.""

That means electors from Wisconsin, for example, could not vote for both Ryan and Walker on a national ticket. That was the assessment of Judith Best of State University of New York-Cortland, Jack Rakove of Stanford University and Miriam Vincent of the Office of the Federal Register, which administers procedural aspects of Electoral College process.

Electors cast separate votes for the two offices.

The original rationale, Rakove explained, was that there would be a lot of ""favorite son"" voting among the electors, so that by requiring electors to cast one vote for someone who was not a resident of their own state, they would be forced to cast one vote on non-parochial (though not necessarily non-regional) grounds.

However, that’s different than being prohibited from running on the same ticket. None of our experts said a same-state ticket would somehow be blocked from running, or that would be unconstitutional.

To be sure, there could be negative consequences for such a ticket … at least on paper.

""In the current case you imagine, only Wisconsin electors would be affected,"" Rakove wrote to us. ""Presumably they would cast their votes for president for the Wis. candidate, and throw away their votes for vice president (I would bet for another Republican, rather than a Democrat).""

Rakove said in the event that an electoral decision comes down to a handful of votes (like in 2000), the loss of the Wisconsin electors for the vice presidential candidate could prevent that candidate from getting a majority of electoral votes. In that event, the U.S. Senate chooses the veep.

""It is still hard for me to imagine why senators from the other party would insist on voting for a v.p. from a different party than the president-elect,"" Rakove said in the email.

We lured Vincent and Best deeper into our web of hypotheticals, asking if Wisconsin electors under such a scenario could split their allegiances.

Yes, they said. For example, half could decide to support Walker for president and half could cast their presidential ballot for a non-Wisconsin resident.

Under that scenario, the half that shunned Walker would be free to vote for Ryan for vice president.

Of course, electors presumably would do this only if Walker had enough cushion in the electoral voting to win the presidency even without the full slate of votes from Wisconsin.

The bottom line: A same-state ticket would pay a penalty in the presidential tally, the VP tally, or both.

Which is why, among many other obvious strategic calculations, that same-state tickets are so unlikely to develop.

Our rating

Commenters on a hypothetical Ryan-Walker or Walker-Ryan ticket in 2016 claimed that such arrangements are unconstitutional.

The constitution does exact a price for such arrangements, as electoral voters could only cast a ballot for one or the other candidate. But the claim that such tickets would be outlawed or blocked from running is off the mark.

With a gentle nod to the commenters who probably never dreamed their musings would be fact-checked, we rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA4C0C0>],/factchecks/2013/jan/28/internet-commenters/commenters-say-ryan-walker-ticket-would-be-unconst/

Marco Rubio says after D.C. passed gun laws, 'violence skyrocketed'
","
Do gun laws work?

As lawmakers consider President Barack Obama's call to take action against gun violence after mass shootings in Connecticut, Colorado, Wisconsin and Arizona, some argue new rules won’t help.

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told Fox News that Obama’s plan — which proposes steps such as closing background check loopholes and banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — is ""not going to solve the problem.""

""Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country,"" Rubio told host Brian Kilmeade on Jan. 17, 2013. ""And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed.""

We wanted to know: Did violence leap after the nation’s capital cracked down on guns?

 Unprotected citizens

In 1976, the District of Columbia required all guns to be registered, banned new handguns and required guns at home to be stored unloaded and disassembled or locked up.

The law’s handgun ban was invalidated by federal courts in 2007, a decision reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 2008. But for three decades, the nation’s capital had some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country.

We’ll note that the president isn’t proposing D.C.’s gun laws — indeed, the Supreme Court took that off the table — so it’s a comparison of questionable value. But we were curious whether Rubio was correct to say that Washington’s handgun ban was followed by violence.

Why would violence climb after such a ban? Rubio’s office declined to explain, but a Jan. 15, 2013, opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal by journalist and attorney Jeffrey Scott Shapiro makes a similar argument: 
Shapiro’s homicide numbers match the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics. But when we looked at related data, it was quickly apparent he chose statistics that told a simple story — pass ban, violent crime soars — that was in reality much more complicated.

We reached out to Shapiro to ask for research to support his conclusion, but didn’t hear back.

Violent crime rates in the District of Columbia from 1976 look like a rockin’ roller coaster, dipping slightly after the ban’s passage, climbing steadily until the early ‘80s, diving again through the late ‘80s, then climbing a steep mountain until the early ‘90s.

Then violent crime, as in the rest of the country, fell steeply, settling into a slower cruise downward since the start of the new century.

(It’s still much more violent in the District than the rest of the nation, with 1,330 violent crimes per 100,000 people compared with 363 per 100,000 for the entire country in 2010.)

But Shapiro cited the annual homicide number for 1993 — the height of violent crime in the four decades we’re examining — then later says: 
He fails to mention that drop started in 1994.

 Weapon-choice theory

But back to Rubio. In his Fox News interview, he didn’t claim the gun ban caused the crime rate to rise. But he does say that the gun laws are ""not going to solve the problem,"" citing D.C.’s experience as an example.

We know that violent crime didn’t simply ""skyrocket"" in the District after the handgun ban passed in 1976. It took a rocky path with peaks in 1981 and 1993, and has generally fallen since then.

A similar trend echoed across the United States. That suggests a wide range of factors at work, not merely D.C.’s gun laws.

Some experts who study violence, such as Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University, say the early ‘80s peak and fall can largely be attributed to the baby boomer generation entering their teens and 20s and then growing up. (People tend to be more law abiding as they age.) The later U.S. peak, Blumstein said, came with crack cocaine and President Ronald Reagan’s war on drugs.

And the fall in violent crime since then? Theories include the passage of Roe vs. Wade and a reduction in environmental lead. Blumstein argues an important part of the explanation was the decline in the demand for crack as people saw its effects in older friends and relatives, ""and aggressive actions by police in taking the guns off the street.""

Ah, so, back to gun laws. What, if any, role did they play in violent crime in the District of Columbia?

There’s not a lot of fresh research on the subject, since Congress put a chill on government-funded firearms research starting in the late ‘90s. (Something that the president’s recent executive actions seek to reverse.)

But Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine, pointed us to a 1991 study in the New England Journal of Medicine.

""Sen. Rubio couldn't be more wrong,"" he told PolitiFact.

The study, conducted by a research group at the University of Maryland and University at Albany, examined suicides and homicides in the District of Columbia compared with nearby cities from 1968 to 1987. They found that the adoption of the gun-licensing law ""coincided with an abrupt decline"" in gun-related deaths not found just across the border. Nor were there increases in homicides or suicides that didn’t use guns.

""Our data suggest that restrictions on access to guns in the District of Columbia prevented an average of 47 deaths each year after the law was implemented,"" the authors concluded.

Despite widely circulated Internet criticism to the contrary, researchers did consider the effects of population changes, including age and population size. They got similar results.

How did the laws help? The researchers argued the data supported something called the weapon-choice theory. When people don’t have easy access to guns, some will use a less deadly form of force. So even if the number of assaults and suicide attempts stays the same, with fewer guns, deaths drop.

The researchers argued their results showed it was reasonable to assume that even with violent crime rising, restrictions on gun access had ""a preventive effect.""

In other words, even if ""violence skyrocketed,"" as Rubio said, that’s not direct evidence that D.C.’s gun laws failed to help. Of course, they also didn’t fully ""solve the problem.""

Our ruling

Rubio, expressing his disappointment in Obama’s recent actions to prevent gun violence, argued they wouldn’t solve the problem. ""Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country,"" he said. ""And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed.""

Crime statistics don’t support Rubio’s simple story. Rather than skyrocket, violent crime rose and fell, rose and fell. Other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws. And one peer-reviewed study about gun laws’ role in violent crime through 1987 showed they reduced homicides and suicides.

Rubio’s statement is partially accurate — in some years, violent crime in the District of Columbia did rise even with a handgun ban in place — but leaves out important details and context. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE133C0>],/factchecks/2013/jan/28/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-after-dc-passed-gun-laws-viol/

Talking gun control and Sandy Hook, Gov. Scott Walker says person was killed near a school with bow and arrow
","
Questions about gun control were on the mind of reporters when Gov. Scott Walker held a news conference in Madison on Jan. 10, 2013.

Reporters, including one from the Wall Street Journal, asked the first-term governor about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were killed in December 2012 by a man with a semi-automatic weapon.

Did the carnage affect Walker’s stance on gun control?

The governor responded that a variety of factors, including the mental health of the perpetrator, need to be considered to prevent future tragic events such as Sandy Hook and the August 2012 shooting at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek.

Walker said too much attention is paid to the weapon in such shootings and cited a recent case as an example: ""We just had someone last week in Neenah near a school kill someone with a bow and arrow.""

He added that if gun control efforts are  ""just focused on the weapon, that gets away from the question of who are the people committing these heinous acts and what is it that’s happening that we’re not able to prevent them from doing that.""

Walker has enjoyed considerable support from the National Rifle Association, and the group has given him an A-plus rating. His response to the gun control question was in line with groups fighting restrictions on guns: Don’t blame the weapons.

There was only one problem with Walker’s statement about the bow and arrow murder.

 It never happened.

We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie to explain the governor’s comment the day after he spoke. He responded three days later with this emailed statement:

""The Governor misspoke when he said someone was killed. I believe he was referring the recent standoff that involved a bow and arrow.""

Winnebago County Sheriff’s Department Capt. David Mack provided the details, starting with the most important one: ""No one got killed. I know because I was there.""

In fact there were no serious injuries in the Jan. 3, 2013, domestic dispute in the Town of Clayton, located just west of Neenah.

According to Mack:

Authorities were called at 9:16 a.m. to a home after receiving reports of a disturbance between Shawn Coenen, 21, and his father.

During the dispute outside the house, ""the son shot an arrow at the father, but the arrow did not strike the father,"" Mack said. Instead, it hit a vehicle.

Coenen was inside the house when authorities arrived. Initially, police weren’t certain that he was inside, so, as a precaution, they sent several officers to Clayton Elementary School, which is 2.5 miles away.

""The school was in session, and they were advised about the situation and placed in lockdown,"" Mack said.

Authorities determined that Coenen was in the house and were told by family members that there were a dozen firearms inside, but that the guns were locked in a gun cabinet. The SWAT team and crisis negotiators were called, and Coenen was arrested without incident at 1:22 p.m., Mack said.

Coenen faces three felony charges -- second degree reckless endangerment, failure to comply with an officer, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.

Our rating

Reporters asked Walker about his views of gun control in the wake Sandy Hook school shooting. Walker responded by discussing a homicide involving a bow and arrow near a Neenah school.

Trouble was, there wasn’t such a homicide. What’s more, while the incident was near a school (2.5 miles away) it didn’t have anything to do with the school. And the SWAT team was called because the suspect was holed up inside the house -- with potential access to guns.

Finally, Walker’s staff allowed his statement to go uncorrected for four days and only admitted that it was incorrect after being asked about it by PolitiFact.

Claim about federal land holdings holds up
","
While the national attention at the end of 2012 focused on the various tax twists and turns of the fiscal cliff, the local conversation included its own tax talk.

During a tea party meeting in Marietta last month, Georgia Tea Party Chairman J. D. Van Brink spent part of his speech denouncing property taxes. Most local governments have long depended on this type of tax to fund their budgets, provide services to residents and stock reserves. But Van Brink, like many other political leaders and conservative commentators, says property taxes are subjective and discriminatory against property owners.

He went on to discuss what he called other government infringements on private property rights, including eminent domain.

""Who owns your land if government can control what you can and cannot do on your land? And who owns your land if it can be taxed away from you? Who would want to buy your land once the government has decreed that it cannot be used for commercial purposes?"" Van Brink said.

He also said the federal government owns 30 percent of the land in the 50 states, or about 650 million acres.

The property tax/property infringement debate is intriguing, but what raised our Truth-O-Meter’s antennae was Van Brink’s comments about federally owned land. Does the government really own this much of the country’s land? If so, where, and what is it used for?

The federal government has owned land throughout the country’s history. From the Louisiana Purchase to the wide-open areas of the West, the government has held the title.

Van Brink said his information on the federally owned acres comes directly from the government, specifically the Department of the Interior.

Numbers used to describe anything dealing with the federal government are sometimes incorrect and difficult to track. But, taking slight rounding into account, an overview of federal land ownership by the Congressional Research Service published in February 2012 supports Van Brink’s statement. The CRS is a an agency within the Library of Congress whose staff of lawyers, scientists and researchers provides nonpartisan research to Congress.

The CRS overview states that the federal government owns and manages roughly 635 million to 640 million acres of land, which is the latest data available. The majority of this land (about 609 million acres) is managed by four agencies: the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service. Most of the land is in the West and Alaska.

Nineteen million additional acres in military bases and training ranges are owned and managed by the Department of Defense.

The Congressional Research Service overview notes that the total amount of federal land in the country is not definitively known. The acreage estimates used in the report presume that the federal agencies have reasonably accurate data on land under their jurisdiction.

The CRS overview also includes detailed federally owned acreage information for each state. Of the country’s total land base of 2.27 billion acres, the roughly 635 million to 640 million acres is about 28 percent of the total, within the truthful range for Van Brink’s 30 percent figure.

""I was trying to solve some problems, and with the federal government owning land, it is land that could be used for productive use,"" Van Brink told us. ""The selling of that land could be used to pay down the national debt.""

Van Brink’s land-sale idea is not new. In 2011, U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, introduced a bill to begin selling federally owned land in 10 Western states, including Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Wyoming. The Disposal of Excess Federal Lands Act of 2011 would have required the secretary of the interior to direct the sale of 3.3 million acres of land, including some forested land. The bill was not enacted and died.

Georgia tea party leader J.D. Van Brink said the federal government owns 30 percent of the land in the 50 states, or about 650 million acres. Based on research from a nonpartisan congressional research think tank, Van Brink’s data is close to the published figures. The only difference is minor rounding.

Wisconsin bill to speed mine approval won't create jobs for 7 years, Sen. Chris Larson says
","Thousands of jobs are the promise of a four-mile-long iron ore mine proposed for far northern Wisconsin, which would be the first such operation in the Badger State in more than 15 years.

But how quickly would the mother lode of jobs come?

State Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, sees a lengthy wait, even if the Legislature adopts a Republican bill to speed part of the process of approving the mine.

On Jan. 15, 2013, Larson gave a Democratic response to GOP Gov. Scott Walker’s state of the state address, which also dangled the prospect of several thousand jobs connected to the mine.

""Tonight, we should be honest with the people of Wisconsin,"" Larson said. ""You just heard calls for bipartisanship from our governor. But the policies he proposed were not bipartisan. Funding an unproven, unaccountable gamble with our children’s future is not bipartisan.

""Forcing through an extreme mining bill that will take at least seven years to create jobs is not bipartisan.""

Is Larson right about how long it would take?

Digging into history

Mining in northern Wisconsin dates to 4,000 B.C., when Native Americans extracted copper along the shores of Lake Superior. By the 19th century, iron in Iron County, where part of the new mine would be located, had created prodigious prosperity. ""Hundreds of people are arriving daily from all parts of the country and millionaires are being made by the score,"" gushed an 1886 article in the Chicago Tribune.  

Over time, the industry fell off. The state’s last operating mine, which held gold and copper near Ladysmith in northwestern Wisconsin, shut down in 1997.

But talk of new boom times returned in November 2010.

That was when Gogebic Taconite said it wanted to invest $1.5 billion to develop an open-pit iron ore mine in Iron and Ashland counties, some 300 miles northwest of Milwaukee. (Gogebic refers to the iron-bearing region of northern Wisconsin and northwestern Michigan; taconite is low-grade iron ore.) The company is a subsidiary of the Cline Group, a privately owned coal-mining company headed by college dropout and Florida billionaire Christopher Cline, whose yacht is named Mine Games.

The economic impact of such an investment could be big -- once the mine is up and running.

An April 2011 study by an economic consultant hired by Gogebic Taconite estimated that once operating, the mine would create 2,834 long-term jobs, including 700 direct mining jobs -- with the direct jobs averaging nearly $83,000 per year in salary and benefits.

Two months later, we rated Mostly True a statement from Wisconsin’s largest business organization that the mine could operate for 100 years and generate billions of dollars of economic activity.

There was a big hitch, however: Gogebic Taconite said it needed new regulations to provide more certainty in seeking a state permit.

Republicans controlled the Legislature. But a GOP-sponsored bill to ease the state part of the state-federal permit process failed on a 17-16 vote in the Senate in March 2012. Gogebic said it was abandoning its plans.

On the day after the Walker and Larson speeches, Republicans introduced a new bill, similar to the previous one. It reignited job creation claims and warnings, including some made by Native Americans near the site, about threats to water and land. Hundreds of people and extra security were on hand at the state Capitol for a Jan. 23, 2013, hearing on the bill.

How long for jobs?

We asked Larson spokeswoman Gillian Morris for evidence that it would take at least seven years under the bill for jobs to be created. She cited three things: -- A January 2013 letter from the the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which says the GOP bill might require the corps to do an environmental analysis separate from one done by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. That could add time to the corps’ review process, which ""generally takes from two to four years or more,"" according to a corps timeline. -- Comments by Tim Sullivan, then-chairman of the Wisconsin Mining Association, who told state lawmakers in November 2012 it would take years to construct a mine.  ""We're not talking a year or two years. You're talking five, six years out, potentially even further, depending on how the permit process goes,"" he said. -- Likely delays caused by litigation. Indeed, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, called a lawsuit ""inevitable,"" but Larson didn’t cite any time frame on litigation delays. We’ll also note that Gogebic Taconite itself, when first announcing its plans, said the regulatory process alone could span five to seven years.

So, there are indications the permitting process could take up to seven years, but not evidence that it would take at least that long.

And jobs would be created along the way.

For his part, Assembly Majority Leader Scott Suder, R-Abbottsford, a sponsor of the new GOP mining bill, envisions a shorter timeline. He told us the environmental review and permitting process would take about two years and that the mine could be up and running in less than two years after that.

Suder also emphasized that some number of jobs would be created long before the mine opens. He said preliminary tasks would include groundwater well drilling, water and soil testing, metallurgical, hydrological and other engineering, and design for a water supply and a railroad line.

DNR mining expert Ann Coakley concurred.

Gogebic Taconite would need people to do environmental studies and to drill at least several hundred wells, she told us. Surface and groundwater testing would need to be done for up to two years. That and other work would need to be done in order for the company to write an environmental impact statement, which is needed to obtain permits. ""That’s a large-scale undertaking,"" costing probably $10 million and likely requiring at least dozens of jobs, Coakley said.

Coakley also noted that while the process for obtaining permission from the Corps of Engineers could take several years, the DNR, under the GOP bill, would have to finish its review of Gogebic Taconite’s application within 420 days. If the DNR gave its permission, the company could start construction on facilities such as a wastewater treatment plant, creating more jobs.

After permission from the Army Corps is granted, construction of the mine itself -- which Gogebic Taconite says would take two years and create 3,175 jobs -- could begin. Coakley said she didn’t expect it would take seven years to get to that point.

Our rating

Larson said a Republican-sponsored mining bill ""will take at least seven years to create jobs.""

The evidence Larson cited referred to how long it would take to open the mine, which is the when the largest number of jobs will be in play. But there’s not hard evidence that it would take at least seven years to open the mine and it’s clear that a significant number of jobs would be created before the opening.

For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Larson a Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF5E500>],/factchecks/2013/jan/27/chris-larson/wisconsin-bill-speed-mine-approval-wont-create-job/

Stephen Sweeney says Chris Christie vetoed a “package” of 30 jobs-related bills
","
The Democrat-led state Legislature handed 30 bills aimed at spurring job growth to Gov. Chris Christie, but the Republican governor took his veto pen to the entire package, according to Senate President Stephen Sweeney.

Sweeney made that claim during a Jan. 8 interview on The Dom Giordano Show on Talk Radio 1210 WPHT. After Sweeney criticized the governor, Giordano asked him what he would do differently from an economic perspective.

""We gave him a jobs package, Dom, that he vetoed, and because it was our package,"" said Sweeney (D-Gloucester). ""You know, the funny thing is, you’ve got to do something. You just can’t do nothing.""

Sweeney quickly added, ""We gave him 30 bills that, by the way, were bipartisan.""

But the senator’s claim is misleading for two main reasons:

While Christie conditionally vetoed certain bills, the governor later signed them after the Legislature concurred with his recommendations. Secondly, Sweeney’s claim ignores the fact that the governor signed several other bills meant to assist businesses and create jobs.

First, let’s discuss the conditional vetoes.

To back up the senator’s claim, Sean Kennedy, associate executive director of the Senate Democrats, provided a list of 30 bills that Christie vetoed in different ways between 2010 and 2012.

For the most part, those bills received absolute vetoes or conditional vetoes. An absolute veto means the governor rejected the legislation outright, while a conditional veto means Christie agreed to sign the bill if the Legislature made certain changes.

But of the nine conditional vetoes cited by Kennedy, eight of them involve bills that Christie later signed after the Legislature approved his proposed changes. So, it’s disingenuous for Sweeney not to acknowledge how versions of those bills were ultimately signed into law.

Now, we’ll talk about other jobs-related bills signed by Christie.

The majority of the bills cited by Kennedy were originally part of what Sweeney and other Democrats called the ""Back to Work NJ"" legislative package. The Legislature approved that package of roughly 30 bills in early 2011.

Christie issued absolute vetoes on at least 15 bills, all of which were considered to be part of that package, including ones cited by Kennedy. Democrats later tried to override some of those vetoes, but failed to secure enough votes.

But here’s what Sweeney failed to mention: several other bills labeled by Democratic legislators as part of that package were ultimately signed by Christie.

The governor signed at least 16 bills described in Democratic news releases as being part of the ""Back to Work NJ"" package. Those bills include 12 bills signed by Christie without any changes and four bills cited by Kennedy as first being conditionally vetoed.

Christie conditionally vetoed at least one other bill within that package, but the Legislature did not accept his recommendations.

In addition to the ""Back to Work NJ"" bills, the remaining bills cited by Kennedy include legislation vetoed in 2010 and early 2012. We told Kennedy that, taken as a whole, those 30 bills don’t constitute a ""package,"" since they were sent to Christie at different times.

In response to our findings, Kennedy said the following in an e-mail, and then declined further comment:

""All of the jobs bills acted on by the Senate were part of our jobs package, regardless of the timeframe in which they were done. The fact remains the governor vetoed 30 bills sent to his desk that would have created jobs and improved the economic climate in this state. In addition, in the Senate, it is the Senate President who defines what constitutes our jobs package.""

Our ruling

In a radio interview, Sweeney claimed that Christie ""vetoed"" a ""jobs package"" of ""30 bills.""

It’s correct to say the governor vetoed numerous bills aimed at supporting businesses and job growth, and thus stopped them from becoming law.

But of the bills cited by the senator’s representative, eight were ultimately signed into law after the Legislature concurred with the governor’s recommendations. Also, Sweeney’s claim ignores several other bills labeled by Democrats as part of the ""Back to Work NJ"" package and signed by the governor without any changes.

We rate the statement Half True.

The National Organization for Marriage-Rhode Island says religious groups have been forced to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities
","
As the Rhode Island House of Representatives moved toward a vote on legalizing same-sex marriage, an ad appeared in some local newspapers asserting that those who oppose same-sex marriage had been penalized in other states.

The ad, headlined  ""The Big Lie,"" was purchased by the National Organization for Marriage-Rhode Island, which opposes same-sex marriage.

It made several claims, including this one: ""Religious groups like Knights of Columbus have been forced to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities, against their beliefs."" The ad included the names and phone numbers of local legislators and urged readers to ask them to oppose same-sex marriage legislation.

We wondered what was behind NOM’s statement, because one of the key issues in Rhode Island’s debate over same-sex marriage is whether those who oppose it on religious grounds could face legal liability if it becomes law.

We contacted the marriage group, whose regional coordinator, Christopher Plante, e-mailed us various incidents summarized in its blog and links to others.

Only one involved the Knights of Columbus. And that was in Canada.

Here’s what we found: In 2003, two Canadian women booked a Knights of Columbus Hall owned by the Archdiocese of Vancouver for their wedding reception. (Same-sex marriage has been legal in British Columbia since July 2003 and overall in Canada since July 2005.)

After learning about the nature of the event, the Knights told the women they could not use the hall. They found another location but filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal.

We read the tribunal’s somewhat contradictory split decision, issued in 2005. On the one hand, it said it ""accepts that the Knights are entitled to this constitutional protection and therefore cannot be compelled to act in a manner that is contrary to their core religious beliefs.""

But it also declared that the Knights’ conduct was discriminatory and ordered the group to pay $1,000 to each of the women ""for injury to their dignity, feelings and self-respect"" and ""to refrain from committing the same or similar contravention"" of anti-discrimination rules.

But contrary to NOM’s advertisement, it did not force the Knights ""to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities.""

NOM cited another instance in which the owner of an Annapolis, Md., trolley tour service, based on his religious beliefs, purportedly decided in 2012 to get out of the wedding tour business so he would not have to take on same-sex couples as clients. (Same-sex marriage became legal in Maryland in March 2012 and was affirmed by voters in November.)

NOM cited a Patch Annapolis article as its source. But the example has little relevance to NOM’s claim. The tour bus company is not a religious organization and it was not forced to do anything.

In a subsequent interview, Plante referred to another case involving Methodists in the New Jersey community of Ocean Grove.

Here’s what we found: In 2007, Harriet Bernstein, 70, a retired school administrator, and Luisa Paster, 64, a retired academic librarian, decided to have a civil-union ceremony. (Like Rhode Island, New Jersey allows civil unions but not same-sex marriages.)

The couple wanted their ceremony at a waterfront pavilion that was advertised for marriage and other public events and was owned by the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association, which describes itself as  ""God’s Square Mile at the Jersey Shore.""  

The Methodist group refused to allow the couple to use the facility.

Bernstein and Paster instead held their ceremony in June 2007 at a nearby fishing pier.

The couple complained to the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights, which decided in October 2012 that, because the association received a tax exemption from the state’s Green Acres program, the pavilion had to be open to anyone in the future.

Again, the example NOM cited didn’t support its claim because the Methodist group hadn’t been forced to hold a same-sex ceremony. (It’s conceivable, of course,  that a same-sex couple might press the issue in the future.)

We searched the Internet for any examples in which a religious group had been forced to host a same-sex ceremony against its beliefs. We couldn’t find any.

Our ruling

The National Organization for Marriage-Rhode Island said in a newspaper advertisement that ""religious groups like Knights of Columbus have been forced to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities, against their beliefs.""

But the Knights of Columbus incident cited as proof by Plante, NOM’s regional coordinator, was from Canada and did not support its claim.

Neither did the second example it cited. Nor the third.

NOM made a strongly worded claim on the eve of a key vote that was meant to influence voters -- and their legislators.

We can’t predict what could happen under same-sex marriage laws in the future.

But we can rule on claims that are so far from the truth. The judges rule Pants on Fire.

"['Abortion', 'Oregon', 'Gayle Atteberry']","
Are abortion clinics in Oregon not held to 'basic health or safety standards?'
","
Gayle Atteberry, the executive director of anti-abortion group Oregon Right to Life, wrote a recent post on the organization’s website titled ""About those safe abortions."" She goes on to write about how abortions are ""anything but safe.""

Part of the problem here, she writes, is that ""abortion clinics in Oregon, as in most states, have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards."" Even tattoo parlors and veterinary clinics follow state-imposed health standards, she wrote.

We wondered whether that was true. Do abortion clinics in Oregon really face no state oversight? Is it true that they don’t have to meet basic health and safety standards?

In an interview, Atteberry said that ""ambulatory surgical"" clinics, such as ones for eye or shoulder surgery, are subject to state oversight, but that ""abortion clinics are exempted specifically from abiding by these restrictions and safety guidelines.""

She directed us to three Oregon administrative rules.The first rule includes a definition of a state-licensed ""ambulatory surgical center,"" which includes many outpatient surgery clinics, and goes on to list safety regulations the clinics must meet. Sure enough, there’s an exemption for abortion clinics. The other rules spell out safety provisions for tattoo parlors and veterinary facilities.

Next, we researched abortions in Oregon. In 2011, 9,566 abortions were performed in the state, according to the Oregon Health Authority. Of those, about 6 percent were performed in hospitals and doctors’ offices. The rest were performed in ambulatory surgical centers and at free-standing clinics.

At least one abortion clinic, Lovejoy Surgicenter in Northwest Portland, is a state-licensed ambulatory surgical center. The Oregon Health Authority’s Health Care Regulation and Quality Improvement program regulates abortion clinics that fall under this category.

Lovejoy is subject to unannounced site visits every year and a half to three or four years, said administrator Kayla Reich. ""They’ll pull patient charts, look at medications, make sure there’s nothing out of date,"" she said. ""We’ll have surveyors here for two or three days going through everything.""

Lovejoy performed about 2,400 abortions last year and about 2,500 in 2011, just more than a quarter of the abortions performed in the state in 2011.

Also, some abortion clinics are satellite hospital clinics that operate under hospital licenses, said Alissa Robbins, a spokeswoman with the Oregon Health Authority.

So we’ve learned that some locations that provide abortions are regulated and some aren’t.

Most free-standing abortion clinics, however, face multiple layers of state and federal oversight because they accept Medicaid patients and seek reimbursements. For example, Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette’s eight clinics in Oregon, which are categorized as free-standing clinics, are subject to inspections, audits and other health and safety oversight. The three co-medical directors who oversee medical care at the clinics are all licensed doctors on the obstetrics and gynecology faculty of OHSU, spokeswoman Liz Delapoer said.

There is a chance an abortion clinic could refuse to see Medicaid patients, meaning those clinics wouldn’t be subject to some of the layers of oversight Planned Parenthood experiences, but many do.

We also looked at who performs abortions. Those people -- doctors and some physician assistants and nurse practitioners -- are licensed and overseen by the state. Kathleen Haley, executive director of the Oregon Medical Board, which licenses doctors, said the agency has not received any complaints about abortion providers or unsafe abortions in the 18 years she has worked there.

Atteberry, in a follow-up interview, said that having state-licensed doctors does not guarantee they meet health standards. ""The state does not come into where they’re doing an abortion, making sure they’re doing it under health and safety standards, or in a building that (meets) health and safety standards.""

We understand the larger political context here: Opponents of abortion in Oregon and nationally have tried to seek more regulation for abortion clinics, but supporters of abortion rights say these types of structural regulations have no bearing on the safety of the procedures. PolitiFact Oregon will stay clear of that debate.

We’re looking into the factual basis of Atteberry’s statement that abortion clinics in Oregon have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards. There is an element of truth to this statement. Some abortion clinics are not licensed in the way other outpatient medical offices are regulated.

But we found at least one abortion clinic, Lovejoy, which does roughly 25 percent of Oregon abortions, that is regulated as a state-licensed ambulatory surgical center. Atteberry acknowledged Lovejoy’s regulation in our initial interview. Some other clinics operate under a hospital license. All of those are subject to health and safety regulations.

Plus, the people who perform the abortions are licensed medical personnel subject to state oversight. While some abortion clinics are not subject to the state oversight that veterinary clinics or tattoo parlors receive, that doesn’t mean they and the people who work in them are not held to basic health standards.

Those are critical facts that would give readers a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB6F200>],/factchecks/2013/jan/26/gayle-atteberry/are-abortion-clinics-oregon-not-held-basic-health-/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Guns', 'Mike Ryan']","
Do police automatically return guns to someone after a Baker Act mental health evaluation?
","
Following the shooting at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Conn., Sunrise Mayor Mike Ryan has become one of the leading advocates in Broward County for changing laws to improve school safety.

Ryan, a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, called for several measures, including the need to address mental health and guns, in the political blog BrowardBeat.com.

""Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the ‘Baker Act’ (as a danger to themselves or others) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours AND their commitment is never entered into a background check database,"" said Ryan, in a guest column on Jan. 14. ""As a result, there is also no impediment or second thought given to someone being released and purchasing a gun.""  

Ryan’s claim suggests that it’s a cinch for someone ""committed"" for up to three days under the Baker Act to reclaim their guns, and that they stay off any list that would ban them from getting a new one. We wanted to check to see if Ryan was correct.

What is the Baker Act?

Under the Baker Act, law enforcement can take someone against their will to a facility for a mental health evaluation if the person is a danger to themselves or others.

A person can’t be held involuntarily for longer than 72 hours, but a medical expert needs to examine the person and sign off on his or her release.

We should point out that the simple act of being held under the Baker Act doesn’t mean the person is mentally ill or in need of commitment. In 2010, less than 1 percent of about 140,000 involuntary examinations led to involuntary placement in a mental health treatment facility, according to the Florida Department of Children and Families. This number doesn’t account for people who voluntarily remained in facilities.

The Baker Act doesn’t state whether guns should be taken or returned, except to ban guns from hospitals providing mental health services. So law enforcement can take their guns when they are transported to a facility under the Baker Act.

We couldn’t find data regarding how often someone who is Baker Acted has their firearm taken. ""Most individuals don’t have weapons at the time of the Baker Act,"" said Miami-Dade County Judge Steve Leifman, who chairs judicial committees on mental health.

But interviews with attorneys, law enforcement officers and experts on the Baker Act revealed, it does happen. We consistently heard from law enforcement that whether they take the gun for safekeeping depends on the specific case.

For example, if a wife calls police to report that her husband is despondent and has a gun, and he is Baker Acted at home, police would take the gun, said Hillsborough Sheriff Col. Jim Previtera. But if someone is Baker Acted on the street and didn’t have a gun on him, the sheriff’s office wouldn’t go to his home and seize the gun.

Under the Baker Act, people who haven’t committed crimes are not supposed to be treated as criminals and they do retain their constitutional rights -- including the right to own a gun.

So do they get their guns back?

A 2009 Florida Attorney General opinion specifically states that law-abiding people who are released under the Baker Act should get their guns back.

""In the absence of an arrest and criminal charge against the person sent for evaluation under Florida's Baker Act, (law enforcement) may not retain firearms confiscated from such persons and retained by that office,"" concluded then Attorney General Bill McCollum.

The opinion didn’t outline procedures for gun retrieval. That means ""there is absolutely no consistency around the state in how this is being practiced,"" according to former state Baker Act director Martha Lenderman, who now trains law enforcement.

 How do police deal with firearms and Baker Act?

We contacted a few law enforcement agencies and other experts about how the gun retrieval is handled.

""You are supposed to get your gun back automatically, but rarely does that happen because they are in the hands of the police department,"" said Jon Gutmacher, an Orlando defense attorney and former Broward prosecutor who specializes in firearm cases.

In Ryan’s city of Sunrise, the police department doesn’t have a written policy on returning guns after a Baker Act. There have been multiple cases where the department required a court order, Deputy Chief Gerald Eddy told PolitiFact Florida.

But there have been times when gun owners tell Sunrise police that the law doesn’t require a court order and threaten litigation. In such cases, the department has to decide whether to still require the court order.

(Ryan told us that he has directed city officials to write a policy to require a court order in all cases ""while we advocate for the law to be changed to relieve us of the obligation to return guns to those Baker Acted."")

We found many law enforcement agencies -- including the sheriff’s offices in Broward and Hillsborough and police departments in the cities of Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and nearby town of Davie -- do require a court order.

Miami-Dade requires a court order if the person used the gun to breach the peace but not if the medically cleared person didn’t use it to breach the peace, Det. Javier Baez said.

In Broward, gun owners must fill out paperwork and pay a filing fee that generally ranges between $55 and $300 depending on the cost of their gun. It usually takes 30 to 45 days to get a hearing. If the law enforcement agency doesn’t object, then a mediator signs off and the judge grants the order. Donna Johnson, manager of county civil court, estimated Broward has about six to 10 such hearings a year.  

In Hillsborough, which doesn’t charge the gun owners a fee, the judge may ask the person to describe what happened that led to the Baker Act evaluation and some other questions, said Jason Gordillo, Hillsborough sheriff’s office legal counsel who has handled such cases for 10 years.

The judge looks for any legal grounds that would ban the person from getting their gun back -- for example a convicted felon or someone with a domestic violence injunction. Usually after a brief hearing the judge issues the order to return the gun.

""They can pick it up that day if they want,"" Gordillo said. The same procedures are used in cases that involved other law enforcement agencies within Hillsborough, he said.

The Pasco County Sheriff's Office doesn’t have a written policy but handles these matters on a case-by-case basis, spokesman Kevin Doll said. He said the usual requirements for return of a gun include Baker Act hospital discharge records, a letter from a licensed mental health professional stating the person is of sound mind and he is of no harm if the firearm is returned to him, and proof of ownership.  

""We cannot compel a person to provide their medical records (HIPAA rules), but if they want their weapons back without a court order, they must provide the requested documents,"" Doll told PolitiFact in an email.

Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office handles such matters on a case-by-case basis and does not have a written policy.

""We often have told them to get a court order to retrieve the weapon, but again, technically nothing in the law allows us to require a court order,"" Sgt. David DiSano said.

When a Baker Act leads to a commitment

Ryan’s claim related to when someone is released after a Baker Act evaluation after 72 hours  -- and therefore isn’t committed (even though he used the word committed). But we also  wondered if someone can get their gun back if they are committed for longer treatment.

Individuals who had been committed may petition the court to restore their gun rights and the court must rule in their favor if it determines the person is not a threat to public safety. (The state attorney can object.)

Baker Act and background checks

Before ringing up a gun sale, federal firearms licensees must contact the FBI or other designated agency to check National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to see if the person is banned from having a gun. (Read about the gaps in this reporting system here.) Since an evaluation under the Baker Act does not equal commitment, it is not entered into the FBI’s database.

Any person who has been ""adjudicated as a mental defective"" or ""committed to a mental institution"" is prohibited under federal law from possessing any firearm. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also maintains a similar database based on court records.

Some people who have a Baker Act evaluation do have mental illness, but they also can stabilize and remain functional throughout their lives, said Lenderman. She said the state needs more clear public policy on when to take -- and when to give back -- guns taken in Baker Act cases.

""Simply having a diagnosis of a medical disorder, which it is, should not deprive you of constitutional rights unless certain criteria have been met,"" she said. ""The law only says if you have a commitment of a court for involuntary placement is that going to take place. ... I hate to see further stigmatization of people with mental illness as though they are all dangerous people -- that is just flat out not true.""

Blanket policies that attempt to stop people with mental illness from obtaining guns can be both overinclusive and underinclusive, said Ron Honberg, a director at the National Alliance on Mental Illness. The key is identifying people who are violent -- not simply those who have a mental illness.

Some of the shooters in recent mass shootings were unknown to the mental health system and therefore wouldn’t have been on such a banned list anyway, he said.

""I understand the knee-jerk let’s keep guns out of the hands of all people with mental illness (but) it's pretty complicated.""

We asked Ryan how he thinks Florida law should handle people who have had a Baker Act evaluation and access to guns.

""The law should require that someone who has been Baker Acted to prove by some standard they are mentally fit to have their guns returned and in the interim be prohibited from purchasing weapons,"" he wrote in an email.  

We asked Ryan to explain why he wrote that the guns are returned ""automatically and immediately upon discharge"" if many cities actually require a court order.

""If the AG opinion is read that such ‘property’ can not be withheld, then the return would be automatic … that is, without restriction.  Immediacy would be without the delay of court hearings or evaluation by mental professionals and upon request.  There would be no reason for delay.   They can walk out of the institution, go to the police department and request return immediately,"" he wrote.  ""That is the import of the AG's opinion.""

Our ruling

Ryan made a two-part claim about the Baker Act and guns. First, he said ""Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the ‘Baker Act’ (as a danger to themselves or others) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours...""  

Those who are released after a Baker Act evaluation are entitled to get their guns back, the state’s former attorney general wrote in an opinion. Many law enforcement agencies require a court order, a process than can take several weeks.

The second part of Ryan’s claim, ""and their commitment is never entered into a background check database,"" is close to correct. It would be more accurate to say that ""their evaluation under the Baker Act is never entered into a background check database."" An evaluation itself is not commitment, and therefore the law stating that a commitment would preclude someone from having a weapon doesn’t apply.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Pundits', 'Sean Hannity']","
Sean Hannity says under President Barack Obama, 8.3 million fewer Americans are working
","During the Jan. 22, 2013, edition of his Fox News show, Sean Hannity introduced an interview segment with Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., by noting that during his second inauguration, President Barack Obama barely mentioned the primary topic of the 2012 presidential election -- the economy.

After playing some excerpts from Obama’s inaugural speech, Hannity said, ""While Obama remains hell-bent on tackling national security threats like climate change, the president made no substantive references to economic matters like putting you the American people back to work.""

Then, welcoming McCarthy to the show, Hannity said, ""8.3 (million) fewer Americans are working today than there were four years ago. What is your reaction to that?"" (Hannity actually inadvertently failed to say the word ""million,"" but in context, it was clear what he meant, so we won’t let that affect our ruling.)

We wondered whether it was really true that ""8.3 (million) fewer Americans are working today than there were four years ago.""

There’s an easy way to find out. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on the number of Americans who are employed at any given time. Using their figures for total, nonfarm employment, there were 358,000 fewer people working in December 2012 than there were in December 2008 -- a far cry from 8.3 million.

So by this standard -- and we believe it’s the correct one to use in this context -- Hannity is flat wrong. But the 8.3 million figure, which has been a hot topic in conservative circles recently, has a grain of truth to it.

Hannity’s primary problem was sloppy phrasing. He referred to 8.3 million ""fewer Americans … working today,"" but he would have been on firmer ground if he’d said that ""8.3 million more Americans are not working today"" compared to four years ago. That may sound like a distinction without a difference, but it’s not.

Actually, it’s crucial.

What’s at issue here are the number of Americans who have left the workforce during the past four years. The most frequently discussed economic statistics don’t do a very good job documenting these workers, and why they make that decision. For instance, a worker may have a baby and leave to become a stay-at-home mom or dad. Or a recent college grad may detour into grad school.

Some of these decisions may have happened anyway, regardless of the state of the job market. But some may decide to raise a child or go to grad school because the job market is poor.

Let’s look at where the 8.3 million figure emerged -- in an article in CNSNews.com, a conservative outlet. (The Fox News press office did not respond to an inquiry.) The article starts with BLS data for the number of Americans aged 16 and older, then subtracts the number who are employed. What’s left refers to the number of Americans who are ""not working"" at any given time, for any reason.

We did our own calculation for the December 2008 to December 2012 time frame and found that CNSNews had actually understated the count. By our count, the number of Americans not working increased by almost 9.6 million.

Still, let’s not get ahead of ourselves -- this number isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, either. Specifically, it’s a big stretch to tie this increase to Obama, as Hannity clearly does based on his introductory video clips and comments. Why?

• A big reason for the rise in non-working Americans is the graying of the Baby Boom generation, something Obama has no control over.

We looked at Census Bureau data to estimate the population of Americans aged 65 or more. There is no data for 2012, so we used the increase in the 65-and-over population from 2007 to 2011 instead. (Given demographic trends, the increase through 2012 would likely be higher, but we’ll stick with the hard numbers.)

We found that the population aged 65 and over rose by 3.1 million between 2007 and 2011. So, 3.1 million of the 9.6 million more non-working Americans are due in large part to the aging of the population. That leaves a rise of roughly 6.5 million Americans that might, theoretically, be attributable to Obama and the economy he presided over.

That number, 6.5 million, is lower than Hannity’s 8.3 million, but it’s still pretty big. (To its credit, CNSNews offered a similar reduction using Social Security beneficiary data, lowering the number of non-workers under Obama to about 4.1 million -- though readers who saw the headline or skimmed the story likely would have missed it.)

But there’s another important factor to consider:

• The number of non-workers has been growing since well before Obama entered office.

To determine how different the economy was under Obama, you have to have a sense of what it was like before he became president. So we did exactly the same calculations for the four-year period immediately before he took office – December 2004 to December 2008, under President George W. Bush.

In the 2004-08 period, the number of non-working Americans rose by 7.2 million and the number of elderly rose (between 2003 and 2007) by 1.8 million. So the rise of non-workers not attributable to the elderly was 5.4 million.

This means the increase in non-workers was indeed bigger under Obama – there were more than 1 million extra non-workers under Obama than under Bush -- but the increase was quite a bit smaller than one would think from hearing Hannity’s comment.

Experts say that this is an important statistic to be concerned about, though they also caution that it’s hard, if not impossible, to know what portion of these 1 million extra non-workers stems from Obama’s policies. We don’t know, after all, to what extent those leaving the job market are doing so because the economy is poor as opposed to other, more personal reasons.

""The idea of more Americans not working is a valid and interesting concept -- economists have been worried about this,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. ""There is clearly a downtrend in labor force participation. The question is how much of this would have happened without the recession -- or with different policies, or whatever the comparison is -- versus how much is long term trends, which we may or may not want to target with policies and may simply be due to demographics"" or changing attitudes.

Our ruling

Hannity said that under President Barack Obama, ""8.3 (million) fewer Americans are working today than there were four years ago."" That’s simply wrong; the actual decrease in working Americans over that period was less than one-twentieth that amount.

There is reason to be concerned about a related, but distinct, statistic -- that there are perhaps 8 million or 9 million more Americans than there were four years ago who are not working, for a variety of reasons. But that number is heavily affected by the graying of the Baby Boom generation and by long-term patterns that have nothing to do with Obama -- and in any case, it’s not what Hannity said. We rate Hannity’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC672140>],/factchecks/2013/jan/25/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-says-under-president-barack-obama-83-/

Obama overstates tax relief to individuals and businesses
","To counter Republican criticism that the stimulus package has made little impact on the economy, President Barack Obama has been boasting that the package has provided $43 billion in tax relief. But his claim includes a questionable tax number that inflates the impact. In his July 11, 2009, weekly radio address, Obama said the stimulus ""has delivered $43 billion in tax relief to American working families and businesses. Without the help the Recovery Act has provided to struggling states, it's estimated that state deficits would be nearly twice as large as they are now, resulting in tens of thousands of additional layoffs."" We wondered if he was right that the stimulus has provided $43 billion in tax relief. The $787 billion stimulus bill comes in two parts. About $499 billion was set aside to fund new roads, hire teachers and generally keep people employed, an issue we've explored previously. The other part of the bill — about $288 billion — is meant for tax breaks to individuals and businesses. According to the Congressional Budget Office, $64.8 billion in tax relief is expected to go out this year. The $43 billion Obama refers to would mean the government has doled out about two-thirds of this year's tax relief. We asked the Treasury Department for a breakdown of that $43 billion. Here's what a department spokeswoman told us has been provided to individuals and businesses:   • About $15 billion has come from a new program called Making Work Pay, the tax cut for the middle class that Obama promised during the campaign. In 2009 and 2010, about 95 percent of working families will get between $400 and $800 per year back from the government through reduced paycheck withholdings. Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that $19 billion will be paid out this year, so the government is nearing its goal for 2009. • About $11 billion in tax relief has resulted in allowing businesses to write off 50 percent of new equipment purchases, like computers, construction equipment or cars used for work. That's a little less than the $23.5 billion the tax committee expects the government to spend this year. • About $5 billion has gone to help people who have lost their jobs pay for health insurance.  • The Treasury Department estimates that extending the fixes to Alternative Minimum Tax has saved people about $8 billion, although the congressional tax committee puts that number at about $2 billion this year (we'll get into this discrepancy a bit later). That fix is necessary to prevent the AMT from drastically raising taxes on millions of Americas. Originally, the AMT was targeted at very wealthy people, but over the years it has grown to include those in lower income brackets as well. So Congress has been passing yearly fixes to keep middle class taxpayers from paying the AMT. • The remaining $4 billion is made up of a mix of other tax breaks.   So the Treasury Department's breakdown of Obama's $43 billion claim makes sense to us — except for the inclusion of the AMT money. We're not sure why the Treasury estimate is $6 billion more than the tax committee's figure. And we found the Treasury Department was vague on how the number was calculated, saying it takes into account estimated taxes as well as wages and salaries. A spokesman would not give more detail to us on the record. Furthermore, many tax experts argue that including AMT relief in the stimulus tax calculation is a bit of smoke and mirrors. By extending the AMT fix every year, the government ensures that the 3 million to 4 million people paying the tax doesn't expand to more than 20 million people, said Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the free-market Cato Institute. ""AMT is something those people never expect to pay,"" he said. ""It's kind of like saying that, if I didn't rob you on the way home from work today, I gave you money."" It's a trick that the Bush administration employed to inflate tax relief, and it seems the Obama administration is taking a similar approach, Mitchell said. Rosanne Altshuler, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a collaboration between the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, agreed. ""On one hand, you have to view the baseline [for the estimate] as the current law,"" which includes the AMT patch, she said. ""But it's not money back from the government in the sense that it's a refund or money being withheld. It would be different if people expected to pay for it."" Altshuler's group gave the AMT extension a D-minus in its Tax Stimulus Report Card because ""the provision would provide virtually no economic stimulus. Because the patch is perennially extended, it would have no effect on behavior in 2009. Almost 80 percent of the benefits would go to the richest 20 percent of households, who would be least likely to spend the additional funds and stimulate demand."" Back to Obama's claim. He's right that quite a bit of tax relief has been given to individuals and businesses, but our experts tell us that counting AMT relief doesn't really make sense because people would not expect to pay that money in taxes in the first place. It's not tax relief as much as it is the status quo. On top of that, the administration's estimate for how much tax relief the AMT has provided is far more than the congressional estimate, creating some uncertainty about how much money the tax break is really worth in the first place. So we don't think Obama can accurately say $43 billion. It could be as low as $35 billion.  He's making incorrect assumptions and including the impact of a tax change that isn't much of a tax break. That's a significant exaggeration that earns a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACB7A00>],/factchecks/2009/jul/22/barack-obama/obama-overstates-tax-relief-individuals-and-busine/

Obama flip-flops on requiring people to buy health care
","
Walk back with us through the mists of time to early 2008, and you might remember then-candidate Barack Obama defending the rights of hard-working people so they would not be forced to buy health insurance.
 
Obama's position was different from his two nearest rivals, Hillary Clinton and John Edwards, who included mandates for individuals to buy health insurance in their plans for reform. It was an issue that got downright contentious on the campaign trail.
 
At a debate in South Carolina, Edwards said Obama's plan really wasn't universal health care, since it didn't have a mandate to ensure everyone was covered.
 
Obama replied that his plan

was

universal (a claim we rated

Barely True

) and explained why he was against a mandate: ""A mandate means that in some fashion, everybody will be forced to buy health insurance. ... But I believe the problem is not that folks are trying to avoid getting health care. The problem is they can't afford it. And that's why my plan emphasizes lowering costs.""
 
Obama said at the time it was possible some people would refuse to buy health care under his plan.
 
""It's true that some people could game the system by just waiting till they get sick and then they show up,"" Obama said. ""But keep in mind that my plan also says children will be able to stay on their parents' plan up until the age of 25. And so I don't believe that there are a whole bunch of folks out there that will not get coverage. And John, both you and Hillary have a hardship exemption where, if people can't afford to buy health care, you exempt them so that you sort of don't count them.""
 
Let's contrast those comments with what Obama said on CBS News on July 17, 2009, after Democrats in the House of Representatives unveiled legislation that includes a mandate.
 
""Do you believe that each individual American should be required to have health insurance?"" asked Jonathan LaPook, an M.D. and a medical correspondent for CBS News.
 
""I have come to that conclusion,"" Obama said. ""During the campaign I was opposed to this idea because my general attitude was the reason people don't have health insurance is not because they don't want it, it's because they can't afford it. And if you make it affordable, then they'll come. I am now in favor of some sort of individual mandate as long as there's a hardship exemption.""
 
Obama said a hardship exemption should protect people who truly can't afford the required coverage.
 
We will agree that there's a technical argument to be made that Obama is still concerned with not punishing people for not having enough money to buy health insurance.
 
But it's hard to take that argument seriously when Obama used the issue of the individual mandate to wallop Hillary Clinton with negative ads.
 
""Hillary Clinton's attacking, but what's she not telling you about her health care plan? It forces everyone to buy insurance, even if you can't afford it, and you pay a penalty if you don't,"" said one of his

television ads

.
 
His mailings made similar claims, which we rated

Half True

. At one campaign stop, Clinton waived the mailers and declared, ""Shame on you, Barack Obama!""
 
""Meet me in Ohio,"" she added. ""Let's have a debate about your tactics and your behavior in this campaign.""
 
Obama was vigorous in his attacks on Clinton for including an indvidual mandate in her plan. Now that the Democrats in the House have included a mandate in health reform legislation, he's fine with it. He admitted he changed position in the interview with CBS. Full Flop!

"['Environment', 'National', 'Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Energy', 'Sarah Palin']","
Palin flips on her support of cap-and-trade
","Shortly after announcing she would resign as Alaska's governor, Sarah Palin wrote an op-ed column in the  Washington Post  lambasting the cap-and-trade bill.

""I am deeply concerned about President Obama's cap-and-trade energy plan, and I believe it is an enormous threat to our economy,"" she wrote on July 14, 2009. ""It would undermine our recovery over the short term and would inflict permanent damage.""

She said jobs will be shipped overseas, energy sector workers will lose their jobs and electricity bills will skyrocket, echoing points that many other Republicans have used in arguing against the bill.

""Do we want to outsource [work] to China, Russia and Saudi Arabia? Make no mistake: President Obama's plan will result in the latter. For so many reasons, we can't afford to kill responsible domestic energy production or clobber every American consumer with higher prices,"" she wrote.

Did we mention her op-ed was called ""The 'Cap and Tax' Dead End?""

Clearly, Palin is no fan of cap-and-trade.

Before we get to Palin's history on the issue, here's some background on cap-and-trade, a proposal to slow climate change. The bill Palin lambasts was authored by Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts. It would cap carbon emissions with the long-term goal of lowering them by 83 percent by 2050. In the meantime, companies would either have to buy permits from the government to continue polluting or trade them with companies who don't produce enough pollution to meet the government-imposed limit.

Several readers wrote to us after the op-ed was published suggesting Palin had flip-flopped. We should note that this isn't the first time Palin's opinions on climate change have  earned her a place  on the Flip-O-Meter; in a Sept. 11, 2008, interview with Charles Gibson of  Good Morning America  , Palin insisted that she's always considered climate change a product of human activity, but we found she had made a Full Flop.

As for her stand on cap and trade, it too has shifted.

Before she became Sen. John McCain's presidential running mate, she did not endorse cap-and-trade outright. When she was named as a possible choice, a  U.S. News and World Report  column said she had no public position on the legislation but that she had shown signs of being interested in the concept.

During her first few months as governor, Palin created a subcabinet on climate change — a group of advisers assigned to find ways to lower the state's greenhouse gas emissions.

""The state's interest in curbing emissions represents a new emphasis for Palin, who pronounced herself unconvinced about global warming science during her campaign for governor last year,"" said an April 13, 2007 article in the  Anchorage Daily News  .

Palin's interest in climate change back then may have had something to do with her state's location. Because of its high latitude, the arctic state has felt the impacts of climate change sooner than the rest of the world.

More than a year later, the subcabinet announced that it would come up with a plan for major industries in the state — oil production, forestry, transportation — to try to reduce climate change.

In the fall of 2007, Palin became involved with the Western Climate Initiative, a coalition of Western states and Canadian provinces with the goal of slowing climate change, according to her Web site. The group established a regional cap-and-trade program in September 2008, but Alaska does not have to meet those goals because it is designated in the group as an observer, not a partner.

Palin became more direct about cap-and-trade when she teamed up with McCain, a Republican who famously went against his party in 2003 by introducing a cap-and-trade bill with then-Democrat Joe Lieberman. McCain stuck with his pledge to to lower emissions during the campaign, writing in the March 18, 2008, edition of the  Financial Times  that ""the risks of global warming have no borders.""

Palin echoed McCain's platform in the Oct. 2, 2008 vice presidential debate against Joe Biden. (It's  on YouTube  . Skip to the 29-minute mark to hear her talk about climate change and cap-and-trade.)

During the debate, Palin emphasized the importance of energy independence, of ""cleaning up the planet"" and of ""encouraging other nations to come along with us."" She went on to say, ""We've got to reduce emissions.""

""We've got to become more energy independent for that reason also. ... As we rely on other countries that don't care as much about climate as we do, we're allowing them to produce, and to emit, and to pollute more than America would ever stand for.""

When debate host Gwen Ifill asked Palin whether she supported capping carbon emissions, her answer was unequivocal:

""I do,"" she said. ""I do.""

It's worth noting that Ifill did not ask Palin if she supported cap-and-trade specifically. But Palin's comments make it clear she at least supported the ""cap"" part. (Indeed, although the caps have generated most of the opposition, capping and trading are inextricably linked. If you cap emissions, you need a mechanism like the trading to provide incentives for companies to reduce their emissions.)

Fast-foward to Palin's recent op-ed in the  Washington Post  and it's clear that she has done a dramatic reversal on the issue. She was in favor of capping emissions as McCain's running mate and is now writing op-eds blasting the idea. We see that as a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA1C0C0>],/factchecks/2009/jul/20/sarah-palin/palin-flips-her-support-cap-and-trade/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Stimulus', 'Transportation', 'Robert Bennett']","
Bennett says stimulus is spending too much on road signs promoting stimulus
","Critics of the $787 billion economic stimulus package are up in arms about a particularly visible reminder of the legislation: roadway signs that are sprouting up across the nation, touting construction projects funded by the bill. In June, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., included the signs as an example of questionable spending in his report, “100 Stimulus Projects: A Second Opinion.” In July, Rep. Chris Lee, R-N.Y., issued a statement saying that the signs are “just the most recent in a series of examples demonstrating how dollars from the stimulus are being wasted or misspent.” Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin, mocking the red, blue and green logo of the stimulus, has gone so far as to label the signs “stimulus hype propaganda sporting the mark of the porkulus beast."" Democrats, such as Rep. Dan Maffei of New York, have even joined the chorus of critics. On July 15, 2009, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, and Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., took aim at stimulus-touting signs with an amendment that “would prohibit the use of stimulus funds to pay for signage promoting the administration's spending of taxpayer dollars on (stimulus) projects.” (The amendment has not yet been taken up by the Senate.) In a statement announcing the amendment, Sen. Bennett asserted that “the administration is wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on a PR campaign.” We’ll leave it to others to decide whether spending stimulus money on roadside signs is worthwhile. Instead, we’ll look at whether the senator’s assertion is accurate. This requires breaking his statement into two parts. The first portion of Bennett’s statement — his assumption that “the administration” is the primary actor in the signage drama — isn’t entirely correct. It’s true that the federal government is providing the stimulus money for these highway construction projects. It’s also true that the U.S. Department of Transportation has issued three versions of guidance on stimulus-related signs, saying that states are “strongly encouraged” to post the signs. But the department did not make the signs mandatory, and news reports indicate that Texas, Florida and Virginia have opted not to post the signs. Indeed, the feds have delegated most of the responsibility for carrying out stimulus efforts to the states, from choosing the projects to negotiating the contracts. If states want to put stimulus money to uses other than signs, they may do so. The other portion of Bennett’s assertion has to do with whether “millions” of dollars are being spent on these signs. That number is not easy to nail down. Stimulus spending is decentralized and the states have broad discretion; there’s also no specific budget line for signs. No one — including the U.S. Transportation Department — knows for sure how much is being spent on these signs. So we did some calculations to create our own estimate. We found that it's possible that spending on stimulus signs has reached into the millions, but it’s no certainty. One of the challenges in making this determination is the large variation in the cost of a sign. In July, the Associated Press reported that Michigan estimated a sign costs $400 to $500. Illinois officials suggested $300 for the sign and an additional $700 when labor is included, while Colorado officials said materials plus labor would run between $750 and $1,200 per sign. Other estimates ran the gamut. The  Tennessean  newspaper reported that the cost in its state was $38 per sign from one vendor and $55.16 from another. In New York state, the estimates have been far pricier. The  Syracuse Post-Standard  reported that published engineering instructions had the largest signs running between $6,000 and $8,300, with smaller versions costing $3,600 to $4,800 and the smallest sizes costing $1,600 to $2,100. After a spate of bad publicity over those numbers, the state Department of Transportation first lowered its costs, according to a spokesman, and then on July 17, 2009, issued an engineering directive suspending the installation of the signs altogether, pending further advice from the U.S. DOT. Meanwhile, in his statement, Bennett himself cited figures of $1,700 per sign in Georgia, $2,000 per sign in Pennsylvania and $3,000 per project in New Jersey. He did not provide sourcing and his office did not return a call and an e-mail. So, excluding the now-dated New York prices, the cost of a single sign ranged from $38 to $2,000, or perhaps $3,000 on the extreme. According to the U.S. DOT, there were 1,995 stimulus-funded highway projects that had “notices to proceed” as of July 10. Many, but likely not all, of these were far enough along to be ready to host a sign, according to DOT. The actual number of signs posted so far is probably lower than that, DOT added, once you eliminate the states that aren’t posting signs at all and the sites that do not yet have signs erected. So, whether stimulus signage is costing “millions,” as Bennett suggests, depends heavily on what you assume to be the prevailing national price of making and posting a sign. Assuming one sign per project and an average installation cost of $1,000 — and without reducing the total number of sites lower than the full 1,995 — the total would be just under $2 million spent for signs, which is the bare minimum for Bennett to be accurate in saying “millions.” Any lower cost per sign would mean that the senator was exaggerating. So let's read the signs for the Truth-O-Meter. The first part of his statement is a stretch because the federal government doesn't actually mandate the signs and some states have opted out. But it's clear the feds are encouraging the signs. The second part of his statement appears to be just in the ballpark based on an average cost of $1,000, but it's an exaggeration if the cost is lower. Add it up and we've got a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD7C840>],/factchecks/2009/jul/17/robert-bennett/bennett-says-stimulus-spending-too-much-road-signs/

Palin claims that the cap-and-trade bill includes a $4.2 billion worker program
","Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has been making waves in the blogosphere with a recent op-ed on cap-and-trade.
 
Her critics say Palin's July 14, 2009, piece in the  Washington Post  gets it all wrong. It ""displays an ignorance for the subject so profound it's almost gutsy,"" Conor Clarke wrote in the  Atlantic  .  Keith Olberman said on  Countdown  that she uses ""the sky-is-falling tactics.""
 
We've explored other aspects of the cap-and-trade bill before, including  how much it would cost  lower-income consumers (Palin says it would hit them hardest, but the independent Congressional Budget Office predicts it would actually put money in the pockets of the poorest), as well as  how much of an impact  the bill would really have on climate.
 
Today, we're tackling this claim from Palin's op-ed: ""Job losses are so certain under this new cap-and-tax plan that it includes a provision accommodating newly unemployed workers from the resulting dried-up energy sector, to the tune of $4.2 billion over eight years. So much for creating jobs.""
 
Before we dig into Palin's statement, here's a quick summary of how the cap-and-trade bill, authored by Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, would work. The bill aims to slow climate change by lowering carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. To do that, the bill would cap yearly carbon emissions, and to comply, companies will have to either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits to continue polluting. Initially, the government's permits for polluters would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government.

Palin and other Republicans say they are concerned that the transition will be costly to industry — particularly companies in the energy sector — and that workers will lose their jobs as a result.
 
The authors of the bill are also concerned — so much so that they included the program Palin refers to. Should workers lose their jobs, they would get 156 weeks of benefits, including 70 percent of their average weekly wage, help paying for health insurance, job training and employment search assistance.
 
So, Palin is correct that the bill has a program for displaced workers.

Funding for the program would come from selling those pollution allowances we mentioned earlier.

Supporters of cap-and-trade argue that Palin's statement is misleading because she makes it seem like, overall, the bill is killing jobs. They say she neglects to point out that it will add thousands of jobs in industries that will grow because of the dramatic policy change. Bracken Hendricks, a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, recently predicted the bill would create 1.7 million new jobs. The program Palin's talking about will also help train those workers to participate in the emerging industry.
 
""In an economic shift from pollution to clean energy, some sectors will see impacts,"" he said. ""But this policy isn't about job loss, it's about anticipated growth. ... The expectation is that there will be a net job creation.""
 
So, back to Palin's claim. She's correct that there is a program in the bill that would help displaced workers, but she paints a narrow view of how the bill will affect employment. Yes, some workers will be displaced and need to be retrained, but some experts are projecting growth and new jobs in industries that benefit from the new policy. We rate her claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8CD600>],/factchecks/2009/jul/16/sarah-palin/palin-claims-cap-and-trade-bill-includes-42-billio/

Obama statements on single-payer have changed a bit
","
President Barack Obama has been prodding Congress to follow his principles on health care reform. He's advocating the same principles he supported during the campaign: Keeping employer-provided insurance in place, making it easier for people to shop for private insurance through a regulated exchange, expanding programs to help low-income people, and requiring large employers to offer insurance or contribute to a health care fund.


But at almost every town hall he's held, though — five since March 26, 2009 — Obama has been asked a variation of this question: Why won't you support a single-payer health care system?


""It seems to me,"" said a questioner at one of the town halls, ""that we would take that same scenario and increase it outward for the entire country, and that is why I still support single-payer. And I know that at one point you did.""


We've gotten similar messages from readers pointing us to a YouTube video as evidence that Obama once supported a single-payer plan, which the readers say indicates he has flip-flopped.


For those who haven't followed the details of health care reform, a single-payer health care system would mean the government pays hospitals and doctors directly for every person's health care. It's not socialized medicine, like in the United Kingdom, where the government owns the hospitals and doctors are government employees. In essence, it's Medicare, the government-sponsored health care plan for seniors, with no age restrictions.


The

YouTube video

, which isn't the greatest quality, shows Obama speaking in a meeting room to an audience that interrupts him from time to time with applause. A sign on the podium says ""AFL-CIO Civil, Human and Women's Rights Conference,"" and Obama sounds like he's giving a campaign speech:


""I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program. I see no reason why the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent of its gross national product on health care, cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody. And that's what Jim is talking about when he says everybody in, nobody out. A single-payer health care plan, a universal health care plan. That's what I’d like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we've got to take back the White House, we've got to take back the Senate, and we've got to take back the House.""


Reports on the Internet date this statement as June 30, 2003. (We'll address the alleged date more in just a bit.) That was a long time ago, but there's no statute of limitations for the Flip-O-Meter. The possibility that Obama may have flipped on the issue is relevant because Obama's conservative opponents sometimes claim that the public option — health insurance run by government that acts as insurer of last resort — is a stalking horse for a single-payer health care system. According to their theory, private insurance will wither in the face of a public option and Obama will get the single-payer system he secretly wants.


We reviewed Obama's public remarks and statements, and found no statements that quite match that video. To give you the context, in 2003, Obama was a second-term state senator and beginning a campaign to win the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. The Democratic field was crowded — there were candidates both better known and better funded than Obama — and he was considered a long-shot at best. He ultimately won, but at the time, nobody was paying much attention to him.


In other statements, Obama has spoken favorably of single-payer in concept, but always adding qualifiers.
 

But the video strikes a very different tone from the remarks above.


To find out more about the video, we tracked down some of the people who worked on health care reform with Obama when he was a state senator in Illinois. Dr. Quentin Young said he has followed Obama's career since Obama first decided to run for state senator in 1995; he lives in Obama's Hyde Park neighborhood in Chicago. A longtime activist in health care matters, Young left his medical practice a few years ago to volunteer full time for Physicians for a National Health Program, a Chicago-based advocacy group for single-payer. The group features Obama as part of its Web site.


Young is an ardent supporter for single-payer, he said, because private insurers have an incentive to deprive people of care. ""They do what they're supposed to do, which is maximize revenue, so they can pay their investors and their executives. Their profits are breathtaking and obscene"" he said. ""And you wonder why the health system is so costly.""


Single-payer makes sense, he said, and Obama used to believe that, too. ""It isn't as though this is an import from Europe or Canada. We have had 45 years of experience with Medicare,"" Young said.


Young believes he was in the room when the YouTube video was made, and if he wasn't, it's only because he heard Obama speak often in favor of a single-payer plan during 2003 and earlier, he said.


""As I recall, this was his categorical response, that he thinks single-payer is the way to go,"" Young said. ""Over the years, there's been ever more edging on his part, to the point where what he has now is a multitiered program, but it ain't single-payer.""


Young said the ""Jim"" Obama refers to in the video is Jim Duffett, director of the Illinois advocacy group Campaign for Better Health Care.


It's true, Duffett said, when we contacted him. He's the ""Jim"" in the video and was at the AFL-CIO speech. He remembered it as having been in December 2003, but it's possible it was in June, he said.


Yes, Obama did support single-payer, but Duffett said Obama also talked about the need to be strategic and work within political limitations, which he attributed to Obama's background as a community organizer.


""You have to figure out who's with you, who's against you, how you divide and conquer and move that football down the field,"" Duffett said. ""It just can't be the same little group of liberals who have health insurance and sit around the table and verbalize their great policy ideas. You have to have more people than that.""


Duffett said if the entire video were aired, it would show Obama making statements about the need to be practical, much like his later public statements.


""I've never felt that his core principles for accessible, guaranteed health care for everyone were ever compromised. He's an organizer, and you have to figure out as strategically as you can how to win,"" he said.


Duffett urges his supporters to strongly support the public option, the details of which are still in the works. If the public option gets passed and operates well, he said, perhaps it will lead to a single-payer system. ""We truly believe a public health option will work to lessen those negative fallacies of what the role of the government can be,"" he said.


Young, on the other hand, calls the public option ""wimpy"" and part of ""a really deceitful set of reforms"" pushed by the health care industry to make sure they don't lose any of their profits, even if reform passes. ""I don't think they'll even let a watered-down public option go forward. And if it does, they'll use their political clout to weaken it,"" he said.


Both Duffett and Young served on the Adequate Health Care Task Force, a 29-member state board created by the Illinois General Assembly in 2004 to research and recommend a health plan for the state. The legislation that created the board was the Health Care Justice Act, and its chief Senate sponsor was Barack Obama.


The chair of the board was Dr. Wayne Lerner, who holds a doctorate in public health policy and a master's degree in hospital administration. Lerner is currently the president of Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago.


We asked Lerner if Obama was a single-payer supporter when Obama was a state senator. Lerner said he didn't know what Obama's opinion was on the best health care model, though he definitely felt the task force had the freedom to explore all options.


""I never felt constrained one way or the other,"" Lerner said. ""You're not going to find a smoking gun in the act or the task force that there was support for a single-payer system from Obama.""


Lerner said he, like many others in Illinois, noticed that Obama moved more to the center on several issues during his run for president, and Lerner was pleased by that.


""There has to be compromise if we're going to have health care reform,"" he said.


But back to our ruling: Did Obama flip on support of single-payer, as the woman at the town hall implied? The video shows he plainly said, ""I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program. ... A single-payer health care plan, a universal health care plan. That's what I’d like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we've got to take back the White House, we've got to take back the Senate, and we've got to take back the House."" Well, Democrats now have the White House, and the Senate and the House. And Obama still doesn't support a single-payer system.


We also have at least one eyewitness — the ""Jim"" mentioned in the video — who says the 54-second snippet shown on YouTube isn't a full accounting of Obama's more nuanced position. And we have a single-payer supporter, Dr. Quentin Young, who said Obama definitely was for single-payer and switched.
 
So let's put this to the Flip-O-Meter. Opponents of Obama's health plan who watch the video see a stark flip (and possibly hints of what they believe he's wanted all along). Indeed, his comments seem quite clear that he supported a single-payer plan. But a full examination of his comments then and now reveals they have not changed that drastically. Yes, when he was trying to appeal to the Democratic base, he was a bigger supporter of the single-payer plan. But as we note, he still says that he'd prefer such a plan if he was starting from scratch.
 
So what we see here is a candidate who in 2003 was trying to appeal to a liberal electorate and today has moderated his comments to appeal to a broader national audience. That's a Half Flip in our view.

Sen. Jon Kyl says only 6.8 percent of stimulus has been spent
","One of the most common Republican attack lines against President Barack Obama's $787 billion economic stimulus package has been that the money isn't flowing to the nation's economy quickly enough. If the bill's supporters really wanted to help the economy quickly, the argument goes, they should have spent the stimulus money right away rather than using it on projects that will take more time to get up and running.   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., the No. 2 Senate Republican, made that point on ABC's  This Week With George Stephanopoulos  on July 12, 2009.   ""The reality is (the stimulus) hasn't helped yet,"" Kyl told Stephanopoulos. ""Only about 6.8 percent of the money has actually been spent.""   It's a matter of opinion and interpretation whether the stimulus has helped the economy since it passed in February. So we won't rule on that. But Kyl is mostly right about the amount that's been spent.   The Obama administration publishes u  pdated spending figures on Recovery.gov  , the administration's Web site tracking the stimulus money. It includes  a graph  showing the week-by-week trend in spending, which shows how it has steadily increased.   As of July 3, $60.4 billion in stimulus money had been spent, according to the chart. If you divide this by the full stimulus amount of $787 billion, you get 7.7 percent — a bit higher than Kyl's 6.8 percent, but in the ballpark. It appears that Kyl was a few weeks out of date in his statistics. The figure spent by June 19 was 6.7 percent; in the subsequent two weeks of reported data, the government shelled out an additional $7.5 billion, boosting the percentage slightly.   But on the larger point, Kyl is accurate: A relatively small portion of the stimulus has been spent. So we find his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC97AA40>],/factchecks/2009/jul/15/jon-kyl/sen-jon-kyl-says-only-68-percent-stimulus-has-been/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Stimulus', 'Joe Biden']","
Vice President Biden claims $174 billion of stimulus has been committed
","To counter Republican criticism that the stimulus money is not being spent fast enough, Vice President Joe Biden has been traveling the country to boast about the recovery plan's success stories.     In conjunction with a July 9, 2009, trip to Ohio, Biden's office put out a news release with this talking point: ""Across the country, $174 billion of the Recovery Act have been committed in its first 130 days.""     The White House says it is getting the numbers from its own Web site, Recovery.gov. We counted 130 days after Obama signed the bill on Feb. 17, which took us to June 27. On that day, the government had committed $157.8 billion, slightly less than the $174 billion cited by Biden.   Those numbers are culled from weekly reports submitted by all federal agencies. The total stimulus cost will ultimately be roughly $787 billion, with about $499 billion for new spending. (The other $288 billion is for tax relief.) So that means that about 35 percent of the spending ($174.9 billion of $499 billion) has been allocated so far.     That might sound like a lot, but Republican critics complain the money is just trickling out. For example, Sen. Jon Kyl, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, complained last week that only 6.8 percent of the stimulus package has been spent.   The numbers can be confusing, making you wonder whether Kyl is right about the 6.8 percent or Biden is right about the 35 percent. So we investigated and found that, like so many things in the federal budgeting process, it all comes down to semantics.     John Porcari, deputy secretary of the Department of Transportation, wrote how this confusion is playing out in miniature at his agency, after getting what he considered some bad press in a  USA Today  story that maintained that only $132 million of the total $27.5 billion earmarked for road construction funding has been spent.     Indeed, there's a big difference between how much money the government has already spent — that figure is about $60 billion, according to the White House — and how much the government has obligated or committed to a project.     ""Whenever a state obligates or dedicates their Recovery dollars to a project that means it is green-lighted,"" Porcari wrote on Recovery.gov. ""States can start advertising the project and soliciting bids and once a bid is awarded contractors can buy supplies, bring workers on board and start breaking ground. It could be weeks before the reimbursement process starts so those outlays are in no way an indicator of how much money is getting to states, how much work is being done or how many people are working. The $16 billion obligated to thousands of highway projects is the true measure of how much highway money is reaching states.""     Using his definition, about $16 billion has been obligated to road construction projects, far more than what's actually been spent.     So for practical purposes, money ""committed"" is the same as ""obligated"" and ""allocated."" It's money that will be spent on a particular project.   It's fair to use those broader terms, according to Jim Horney, a budget expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, because the guarantee of the money can sometimes be enough to keep an agency or a company from laying off a worker.    ""It's not just when the check has been written that we see an impact,"" he said.     Take Virginia, for example. Earlier in the year, lawmakers were planning to lay off teachers to save cash. But when the stimulus passed, the state knew it would be getting some financial relief, so officials changed their budget to keep those teachers employed.     The money isn't in the state treasury at that moment, but it still has a ripple effect on the economy, Horney said.     ""If [teachers] knew they would be laid off, they would have started saving money, stopped buying clothes, preparing for hard times ahead,"" he said. Knowing they would have a job in the coming school year, teachers were less likely to adopt austerity measures.      Horney had this caveat: Impact on the economy depends on how quickly the money is actually spent or reimbursed. If it takes five years for the government to pay a state back for a project, then the state may take some cost-cutting measures in the meantime.     Conservatives, though, say the true measurement of economic impact is money actually spent, said Brian Riedl of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.     ""The economic theory behind the stimulus suggests only actual outlays can create jobs and drive money through the economy,"" he said.     So back to Biden. He said that $174 billion had been committed at the 130-day mark. Federal records show he was a little off. The administration's Recovery.gov site shows that $157.8 billion had been committed. So we give Biden a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC995D80>],/factchecks/2009/jul/15/joe-biden/vice-president-biden-correct-174-billion-stimulus-/

Ad on Rush Limbaugh and Sonia Sotomayor gets Adam Putnam's position wrong
"," UPDATE:  We've updated this item after hearing back from Presente.org, but we haven't changed our ruling. A group called Presente.org is using some political sleight-of-hand to suggest that a Republican House member from Florida endorses Rush Limbaugh's comment that Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor is a racist. The sleight-of-hand is the tricky wording in a radio ad from the left-leaning Latino advocacy group's ""Action"" arm. Instead of directly saying that Putnam, who is running for Florida agriculture commissioner, endorses Limbaugh, the ad says that he ""refused"" to reply to the group's inquiry. A similar ad was used against Rep. John Mica, a Republican from the Orlando area. Here's a translation of the Spanish-language ad: (Spanish) ""Sonia Sotomayor is set to be the first Latina, and the first Puerto Rican, to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. It is a proud moment for our community. Yet Republican leaders insist on attacking her. (English) ""'She doesn't have any intellectual depth. She's got a — she's an angry woman, she's a bigot. She's a racist.' (Spanish) ""That's Republican leader Rush Limbaugh calling Judge Sotomayor a racist and a bigot. It's insulting to all Latinos and Americans. We asked Republican Congressman Adam Putnam if he would denounce Limbaugh's words. He refused to reply. Let's put a stop to the hate. Call Congressman Putnam today at 863-534-3530 and tell him to condemn this language."" The ad is unusual because House members don't have any say in the confirmation of Supreme Court nominees. That's up to the Senate. With its insinuation, the ad is incorrect. Most notably, Putnam has not ""refused"" to comment on this. He told the  Orlando Sentinel  very specifically that he thought Sotomayor was  not  a racist in response to Limbaugh's comments. His comments were published in a  Sentinel  column on May 31, 2009, by Scott Maxwell, about how Republicans were responding to the Sotomayor nomination and Limbaugh's controversial remarks. ""I have not seen anything that would disqualify her,"" Putnam said. ""And I certainly would not call her a racist based on anything we have seen so far."" We also spoke with Putnam's communications director, Keith Rupp. Rupp said if Presente.org called Putnam's office looking for comment on Limbaugh, he couldn't find a record of it. He looked after they started getting calls off the radio ad. ""The bottom line is we're not aware of them having contacted us,"" Rupp said. ""When people call, we make a record of it, usually in writing."" Presente.org, however, said they did call, and spokesperson Jennifer Fernandez Ancona provided us with a copy of their phone record that shows a 4-minute call to Putnam's Bartow office and a 1-minute call to his D.C. office on June 19. The group knew about Putnam's previous comments, she said, but felt it was important that Putnam and Mica denounce Limbaugh's remarks as the Sotomayor hearings began. She said it's not sufficient that Putnam said he didn't think Sotomayor was a racist, because of how influential Limbaugh is and how much attention his comments receive. ""We were asking (Putnam) to specifically denounce Rush's comments,"" she said. ""It's a different question."" Rupp said that Putnam's statements to the  Sentinel  were his definitive comments on the matter. The phrasing of the ad is very artful, but the thrust of the message is that Putnam was silent when asked about Limbaugh's remarks. That's not the case. Presente.org said there's a difference between saying you disagree with someone's comments and specifically denouncing the person's comments. We don't think that's a meaningful distinction in the context of a 60-second radio ad. We rule Presente.org's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8933C0>],/factchecks/2009/jul/14/presente/rush-limbaugh-sonia-sotomayor-adam-putnam/

Republican National Committee claims Obama administration offered $900 million to Hamas to rebuild Gaza
","
The Republican National Committee recently put out a questionnaire called the ""2009 Obama Agenda Survey"" in which it asks Republicans to rate their agreement or disagreement with a number of so-called Obama administration positions.
 
But it looks to us more like a push poll, a political technique in which the questions are written in a way that aims to convince the respondent of a particular political position. In other words, they are political statements masquerading as questions.
 
We decided to fact-check two ""questions"" from the survey, and you'll see what we mean.
 
One is an allegation that the Obama administration has ordered a new initiative that requires FBI agents to read Miranda Rights to high-value terrorist detainees captured on the battlefield. We deal with that one in

another Truth-O-Meter ruling

.
 
Here, we address the GOP question, ""Do you support the Obama administration’s decision to offer $900 million to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to rebuild Gaza?""
 
As you can see, built into the ""question"" is a statement of fact, that the Obama administration offered $900 million to Hamas to rebuild Gaza.
 
During a trip to Egypt in early March 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the United States intends to provide $900 million for humanitarian, economic and security assistance for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people.
 
Here's how that money would be split: $200 million to the Palestinian Authority to address part of its 2009 budget shortfall; $400 million ""to help the Palestinian Authority solidify economic and institutional reforms in the West Bank""; and $300 million in humanitarian aid for Gaza following January's 22-day violent conflict between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas. The humanitarian aid to Gaza would be distributed primarily through U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations. The strategy, according to State Department officials, was to specifically make sure the money did not go to Hamas.
 
In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 30, Clinton assured that disbursement of the money ""will be implemented with stringent requirements to prevent aid from being diverted into the wrong hands.""
 
Translation: Hamas.
 
Some have argued, however, that the aid, while not going directly to Hamas, would still benefit them.
 
""Whatever officials in Washington might intend, the Obama administration's new Gaza aid package is likely to turn out to be a financial boon for Hamas, which wields actual physical control over the places the aid is destined to go,"" wrote Ilan Berman, vice president for foreign policy at the American Foreign Policy Council, in an April commentary distributed by Tribune Media Services.
 
Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations and an expert in U.S.-Middle East policy, said there are legitimate concerns about aid ending up in the hands of Hamas. The problem, he said, is that supposed nongovernmental groups that purport not to have ties with Hamas sometimes do.
 
""We have yet to devise a foolproof system to ensure that money doesn't bleed out,"" Cook said.
 
Still, he said, it's a wild distortion to claim that the United States has offered Hamas $900 million. First of all, most of the $900 million is going to the West Bank, not Gaza. And while some of the humanitarian aid disbursed through U.N. and other nongovernmental agencies could ""bleed out"" to Hamas unintentionally, that's far different from giving money directly to Hamas.
 
Not only that, but the claim that the money would be used to ""rebuild"" Gaza after January's 22-day violent conflict between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas is also misleading. The money to Gaza is for humanitarian aid — food, medicine, repairing damaged infrastructure, removing rubble, etc. It is specifically not for reconstruction, he said, as Israel was concerned that reconstruction money might be used to build tunnels, weapons factories or the like.
 
""I'd give this one a D-minus,"" Cook said of the GOP claim.
 
We agree that it's possible that even with safeguards, some of the humanitarian money could wind up in the hands of Hamas.
 
But when you read the GOP survey, you are left with the impression that the U.S. government intends to write a big, fat $900 million check that says ""Pay to the order of Hamas."" To the contrary, Washington is taking steps to try to specifically make sure none of that money winds up in the hands of Hamas. We also note that only $300 million of the $900 million is even going to Gaza, for humanitarian aid. And the money is specifically not to be used for reconstruction. It is limited to humanitarian aid — food, medicine, that kind of thing. So the GOP is wrong on that point too. We rule the RNC's Hamas claim to be False.

GOP claims Obama has ordered FBI to read Miranda Rights to terrorist detainees captured on the battlefield
","
The Republican National Committee recently put out a questionnaire called the ""2009 Obama Agenda Survey"" in which it asks Republicans to rate their agreement or disagreement with a number of so-called Obama administration positions.
 
But it looks to us more like a push poll, a political technique in which the questions are written in a way that aims to convince the respondent of a particular political position. In other words, they are political statements masquerading as questions.
 
We decided to fact-check two ""questions"" from the survey, and you'll see what we mean.
 
One is the question/statement, ""Do you support the Obama administration’s decision to offer $900 million to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to rebuild Gaza?"" We rate the truth of that one with

another Truth-O-Meter ruling

.
 
But in this item we address this question: ""Are you in favor of FBI agents reading Miranda Rights to high-value terrorist detainees captured on the battlefield as the Obama administration has ordered under the new and little- known 'global justice' initiative?""
 
Implied in the question, of course, is that the Obama administration — in a ""new and little-known 'global justice' initiative"" — is ordering FBI agents to read Miranda Rights to terrorist detainees captured in Afghanistan or Iraq. You know the Miranda Rights: you have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney, etc.
 
The claim was first made by Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., who said that during a congressional trip to Afghanistan in May, he visited Bagram Air Base and sat in on a law enforcement and intelligence officer meeting in which officials talked about a new policy of FBI agents Mirandizing suspected terrorists at U.S. military detention facilities. In an interview with Fox News on June 11, Rogers, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, said soldiers were confused and frustrated by the policy.
 
“Yes, as shocking and unbelievable as it may seem, it is true that under the new administration’s 'Global Justice Initiative,' special agents of the FBI are administering Miranda rights to enemy combatants caught trying to kill American soldiers or our Afghan partners in Afghanistan,"" Rogers said in a June 12 news release.
 
""These terrorist suspects are not accused of a common crime, they are suspected of acts of war against the United States and her allies,"" Rogers stated. ""Miranda rights should not apply for dealing with enemy combatants.""
 
Rogers, a former FBI special agent who served in the U.S. Army, warned that applying criminal law on the battlefield hinders the process of gathering crucial intelligence. ""This could have deadly results for the men and women fighting for America and our Afghan allies,"" he said.
 
FBI and military officials, however, say Rogers is just wrong.
 
""The real rumor yesterday is whether our forces were reading Miranda rights to detainees and the answer to that is no,"" Gen. David Petraeus, the U.S. military's Central Command chief, said on June 12.
 
But according to a story in the

Australian

, Petraeus said the FBI was continuing the practice of reading detainees their rights in a limited number of cases where accused militants would face trials in civilian courts.
 
Those sentiments were echoed in a more detailed June 12 letter sent by FBI director Robert S. Mueller III to U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, and forwarded to Rogers.
 
""Regarding Miranda, there has been no policy change and no blanket instruction issued for FBI agents to Mirandize detainees overseas,"" Mueller wrote. ""For years, FBI agents have been trained to analyze whether Miranda is appropriate to use on a case-by-case basis and to consider providing Miranda warnings if prosecution in the United States may occur. For detainees held in military custody overseas, approval by the Department of Justice is required before Miranda warnings may be given.
 
""There are cases in which FBI agents have provided Miranda warnings to persons captured and held overseas, at Bagram and elsewhere. In those cases, a determination was made that a prosecution in ... court may be in the interest of national security and that providing Miranda warnings ... was therefore desirable to maximize the likelihood that any resulting statements would be admissible at trial. In practice, Miranda warnings have been provided to Bagram detainees in only a small handful of cases out of over 4,000 individuals detained and interrogated by the FBI.""
 
Mueller went on to explain that the ""Global Justice"" proposal is intended to improve collaboration between military and law enforcement officials relative to terrorists overseas. The proposal is still preliminary, he stated, and would ""ensure, when possible that intelligence is gathered in a manner that best preserves future options vis-a-vis the individual terrorist at issue, including gathering evidence in a manner that ensures its integrity in the event a prosecution becomes the most desirable approach. Far from a policy change, the proposal would focus on the best way to manage and deploy interagency teams overseas, train the teams, and provide them forensic support. The proposal has never had any connection to changes in FBI policy on when Miranda warnings should be administered to detainees overseas.""
 
Rogers isn't backing off.


In an interview with CQ Politics, Rogers said everything he saw at Bagram and has been told since is contrary to the assurances he got from Mueller.


Rogers is moving ahead with an amendment to the intelligence authorization bill prohibiting government funds from being used to Mirandize detainees.
 
But back to the ""question"" in the GOP survey, ""Are you in favor of FBI agents reading Miranda Rights to high-value terrorist detainees captured on the battlefield as the Obama administration has ordered under the new and little-known 'global justice' initiative?""
 
This one is a tougher call than it might seem. On the one hand, you have a congressman who says he heard what he heard. And we think that Rogers' history as a former FBI agent and member of the House Intelligence Committee gives him credibility. He knows the lingo.
 
On the other hand, you have the FBI director saying there is no new policy instructing FBI agents to Mirandize detainees overseas. FBI officials acknowledge they have done so on a handful of occasions to preserve evidence in cases that seem likely to go to trial down the road. But they say that's not new policy. And, FBI officials note, they have to clear it with the Department of Justice before they do. And lastly, they say the ""Global Justice"" proposal which seeks more interagency cooperation overseas has never had anything to do with FBI policy on whether or not to Mirandize a detainee overseas.
 
At the least, we can say the GOP question/statement is a bit misleading. It suggests every detainee captured in Afghanistan is read his rights. That has only happened in a small number of cases, and only with Department of Justice approval. And according to the military, that has nothing to do with the Global Justice proposal. And so we rule this one Half True.

Supreme Court nominees got Senate votes with big margins
","
Sen. Lindsey Graham got a few chuckles during the Supreme Court nomination hearing for Judge Sonia Sotomayor.
 
""Now, unless you have a complete meltdown, you're going to get confirmed,"" he said, adding that he didn't expect such a meltdown.
 
Graham, R-S.C., then went on to more philosophical ruminations about how senators decide to vote for or against nominees, citing then-Sen. Barack Obama's reasoning for voting against nominee John Roberts in 2005.
 
""He said something about the 5 percent of the cases that we're all driven by,"" Graham said. ""He said something to the effect, in those difficult cases, the critical ingredient is applied by what is in the judge's heart. Well, I have no way of knowing what is in your heart any more than you have knowing what's in my heart. So that to me is an absurd, dangerous standard."" (Read Obama's full 2005

statement on John Roberts

.)
 
Graham added that it used to be that nominees would be confirmed by large margins, even nominees who had established views on controversial issues.
 
""Now, there was a time when someone like (Antonin) Scalia and (Ruth) Ginsburg got 95-plus votes,"" Graham said. ""If you were confused about where Scalia was coming down as a judge, you shouldn't be voting, any more than if (it was) a mystery about what Justice Ginsburg was going to do in these 5 percent of the cases. That is no mystery.""
 
To be clear, we're not ruling on Graham's philosophy for confirming Supreme Court nominees. But we wondered if the margins were as large as Graham said for the confirmation votes of Justices Scalia and Ginsburg, who represent the conservative and liberal extremes of the court, respectively.
 
It turns out Graham is right. Scalia, who was nominated by President Ronald Reagan, was confirmed by a vote of 98-0 on Sept. 17, 1986. Ginsburg, nominated by President Bill Clinton, was confirmed by a vote of 96-3 on Aug. 3, 1993. (You can browse the votes for

all Supreme Court nominees

on the U.S. Senate Web site.)
 
Graham said he didn't know how he would vote on Sotomayor, and that he would respect senators who didn't feel that they could vote in favor of her. But he also seemed to urge a return to deference for a president's nominee.
 
""President Obama won the election and I will respect that,"" Graham said. ""But when he was here (as a senator), he set in motion a standard, I thought, that was more about seeking the presidency than being fair to the nominee when he said, 'The critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge's heart.' Translated, that means, 'I'm not going to vote against my base, because I'm running for president.' We've got a chance to start over. I hope we'll take that chance.""
 
Graham may be giving Obama too much credit (or blame) by saying Obama ""set in motion"" a standard of voting against nominees based on political leanings. Reagan appointee Robert Bork, for example, lost a 42-58 Senate confirmation vote amid much partisan rancor in 1987. Obama was then a community organizer in Chicago.
 
Here, though, we're checking if Graham was right that Scalia and Ginsburg were confirmed by such large margins. They were. We rate Graham's statement True.

Poll on Sonia Sotomayor support shows even divide
","The day before the Supreme Court nomination hearing for Sonia Sotomayor began, Sen. Jon Kyl said President Barack Obama's nominee was losing the support of the American public. ""It's interesting that I just reviewed the Rasmussen poll, most recent poll about American public opinion about Judge Sotomayor. They oppose her confirmation. Only 37 percent support it,"" the Arizona Republican said during an appearance on  This Week with George Stephanopolous.  Stephanopolous seemed surprised by that, and said he wasn't familiar with the poll. We wanted to check the poll for ourselves and see what it said. The Rasmussen Reports poll was conducted June 29-30, 2009, and was a national survey of 1,000 likely voters. The poll asked this question: ""The United States Senate has the constitutional authority to confirm all Supreme Court nominees. Based upon what you know at this time, should the United States confirm Sonia Sotomayor as a Supreme Court Justice?"" The results were very close. Thirty-seven percent said yes, the Senate should confirm, 39 percent said no, and 23 percent said ""not sure."" And it's important to note that the margin of error on the poll was 3 percentage points. So the 37-39 split is within the margin of error, and could be considered a statistical tie. As a side note, the same poll showed that most respondents expected Sotomayor to be confirmed, with 58 percent saying it was ""very likely"" and another 26 percent saying it was ""somewhat likely."" And a Gallup poll, conducted after the Rasmussen poll but released the day after Kyl made his remarks, found that 53 percent favored Sotomayor's nomination, with 33 percent opposed and 13 percent having no opinion. Kyl specifically cited the Rasmussen poll, though, and he got the number who favored confirmation right. But his comment leaves the impression that a solid majority opposes Sotomayor's nomination.

Ann Coulter wrong about Sotomayor unsigned opinion in Ricci New Haven firefighter case
","Columnist Ann Coulter wrote recently that Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor tried to hide her participation in a controversial race discrimination case involving firefighters in New Haven, Conn.

In a July 1, 2009, column in  Human Events  headlined ""So much for wise Latinas,"" Coulter wrote that ""Sotomayor threw out their lawsuit in a sneaky, unsigned opinion — the judicial equivalent of 'talk to the hand.'""

This part of Coulter's claim is right: The opinion was unsigned. But the truth stops there.

In legal terms, ""unsigned"" means the ruling was ""per curiam,"" or ""for the court"" — simply, that everyone on the panel agreed with the decision and decided to issue a single opinion.

""Generally, an 'unsigned' opinion means the opinion was issued per curiam, meaning no one judge took credit for authoring the opinion, but it represents the opinion of the court,"" Sarah Ricks, a law professor at Rutgers University who has analyzed types of judicial opinions, wrote us in an e-mail interview.

Ricks added that ""it is not unusual for a federal appellate court to issue a per curiam opinion; even the Supreme Court very occasionally issues a per curiam opinion. ... A per curiam opinion does not preclude separate opinions by members of the court but it does represent the reasoning for the judgment of the court.""

Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said that ""unsigned just means that the three judges agree not to have one author, but all three are agreeing to what the opinion says. It is not uncommon and it is not sneaky. All three judges stand behind the opinion, signed or not.""
 
In  Ricci vs. DeStefano,  more than a dozen white firefighters, as well as one Hispanic, sued New Haven, Conn., for discrimination after the city threw out the results of its lieutenant and captain exams because black firefighters performed disproportionately poorly and wouldn't have been promoted.

A federal district court judge found in 2006 that the city was justified. The firefighters appealed, and the case was assigned to a three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that included Sotomayor.

In February 2008, the panel issued a summary order, without comment, upholding the lower court's finding. Another 2nd Circuit judge asked the full appeals court to rehear the case, but the court's other judges declined.

After that, Sotomayor and her two colleagues on the panel, Rosemary Pooler and Robert Sack, issued a new ""per curiam"" order that adopted the lower court's ruling as their own, calling it ""thorough, thoughtful, and well-reasoned.""

They also added two paragraphs expressing sympathy for the firefighters who passed the exam but who were not promoted.

""In this case, the Civil Service Board found itself in the unfortunate position of having no good alternatives,"" they wrote. ""We are not unsympathetic to the (white firefighters') expression of frustration.""   

So Coulter — an attorney who is billed as the ""legal affairs correspondent for  Human Events  — is seriously distorting what the judges did. The term ""unsigned"" has nothing to do with judges trying to duck responsibility for the ruling. The suggestion that appellate court judges could somehow hide their participation is preposterous — the judges' names are on every opinion they issue, unsigned or not.

In fact, their names are right near the top.

So we find Coulter's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECABA4C0>],/factchecks/2009/jul/10/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-wrong-about-sotomayor-unsigned-opinion/
"['Environment', 'National', 'Energy', 'Pundits', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Limbaugh claims the climate bill wasn't written when it came up for a vote
","In Washington, it's not unusual for lawmakers to get as heated about the arcane rules of Congress as they do about the substance of a bill.
 
Such was the case with a plan to slow climate change passed by the House of Representatives on June 26, 2009. Republican lawmakers not only opposed cap-and-trade because they fear it will be too expensive, but they were angry that they'd had only a few hours to vet 300 pages of last-minute changes to the already massive legislation. With such a quick turnaround, ""pages of text were being passed around the speaker's desk by clerks,"" wrote Florida Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite on her party's blog. ""Who knows what we voted on? Members of Congress sure didn't.""
 
Then came this lament from Rush Limbaugh: On the day the House voted on the climate change bill, ""there was not even a copy of the bill in the well of the House, which is standard. It wasn't even written,"" he said during his June 29 radio show.
 
Limbaugh is right on at least one point: It is standard for the reading clerk — you've probably seen them on C-SPAN reciting the text of a bill — to have a copy of the legislation at their desk. So, we found it hard to believe that there was not one complete copy of the cap-and-trade plan in the chamber the day the House passed the bill.
 
But before we can solve the Case of the Missing Bill, we'll need a brief lesson in congressional procedure.
 
Before the House debates a bill, it goes to the chamber's Rules Committee, a group controlled by the majority party that has the important role of deciding which amendments can come up for a vote and how long debate will last. Frequently, the Rules Committee will also adopt last-minute changes to the bill, which can range from minor technical tweaks to big compromises. All those decisions are compiled in one long document — which is called, simply, a rule — and brought to the House floor where it becomes the chamber's first order of business before lawmakers can get to the meat of the legislation. If the rule is adopted, lawmakers have officially agreed to make all those changes to the original version of the bill. The House then takes up the bill itself.
 
The cap-and-trade bill followed this process. After the bill was passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee on May 21, its two lead authors, Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, set out to find enough votes in the full House. In the process, it appears the duo had to cut some deals; for example, one change made farms exempt from the emissions cap. And, not coincidentally, some farm-state lawmakers ultimately backed the bill.

In the early morning of June 26, more than 300 pages of changes were adopted by the Rules Committee. And later in the day, the House voted 217-205 to accept those changes.
 
After that, the chamber got down to debating the newly updated bill, and that's when the controversy over the missing copies began.
 
""Is there somewhere physically in the House of Representatives a copy of what we are voting on?"" asked Joe Barton, who is the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee.
 
""My inquiry is how do I get a copy of the other 300 pages that people here on the floor haven’t had a chance to read or see? Where do we get that before we slam this and cram this down on the American people?"" echoed Louie Gohmert of Texas.
 
Markey came to the floor to reassure Barton and Gohmert that they could find the latest changes on the Rules Committee Web site. And besides, they had just voted on the new language and it could be found at the reader's desk, Markey said.
 
But Gohmert wasn't satisfied. Here's an excerpt from the  Congressional Record  of his conversation with the the speaker pro tempore, the House member who then had the rotating duty of running the House:

GOHMERT. My parliamentary inquiry, I was just at the dais and the clerks, as always, were immensely helpful. But apparently the official copy of the 1,090 pages are there, and then the additional 300 pages are sitting beside it, and the clerk is having to go through and is in the process as we speak of going through and figuring out where the extra 300 pages that has been added goes in the official copy. So even as I speak, Madam Speaker, the official copy is not truly an official copy because it doesn’t have all of the amendments in it. And since the rule says there is an official copy at the desk, my inquiry is whether it is truly an official copy if it, as yet, does not have all of the pages in the official copy.
 
SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: The clerk is currently executing the order of the House in House Resolution 587.

GOHMERT. Right, to put the extra pages into the official copy. But is it required that it actually be a full official copy put together before you satisfy the requirement of having an official copy at the desk?

SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: The two components of the official copy are there together, so it is, in effect, the official copy.

GOHMERT: So the two together in two different piles that are being worked out together is the official copy.

In theory, House leadership could have called a recess to meld the 1,090 pages of the original bill with the more than 300 pages of changes as Gohmert and Barton wanted. But the leadership did not.

So to determine if Limbaugh is correct, we have to decide if two stacks of paper at the reading desk instead of one mean the bill was not on the House floor.

We went to House Parliamentarian John Sullivan, the guru of all things having to do with chamber procedure. He's been advising members on their rules since 2004.

""It's not true,"" he said of Limbaugh's claim. ""Obviously 'the' copy of the bill was at the reading clerk's desk the entire time. ... All the ingredients that made the final bill were at the desk,"" he said.

In fact, it's not at all unusual for pages of legislation to be in flux during debate, Sullivan said. For example, as amendments are adopted on the House floor, someone literally sits at the front of the chamber, adding or subtracting language in a bill. And it's a time-tested tactic for the minority to complain that the majority has rushed a bill through and not given members enough time to read it.
 
Limbaugh claimed that ""there was not even a copy of the bill in the well of the House. . . . It wasn't even written."" And indeed, it's clear from the  Congressional Record  that many lawmakers were frustrated that the copy at the desk consisted of two parts: the original bill and a second part that included changes that were compiled by the Rules Committee and adopted by the entire chamber. So in that sense, there is some truth to Limbaugh's claim that the bill ""wasn't even written.""

But the  Congressional Record  and our interview with the parliamentarian show that Limbaugh is wrong to say that there was no copy of the bill in the chamber during the vote. As Sullivan said, every component of the final version was in the chamber from the start, available for members to read. The final House bill, the one that was sent to the Senate on July 6, included all those changes; two documents effectively became one. So we give Limbaugh a Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB93E00>],/factchecks/2009/jul/09/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-claims-climate-bill-wasnt-written-when-it/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Stimulus', 'Eric Cantor']","
Cantor and other Republicans say Obama promised stimulus would keep unemployment rates below 8 percent
","With unemployment rates continuing to rise nearly five months after the economic stimulus plan was passed, House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said the Obama-backed plan is a bust. ""Clearly the stimulus or so-called stimulus plan that spent almost $800 billion dollars has not worked,"" Cantor said in a PBS interview on July 8, 2009. ""We were promised, the president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent. We're now over 9.5 percent, on our way to 10 percent."" The claim that the Obama administration ""promised"" the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent is a popular talking point among Republican critics of the stimulus. We've heard it from House Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, Reps. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., as well as conservative talk show host Sean Hannity, to name a few. They all called it a ""promise."" They are referring to a Jan. 9, 2009, report called ""The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan"" from Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create between three and four million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also includes a graphic predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. But in June, the unemployment rate was 9.5 percent. In the past week, the administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong. Here's what Romer herself said in a July 2 interview on Fox: ""None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated. What the private forecasters are saying now is that they do anticipate that the economy will start growing again in the second half of the year, and that usually, then, employment and unemployment start to respond shortly after that. So I think that is a realistic expectation."" Biden also acknowledged the discrepancies in a July 5 interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. ""The truth is, we and everyone else misread the economy,"" Biden said. ""The figures we worked off of in January were the consensus figures in most of the blue chip indexes out there. ... And so the truth is, there was a misreading of just how bad an economy we inherited. Now, that doesn't — I'm not laying — it's now our responsibility. So the second question becomes, did the economic package we put in place, including the Recovery Act, is it the right package given the circumstances we're in? And we believe it is the right package given the circumstances we're in."" Stephanopoulos correctly noted that projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office at the time were slightly less optimistic than the administration's. In January, the CBO projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus. In a White House news conference on June 8, 2009, Bernstein, the co-author of the February projections, said they were off because the fourth-quarter economic numbers weren't available at the time. When they were released a short time later, they revealed the economy was in more dire shape than economists realized. Bernstein maintained in that June news conference that the stimulus is working, and that without it, the unemployment rate would be even worse. The debate about the numbers comes from the inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. How can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate gets to X percent, it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus? The same holds true for Republicans who say the rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus isn't working. Again, it's difficult to empirically prove whether they're right or wrong. We're certainly not going to try here. What we can rule on, however, is whether the Obama administration ""promised"" that unemployment rates would not rise above 8 percent if the stimulus were passed. We could find no instance of anyone in the administration directly making such a public pledge. What we saw from the administration in January was a projection, not a promise. And it was a projection that came with heavy disclaimers. ""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,"" the report states. ""There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity."" There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart that states: ""Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action."" That sure doesn't sound like a full-fledged promise to us. We think it's a big stretch to call an economic projection a ""promise."" The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had ""significant margins of error"" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity."" And so we rule the statement by Cantor — and other Republicans who have said the same thing — Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAB8040>],/factchecks/2009/jul/09/eric-cantor/Cantor-and-other-republicans-say-obama-promised-s/

Obama's wrong on oil imports
","
In an interview with

Novaya Gazeta

, a Russian newspaper, President Barack Obama was asked what caused the economic crisis. Obama answered that oil imports were partly to blame.

 

""Our economy did not fall into decline overnight,"" he said in the July 6, 2009, interview. ""We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. Yet we import more oil today than ever before.""

 

Obama said the same thing on February 24, 2009, during his first address to Congress.

 

At first, it sounded plausible to us that the United States would be importing more oil these days. But as our friends at FactCheck.org

first pointed out

, crude oil and petroleum imports have actually declined in recent years after peaking in 2005 and 2006. FactCheck cites the Energy Information Administration, a branch of government that keeps an enormous database of all things energy-related, and we confirmed it on the EIA's Web site.

 

In two decades, imported oil will be down by about 20 percent, according to a March 2009 EIA report.

 

And in April 2009, the American Petroleum Institute said that imports have fallen to their lowest levels in three years.

 

The reason?

 

""The big one is the decline in consumption,"" said Ron Planting, an economist with the API, a trade group representing oil and natural gas companies. ""Our figures through May are that domestic consumption has declined 4.7 percent from a year ago.""

 

Through 2008, high gas prices spurred the decline, he said. Now, it's the recession.

 

The proliferation of gasoline-ethanol blends and a 4.4 percent increase in domestic oil production have also contributed, Planting said.


So Obama needs to check his figures. Twice this year, he has said that oil imports are higher than ever, but studies by the government and the energy industry show that's not true. As a result, we give Obama a False.
