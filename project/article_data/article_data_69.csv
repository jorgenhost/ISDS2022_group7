Karl Rove and Juan Williams argue over Loretta Lynch confirmation
","This past week, President Barack Obama pressured Senate Republicans to schedule a vote to confirm his nominee for attorney general, Loretta Lynch. But the confirmation is stuck behind a stalled anti-human trafficking bill. The bipartisan bill hit an unexpected road bump in March when Senate Democrats accused Republicans of sneaking in a provision that restricts federal spending on abortions, while Republicans accused them of not reading the bill thoroughly. The issue resurfaced on the Sunday talk shows April 19, since Republicans have said they would not confirm Lynch until the human trafficking bill passes. By and large, the Republicans want the abortion spending restrictions, and Democrats don't. ""The Republicans hid this language,"" said Fox News Sunday pundit Juan Williams of the abortion provision. ""The language was in the bill,"" responded Republican strategist Karl Rove, after some crosstalk. ""The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it."" Because the question about the origins of the anti-abortion provision have re-emerged, we wanted to take a look into Rove’s statement that the language was in there, and that a Democratic sponsor knew about it. The Hyde Amendment So what is an anti-abortion rule doing in a bill designed to increase compensation for human trafficking victims and to raise consequences for the traffickers? The provision is called the Hyde Amendment, which first passed about 40 years ago and is named after the original sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. The amendment bars federal funding for most abortions. Lawmakers have worked it into many pieces of legislation, including every appropriations bill since 1976, to explicitly prevent those funds from going toward abortions. So the trafficking bill’s Republican authors worked in a reference to the Hyde Amendment into the bill. The bill doesn’t plainly say anything about abortion or the Hyde Amendment. Rather it says, ""Amounts in the Fund, or otherwise transferred from the Fund, shall be subject to the limitations on the use or expending of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014."" (Those sections of the appropriations act are Hyde limitations.) But Senate Democrats didn’t notice that this was in the bill until after the Senate Judiciary Committee passed it unanimously in late February. The Democrats accused the Republicans of hoodwinking them. The Senate debated a version of the bill last year, and that version did not include Hyde Amendment language, and they said Republicans didn’t let them know about the change. In January, a Republican Judiciary Committee staffer emailed the Democratic counterpart a summary of changes, but the list did not mention the addition of the abortion language, according to the Washington Post. So who was Rove referring to when he said, ""The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it""? A spokesperson for Rove told us he was referring to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a member of the Judiciary Committee and one of the original cosponsors of the bill. Klobuchar’s office released a statement on March 18 saying that a staffer in Klobuchar’s office had known about the insertion of the Hyde Amendment before the Senate Judiciary Committee vote but ""did not inform the senator."" ""The senator was not aware that the provision was included"" when she voted for the bill in committee, the statement said. So, yes, Klobuchar’s office says a staffer knew the measure was in the bill. And Klobuchar did vote for it. But Rove is pushing things by linking the two events so closely together. There is no evidence Klobuchar knew the measure was in the bill and voted for it anyway -- which is what you might interpret Rove’s statement to mean. And Klobuchar has voted to block a final vote on the bill since the provision became widely known. We asked a couple legislative experts if the Democrats’ claim that they were hoodwinked passed muster, and they said both parties are to blame. The Democrats didn’t do their due diligence in thoroughly reading the bill, but the Republicans weren’t as upfront as they could have been in regards to adding in the Hyde language, said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""Really, this is bad staff work all around,"" said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. Our ruling Rove said the Hyde Amendment ""language was in the bill. The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it."" The abortion language was indeed in the human trafficking bill considered this year, though it was not in a similar bill considered last year. A Democratic staffer was aware it was in the bill, but that message wasn’t conveyed up the food chain. The only flaw in Rove’s statement is the suggestion that the Democratic sponsor, Klobuchar knew about the language and voted for it anyway. There is no evidence of that. Rove’s statement needs that clarifying detail. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C244EC0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/19/karl-rove/karl-rove-and-juan-williams-argue-over-loretta-lyn/

R.I. HHS Secretary Elizabeth Roberts says more than 30 percent of state tax dollars goes to Medicaid
","The Raimondo administration wants to see more efficiency when it comes to spending on Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that provides health insurance to the very poor and people with disabilities. Roughly every dollar spent by the state is matched by the federal government. During a March 2, 2015, presentation to the Reinventing Medicaid Working Group, the state's secretary for health and human services, Elizabeth Roberts, displayed a slide which said that nearly a third of all state tax dollars goes to Medicaid. ""More than 30 cents of every state tax dollar goes to Medicaid,"" the slide said. It also contained a pie chart in which Medicaid is shown eating up 31.5 percent of those tax dollars. The slide lists the source as the state budget for the 2013 fiscal year. But on March 31, 2015, groups that want to create a single-payer health insurance system in the state challenged that statistic and others being used by the Raimondo administration in its push for Medicaid reform. The Rhode Island chapters of Physicians for a National Health Program and HealthCare Now said the actual percentage isn't 31.5 for fiscal 2013, but closer to 22. We decided to see who was correct. Because Roberts specifically mentioned ""state tax dollars,"" for this fact check, we will only look at general revenue funds raised by the state, not federal funds shared with the state or restricted funds. When we contacted Roberts' office, spokesman Michael Raia said the source of the information was listed incorrectly. The 31.5 percent is based on the current fiscal year of 2015. According to data from the House Finance committee, this year the state is slated to spend $1.084 billion of its unrestricted money on Medicaid. That's 31.5 percent of the $3.445 billion in general revenue funds. (The state budget enacted that year totaled $8.78 billion, including restricted revenue and federal money for Medicaid and other things.) That made us curious. What were the numbers in 2013, the year cited incorrectly by Roberts? The Rhode Island Health Care Association, one of the groups questioning the numbers, referred us to the executive summary of Gov. Lincoln Chafee's budget for the 2015 fiscal year. Page A-5 listed $3.216 billion in general revenue for that year and page 71 of the budget's technical appendix says the Office of Health and Human Services (OHHS) actually received $772 million from the general fund. That would be 24 percent, close to what the critics claimed. But in the 2013 enacted budget, 20 percent of the state's Medicaid money was spent by other departments, including Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals (BHDDH) and the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF). That makes the 24 percent too low. When all of the state’s spending for Medicaid out of its general revenues is accounted for, the percentage comes out to around 31 percent. Our ruling Roberts said more than 30 cents of every state tax dollar goes to Medicaid. She cited a specific percentage of 31.5 percent and said it came from the 2013 fiscal year. It's actually from the 2015 fiscal year. But the percentage from 2013 is very close to that. Roberts may have gotten the source year wrong, but it turns out that either year produces the same result. We rate her statement as True.

Judicial Watch says ISIS operating a camp in Mexico--near El Paso
","A conservative watchdog group just declared terrorists active in Syria and Iraq and other parts of the Middle East also have a camp in Mexico--just a few miles from El Paso. In a six-paragraph web post, ""ISIS Camp a Few Miles from Texas, Mexican Authorities Confirm,"" Judicial Watch said that according to anonymous sources including a Mexican Army ""field grade officer and Mexican Federal Police inspector,"" ISIS is operating a camp around eight miles from the U.S. border in an area known as Anapra just west of Ciudad Juárez, which adjoins El Paso. Its April 14, 2015 post quoted the ""same knowledgeable sources"" confirming another ISIS cell to the west of Ciudad Juárez,  targeting the New Mexico towns of Columbus and Deming. Scary stuff if so. Similar claims not substantiated We’ve found a lack of substance to similar claims. In September 2014, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C. found no independent or law-enforcement corroboration of a statement that ""ISIS is present in Ciudad Juárez."" National security experts advised it’s unlikely ISIS would operate in Mexico and stage an attack by crossing the border. The next month, we rated Pants on Fire a congressman’s claim that at least 10 ISIS fighters had been caught in Texas after coming across the border and there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."" When we inquired, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, called the claim ""categorically false."" By email, Catron said the department ""continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border."" Judicial Watch: Identifying sources ‘would get them killed’ For this fact check, we asked Judicial Watch, an educational foundation that says it focuses on ensuring political and judicial officials do not abuse their powers, to elaborate on its post. By phone, Christopher Farrell, its director of investigations and research, told us the web post did not identify the two key sources because neither one was authorized to speak on the record and identifying them ""would get them killed."" Other authorities, government agencies see no fire Separately, we asked security experts about the claim. Daniel Byman, a Georgetown University professor, emailed: ""It's hard for me to say there definitely isn't something there, though I'd be very surprised if this were true. You'd want someone from FBI or DHS to confirm/deny."" We tried that tack; agencies signaled skepticism. Homeland Security’s Catron referred us to the National Security Council whose spokesman, Alistair Baskey, said by email: ""There is no indication that this claim has any validity to it."" Meantime, an FBI spokesman left a voice message with us responding to our inquiry. El Paso-based Michael Martinez said: ""As far as we’re concerned, there is no credible information to support that."" We also called Mexico’s embassy in Washington, D.C. By email, the embassy’s press office provided a denial evidently prepared the day Judicial Watch made its post: ""The government of Mexico dismisses and categorically denies each of the statements made today by the organization Judicial Watch on the alleged presence of ISIS's operating cells throughout the border region, particularly at Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua - El Paso, Texas."" The embassy said ""relevant authorities operating in the region have also confirmed the nonexistence of these activities with their U.S. counterparts, with whom they will continue to work closely and to exchange information at our common border."" Texas Department of Public Safety: 'No credible information' In Texas, we reached Tom Vinger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, who said by email the agency ""has no credible information to corroborate or validate this story."" We were struck by the reaction of Monica Varela, a public information officer for the El Paso County sheriff’s office. After we summarized the Judicial Watch conclusion there’s an ISIS camp in Mexico near El Paso, Varela said by phone: ""Holy Jesus Christ."" Later, Chris Acosta, the department’s public affairs director, said by email the department couldn’t provide relevant information; after all, its deputies don’t patrol the Mexico side of the border. Also in El Paso, Victor Manjarrez, a former longtime U.S. Border Patrol official and associate director of the National Center for Border Security & Immigration at the University of Texas at El Paso, told us he didn’t find the Judicial Watch item believable -- in part because the described location of the camp is a suburb of Ciudad Juárez that’s modern by Mexican standards. Generally, Manjarrez said by phone, the group’s statement is ""really silly."" Judical Watch stands by its post We shared what we’d gathered with Judicial Watch. By phone, Farrell said the center stands by its item. He questioned the credibility of Manjarrez, who he described as retiring from the Border Patrol under a cloud. ""He may not be the most authoritative expert,"" Farrell said. Manjarrez later said by phone he went to court in connection with his retirement to make sure he was fully paid for his service and ended up happy with the outcome; he said he also signed a nondisclosure agreement. Our ruling Judicial Watch said it confirmed ISIS has a camp in Mexico a few miles from El Paso. U.S., Mexico and Texas officials told us they had no information to validate or corroborate this bombshell. Lacking any on-the-record indication of the claim's accuracy, we rate it False.

Meme compares spending on undocumented immigrants with typical U.S. family income
","Is President Barack Obama lavishing almost five times as much money on undocumented immigrant children than the typical household earns in a month? A meme making the rounds on social media says that’s the case. The meme, forwarded to us by a reader, was created by ForAmerica, a conservative group founded by longtime activist L. Brent Bozell III. The meme says: ""American families work hard to earn $4,250 a month. Obama is spending $18,972 a month on each illegal immigrant child. Like if you're sick of Obama rewarding illegal immigrants."" The visual that accompanies this text contrasts an ""American family"" looking sadly at a small pile of dollars, while Obama grins at a much larger pile. By April 17, 2015, the meme had attracted more than 90,000 likes and had been shared more than 25,000 times. Taken literally, that would mean that the government is giving every undocumented immigrant child $228,000 every year, which would seem to be a ridiculously large amount. It would also mean a total cost of $228 billion when applied to the estimated 1 million unauthorized immigrant children in the United States. Such figures made us skeptical. We had previously reported that all direct federal spending on minors totaled roughly $300 billion -- for the benefit of all 75 million or so Americans under 19. So we decided to take a closer look. Looking at the data We reached out to a public-relations firm representing ForAmerica, and they provided us with the data to back up their claim. The $18,972-a-month figure comes from what it cost the federal government to address a surge of tens of thousands of children from Central America for four months in 2014. This is an important piece of context that the meme doesn’t make clear. We’ll get to several problems with the meme’s dollar comparisons in a moment, but first, we’ll briefly summarize what the numbers refer to. The figures were reported in a Sept. 9, 2014, Department of Health and Human Services response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the conservative investigative group Judicial Watch. The documents detail the contracts between the federal government and a group called Baptist Child and Family Services to take care of the children who showed up on the border. The group agreed to provide 1,200 beds at each of two sites -- the former Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas (for $77.9 million) and Fort Sill, in Oklahoma (for $104.2 million). The grand total of $182.1 million covered housing, medical care, and educational and recreational activities, including staff pay and benefits, food, clothing, utilities and linens, for four months, from May to September 2014. In putting together its meme, ForAmerica divided $182.1 million by four months to get the cost per month, then divided by 2,400 to get the monthly cost per child being cared for. That’s how the group arrived at the $18,972 figure cited in the meme. Meanwhile, the family income figure is on target. As we noted in a recent fact-check, the median family income in 2013 was $51,939, which works out to $4,328 a month -- not far off from what the meme said. What’s missing from the comparison So the meme’s numbers have a basis in fact. Where the meme is more problematic is in its comparison of the two. The most reasonable argument for making this comparison is simply to provide a context for understanding how much money was being spent to care for the unexpected influx of unaccompanied minors. We think most readers will agree that spending $18,972 to house and feed a child for a month is a significant sum, and one way to explain how big that is would be to compare it to what a typical family earns per month. But the meme’s text and visuals go well beyond that. For instance: • The meme fails to make clear that these expenditures are for a specific and limited subset of undocumented children. The meme says the government is spending $18,972 a month on ""each illegal immigrant child."" Yet it doesn’t clarify that this money is being spent only on children who were being housed at those facilities -- who represent a small fraction of the roughly 1 million undocumented immigrant children in the United States. Not including that qualifier is significantly misleading. • The framing and imagery of the meme could lead readers to believe that Obama is paying undocumented immigrants directly. The dollar figures cited are not equivalent, even though both are punctuated visually by piles of dollar bills. The figure for families refers to the dollars they earn and can spend as they wish, but the figure for undocumented immigrants refers to the money paid to a contractor on their behalf. It’s not money the individual immigrant can pocket. • The meme implies that this high rate of spending is ongoing. The meme says that ""Obama is spending"" that amount -- present tense. But the data covers a specific period that ended in September 2014, and it’s unclear how much the government is spending for that purpose now. (We have asked HHS for that information and will update this item if we receive it.) Our ruling The meme said that ""American families work hard to earn $4,250 a month. Obama is spending $18,972 a month on each illegal immigrant child."" The numbers cited by the meme are rooted in reality, but the comparison is framed in a misleading way. The sum of money cited has been allotted to a small fraction of all undocumented immigrant children in the United States, and it isn’t going into their pockets as family earnings are. It’s also unclear whether this high rate of spending has continued to today. The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B02140>],/factchecks/2015/apr/17/america/meme-compares-spending-undocumented-immigrants-typ/

New Wisconsin utility regulator says volcanos worse than cars for greenhouse gas
","Questions about climate change shouldn’t have been a surprise at the confirmation hearing for Michael Huebsch to join the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. After all, the state agency regulates electricity prices, power plant construction and the development of wind and solar power. All play a role in the amount of carbon emissions that utilities generate in Wisconsin. Huebsch, a former Republican state lawmaker, served as secretary of the Department of Administration under Gov. Scott Walker, who appointed him to the PSC. The question came up during the end of Huebsch’s April 7, 2015 appearance before the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy. State Sen. Mark Miller (D-Monona) asked Huebsch for his views about ""whether or not our activities in terms of energy generation are contributing to climate change?"" Huebsch responded that humans have can have an impact on climate change, but said he didn’t believe it is ""anywhere near the level of impact of just the natural progression of our planet."" He added: ""You know, the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding."" That one, well, erupted on social media. Critics questioned the science behind the claim, which has been repeated numerous times by those who do not believe human activity is causing the planet to warm. When we asked Huebsch for his evidence, he responded by forwarding us an email he had sent to Miller after the hearing. ""I answered a question you put to me inaccurately and I want to set the record straight,"" Huebsch wrote. ""To your question regarding global climate change I indicated global volcanic activity can equal the emission output by the automobiles in the United States. That is inaccurate and I apologize for the error."" He added: ""While the scientific community recognizes the natural impact on climate change due to carbon (CO2)and sulfur (SO2) emissions from volcanic activity, those emissions do not equate to the annual emissions from United States automobiles and other fossil fuel based transportation. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused."" Oh. All that said, let’s take a closer look the comparison. Volcanoes: A frequently cited 2011 report by Terrance Gerlach, a volcano expert with the United States Geological Survey, compared carbon emissions from volcanoes and all human activity -- not just motor vehicles. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 was one of the largest ever recorded. That event sent about 0.05 gigatons into the atmosphere. Vehicles: According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Gerlach’s report says that vehicles worldwide contributed 3 gigatons a year in greenhouse gases. The EPA estimate puts the U.S. share of that at just under 2 gigatons. By either measure, that’s far, far more that a volcanic eruption. The Gerlach report contained this conclusion: ""Do the Earth’s volcanoes emit more CO2 than human activities? Research findings indicate that the answer to this frequently asked question is a clear and unequivocal, ‘No.’"" Our rating Huebsch, the latest appointee to the agency that regulates utilities in Wisconsin, testified that ""the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding."" When we asked about his comments, Huebsch issued an email saying his answer to the climate change question was wrong, and apologized. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3CC600>],/factchecks/2015/apr/17/mike-huebsch/new-wisconsin-utility-regulator-says-volcanos-wors/
"['Elections', 'Legal Issues', 'PunditFact', ""Lawrence O'Donnell""]","
Can the president and the vice president be from the same state?
","The links between Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have some talking about a Bush/Rubio ticket in 2016. But is it even possible? The day after Rubio announced he was running for president, liberal MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell was already looking ahead to what happens if Rubio’s campaign falls short. ""Marco Rubio looks like one of the best possible vice presidential candidates in the Republican field,"" O’Donnell said on his show on April 14, 2015. ""But the one person who can’t choose him is Jeb Bush, because the president and vice president can't be from the same state."" While we're still waiting for Bush to make his candidacy official, O'Donnell's claim that ""the president and vice president can't be from the same state,"" got our heads spinning. If correct, that would rule out a Florida ticket of Bush/Rubio, or a Texas ticket of Rick Perry and Ted Cruz for that matter, or any combination that includes Bush, Rubio and two other Florida residents and possible contenders -- Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee. So is it true? The answer is no. Neither the Constitution nor the Electoral College prevents Bush from picking a fellow Floridian or any candidate from choosing a running mate from the same state. It just might make things tricky, depending on the situation.  We'll explain the why and how.  What the Constitution has to say about electing presidents While registered voters select their preferred candidate for president, the actual electing of the president and vice president is in the hands of the Electoral College. There are 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Candidates need a majority, 270, to win. Those electors cast a separate vote for president and vice president. But that wasn't always the case. From 1789-1804, Electoral College members got to vote for two men (and back then, it was only men). The top vote-getter became president and the second-place winner became vice president. There was one caveat. Electoral College voters, called electors, could not cast both of their votes for two people from their home state. In plainspeak, an Electoral College member from Maryland couldn’t cast his two votes for candidates from Maryland. Electors from any other state could still vote for two Maryland representatives, just not the electors from Maryland. The idea behind the restriction was to dilute the power of the big states and to encourage electors to look beyond their political allies. Here’s the text from Article II of the Constitution: ""The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves."" In 1804, the Twelfth Amendment altered the Electoral College process and created a separate ballot for vice president. But the rule of not being able to use both votes on a person from an elector's home state remained in effect. What does it all mean? Let's use the Bush/Rubio hypothetical. Bush could choose Rubio to be his running mate. And if the two won, Florida's 29 electors could vote to make Bush president, but not to make Rubio vice president (or vice versa). If Bush and Rubio started with 299 electoral votes or more, that wouldn't matter and Rubio would still be vice president. But if the election were close, things would get complicated. This is how it gets complicated We don't have to look too far back to find an example of how this could play out. ""We actually flirted with the problem in the 2000 election where both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney had called Texas home in the runup to the nomination,"" said Robert Bennett, a law professor at Northwestern University and the author of Taming the Electoral College. Cheney sidestepped the issue by registering to vote in Wyoming, the state he once represented in the House. It's good he did. Bush/Cheney wound up with 271 electoral votes. Take away Texas' 32 electoral votes from Cheney's tally and he wouldn't have hit the required 270. Here’s how the 2000 map looked:  So what would have happened if Cheney stayed a Texas resident? And what could happen with Bush and Rubio (or another same-state pair)? There are few scenarios.  One possible scenario is the Electoral College would vote to elect the new president but not elect the vice president. In that case, the election of the next vice president would become the work of the U.S. Senate, where each senator would get one vote. If that vote is miraculously tied -- well, we’re not sure what would happen next. Some people say the sitting vice president might get to break the tie. Others note that the vice president is not a senator, which is the process spelled out in the Twelfth Amendment. (Imagine if Joe Biden got to vote for himself to break a tie in 2012.) Another possible scenario is that the Electoral College would vote to elect a new vice president and not a president. In this case, the U.S. House of Representatives would break that deadlock, with members of each state casting a single vote. A majority wins. In the case of Bush/Cheney, it never got that far. In the Bush/Rubio exercise, the fact that Republicans control the Senate and House (and a majority of the state delegations) improves their odds of prevailing. But it's definitely a risk. John Harrison, a leading constitutional scholar at the University of Virginia School of Law, offered another hypothetical option looking ahead to 2016. ""The Florida Republican Party might seek an amendment to Florida law so that non-Floridians could serve as electors, and nominate a slate of, say, Georgians, who could come down for the day in December when the electors give their vote,"" Harrison suggested. Harrison added that the Constitution is silent about whether electors must come from the state that appoints them. Harrison acknowledges that this question could be argued (in court) either way. Our ruling O’Donnell said the president and vice president can't be from the same state. That’s incorrect, there is no law or regulation preventing a ticket from coming from the same state. All the Constitution does is prevent electors in the Electoral College from voting for a president and vice president who are both from their home state. In many elections, that actually wouldn't matter. President Barack Obama could have picked a running mate from Illinois in 2008 and 2012 with no ill effect. Ditto for Bill Clinton's victories in 1992 and 1996, George H.W. Bush's 1988 win and Ronald Reagan's victories in 1980 and 1984. But in a close election, the Electoral College quirk could matter (as well as the hoops people might try to work around it). That makes the possibility of an all Florida ticket risky, but not illegal or impossible. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1CE4C0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/16/lawrence-odonnell/president-vice-president-same-state-allowed/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Hillary Clinton']","
In Iowa, Hillary Clinton claims 'all my grandparents' came to the U.S. from foreign countries
","Hillary Clinton this week became the latest example of a politician flubbing her family’s ancestry while making the case for her presidency. Clinton was speaking at a business roundtable inside an Iowa produce store when she related her personal family heritage to the struggles of undocumented immigrants trying to work in the United States. ""I think if we were to just go around this room, there are a lot of immigrant stories,"" Clinton said, according to a video of the event. ""All my grandparents, you know, came over here, and you know my grandfather went to work in a lace mill in Scranton, Pa., and worked there until he retired at 65. He started there when he was a teenager and just kept going. So I sit here and I think well you’re talking about the second, third generation. That’s me, that’s you."" BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kaczynski quickly pointed out that Clinton was wrong, primarily using census and military records from Ancestry.com. An unidentified Clinton spokesman admitted the error in a statement to BuzzFeed, saying Clinton’s ""grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and, as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants."" While it’s clear Clinton is incorrect, and why her claim rates False on the Truth-O-Meter, we wanted to provide as much context as possible to this claim. Megan Smolenyak, a ""genealogical adventurer and storyteller"" who recently examined Clinton’s Welsh roots, can see where the campaign is coming from. Seven of Clinton’s eight great-grandparents were born overseas into working-class families. Clinton’s paternal grandfather, Hugh Rodham Sr., was born in England, but her three other grandparents were born in the United States. Hugh Rodham’s wife, Hanna (also Hannah) Jones Rodham, was born in Scranton, Pa., to Welsh parents a couple years after they emigrated. Census, civil and military records show Clinton’s maternal grandparents, Della and Edwin Howell, were born in Illinois. (Della’s mother was the one great-grandparent born in the United States.) Even though three of Clinton’s grandparents were born in the United States, Smolenyak said they probably strongly identified with their immigrant parents and older siblings, and she considers Clinton’s ancestors more ""off the boat"" than most politicians. Clinton is not the first person, famous or not, to potentially confuse family lore with the cold facts of her roots. Her misfire follows the misinterpreted family trees of U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio, who wrongly said his parents were Cuban exiles, and Elizabeth Warren, who claimed American Indian heritage while working as a Harvard professor. ""We hold politicians to higher standards for accuracy in their family histories than we do genealogists and historians,"" Smolenyak said. ""Your Great Aunt Tilly tells you something, and you believe it."" Finding Hanna Jones Again, it is clear Clinton was wrong when she said ""all my grandparents"" immigrated to America. But Smolenyak recently upended the real story about one-quarter of Clinton’s roots. A few months ago, Smolenyak started researching Clinton’s Celtic connections for Irish America magazine. She was not expecting to find anything new in the well-documented background of a high-profile American, but she wrapped her investigation with a ""wake-up call"" for genealogists. Researchers had made critical mistakes in the background of Clinton’s paternal grandmother, Hanna Jones Rodham (born in Scranton), she found. At the beginning, Smolenyak knew she needed to search for records with names spanning all kinds of possibilities, as Jones is a common name in Wales , and a woman named Hanna could go by several names, including Annie, Anna, Hanna, Honora or Nora. (Americans weren’t as picky about the spelling of their names and records retention back then, she said.) Census records show two women born in the early 1880s in Lackawanna County, Pa., named Hanna (or Hannah) Jones. But researchers chose the wrong Hanna Jones and ran with it, wrongly assigning Hillary Clinton’s roots to that woman’s parents and creating a false echo chamber (PolitiFact can relate to the frustration). The wrong Hanna Jones, born in 1883, had a readily accessible birth record, but the right one, born in 1882, did not. Smolenyak confirmed the real Hanna Jones, Clinton’s grandmother, by picking up clues from records over time. A low-key marriage announcement in the Aug. 9, 1902, edition of the Scranton Times-Tribune offered potential proof that Jones and Hugh Rodham eloped in a nearby New York town where marriage had fewer restrictions: Ms. Anna Jones, of Brick avenue, was quietly wedded to Hugh Rodham, of Park place, at Binghamton, Memorial Day. Mr. and Mrs. Rodham will make their residence with the bride’s parents on Brick avenue. From there she could find out more information about the Joneses who lived on Brick in Scranton and match up what she knew about Hanna with other records about the family. Census records from 1910, 1920 and 1930 say Hanna (and also Hannah) Jones was born in Pennsylvania while her husband was born in England. Her parents are listed as born in Wales. PolitiFact found an unfinished application for a 1937 marriage license from Clinton’s father, Hugh E. Rodham, that lists the birthplace of both of his parents, Hugh Sr. in England and Hannah in Scranton. Interestingly, the marriage license does not list Hugh Jr.’s eventual wife and Hillary’s mother, Dorothy Howell, but another woman whom he did not marry, Catherine Meisinger. Our ruling Talking about immigration in Iowa, Clinton said, ""All my grandparents, you know, came over here."" It’s very clear from the evidence that not all of Hillary Clinton’s grandparents were immigrants. In fact, only one was. It’s possible she misspoke, but it doesn’t make her comment more accurate. We rate her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809749E340>],/factchecks/2015/apr/16/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-flubs-familys-immigration-history-/

Jeb Bush correct that median income has fallen in U.S. since end of recession
","Jeb Bush is making economic opportunity a major theme of his not-yet-official presidential campaign. One of his main gripes with the economy is that income isn’t going up. ""If we grew at a far faster rate, the middle would no longer be as squeezed as they are,"" Bush said. ""We are in the sixth year of recovery, and median income is below what it was at the start of the recovery."" Bush, the former Republican governor of Florida, made the remarks during a recent visit to Ohio, where he talked with Pittsburgh Tribune-Review political writer Salena Zito before addressing the Ohio Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting. (Zito paraphrased part of Bush’s quote in her article, but she provided us with the full text of Bush’s comment.) We knew that the national employment picture has improved, slowly but surely, since the official end of the recession in mid 2009. But has the typical household income in the United States really fallen since the end of the recession? If true, that would be pretty startling. As it turns out, median income has fallen, once you take inflation into account. Here are the details. In September 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau published its annual roundup of data on income and poverty. Table A-2 in the report provides data on the inflation-adjusted, median household income for the most recent 10 years:   Year Inflation-adjusted, median household income 2009 $54,059 2010 $52,646 2011 $51,842 2012 $51,759 2013 $51,939   This shows that, despite a slight uptick between 2012 and 2013, real median household income has fallen since the start of the recovery in 2009 by $2,120. That’s about 4 percent, or roughly 1 percent per year, every year. The only caveat we should mention is that the most recent data stops at the end of 2013, and we don’t know yet whether income gains accelerated enough in 2014 to make up for the losses between 2009 and 2013. Still, we won’t mark down Bush for this, since he was using the most current data available. ""It's sad but true that real median income is below what it was in 2009 and 2010,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. ""Real median income kept dropping well after the official end of the recession and has been pretty close to flat since 2011."" She added that the losses have not been experienced equally. Incomes, Sinclair noted, ""have fallen in the lower parts of the income distribution,"" whereas the the top 10 percent of the income spectrum, and even more elite segments, have experienced gains. Still, Bush was clearly speaking about the overall national picture, so we find no fault with his claim. Our ruling Bush said that ""we are in the sixth year of recovery, and median income is below what it was at the start of the recovery."" He’s right, once you take inflation into account and if you use the most recent data available, which goes through 2013. We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967A1F80>],/factchecks/2015/apr/16/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-correct-median-income-has-fallen-us-end-r/
"['Elections', 'History', 'Wisconsin', 'Mark Pocan']","
Mark Pocan says less than 25 percent of population could vote when Constitution was written
","U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, earned a True on the Truth-O-Meter in 2013 when he declared that ""Nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote."" He was right that there is no affirmative right to vote spelled out in the U.S. Constitution, though several amendments aim to prohibit discrimination based on race, sex and age. Pocan is back again seeking a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to vote, in hopes of making it more difficult for states to impose rules on voting, such as having to present a photo identification in order to cast a ballot. And he got our attention again during an April 19, 2015 news conference where he explained his thinking on the need to update the Constitution. ""If you think about it, when the Constitution was written, 20 to 25 percent of the people in the country could vote,"" Pocan said. ""White male property owners over 21 is a very small subset of the country."" Is Pocan is accurately describing the state of voting eligibility in 1787, when the founding document was signed? Opening the history books Pocan directed us to excerpts from ""The Suffrage Franchise in the Thirteen English Colonies in America,"" an oft-cited 1905 book by Albert McKinley. Like many other sources, the book describes the difficulty in pinning down the size of the pool of potential voters in part because states set their own rules. After all, the constitution had not been signed, so there were no national standards. ""In Pennsylvania the tax-list figures give only potential voters, but they show about eight per cent of the rural population qualified for the suffrage, and only two per cent in the city of Philadelphia,"" McKinley wrote. ""In Rhode Island the freemen or potential voters numbered only nine percent of the population."" The potential voters seem to vary from one-sixth to one-fiftieth of the population,"" he concluded, after warning that ""these figures are entirely too few, and too scattered in time and territory, to justify any accurate generalization from them."" Several experts we turned to for help said Pocan’s estimate was in the right range. Voting in the late 18th century was restricted to males and generally based on landownership, and did not extend to slaves who were a fifth of the population, said Andrew J. O'Shaughnessy, a University of Virginia historian and vice president of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. The proportion of men who could vote rose in the early nineteenth century as voting restrictions were eased. By early in the century, on average probably 50 percent to 60 percent of white adult males could vote, which would be around 20 percent of the total white population, he said. Steven Mintz, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, put the voting pool at about 18 percent of the adult population. He based his view on evidence cited in ""The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States,"" authored in 2000 by Alexander Keyssar, a Harvard University historian. Keyssar, too, told us that Pocan’s claim is roughly accurate. ""It should also be noted that not all states had property requirements,"" Keyssar said. ""In a few, there were tax requirements, and Vermont had no financial qualification for voting."" Mintz has written that leading colonists associated democracy with disorder and mob rule, and felt that only property owners or taxpayers ""were committed members of the community and were sufficiently independent to vote."" ""Many colonies imposed other restrictions on voting, including religious tests,"" Mintz wrote. ""Catholics were barred from voting in five colonies and Jews in four."" On the other hand, O’Shaughnessy said in an interview with writer Ed Crews that by 18th century standards, ""Americans enjoyed considerable voting rights,"" and that even in Britain, with its elections and representative government, voting practices tended to be unfair, uneven, corrupt, and far more restrictive than America's."" Our rating Pocan said, ""When the Constitution was written, 20 to 25 percent of the people in the country could vote."" Pocan’s estimate is defensible based on a variety of sources, with the caveat that this is tough territory for statistical precision.

"['National', 'Education', 'History', 'Rick Santorum']","
Is book by Howard Zinn the 'most popular' high-school history textbook?
","A debate over high school history books doesn’t seem like the most obvious point to bring up during a speech to members of the National Rifle Association. But potential presidential candidate Rick Santorum did just that during the group’s annual convention last week. In addition to touching on gun rights issues in his speech, Santorum, a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania, criticized teachers for assigning works by the late Howard Zinn, including A People’s History of the United States, that cast a critical -- and often sharply negative -- light on the past actions of the U.S. government. ""Do you know the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America is written by a man named Howard Zinn, who is an anti-American Marxist, and that is the most common textbook?"" Santorum said in the April 10, 2015, speech. (It’s around the 10:15 mark.) We wondered whether Santorum was correct, so we took a closer look. Who was Howard Zinn? First, some background on Zinn. Zinn was born in 1922 to Eastern European immigrants and grew up in working-class Brooklyn. ""By his late teens, his reading had veered into politics, especially Marxism,"" wrote Rutgers University historian David Greenberg. Greenberg noted that historians have divided over the question of whether Zinn ever officially joined the Communist Party, but there is no doubt that his politics were -- and remained -- left-wing until his death in 2010. Zinn earned a Ph.D. in history from Columbia, taught for more than two decades at Boston University, and went on to write a number of books and plays, but A People’s History became his most famous work, selling more than 2 million copies since its publication in 1980, including various updated editions, according to Amazon.com. Zinn intended it as history from the bottom-up -- ""the Constitution from the standpoint of the slaves, of Andrew Jackson as seen by the Cherokees, of the Civil War as seen by the New York Irish ... ."" It’s a black-and-white, heroes-and-villains history of the United States in which the United States is almost always in the wrong. The book clearly hit a nerve: It became a cultural icon, name-checked on such television shows as The Sopranos and The Simpsons and receiving a prominent endorsement by Matt Damon’s character in the movie Good Will Hunting. The book also informed a number of historical documentaries and has inspired a national effort to promote his approach to history called the Zinn Education Project. So Zinn clearly has his admirers. But he also has detractors -- and they are not just conservatives. Some of Zinn’s fiercest critics have been liberals. Greenberg, writing in the liberal magazine The New Republic in 2013, called it a ""pretty lousy piece of work"" and said Zinn’s scholarly contributions were ""meager."" Zinn ""renounces the ideals of objectivity and empirical responsibility, and makes the dubious leap to the notion that a historian need only lay his ideological cards on the table and tell whatever history he chooses,"" Greenberg wrote. Even a publication of the American Federation of Teachers -- one of the nation’s two leading teachers’ unions -- ran a piece critical of Zinn by Stanford education and history professor Sam Wineburg. ""It seems that once (Zinn) made up his mind, nothing—not new evidence, not new scholarship, not the discovery of previously unknown documents, not the revelations of historical actors on their deathbeds—could shake it,"" Wineburg wrote. He added that ""history as truth, issued from the left or from the right, abhors shades of gray. It seeks to stamp out the democratic insight that people of good will can see the same thing and come to different conclusions."" What’s the evidence? We won’t take a position on the merits of Zinn’s historiography, but we will look at the evidence for whether Santorum is correct that Zinn is the author of ""the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America."" We’ll start by noting that, contrary to Santorum’s wording, A People’s History is ""not a textbook but a trade book,"" said Gilbert T. Sewall, director of the New York City-based American Textbook Council. While A People’s History might serve as supplementary material in a high school history class, ""its choices are highly idiosyncratic and it really wouldn’t do as your main text for a U.S. history survey class,"" Greenberg of Rutgers told PolitiFact. Beyond this, though, is there hard evidence that Zinn is the ""most popular"" book in high-school history classes? The short answer is no. When we asked Matt Beynon, a spokesman for Santorum, for supporting evidence, he referred us to two articles that mentioned the book but didn’t provide any hard evidence that it was the ""most popular."" Other experts also came up empty in the search for hard data. ""I have never heard anyone in our organization suggest that it is the most popular by any stretch of the definition of ‘most,’ "" said Susan Griffin, executive director of the National Council for the Social Studies, which represents high school history teachers. Peter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, said that while he believes anecdotally that Zinn’s books are ""widely used"" in American high schools, he is unaware ""of any hard data on how often it is assigned relative to other textbooks or how popular it is compared to other historical surveys."" Sewall, of the American Textbook Council, concurred. While Zinn’s impact on social studies teachers ""is prodigious and possibly unparalleled,"" he said, ""there is no way to determine the most popular base history instructional materials used in U.S. high schools."" In an interview, Wineburg of Stanford added that ""not a single state in the union"" has put Zinn’s books on an ""approved adoption list for middle or high school. Three big companies, including the biggest, Holt-McDougal, control about 90 percent of the market. They issue conventional, 1,000-page behemoths. … Find me one instance in which Zinn appears on any one of 50 state adoption lists, and I'll find you a unicorn."" Not even Zinn’s supporters agree with the claims that his influence in high school classrooms is unmatched. Alison Kysia, who has taught history at Northern Virginia Community College and has served as a fellow with the group that co-sponsors the Zinn Education Project, has written that ""for as much as I wish"" it were true that A People’s History was the most popular history textbook used in classrooms today, ""it isn’t."" Not only is there no comprehensive study, she wrote, but the evidence of the volume’s use in college classes shows that it’s not used especially widely. Specifically, a study by Dan Cohen, the founding executive director of the Digital Public Library of America and a former historian at George Mason University, found that of 258 undergraduate U.S. history survey courses in spring 2004, only three assigned Zinn’s book. The most commonly assigned volumes were The American Promise, by Roark, Johnson, Cohen, Stage and Hartmann, and The American People: Creating a Nation and a Society, by Nash, Jeffrey, Howe Frederick, Davis, Winkler, Mires and Pestana. ""I doubt that high school is much different,"" Cohen told PolitiFact. ""There are a lot of textbooks out there, and Zinn's is a tiny fraction of the assigned books."" Anecdotal evidence So we find no evidence to support the statistical claim that Zinn’s is ""the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America."" But we do think it’s worth paying at least some attention to the broader question of whether Zinn remains influential. For starters, Zinn’s sales are still strong, even five years after his death. He ranks about 30th on Amazon.com’s list of best-selling history authors. (The ranking changes constantly based on new sales, so it’s impossible to pinpoint a specific number.) While this bit of evidence should be taken with a grain of salt -- Fox News host Bill O’Reilly ranks about 10th on the same list -- it does suggest a continuing interest in his works. Indeed, Wood of the National Association of Scholars said it’s possible to interpret Santorum’s use of the word ""popular"" as meaning best-liked, rather than most widely used. While he acknowledges that this would be impossible to test empirically, he said it’s not implausible to think that Zinn’s supporters have an unmatched level of passion for his writings. ""There really is no other history textbook that enjoys the level of enthusiasm among students as Zinn’s book enjoys,"" he said. There’s anecdotal evidence for this. Wineburg of Stanford noted in his article that ""in 2008, the National Council for the Social Studies invited Zinn to address its annual conference—the largest gathering of social studies teachers in the country. Zinn's speech met with raucous applause."" Greenberg of Rutgers, while he called Santorum’s claim ""hyperbole,"" agreed that Zinn’s works are ""influential."" ""It’s very simplistic and appeals to the high school mind,"" he said. ""I think there is a germ of truth in the conservative complaint that the academy is captive to left-wing ideas."" Our ruling Santorum said that Zinn wrote ""the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America."" While there is anecdotal evidence that Zinn’s work is popular among some high-school teachers, there is zero hard evidence to support Santorum’s core statistical claim -- that Zinn’s volume is taught in more high-school history classes than any other book. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B3E180>],/factchecks/2015/apr/15/rick-santorum/book-howard-zinn-most-popular-high-school-history-/
"['Corrections and Updates', 'Florida', 'Guns', 'Jeb Bush']","
Which state has the most gun permits?
","Facing a long list of GOP presidential contenders at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush touted his own pro-gun rights record. Bush took a friendly jab at another potential presidential contender in the room: ""Today there are well over 1.3 million law-abiding Floridians with a valid concealed weapons permit, 1.3 million. That’s the most in the nation -- nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas. Sorry, Gov. Perry."" Yep, Florida does have 1,384,756 million concealed weapon permit holders as of March 2015. It’s not surprising that Florida would be among the top states for the number of gun permits since it is now the third most populous state in the country. But does Florida lead the nation in gun permits and is that nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas? We were fired up to find the facts. Comparing state permit figures A spokesman for Bush’s PAC referred us to an August 2014 article in the Washington Times, which stated Florida led the nation with 1.3 million in concealed carry permits while Texas came in second with just over 708,000. We sought to independently find current statistics. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, last studied the number of active concealed weapons permits by state in 2012 based on data as of Dec. 31, 2011, in most cases. It found Florida was No. 1 with 887,000 permits at the time, followed by Pennsylvania 786,000, Georgia 600,000 permits and Texas with 519,000 permits. Looking for more current numbers, we found Florida had nearly 1.4 million permit holders as of March 2015, while Texas has 825,957 as of December 2014, according to each state's official count. Florida’s number is about 1.7 times higher than Texas, which is close to Bush’s words of ""nearly double."" To determine if Texas is No. 2, we tried to find a more current number for gun permits in Pennsylvania and Georgia. Those two states don’t make such data as readily and publicly available as Florida and Texas. Pennsylvania has 1,064,360 active carry permits, State Trooper Adam Reed, a spokesman for the state police, told PolitiFact. So Pennsylvania, not Texas, is No. 2. In Georgia, 159 probate judges report the number of applications for weapons licenses to the Administrative Office of the Courts; however, some judges fail to report the number of applicants, resulting in no firm number. PolitiFact Georgia found that the state’s compiled number was in the ballpark of 500,000 in 2012, but the numbers have been increasing. Other estimates we have seen are higher, but none exceeded the total in Texas. (The courts sent us the total number of applications in 2013 which was about 169,000.) Some caveats about conceal carry laws and Bush’s claim While Bush’s claim is based on the sheer number of permits, another valid way to measure access to gun permits is to look at the rate in each state. The 2012 GAO report, using 2010 Census data for the adult population, shows Florida’s rate at 6.2 -- equal to Connecticut but less than Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah. The rules about conceal carry and each state vary, so it’s worth mentioning some caveats we have noted before. Several states, including Florida, allow out-of-state residents to acquire concealed weapons permits. As of March, about 192,000 out-of-state residents have Florida permits, representing about 13 percent of the total. Two populous states are notably absent from the top of the list: California and New York. Those states are considered a ""may issue"" states, which gives those states much more discretion over who gets a permit. That means it is harder to get a permit there than in a state such as Florida which is a ""shall issue"" state. We interviewed John R. Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center which compiles data on gun permits in states. Lott, an academic and Fox News columnist, published the book More Guns, Less Crime through the University of Chicago in 2010. He said there are four factors that influence the number of gun permits in a state: the amount of fees, hours of required training, how many places people can or can’t carry their firearms and how many years the rules have been in effect. For example, Pennsylvania has one of the lower fees, while Florida has higher fees but close to average in terms of training requirements. Our ruling Bush said Florida has the most concealed weapon permits in the nation, ""nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas."" There are three parts to this claim. On the first one, Bush is correct that Florida leads the nation in the sheer number of gun permits -- the most current figure is nearly 1.4 million. However, eight states have a higher per-capita rate of gun permits than Florida. When he says that Florida has ""nearly double"" the number of permits as Texas he is in the ballpark -- Texas has about 826,000. So Florida has about 1.7 times as many permit holders. Where Bush misses the mark is when he says that Texas is the second state in terms of gun permits. Current data from the Pennsylvania state patrol showed slightly more than one million permits -- so more than Texas. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True. Clarification: This report has been changed to clarify that probate judges report the number of applications for weapons licenses, not completed licenses. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280972C1E40>],/factchecks/2015/apr/15/jeb-bush/which-state-most-gun-permits/

In Wisconsin, carrying marijuana a second time is a felony but illegally carrying gun a misdemeanor?
","Even in a city repeatedly scarred by senseless fatal shootings -- a 10-year-old girl caught in the crossfire at a playground, a toddler struck by a bullet aimed at the wrong house -- this case stood out: A man driving his van in Milwaukee late on a Sunday afternoon struck and killed a 2-year-old boy who had darted into the street. He jumped out of the vehicle immediately and was grieving as he stood over the body. Moments later, a gunman, apparently enraged about the accident, shot the 40-year-old driver to death. But he also fatally wounded a 15-year-old, the toddler’s brother, who had rushed to the scene. Reacting to the incident, Mayor Tom Barrett linked increases in fatal and non-fatal shootings in Milwaukee with gun laws. In turn, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. criticized the mayor, saying Barrett was blaming concealed carry permit holders for more guns being on the street. Then, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, while speaking to reporters on April 14, 2015, two days after the accident and double-shooting, responded to the sheriff. ""We're the only place I know,"" Flynn said, referring to Wisconsin, ""where it's a misdemeanor to carry a gun illegally, but a felony for a second rap for carrying pot. Would you tell me how that makes sense? ""Second arrest for carrying pot is a felony. Second, third, fourth, 10th arrest for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor. Is it any wonder these knuckleheads out there with guns aren't learning a lesson from getting locked up by us?""​ Is Flynn right about the Wisconsin laws? Except for some clarification, yes. Marijuana Carrying marijuana -- for a second offense and subsequent offenses -- is, in fact, a felony crime. But that doesn't necessarily mean a felony charge will be filed. Prosecutors generally have discretion in charging.  So, while someone with a clean criminal record who is caught a second time carrying a marijuana joint technically has committed a felony offense, a prosecutor might decide to only issue a ticket. It’s also worth noting that carrying marijuana can be a felony on a first offense -- if you’re carrying with the intent to deliver, for instance. (Coincidentally, the day before Flynn made his claim, state Rep. Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, announced she would introduce a bill to legalize marijuana in Wisconsin. With Republicans controlling both houses of the Legislature, the measure has virtually no chance of passing.) Guns Wisconsin legalized the concealed carry of guns and other weapons in 2011. Carrying a concealed gun without a state-issued concealed carry license is a misdemeanor, for the first offense and for any subsequent offenses. It’s worth noting that someone convicted of any misdemeanor on three separate occasions within five years can be sentenced to more time behind bars. So, someone convicted of carrying a concealed gun illegally could be punished more if they are also convicted of two other misdemeanors, whether gun-related or not, within five years. In addition, for certain people, carrying a gun is a felony on the first offense. That includes convicted felons and people who are subject to an injunction such as a domestic violence restraining order. Our rating Flynn said that in Wisconsin, a ""second arrest for carrying pot is a felony,"" but a second or subsequent arrest ""for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor."" A second arrest for carrying marijuana is classified as a felony offense, although depending on the circumstances, only a ticket might be issued. And generally a first or subsequent offense for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor -- although for some people, such as convicted felons, a first offense is a felony.   For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

Rick Perry says immigrant tuition law made sense in 2001 but he's got no position on repeal in 2015
","Rick Perry recently made us wonder if he’d flip-flopped on his politically touchy support for the Texas law enabling thousands of young unauthorized immigrants to pay in-state tuition at state colleges and universities — a provision that might be repealed by the 2015 Legislature. What he said The former Texas governor, a Republican exploring a second run for president, was in South Carolina April 7, 2015, when Patrick Svitek of the Texas Tribune asked if his ""thinking"" on the 2001 law had changed ""over the years."" Perry initially replied by stressing the importance of the federal government securing the U.S.-Mexico border. ""This is a result of Washington, D.C. failing at their constitutional duty and then forcing states to deal with it."" Perry also said the 2001 Legislature, Republicans and Democrats, overwhelmingly supported the in-state tuition provision, thinking ""that we had a choice to make economically: Are you going to put these people in a position of having to rely upon government to take care of themselves, or are you going to let them be educated and be contributing members of society, obviously working towards getting their citizenship? And that’s what that legislation did; I supported that at that particular point in time."" Perry continued: ""I’m going to leave it up to the Legislature; you know, I’m not the governor any more. They’ll make a call on whether this is right for Texas or not."" Perry went on to say he’ll continue to call on the federal government to secure the border. Reporter’s follow-up Svitek followed up: ""And just to be clear: You supported it in 2001. So you don’t have a position today on whether it should be in place?"" Perry: ""Listen, I’m going to leave that up to the Legislature. They’re going to look at all of the impact. But I hope what the Legislature will do is really send a powerful message to Washington, D.C., to their congressmen, to the senators that you must deal with this issue of border security, you must allow the states to be able to know that they’re not going to have to pick up the costs because the federal government is failing to do their job to secure the border."" Perry before We’ve been writing about the 2001 law since this February 2010 fact check, which noted that on June 16, 2001, Perry signed into law the proposal allowing certain immigrants to attend Texas colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates. Students lacking proper immigration documentation but with a Texas high school diploma or GED and who have lived in Texas for at least three years may qualify for in-state tuition if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they can. Thousands of students have since taken advantage of the law. According to the latest available data, in the fiscal year through August 2013, 24,770 students partook, accounting for 1.9 percent of all students in the state’s public colleges and universities, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. In 2011, during his bid for president, Perry accurately pointed out very few legislators opposed the measure before it reached his desk 10 years before. In a September 2011 interview with Newsmax, Perry also apologized for saying in a Republican candidate debate that anyone who opposed giving tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants did not ""have a heart."" In an article about the interview, Newsmax noted that Perry also stood by his view that the decision in his state to extend tuition breaks was the right one. ""I was probably a bit over-passionate by using that word, and it was inappropriate,"" Perry was quoted as saying. ""In Texas, in 2001, we had 181 members of the Legislature — only four voted against this piece of legislation — because it wasn't about immigration; it was about education."" By our count, five of the 181 legislators referred to by Perry (31 state senators, 150 House members) voted against the tuition measure. Perry in 2014-15 Via the Nexis news database, we searched for more recent Perry comments about the law. Has his support slackened? In a September 2014 public interview with the Tribune, Perry expressed regret for his ""have a heart"" comment while he continued to stand by the law, the Tribune then reported. Asked how he would handle the issue if it came up again, he said: ""I wouldn’t say they were heartless. I would say I hope I can explain to you why in 2001 this was the right thing to do for the state of Texas."" Perry, then poised to leave the governor's office in early 2015, acknowledged that some Republicans intended to repeal the program in the 2015 legislative session. He also suggested the 2001 law came about out of frustration with the security of the U.S.-Mexico border--an aspect we don’t recall from debate at that time. In answer to a question from a UT student, Perry said, ""We have to remember that the reason we had to address this as a state was because of the federal government's total and abject failure of securing our border with Mexico. So we don't have the luxury of doing anything other than addressing this, and in 2001, members of the Legislature debated it, they talked about it, and they came to the conclusion that we had some options and the option they chose was in the best economic interests of the state of Texas. ""Young people who were here by no fault of their own, and I would suggest in every case that decision wasn't made by a 6-year-old - ‘We're going to the state of Texas so I can go to the University of Texas' - but economically what was in the best interests of the state of Texas was to give these young people the opportunity to be givers rather than takers, to be a constructive part of this society, and that's what we did,"" Perry said.""Economically, what was in the best interest in the state of Texas was to give these young people the opportunity to be givers rather than takers, to be a constructive part of this society,"" Perry said. Most recently before his comments in South Carolina, Perry stuck by his support for the 2001 law in a January 2015 interview with the New York Times; its news story quoted Perry saying: ''I still support the concept of allowing those people to be contributors to our society rather than takers."" We did not spot other comments about the law by Perry prior to the April 2015 exchange that got our attention. Perry aide says no flip-flop By email, we asked Perry’s spokeswoman, Lucy Nashed, if Perry’s answers to the Tribune’s April 2015 questions indicated he’s changed his position and his mind on the in-state tuition law. ""No,"" she replied, not elaborating. No Texas DREAM Act Footnote: In his initial question to Perry, Svitek referred to the 2001 law as the Texas DREAM Act. That’s common incorrect shorthand for the 2001 law, which had no memorable title. Rather, the final version of the legislation began: ""An act relating to the eligibility of certain persons to qualify as residents of this state for purposes of higher education tuition or to pay tuition at the rate provided to residents of this state."" Worth noting, too, the ""DREAM"" label might leave the misimpression that the law affords beneficiaries a path to citizenship or other immigration-related benefits presented in federal DREAM Act proposals that have yet to win full congressional approval. The Texas law solely focused on particular Texans who might newly qualify to pay in-state tuition at state colleges and universities. Our ruling In April 2015, Perry declined to take a position on whether Texas should repeal provisions he signed into law enabling certain unauthorized immigrants living in the state to qualify for in-state tuition. That was a step back from his previously consistent defense of the law, though not an all-out repudiation; he also said, as before, that he and lawmakers did the right thing in embracing the change in 2001.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Barack Obama']","
Clinton voted for McCain-supported Iran resolution
","Barack Obama made his most direct case for the Democratic nomination at a speech on Jan. 30, 2008, in Denver. He criticized fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's candidacy, arguing that he represents a more dramatic distinction with John McCain, the apparent Republican front-runner after winning Florida's primary.
 
In making his argument, Obama attacked Clinton for voting with Republicans on national security issues, among other things.
 
Among Obama's points: ""It's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who ... agreed with him by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran.""
 
On the issue of Iran, Obama is referring to a vote in September 2007 on a measure known as the Kyl-Lieberman Amendment, which declared the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to be a terrorist organization.
 
Clinton voted in favor of the amendment, which McCain co-sponsored.
 
Obama advisers argued at the time that the Kyl-Lieberman amendment could be used to justify a military attack on Iran.
 
We previously fact-checked the advisers' claim that Kyl-Lieberman was a ""blank check"" for the use of force in Iran. We found that expert opinions were split. Some said the legislation gave no new authority for the use of force in Iran. But others said the Bush administration would point to the legislation as a justification if it wanted to invade Iran, even if the legislation did not specifically condone it. Describing the amendment as ""giving George Bush the benefit of the doubt"" is similar to that argument.
 
There are a few other problems with Obama's statement that are worth mentioning. Though McCain co-sponsored the legislation, he missed the vote itself — as did Obama, who was campaigning. Obama said he would have voted against the amendment if he had been present. So though Clinton may have ""agreed"" with McCain on the issue, they did not technically vote the same way on it.
 
To say that voting for Kyl-Lieberman is ""giving George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran"" remains a contentious issue. But Obama's main point is that Clinton and McCain were on the same side, and that is correct. So we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'John McCain']","
More costly than expected, but no debt
","At a Jan. 30, 2008, Republican debate, John McCain repeated a statistic he has often cited on the campaign trail, attacking the health care reform initiated in Massachusetts when Mitt Romney was governor.
 
McCain said that Massachusetts now has ""a $245-million debt because of the big government-mandated health care system"" that Romney helped establish.
 
Romney responded: ""You know, a lot of people talk about health care. I'm the only one that got the job done.
 
""I got health insurance for all our citizens. We had 460,000 people without insurance. We got ... 300,000 of them signed up for insurance now. I'm proud of what we accomplished.
 
""The bill that I submitted to the legislature didn't cost $1 more than what we were already spending. However, the legislature and now the new Democratic governor have added some bells and whistles, and they're willing to pay for them.
 
""I wouldn't do that if I were governor. I would veto the items they put in place there, but they're entitled to make changes if they want to.
 
""They're still running a balanced budget. I wouldn't have added the money they did. And by the way, no debt was left. I left a rainy day fund of over $2-billion.
 
""Facts are stubborn things. I'm proud of my record.""
 
Well, let's get to those stubborn facts.
 
When Romney was governor of Massachusetts in 2006, the state initiated an ambitious health care reform package aimed at drastically reducing the number of people without health insurance. At the time, the state estimated there were about 400,000 uninsured residents (though the U.S. Census put the figure closer to 600,000).
 
At issue is the Commonwealth Care program in which taxpayers subsidize free or low-cost health services to low- or moderate-income residents who are uninsured.
 
Let's be clear that Romney did not leave the state in debt. McCain seems to be speaking of a projection on rising costs of the program in the current fiscal year.
 
To that point, the state anticipated there would be 135,000 people participating in the Commonwealth Care program in fiscal year 2008 ending June 30. As of the first of the year, there were 169,000 people participating (and they anticipate it will rise to 172,000 by the end of this fiscal year). Bottom line, the program is going to cost more than expected.
 
While the cost is higher than expected, the numbers are actually a source of pride for many involved with the program.
 
Dick Powers, a spokesman for the authority that oversees Commonwealth Care attributed the higher than expected participation to an ""extremely aggressive and successful public education and outreach effort to enroll people.""
 
The state budgeted $472-million for the Commonwealth Care program, but because of higher participation rates, it is now projected to cost $618-million this year. That comes to $146-million more than anticipated.
 
So where does McCain come up with $245-million? McCain's campaign did not respond to several requests for backup information, but in one speech where he made the same quote, McCain cited a

Boston Globe

article. The article noted that the state is expected to exceed the initial budget for the health insurance initiative by about $245-million this year.
 
In addition to costs from higher than anticipated participation, that number includes negotiated increases in supplemental payments to hospitals that offer free health care to uninsured people ($113-million more than was budgeted). In addition, after Romney left office, the legislature changed its formula so that as of July 2007, people making 150 percent of the poverty level would be eligible for free health services through Commonwealth Care (the threshold used to be people making under 100 percent of poverty level). That's some of the ""bells and whistles"" Romney was referring to. It raised costs about $13-million, Powers said.
 
As for the claim that Romney saddled the state with $245-million in debt from the health care program, the fact is the program is fully funded, said Cyndi Roy, deputy press secretary for Gov. Deval L. Patrick, a Democrat. Patrick will submit a supplemental budget later this year to reflect the increased costs, Roy said.
 
""It is certainly more than anticipated,"" Roy said. ""But it'll be covered. It's not in the red.""
 
And here's another thing. The same report that projects the $245 million in over-budget spending for the Commonwealth Care program also has some numbers McCain didn't note: free health care provided to the uninsured — which cost $600-million in 2007 — is expected to drop 12.5 percent this year, 25 percent by 2009.
 
McCain said Romney's program left Massachusetts with $245-million in debt. That's misleading. It did not leave the state in debt. Yes, the program is costing more than expected. Some might call it a victim of its own success. And in noting how much more the program is expected to cost, McCain fails to note how much the program is projected to save. We rate his claim Barely True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Mike Huckabee']","
Congress delivered, but after Bush asked
","Responding to a question about whether Americans are better off than they were eight years ago, Mike Huckabee tried to deflect some of the blame for the nation's economy away from President Bush and onto Congress, which he portrayed as fiscally reckless.
 
""We've got a Congress who sat around on their hands and done nothing but spend a lot of money and they're spending, leaving us $9-trillion in debt that we're passing on to our grandchildren,"" he said during a Jan. 30, 2008, Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Library.
 
Huckabee is correct there is a $9-trillion debt — actually, it's $9.2-trillion — and that it will be left to future generations to repay. And he's right about federal spending; it rose a cumulative 53 percent between 2000 and 2007. Because taxes and other receipts didn't rise as fast, the debt soared.
 
But the former Arkansas governor overlooks the fact that President Bush asked for most of the changes that drove up spending, most notably the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that were not fullly offset by spending cuts and the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill, which drove up entitlement costs. There also were national security spending increases after 9/11 and the cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
Republican-controlled Congresses delivered on each of these high-priority items, and Bush signed them into law. So at a minimum, the president and Congress share the blame for the fiscal policies Huckabee cites in the eight-year time frame. For that reason, we rate his statement Half True.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'John McCain']","
Romney won't mention a date
","On the weekend before the Florida Republican primary, John McCain attacked Mitt Romney on Iraq, bringing one of McCain's signature issues back to the forefront of the campaign.
 
""Now, one of my opponents wanted to set a date for withdrawal that would have meant disaster,"" McCain said.
 
Later, in remarks to reporters, McCain linked Romney's position with that of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
 
""If we surrender and wave a white flag, like Senator Clinton wants to do, and withdraw, as Governor Romney wanted to do, then there will be chaos, genocide, and the cost of American blood and treasure would be dramatically higher,"" McCain said.
 
(We previously examined McCain's ""white flag"" attack on Hillary Clinton

here

.)
 
Romney immediately disputed the accuracy of McCain's remarks.
 
""That's dishonest, to say that I have a specific date. That's simply wrong,"" Romney said. ""That is not the case. I've never said that.""
 
So did he?
 
As a source, the McCain campaign points to an interview Romney gave to

Good Morning America

in April 2007. Interviewer Robin Roberts asked Romney, ""Do you believe that there should be a timetable in withdrawing the troops?""
 
Romney: ""Well, there's no question but that the president and Prime Minister al-Maliki have to have a series of timetables and milestones that they speak about. But those shouldn't be for public pronouncement. You don't want the enemy to understand how long they have to wait in the weeds until you're going to be gone. You want to have a series of things you want to see accomplished in terms of the strength of the Iraqi military and the Iraqi police and the leadership of the Iraqi government.""
 
Roberts: ""So, private? You wouldn't do it publicly because — the president has said flat-out that he will veto anything the Congress passes about a timetable for troop withdrawals. As president, would you do the same?""
 
Romney: ""Well, could you, yeah — well, of course. Could you imagine the setting where during the Second World War we said to the Germans, gee, if we haven't reached the Rhine by this date, we'll go home, or if we haven't gotten this accomplished, we'll pull up and leave? You don't publish that to your enemy, or they just simply lie and wait until that time. So, of course, you have to work together to create timetables and milestones, but you don't do that with the opposition.""
 
So is a withdrawal date a withdrawal date if you don't tell anyone about it?
 
On the Democratic side of the presidential campaign, where primary voters are generally opposed to the Iraq war, the candidates regularly discuss timelines for withdrawal. Their emphasis has been on when to begin withdrawal, with front-runners Clinton and Barack Obama resisting deadlines for complete withdrawal. It's worth noting that Romney hasn't come close to talking about the kind of withdrawal parameters the Democrats have mentioned.
 
On the other hand, he's said in debates that he does not envision a permanent presence for the United States in Iraq. In a September debate, Romney said:
 
""If the surge is working, then we're going to be able to start bringing back our troop levels, slowly but surely, and play more of a support role over time. Ultimately, down the road, I would anticipate that we're not going to have a permanent presence in Iraq.""
 
McCain has said that while high casualty levels over the long term in Iraq are unacceptable to the American public, troops should stay in Iraq as long as needed, comparing the situation with American troops in Japan and Germany. (We checked an attack on McCain about that statement

here

.)
 
So McCain and Romney do seem to have genuine policy differences when it comes to withdrawal.
 
But McCain paraphrases Romney's statements in a way that leaves voters with the impression that Romney advocates a specific date for withdrawal from Iraq, which he does not. When Romney spoke about setting timetables for troop withdrawal it was within the context of meeting benchmarks or goals for progress there. For that reason, we come down on the more negative side of the Truth-O-Meter's dial. We rate McCain's statement Barely True.

"['National', 'Transportation', 'Mike Huckabee']","
His numbers are old or just wrong
","Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has sometimes strayed from Republican orthodoxy during his long-shot bid for the GOP nomination, most notably when it comes to economic issues.
 
He often touts his success in Arkansas improving the state's transportation infrastructure, so it was no surprise on Jan. 30, 2008, when he argued that highway spending would be a better means of stimulating the economy than the rebate checks that President Bush and Congress have in mind.
 
""Every billion dollars we spend on highway construction results in 47,500 jobs,"" he said during the Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.
 
And while Americans may love the thought of a $600 check from the government – as the House passed as part of its economic stimulus bill this week – they also would thank their government for reducing traffic congestion.
 
""The fact is the average American is sitting in traffic 38 hours a year,"" Huckabee said.
 
Huckabee is on well-trod ground here. But in the first case, he's using data so old that it can't possibly be true anymore. In the second, he misstates the results of a prominent study.
 
Huckabee's not alone in arguing that $1-billion in highway spending equates to 47,500 jobs. The equation has been widely cited in recent years by officials of the U.S. Department of Transportation, members of Congress and transportation advocacy groups.
 
Unfortunately, the study that made the finding is now 12 years old, 13 if you figure the data used was from 1995. The study was published in 1996 by the Federal Highway Administration. And in actuality, the author – economist Thomas P. Keane – found that $1-billion in federal spending created 42,100 jobs – 7,900 in direct highway construction, another 19,700 in related construction industry jobs and another 14,500 in unrelated jobs sparked by the construction, including everything from vendors who sell coffee to the workers to teachers who instruct their children.
 
Advocates of highway spending have used the data to argue that $1-billion in federal spending would typically be matched by $100-million in state matching funds, tacking on the remaining 5,400 jobs cited by Huckabee.
 
But the Transportation Department has never updated its findings and inflation has surely cut into the jobs that $1-billion, or even $1.1-billion, would create, says Frank R. Moretti, director of policy and research at TRIP, a Washington nonprofit group that advocates for policies to reduce traffic congestion. ""You would anticipate wages have been impacted over the last 13 years,"" he says, reducing – potentially significantly – the amount of jobs created.
 
Likewise Huckabee slips up a bit in citing a Texas Transportation Institute study examining the number of hours Americans spend stuck in traffic each year. The institute's September 2007 ""Urban Mobility Report"" found that congestion causes the average peak period traveler to spend an extra 38 hours in traffic each year. However, the average peak period traveler isn't the same as the ""average American"" that Huckabee cited.
 
In fact, only about 60 percent of Americans travel during the 8 hours a day that the institute defines as the ""peak period"" – between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. in the morning and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. during the evening rush. Senior citizens, stay-at-home parents, small children and the unemployed are among the 40 percent that typically don't. If they were factored in – thereby calculating how much time the average American spends in traffic – the 38-hour figure would likely drop into the 25-hour range, says David Schrank, a co-author of the report.
 
So Huckabee's facts are off, though not egregiously. His first error is in relying on the U.S. Department of Transportation, which continues to cite a 12-year-old statistic. The second misstatement is an exaggeration of a study. We rate both statements, therefore, as Barely True.

Pretty much yes, but it's not 'special'

A day ahead of the Florida primary, John McCain unleashed an attack on rival Mitt Romney in an automatic phone call to Republican voters.
 
It's identical to something Rudy Giuliani said about Romney when the former New York mayor was still in the race. We examined the Giuliani charge and concluded it was

Mostly True.

 
As reported by

Politico.com

, the McCain robocall is a woman apparently concerned about Romney's social conservative record. A McCain spokesman confirmed for us that the call came from the campaign but did not provide the official text.
 
Here is the transcript of the call courtesy of

Politico

:
 
""I'm calling with an urgent Mitt Romney [unintelligible]""
 
""We care deeply about traditional values and protecting families. And we need someone who will not waver in the White House: ending abortion, preserving the sanctity of marriage, stopping the trash on the airwaves and attempts to ban God from every corner of society. These issues are core to our being.
 
""Mitt Romney thinks he can fool us. He supported abortion on demand, even allowed a law mandating taxpayer funding for abortion. He says he changed his mind, but he still hasn't changed the law. He told gay organizers in Massachusetts he would be a stronger advocate for special rights than even Ted Kennedy. Now, it's something different.
 
""Unfortunately, on issue after issue Mitt Romney has treated social issues voters as fools, thinking we won't catch on. Sorry, Mitt, we know you aren't trustworthy on the most important issue and you aren't a conservative.
 
""Paid for by John McCain 2008.""
 
The statement the the call refers to comes from Romney's 1994 U.S. Senate campaign against Kennedy. During the race, Romney wrote a letter to the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of gay Republicans, thanking them for their support.
 
""For some voters it might be enough for me to simply match my opponent's record in this area,"" Romney wrote in October 1994. ""But I believe we can and must do better. If we are to achieve the goals we share, we must make equality for gays and lesbians a mainstream concern. My opponent cannot do this. I can and will.""
 
As with our previous ruling on this same attack, we find it Mostly True. McCain is right that Romney promised to be more supportive of gay rights than Kennedy had been, but he loses some points by using the term ""special rights."" What Romney actually advocated was equality for gay and lesbian Americans; nothing ""special.""
 
Yes, it's a small point. But for a politician like McCain, who took such grief over the misuse by his opponents of the term ""amnesty"" to describe his proposal for illegal immigrants, it's reasonable to expect a little more precision.

Americans consume a lot
","Mitt Romney discussed his detailed economic proposals at a Republican debate in Boca Raton, Fla., prefacing his comments with the need to get money into the hands of people who will spend it.
 
Speaking favorably of the Bush stimulus plan, Romney said, ""What's effective is, first, he's getting money back to consumers. And given the fact that two-thirds of our economy is a consumer economy, getting money back into the hands of our citizens, a lot of them paying a lot for gasoline, a lot for heating oil, a lot of people concerned about how to make ends meet, that makes sense to me.""
 
It made us wonder: Two-thirds of our economy geared to consumption? Is that true?
 
Consumption includes pretty much everything we spend our money on. The major components of consumption include things like food, apparel and services, transportation, health care and entertainment.
 
The latest data available from the third quarter of 2007 show that personal consumption expenditures in the United States made up 70 percent of the gross domestic product, with a split of 7.7 percent for durable goods, 20.4 percent for nondurable goods, and 41.9 percent for services.
 
Turns out Romney is on the money. We rate his statement True.

"['National', 'Energy', 'Mitt Romney']","
It might whack you ... in 20 or 30 years
","Mitt Romney set up camp at a Texaco station in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Monday to take a poke at the McCain-Lieberman bill that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 
""On a very different topic, we're at a gas station,"" Romney told reporters. ""And the reason for that is that I want to underscore the fact that Senator McCain's McCain-Lieberman (bill) would be a very expensive bill for the people of Florida. By our calculation, a family of four would have to spend about an extra $1,000 a year if McCain-Lieberman became law. And again that's because gasoline would rise in price by approximately 50 cents a gallon and natural gas would rise about 20 percent. The burden on Florida homeowners would obviously be excessive.""
 
The McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007 requires that greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 2004 levels by 2012, 1990 levels by 2020, and 60 percent below 1990 by 2050. It is a so-called cap-and-trade plan because it includes a market-driven plan in which companies that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions can sell emission allowances to other companies struggling to meet required standards. The plan also would provide some support for low-carbon alternative fuels, including nuclear power.
 
We're not taking sides on whether the McCain-Lieberman plan makes economic sense, or even whether it would help to solve global warming. But there's enough research in to judge Romney's numbers.
 
Lots of assumptions go into various projections about the impact of the McCain-Lieberman plan (or any other, for that matter), so you could probably find a study to say about anything. But take a look at the information Romney cites as background material in a press release about his attack on McCain's plan.
 
First off, the Romney camp switches back and forth between analyses of the 2003 and 2007 versions of the McCain-Lieberman plan. For example, it cites an American Council for Capital Formation study that concluded the McCain plan could increase gas prices 30 to 50 cents by 2020. But that was an analysis of the 2003 plan.
 
More on point are two government analyses of the 2007 McCain-Lieberman bill, one by the EPA and the other by the Energy Information Administration, which produces the official energy statistics from the U.S. government.
 
The EPA concluded in July 2007 that if the bill passed, it would increase gasoline prices about 26 cents per gallon by 2030; 68 cents per gallon by 2050.
 
The Energy Information Administration analysis, released in August 2007, concluded the price of gas would increase 34 cents per gallon by 2030.
 
Romney's claim that gas prices would rise 50 cents per gallon is grossly misleading considering these two reports conclude the increase would be 26 cents or 34 cents

in 22 years.

Romney's projection of the plan costing Florida families $1,000 a year rests on a 50-cent increase. Sure, the projections may come into Romney's wheelhouse in 30 or 40 years, but c'mon.
 
Both plans do, however, suggest that the price of electricity would rise (22 percent according to the EPA projections; 21 percent according to the EIA). But again, that's a projection for 2030.
 
Janet Peace, a senior economist with the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, doesn't take issue with either the EPA or EIA projections — based on the assumptions they made — but she argues that the farther out you go in years, the more difficult it is for the government to anticipate energy technology that may significantly alter the picture. The whole idea is to decrease Americans' reliance on fossil fuels through alternative energy sources.
 
Romney's claims didn't give a time frame, but we bet voters would be surprised to hear that he's talking about 20, 30, maybe even 40 years from now. We rate his statement Barely True.

In 1994, Romney ran for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy. During that campaign, Romney supported two gun control measures: the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons.
 
In 2002, Romney ran for governor, successfully beating Shannon P. O'Brien. During that campaign Romney said, ""We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them."" The McCain ad accurately quotes Romney on this point.
 
Also during the 1994 race, Kennedy attacked Romney as a conservative similar to Ronald Reagan. (He didn't mean it as a compliment.) That's when Romney responded, ""I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.""
 
Romney made his most detailed defenses to these apparent flip-flops in an interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News'

Face the Nation

on Oct. 21, 2007.
 
On the gun issue, Romney said, ""I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. ... But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. I sought the support of the NRA when I ran for governor, and I got it.""
 
Unfortunately for Romney, he later had to revise his statement that he had the support of the NRA in the governor's race. The NRA did not endorse in that race. (See our previous check on that statement

here

.)
 
On his Reagan comment: ""Well, when I was running in '94 I wasn't trying to return to Reagan-Bush because that was characterized as a very different posture than what I was running for. ... And Senator Kennedy in the debate was saying, `Oh, you're just turning yourself into Reagan-Bush.' I said, 'No, I'm my own person.' ""

Romney has changed his stand on abortion
","A new ad from John McCain makes the case that Mitt Romney has not always opposed abortion. Romney has acknowledged that this is the case.
 
When Romney ran for office in Massachusetts — unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 1994 and successfully for governor in 2002 — he often said he supported abortion rights.
 
McCain's ad highlights a few of those statements.
""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country,"" Romney said in a 1994 debate with Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy.
 
In a 2002 debate, Romney said there was no difference between his views and that of his Democratic opponent, Shannon P. O'Brien. ""I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose, and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard,"" Romney said.
 
In 2007, Romney said his views have changed. ""And I get tired of people that are holier than thou because they've been prolife longer than I have,"" he said at a Republican debate on Aug. 5, 2007.

"['National', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
A real turnaround
","Rudy Giuliani has run his campaign on two basic themes – leadership on 9/11, and the turnaround of New York City. At the Republican debate at Florida Atlantic University on Jan. 24, 2008, he made the turnaround of New York a point of contrast with his opponents.
 
""I'm the only one who's actually turned around a government economy,"" he said. ""And the reality is, when I became mayor of New York, the economy of New York was in very, very bad shape. Tremendous deficits, 10.5 percent unemployment, 300,000 jobs gone. We turned that around, cut unemployment by more than half, brought in 450,000 new jobs, and we cut taxes by 17 percent.""
 
And if you look at their records, at least in the fairly specific set of economic measures Giuliani listed, he is right.
 
Two other Republican candidates held political offices that let them be compared on their ""turnaround"" ability: Mike Huckabee, who was governor of Arkansas for 10 years, and Mitt Romney, who was governor of Massachusetts for four years. Both men left office in January 2007. Giuliani was mayor of New York for eight years, 1994-2001. Sen. John McCain has never held an executive position and thus has no record of economic turnaround.
 
The turnaround in New York is widely known. (We addressed it with this look at his luck with the

budget deficit

and this look at his claim of

cutting taxes.)

Giuliani had the wind at his back nationally: His years as mayor coincided with one of the longest national economic booms in American history, with the Wall Street boom was one of the headline stories of the era. Yet Giuliani clearly imposed greater financial discipline, and the economic measures support his claim that New York City outperformed the national boom during his years in office.
 
It is hard to argue that New York did not enjoy a substantial turnaround during the Giuliani years. Whether Giuliani deserves as much credit as he claims has been widely debated. The specifics of his claims have been evaluated before. He did not inherit a ""tremendous"" deficit any more than he left one. City budgets are required to be balanced, and Giuliani's budget directors have argued that budgets routinely show deficits at midyear (when mayors take office) but are resolved by year-end. Giuliani likes to decry the ""deficit"" he inherited from his predecessor, but dismisses the one he left for his successor by the same accounting.
 
It's worth noting, in all the talk of how they cut taxes and balanced budgets (all of their governments required balanced budgets, unlike the federal government), none of the former government executives is saying he'll produce a balanced budget in Washington.
 
In Massachusetts, it is perhaps noteworthy that Romney's book called ""Turnaround"" is not about his governorship but his tenure as CEO of the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics of 2002, a job he took at the beginning of 1999 when the Olympics had endured an ethics scandal and was projecting a substantial deficit.
 
The measures Giuliani picks as indicators of turnaround in New York don't look so good for Romney's four years as governor – which is probably one reason Giuliani picked them.
 
Giuliani's unemployment rate, for example, fell from 8.8 percent in 1994, his first year as mayor, to
6 percent his last year, though it held stubbornly around 9 percent for most of his first term. Romney, taking office a year after Giuliani left office, saw his unemployment rate fall from 5.7 percent to as low as 4.8 percent and then return to 5.3 percent.
 
Employment hit a cyclical bottom a year after Romney came into office. In the South Carolina debate on Jan. 10, Romney said, ""I'm very proud of the fact that after many, many months of declining job growth, I took over the state and helped turn that around. And in my years as governor, we kept adding jobs every single month after we saw that turnaround."" The turnaround, though, started only after a loss of well over 20,000 jobs his first year in office.
 
The tax burden in Massachusetts, for state and local governments combined, grew under Romney from 10 percent of personal income to 10.6 percent. Romney fought for a reduction in the income-tax rate, but the Democratic-controlled state legislature wouldn't go along. Giuliani claims he more or less bludgeoned New York's Democratic city council into becoming tax cutters. The tax burden fell in New York City – by nearly 20 percent, in Giuliani's calculation. (We evaluated that calculation in a previous story,

here,

and found it to be solid.)
 
(Giuliani prefers to focus on the magnitude of change, rather than on national comparisons, because he says New York has traditionally underperformed the nation on many such economic measures.)
 
Northeastern University's Center for Market Studies, looked at the economy three years into Romney's tenure and found it ""lackluster,"" trailing national performance on a number of measures. One was job growth: It had none after three years under Romney. It had just gotten back to even with where he started.
 
Now, for Huckabee, the story is a bit different. His tenure in Arkansas continued on through the much tougher economy of the last four years. Huckabee has spent a lot of effort trying to persuade people he cut taxes (""93 times,"" in his famous claim) when in fact the overall tax burden in Arkansas went up. If he talked more about turning around under-performance in the state's schools and roads, which he did to some extent and occasionally discussed, he might have claimed a different kind of ""turnaround"" mantle.
 
Huckabee used a gas tax to rehab Interstate 40 through Arkansas – once designated as the worst stretch of road in the country by a survey of truckers – and a sales tax to reform an inefficient and unfair system of schools.
 
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not significantly increase his city's investment in infrastructure.
 
Giuliani's claim about being the ""only turnaround"" candidate does not incorporate the concept of additional investment and additional ""return"" in the form of better services. Comparing Arkansas and New York City ""turnarounds"" is almost imponderable. Huckabee, however, doesn't describe his tenure as a turnaround era in Arkansas.
 
Giuliani's budget discipline did not allow for substantial new spending on infrastructure. Whether Huckabee's ""investment"" of higher taxes for better services was a good move is not is not a turnaround category Giuliani lists.
 
It has to be kept in mind that the economic circumstances each chief executive faced were very different. Giuliani can't match Romney in the corporate turnaround business. And Giuliani's view of what constitutes a turnaround doesn't consider everything, but Giuliani clearly has clear accomplishments when it comes to a government turnaround. We find his claim Mostly True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Mitt Romney']","
McCain switched tax vote
","Mitt Romney has repeatedly charged John McCain with flip-flopping on tax cuts. He points out that McCain twice voted against President Bush's tax changes before deciding to support them. He repeated his attack at the Republican debate in Boca Raton.
 
Though Romney omits some important details, we again find that he is accurately summarizing McCain's record.
 
In 2001, McCain voted against a $1.35-trillion tax cut package, arguing that the tax cuts didn't do enough for the middle class, and because of a need for increased defense spending. Two years later, McCain again citied spending for opposing $350-billion in additional tax cuts, specifically citing the unknown costs for the war in Iraq.
 
But in 2006, McCain changed position and voted to extend the Bush tax cuts for five years. He said not to do so would be tantamount to raising taxes at a time when the economy was sputtering.
 
McCain said he supported the tax-cut extensions, which reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, because ""American businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that we should not reverse course by letting higher tax rates take effect.""
 
In an interview on Fox News on Dec. 28, 2007, he expressed no regrets about his tax votes against Bush. He said he would have preferred a plan that included spending cuts as well as tax cuts, but added that he believes the tax cuts should now be made permanent.
 
""We presided over the greatest increase in the size of government since the Great Society,"" McCain said. ""Spending went completely out of control. It's still out of control. Wasteful earmark spending is a disgrace, and it caused us to alienate our Republican base. So these tax cuts need to be made permanent. Otherwise, they would have the effect of tax increases. But, look, if we had gotten spending under control, we'd be talking about more tax cuts today.""
 
McCain has responded by calling Romney a flip-flopper on taxes and other issues, but the fact remains: McCain voted the way Romney says. We find Romney's claim to be True. And if you'd like to see our previous same rulings on this issue, see

"['National', 'History', 'Barack Obama']","
He's right, but Clinton 'quote' isn't hers exactly

","Ronald Reagan is back on the campaign trail.
 
And this time, it's not the Republicans vying to claim his political DNA. It's the leading Democratic candidates, running as far as they can from the former president.
 
The latest claim in this debate comes from Barack Obama, who hits Hillary Clinton's Reagan record as he fights off

false attacks from Bill Clinton

on the very same thing.
 
Obama tries turning the tables on Clinton in a radio ad that makes passing reference to her views on Reagan.
 
""But it was Hillary Clinton, in an interview with Tom Brokaw, who quote 'paid tribute' to Ronald Reagan's economic and foreign policy,"" an announcer says in an

Obama radio advertisement

that aired in South Carolina.
 
The Illinois senator made a similar point during the Jan. 21, 2008, Democratic debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C.
 
On both counts, Obama's assertion about Clinton's praise of Reagan is basically true. But a couple of significant points need to be made. First, Clinton didn't use the words ""paid tribute,"" which the radio announcer says in quotations. That's how Brokaw summarized Clinton's remarks.
 
(It's worth noting that the Obama campaign said it pulled this ad from the air shortly after Clinton's campaign did the same with one bashing Obama's remarks on Reagan.)
 
And second, you have to read what Brokaw actually attributes to Clinton. Clinton's comments in question come from Brokaw's book,

Boom: Voices of the Sixties

. Brokaw notes Clinton's '60s rhetoric from her college days and writes about the current political climate.
 
Then this passage from page 403 and 404:
 
""She also believes modern conservatives such as Karl Rove are 'obsessed' with defeating her.
 
""She prefers the godfather of the modern conservative movement, Ronald Reagan. He was, she says, 'a child of the Depression, so he understood it [economic pressures on the working and middle class]. When he had those big tax cuts and they went too far, he oversaw the largest tax increase. He could call the Soviet Union the Evil Empire and then negotiate arms-control agreements. He played the balance and the music beautifully.'
 
""In 1969, who would have imagined that the Hillary Rodham on the Wellesley commencement stage would find herself 38 years later paying tribute to Ronald Reagan?""
 
Compare that text with Obama's ad, and you'll see that Clinton didn't offer overall praise for Reagan's economic record. In fact, what she did was single out what she saw as his appreciation for the challenges of the working class and his willingness to reverse course when taxes were cut too much.
 
It's true that Brokaw summarized this as paying tribute, but it still looks to us like the Obama ad somewhat mischaracterizes what Clinton said about Reagan. This leads us to rate it Half True.

"['National', 'John McCain']","
A white flag has a literal meaning, too.
","John McCain has attacked Hillary Clinton, saying she wants to ""wave the white flag of surrender"" in Iraq. He said it again in response to a question about Iraq at the Jan. 24, 2008, Republican debate in Boca Raton. (His comments come near the end of the YouTube video, at 9:45.)
 
It's hard to believe Hillary Clinton would say something so impolitic. Did she?
 
It's a harsh paraphrase of what she actually said in the Jan. 21, 2008, Democratic debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C.
 
Here's the full exchange:
 
Question: ""Last week, you said the next president will, quote, 'have a war to end in Iraq.' In light of the new military and political progress on the ground there in Iraq, are you looking to end this war or win it?""
 
Clinton: ""I'm looking to bring our troops home, starting within 60 days of my becoming president, and here's why, Joe. I have the greatest admiration for the American military. I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I've been to Iraq three times. I've met with the leaders of the various factions. But there is no military solution, and our young men and women should not remain as the referees of their conflict.
 
""I believe what you're seeing happen is twofold. Of course the surge, the so-called surge, was able to pacify certain parts of Iraq. If we put enough of our men and women and equipment in, we're going to be able to have some tactical military success. But the whole purpose of the surge was to force the Iraqi government to move quickly towards the kind of resolution that only it can bring about.
 
""I think what is motivating the Iraqi government is the debate in the political campaign here. They know they will no longer have a blank check from George Bush, that I will withdraw troops from Iraq. And I believe that will put even more pressure on the Iraqis to finally make the decisions that they have to make.""
 
McCain is right that Clinton is setting a time frame to start withdrawing troops, and that does imply giving up and waving a metaphorical white flag. Saying there is no military solution as she does could be seen as a form of surrender. But technically, there is no ruling army to surrender to, which is really what a white flag means. Clinton just wants the troops to come home.
 
So McCain is right when he says Clinton is advocating withdrawal from Iraq. But he uses a highly charged term that somewhat overstates the conditions to which she's referring to end U.S. involvement in Iraq. For this reason, we rate his attack Half True.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Mitt Romney']","
He should check their resumes
","Mitt Romney likes to trumpet his experience in the private sector. He was the head of the 2002 Winter Olympics and founder of Bain Capital, a venture capital and investment firm.
 
During a campaign rally in Pensacola on Jan. 25, 2008, the day after a Republican debate, Romney boasted, ""I was pretty proud of being the only guy on the stage that ever had a job in the private sector.""
 
He needs to check the resumes of his rivals.
 
Three of the four other candidates on the stage with Romney at the Boca Raton debate have private sector experience.
 
Rep. Ron Paul was an obstetrician from 1968 to 1996 and has delivered more than 4,000 babies. That sounds like the private sector to us.
 
Mike Huckabee has held several private sector jobs. He was a minister at Immanuel Baptist Church in Pine Bluff, Ark., the producer of radio and TV ads and a founder of KBSC-TV, a Christian TV station in Texarkana, Ark., now known as KLFI-TV. He served as the station's president from 1987 through 1992. He hosted a show called

Positive Alternatives

and, during his tenure, the station started airing Texarkana football.
 
Rudy Giuliani has spent much of his career in public service, but he practiced law with the firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler from 1977 to 1981. When he stepped down from being mayor of New York in 2002, he founded Giuliani Partners, a consulting firm in emergency preparedness, public safety, crisis management, energy and health care. In 2005, he became a partner in Bracewell & Giuliani, a large law firm.
 
When we inquired with a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign about the remark, she said Romney was referring to

business

experience. But we find plenty of the private-sector experience of the other candidates to be in business – especially Giuliani's work for the consulting firm, Huckabee's work at the Christian TV station and Paul's work running a medical practice. And so we find Romney's statement to be False.

The 1990s? Good times
","With heightened fears of a recession, Bill Clinton wants you to remember the good old days, the days of Spice Girls and Starbucks and economic prosperity ... the 1990s. The days when, you know, he was president. In a radio ad that is running in South Carolina, Bill Clinton suggests things could be like that again, if you elect his wife.
 
""The 1990s were a time of prosperity,"" Clinton says in the ad. ""We created more than 22-million new jobs, moved 8-million people out of poverty, and turned our economy around.
 
""It's time for another comeback, time to make America great again. I know Hillary's the one who can do it.""
 
There are two main statistics in this advertisement (which Hillary Clinton has also thrown out from time to time), and we find that Bill Clinton is on target on both.
 
The first is about new jobs. According to Bureau of Labor statistics, the number of employees on nonagricultural payrolls went from 109.7-million in January 1993 (when Clinton took office) to 132.5-million in January 2001 (when Clinton checked out). Net gain: 22.8-million new jobs.
 
The other claim is fewer people living in poverty. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of people living in poverty went from 38-million in 1992 to 31-million in 2000; not quite 8-million as Bill Clinton said, but pretty close.
 
""The hard numbers are correct, but how much of that can you attribute to Clinton's policies?"" said James Sherk, a labor policy analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation.
 
Keep in mind, Sherk said, the country was beginning to come out of a recession before Clinton took office. And much of the dramatic change came after 1995 when Republicans had secured control of Congress. Sherk noted that Clinton initially opposed the Welfare Reform Act, which Sherk believes may have been the biggest catalyst in reducing poverty numbers.
 
Sherk says Clinton was also a little lucky.
 
""He had the good fortune to be in office at the height of the tech bubble,"" he said. ""It makes his time in office look good in ways he can't take credit for.""
 
Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institute, says there's no getting around the numbers.
 
Sure, Burtless said, the dot.com craze may have helped the economic numbers, and some may argue that the U.S. economy was due for an up-cycle during the 1990s, ""but the fact is, there was significant economic growth during that period. It's tough to get around that.""
 
""To the degree that a president can effect economic progress,"" Burtless said, ""most would say Bill Clinton did well above average.""
 
Let the partisan folks argue about whether Bill Clinton deserves credit for the numbers, or whether Hillary Clinton can recreate them. The numbers are right. We rate Bill Clinton's statement True.

U.S. is Saudi Arabia of coal
","In the Republican debate on Jan. 24, 2008, in Boca Raton, Rudy Giuliani was asked a question about global warming. He said he would address the problem in part by supporting alternative fuel sources such as coal.
 
""We need to expand the use of clean coal,"" he said. ""Carbon sequestration is expensive, but it's a process that works. We have more coal reserves in the United States than they have oil reserves in Saudi Arabia.""
 
Giuiliani's comparison is accurate.
 
According to the U.S. Energy Department, the United States has 267.3-billion short tons of coal reserves, or 26.8 percent of the world total. Saudi Arabia has about 20 percent of the world's oil reserves.
