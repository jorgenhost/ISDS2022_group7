Anti-crime organization says Oregon ranks 30th for incarceration rate
","

When Oregon legislators set out to evaluate the state’s budget in the coming months, they’ll take a keen look at the state’s prison system. For the 2007-09 budget period, public safety accounted for nearly 15 percent of what the state spends, and, by one measure, the state’s prison system takes nearly one dime out of every dollar in the general fund.

Naturally, there’s a lot of talk about how the state can make that slice of the dollar smaller. That talk then turns to the subject of minimum sentences and how the measures that Oregonians have approved over the years might be contributing to the large cost. (Most recently, voters said ""yes"" to Measure 73, which mandated longer sentences for repeat drunken drivers and sex offenders.)

Pushing back on this line of reasoning, Oregon Crime Victims United offered a little context in a piece online that then got picked up by another tough-on-crime group called the Oregon Anti-Crime Alliance.

In the statement, Crime Victims United argues that the cost of corrections is sometimes used as proof that Oregon has gone too far on incarceration. ""However,"" the statement says, ""costs have risen far faster than incarceration. Oregon still ranks just 30th in incarceration rate. We have not gone overboard with incarceration.""

There’s a lot there to consider, but what jumped out at us was the statement that Oregon ranks ""just 30th in incarceration rate."" We decided to check the number out.

We spoke with Howard Rodstein, the group’s number cruncher. He e-mailed us a link to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report that compares all 50 states’ incarceration rates. According to this report, ""imprisonment rate is the number of prisoners sentenced to more than 1 year per 100,000 U.S. residents.""

Under that definition, Oregon scored 371 for 2008 and did, in fact, come in at 30th place. As a comparison, the national number was 504 prisoners per 100,000 residents..

We went to the source of that report, and asked spokeswoman Kara McCarthy whether the Bureau of Justice Statistics had any newer numbers. She said it did not.

To make sure we did our due diligence, we checked in with Tony Green, spokesman for the Oregon attorney general. Green said he didn’t have any other numbers to provide, but pointed us to the state Department of Corrections. We dialed them up, too.

There, spokeswoman Jeanine Hohn was able to provide fresh numbers. She sent us another report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics that showed Oregon with an incarceration rate of 375 midway through 2009. That put Oregon in 28th place. That indicates some slight movement upward.

Hohn also got Michael Wilson, an economist with the Criminal Justice Commission, on the phone with us. Wilson said that the Bureau of Justice Statistics reports are pretty much the standard measurement. ""For the most part, it's what people use because it's the best that's out there,"" he said.

Oregon’s incarceration rate did increase faster than the national rate from the early ‘90s through 2005 or so, he said, but -- with help from population growth -- has leveled off since then, keeping our rate below the national average.

Before we get to the ruling, we want to point out one final piece of context: While Oregon ranks near the middle when it comes to U.S. incarceration rates, the United States happens to be a world leader in this area. According to the International Centre for Prison Studies at King’s College London, the United States’ incarceration rate far outpaces most other countries’.

Now, back to the issue at hand. Oregon Crime Victims United said that Oregon ranked 30th in state incarceration rates. Newer numbers show that to be off, but only slightly. Because not even the spokeswoman for the Bureau of Justice Statistics knew about the fresher numbers, we won’t fault Crime Victims United for the slight discrepancy. We find this claim to be True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/19/crime-victims-united-oregon/anti-crime-organization-says-oregon-ranks-30th-inc/
"['Georgia', 'Economy', 'Atlanta Sports Council']","
2000 Super Bowl's economic impact tallied at $292 million
","
When Gov.-elect Nathan Deal and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed told the NFL they hope to woo the Super Bowl back to town, the NFL played coy. 
 
The Super Bowl has plenty of suitors, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said last week. Winning cities tend to have brand-new stadiums. Atlanta's chances may improve if it built one, too, he hinted.

That costs money, which boosters think the event can generate. 

Atlanta's last Super Bowl in 2000 had an economic impact of $292 million, according to a study backed by the Atlanta Sports Council, which aims to build the city's reputation as the ""sports capital of the world."" That figure has been repeated in media accounts and academic research for a decade.

That seems like a nice little nest egg, but does the game really bring in that much money?

Festivities for the nation's biggest regular event last for a week and attract celebrity guests and corporate tycoons willing to pay for luxury rental cars, hotel suites and fine dining that are well beyond the means of typical tourists. 

Still, skeptics say that even that degree of excess cannot support economic impact projections for the Super Bowl. Estimates for upcoming games have passed the half-billion mark.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia interviewed independent sports economists to see whether they have come to a consensus on the game's worth. They haven't. Some place the amount in the tens of millions. Its harshest critics think its net effect is zero.

But they do agree on this: Independent economists come up with much lower estimates than boosters do.

They warn that boosters' estimates do not adequately acknowledge that a mega-event may drive away other potential visitors. They can bring such large crowds and tangled traffic that conventions opt to move elsewhere. Plus, the frenzied activity could prompt locals to stay at home. This can actually lower spending at restaurants and movie theaters.

Estimates must also consider where the money is going. If visitors patronize chain restaurants and hotels based outside of the Atlanta area and buy T-shirts and caps licensed by an out-of-town sports league, the bulk of their money isn't creating local wealth. It's heading elsewhere. 

Further complicating the matter is that the Super Bowl's impact won't be the same in all cities. It might pack more economic punch in Detroit, which doesn't get many tourists during January or February, than it would in Miami, where hotels fill up that time of year whether or not the game is in town. 

Now back to the 2000 Super Bowl, which didn't go smoothly. An ice storm blanketed
Atlanta, and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis was arrested on murder charges after a fight in Buckhead. He pleaded guilty to an obstruction of justice charge in exchange for testifying against his co-defendants.

The Tennessee Titans battled back from a 16-point deficit before losing 23-16 to the St. Louis Rams. About 94,000 people visited the city, 87 percent of whom stayed in hotels an average of 3.7 days, according to a 2000 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 

The Atlanta Sports Council obtained its economic impact estimate with the help of the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and Bruce Seaman, a Georgia State University economist who studies sports and cultural events. He regularly completes economic impact studies on local institutions.

We requested a copy of the original 2000 estimate from Seaman and the Sports Council, but neither was able to locate one. Seaman wrote an abstract of his findings, but not a full report. He did provide an unedited version of a letter he wrote to the Atlanta Business Chronicle that explained his methodology. We used this, a working paper he wrote that touched on the subject, and media coverage to bolster our understanding of the estimate.

Seaman said the Sports Council asked for his help because he's skeptical about economic impact estimates. Critics blasted the NFL for an estimate of the 1999 Super Bowl in Miami that topped $350 million. The council hoped to avoid a similar problem in Atlanta.

Here's how the study worked: It estimated the game's impact on gross regional product, personal income, employment and tax revenue. It surveyed visitors on their spending and interviewed hotel, car rental and restaurant operators. It also incorporated NFL spending.

To avoid overestimating the impact, Seaman adjusted his figures to exclude money that would not go to local vendors and workers, and he considered whether the Super Bowl would displace other visitors.

Seaman also looked at hotel occupancy, airport traffic and tax receipts. 

The data were plugged into a mathematical model that Georgia State economists developed to estimate the economic impact of large events. It gave them $292 million.

But this number needs heavy qualification. It's not quite as it has been portrayed by the media and academics. 

The first qualification is that $292 million represents the economic impact estimate for all of Georgia, including direct spending and longer-term effects as the money made its way across the state. The original estimate for the game's economic impact on metro Atlanta was actually $215 million.

The bigger problem is the original estimate is outdated. In 2005, during Atlanta's failed bid for the 2009 Super Bowl, Seaman took another look at the 2000 Super Bowl economic impact figure and revised it down to $182 million for the metro area. 

Now, Seaman thinks that $150 million may be a safer bet, he told AJC PolitiFact Georgia. That's in today's dollars.

The estimate sank because Seaman fine-tuned the economic model in the decade since the Rams-Titans faceoff. Some significant adjustments included changes in how much fans spent on hotel accommodations and food, beverage and retail purchases outside the Georgia Dome. 
For instance, Seaman used to think spectators (excluding media) spent more than $100 per night on hotels, based on double-occupancy. Now he thinks that figure is $70.33. This change knocks millions off the estimate.  
""In retrospect, even the $182 million figure is too high,"" Seaman said. ""But is there a positive economic impact? I contend 'yes.' ""  

To sum up, the Sports Council's original $292 million figure was once correct, but it took on a life of its own. It was used without specifying that it measures the impact statewide, not for the metro area.

And now it's no longer accurate. The true impact is likely $150 million.

It might have been an OK figure to use in the early 2000s. But it's been revised downward, which means it's now False.",/factchecks/2010/nov/19/atlanta-sports-council/2000-super-bowls-economic-impact-tallied-292-milli/
"['Immigration', 'Rhode Island', 'Lincoln Chafee']","
Chafee says only six states use E-Verify
","
Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee wasted no time telling constituents that he will make good on a campaign pledge to repeal Governor Carcieri's 2008 executive order on immigration.

When it came to talking about one of the key components of that order, the use of the federal E-Verify system, he seemed a little vague on the details, however.

""Don't forget, Rhode Island is one of only six states to have -- I believe it's only six -- to have E-Verify. So there's 44 other states that don't have it,"" Chafee told reporters after an unrelated news conference Monday.

The point he was trying to make is that E-Verify is not a widely used program and one he believes may not be effective.

We wondered how many states actually require use of E-Verify. But first, a little background.

E-Verify is a free, federal database that compares information from a person's employment paperwork to Homeland Security and Social Security records. Employers who use the program can weed out immigrants not eligible to work in this country.

Once employers hire workers, they run their names through the E-Verify database. If the records match, the new employees are eligible to work. If they don't match, the database notifies the employers, who must then give the worker eight days to provide sufficient proof of eligibility.

What sounds like a foolproof system quickly came under fire. Critics complained that the database was inaccurate and demanded that it be improved before E-Verify was widely implemented. 
Despite that criticism, companies increasing began using the program on a voluntary basis. One by one, some states too started mandating E-Verify checks. In 2008, Rhode Island became one of them when Governor Donald Carcieri announced a multi-part executive order intended to curb illegal immigration. One of the key elements of the order required the state's executive branch and companies doing business with the state to use E-Verify for new employees. 
(The federal government began requiring use of E-Verify for government contractors in September 2009). 
Just how many states require the use of E-Verify? Contrary to what Chafee told reporters, the number is 13 -- 26 percent -- according to data from the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services.

There are variations in how states employ E-Verify. Idaho, North Carolina and Virginia require E-Verify checks on state employees, while Colorado mandates that only state contractors use the system. Like Rhode Island, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma require both.

Finally, Arizona, Mississippi and Utah mandate that all employers statewide use the program.

(South Carolina requires employers to verify the legal status of their workers, either through E-Verify or by checking their drivers' licenses.)

While those statistics make clear that Chafee has his facts wrong, we were inclined to give him a little leeway on this one, for a couple of reasons.

First, he said he believed only six states used E-Verify, implying he didn't know for sure. And when Carcieri issued his well-publicized executive order, the number of states using E-Verify was closer to six. It has since increased.

When asked about the discrepancy, Chafee's transition office explained the governor elect's statement this way: there are six other states besides Rhode Island that have E-Verify laws that are similar to ours, spokesman Christian Vareika said.

So a state that actually has a more sweeping E-Verify policy than Rhode Island should not be included in the total because its program is more extensive? That logic escapes us.

Vareika stressed what he called Chafee's larger point. ""The vast majority of states do not use E-Verify, so I think the heart of the matter remains true,"" he said.

But there is something else. This is not the first time Chafee has used the six-state figure. Back in June in a gubernatorial candidate forum, Chafee told the crowd: ""I would not participate in E-Verify. Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Mississippi, Rhode Island and South Carolina  - only six states participate. If it's so great, is that the kind of company we want? I don't think so.""

Why he arbitrarily cited those six states, we're not sure.

We tend to give politicians a pass when they make one slip of the tongue. But not when they repeat incorrect information. In this case, after The Providence Journal quoted him on the ""six states"" in June, the candidate posted the story on his campaign website where it remained as of Nov. 18.

Chafee has repeatedly condemned Carcieri's executive order and promised to repeal it once he takes office. In challenging such a controversial policy, he owed it to constituents on both sides of the debate to do his homework on the current laws before speaking out.

Dean Cannon says state Supreme Court lacks ""express authority"" to strike the Legislature's proposed amendments
","
In 2010, the Florida Supreme Court removed three proposed constitutional amendments from the Nov. 2 ballot. Florida House Speaker Dean Cannon, R-Winter Park, a lawyer, bashed the court for doing so on Nov. 16, 2010, in his first speech as House speaker during the Legislature's one-day organizing session.

""As an attorney and an officer of the court, I believe fervently in a judicial branch that is strong and independent and fully empowered and equipped to fulfill its constitutional duties. But for the judiciary to be independent, it must also be impartial and apolitical. It must respect the co-equal executive and legislative branches, and it must protect their unambiguous constitutional powers, and it must practice the restraint that is built into our federal and state constitutions. And yet, over the past year three times we saw the work of a three-fifths super majority of this legislative branch, the elected representatives of over 18 million Floridians, demolished by five unelected justices of the Florida Supreme Court. This was done notwithstanding the fact that there is no express authority in the Florida Constitution for their doing so.""

For this Truth-O-Meter we will explore, is there ""no express authority in the Florida Constitution"" for the state Supreme Court to remove amendments placed on the ballot by the Legislature?

First, some background on the amendments in question that we gleaned from a Sept. 1, 2010, article in the Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times. In a 5-2 ruling on Aug. 31, 2010, the Supreme Court struck three amendments from the November 2010 ballot:

• Amendment 3: To grant extra tax breaks to first-time home-buyers.

• Amendment 7: To ""clarify"" redistricting Amendments 5 and 6, which did remain on the ballot.

• Amendment 9: To prohibit Florida from participating in a health insurance exchange that forces people to buy insurance, which was in reaction to the new federal health care law.

First, we asked Cannon spokesperson Katherine Betta to provide proof that the Florida Supreme Court lacks ""express authority"" in the state Constitution to remove the ballot items.

""He has the text of the Constitution… express authority means authority that is expressly written into the Constitution,'' Betta wrote in an e-mail. ""The Constitution doesn’t provide express authority for the judicial branch to remove amendments placed on the ballot by the Legislature. It only provides authority to remove those placed by citizen petition."" These three ballot items were placed on the ballot by the Legislature, she wrote.

We sent Cannon's claim to four professors who are experts in Florida constitutional law -- Joseph Little, Timothy McLendon and Jon Mills at the University of Florida and Donald Jones at the University of Miami. We also interviewed three lawyers who have argued amendment cases in Florida: Mark Herron, Barry Richard and Ronald Meyer.

Most of the legal experts agreed that there is no ""express authority"" in the state Constitution -- no blunt, direct language that says the Supreme Court should review ballot items written by the Legislature. But most also said that doesn't matter. The Supreme Court clearly has jurisdiction, and it would be misleading to suggest otherwise.

First, let's look at the legal documents that the professors cited -- the Florida Constitution and state statute 101.161. The state Constitution in Article 4 Section 10 expressly directs the Supreme Court to review amendments headed to the ballot that were written by citizens -- not the Legislature: ""The attorney general shall, as directed by general law, request the opinion of the justices of the supreme court as to the validity of any initiative petition circulated pursuant to Section 3 of Article XI. The justices shall, subject to their rules of procedure, permit interested persons to be heard on the questions presented and shall render their written opinion no later than April 1 of the year in which the initiative is to be submitted to the voters pursuant to Section 5 of Article XI.""

But the Constitution in Article 11 Section 1, also allows the state Legislature -- by a three-fifths vote -- to put an amendment on a ballot. That section makes no mention of the Supreme Court. 
""There is a distinct difference between citizen petitions and the Legislature’s express constitutional authority to place amendments before the people,"" Betta wrote. ""The Constitution does not provide express authority for courts to remove questions placed on the ballot by the Legislature, as Rep. Cannon discussed in his speech.""

That's what Mills concluded about Cannon's claim: ""I think he is right. The only provision in the Constitution dealing with judicial review relates to (citizen) initiatives.""

But the Supreme Court still has authority to review such legislative-proposed amendments. After the Legislature agrees to place a question on the ballot, someone can file a challenge at the trial court level, which can work its way to the appeals court and then the state Supreme Court. That's what happened in the case of the three legislative amendments in 2010.

Several lawyers said the basis on which the Florida Supreme Court removed the Legislature's proposed amendments in 2010 was state law 101.161, which requires that such amendments be ""printed in clear and unambiguous language"" among other requirements. That statute doesn't directly state that the Supreme Court can review amendments for that purpose, but the lawyers said it doesn't have to -- individual statutes don't have to mention the court's jurisdiction.

Meyer told us in an e-mail that the Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to review such a decision due to Article 5 Section 3 of the Constitution, which states that the Supreme Court: ""may review any order or judgment of a trial court certified by the district court of appeal in which an appeal is pending to be of great public importance, or to have a great effect on the proper administration of justice throughout the state, and certified to require immediate resolution by the Supreme Court.""

Meyer also wrote: ""For nearly a century, the Florida Supreme Court has exercised its constitutional power to review proposed amendments."" Here is the full text of what Meyer wrote to us.

""You could say there is nothing red in the sky that allows the Supreme Court"" to review amendments, and that would also be true, Meyer said sarcastically in an interview.

Richard, who has argued several amendment cases, said technically he agrees with Cannon that the Constitution lacks express authority for the Supreme Court, but the court can review amendments if a lawsuit is filed at the trial court. (It bears repeating: That's exactly what happened with these three amendments that angered Cannon.)

""Most Supreme Court authority isn't spelled out,'' Richard said. ""If you say that it has to be 'express authority' then the Supreme Court wouldn't be able to review any statutory provisions. You need to take the next step. He is correct that there is no express authority, I agree, but most of the authority of the Supreme Court isn't express -- it is inherent in its nature as the high court in this state.""

We also sent Cannon's claim to the Florida Attorney General's office, which sometimes represents the Legislature in amendment challenges. Spokeswoman Sandi Copes sent back a link to the the 2000 Armstrong decision, which tossed out a death penalty amendment due to misleading ballot language after it was approved by voters in 1998. That ruling included this statement: ""Although the Constitution does not expressly authorize judicial review of amendments proposed by the Legislature, this Court long ago explained that the courts are the proper forum in which to litigate the validity of such amendments.""

Let's look at what two professors wrote to us in e-mails:

""The Florida courts possess jurisdiction, upon proper complaint having been filed, to ascertain whether the Legislature’s prescribed standards have been satisfied,"" Little wrote. ""The statute does not exempt proposals adopted by the Legislature from review. Hence, although it is true that the Florida Constitution does not include express language on this point, it is well within the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction to review the questions of law that arise under (state law.)""

The state Constitution, Little wrote, ""does not have express words pertaining to most of the other myriad issues the court considers. By contrast, the Supreme Court does have express authority to review constitutional amendments proposed by citizen initiatives. I do not disagree that the authority is not 'express.' I do disagree that the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction.""

And Jones wrote: ""The law is not always what is written down. What is express or written down can never be the limit of the law in a democracy. If that were so, most of the law of the 20th century including Brown v. Board of Education would be void."" (That's a reference to the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court school desegregation case.)

Let's summarize: There is no sentence in the Florida Constitution that bluntly states, as UF's McLendon told us, ""Oh by the way the Supreme Court can review these amendments and kick them off the ballot.'' So technically, Cannon is correct that there is ""no express authority"" in the Constitution.

But let's look at the context of Cannon's remarks: ""And yet, over the past year three times we saw the work of a three-fifths super majority of this legislative branch, the elected representatives of over 18 million Floridians, demolished by five unelected Justices of the Florida Supreme Court. This was done notwithstanding the fact that there is no express authority in the Florida constitution for their doing so.""

Cannon is clearly raising questions about whether the Supreme Court overstepped its bounds here, implying that it lacked authority for its action and that it failed to respect the legislative branch. The legal scholars and lawyers we interviewed agreed that the Supreme Court does have jurisdiction to review those amendments. Or to put it in non-legal terms, big whoop that it lacks ""express authority"" in the Constitution -- the Supremes have every right to rule here. We rate this claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/18/dean-cannon/dean-cannon-says-state-supreme-court-lacks-express/

Richard Lugar says ending earmarks won't save money
","
One of the congressional Republicans' first actions after the 2010 election was to take a stand on curbing earmarks -- the targeted congressional spending provisions that have been criticized by politicians ranging from President Barack Obama to most members of the tea party movement.

An earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker. Critics have long argued that earmarks are likelier to serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group than the national good.

On Nov. 16, 2010, after pressure from newly elected, tea party-backed Republican candidates as well as incumbents on the right flank of the GOP, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blessed an earmark moratorium, even though McConnell had been an active earmarker for much of his congressional career.

""Make no mistake, I know the good that has come from the projects I have helped support throughout my state,"" McConnell said. ""I don't apologize for them. But there is simply no doubt that the abuse of this practice has caused Americans to view it as a symbol of the waste and the out-of-control spending that every Republican in Washington is determined to fight. And unless people like me show the American people that we're willing to follow through on small or even symbolic things, we risk losing them on our broader efforts to cut spending and rein in government.""

Two days after McConnell's announcement, the new House Republican majority voted to enact a ban on earmarks in the 112th Congress as well.

Yet as popular as banning earmarks appears to be, a few lawmakers have urged caution. Some have argued that giving up Congress' right to direct where money goes effectively cedes those powers to the executive branch, centralizing more power than ever in the presidential administration. Some have argued that, in the context of the entire federal budget, the dollar amounts are trivial -- roughly $15 billion out of a $1.4 trillion deficit in 2009. Critics say that focusing on earmarks is a symbolic action that obscures the harder choices that will be needed to reduce the federal deficit and cut into the national debt.

One lawmaker, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., made a stark point: Cutting earmarks won't actually save money.

""I oppose the Senate Republican Conference voluntary moratorium on so-called 'earmarks,' "" Lugar said in a prepared statement. ""At a moment in which over-spending by the federal government perpetuates annual deficits of over $1 trillion a year, the Congress is being asked to debate a congressional earmark spending resolution which will save no money, even while giving the impression that the Congress is attempting to meet the public demand to reduce spending. Instead of surrendering constitutional authority to Washington bureaucrats and the Obama Administration, Congress should focus on reducing spending on both entitlement and discretionary spending programs. Providing the Obama Administration with greater authority to direct spending does not accomplish this goal, and eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending.""

It's the last part -- the notion that ""eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending"" -- that caught our eye. We wondered whether it's accurate. 
Since earmarks are simply provisions of larger spending bills that direct where lawmakers want the money to go, earmarks, strictly speaking, do not increase the cost of a spending bill -- they only tell where portions of that spending should go. If Congress doesn't specify where the money should be spent, it would be up to executive branch officials to make the decision instead. 
Joshua Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a group that favors balanced budgets and reducing the national debt, calls Lugar's statement ""accurate."" 
""The moratoriums would not save any money,"" Gordon said. ""They just change who is allowed to direct where money is spent."" 
Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, agrees that Lugar is right, though he adds that the existence of earmarks increases the upward pressure on federal spending indirectly, since lawmakers ""know they need to support the relevant powers on the spending committees in order to have their earmarks approved."" 
Mitchell calls earmarks a ""gateway drug"" that ""seduces members into treating the federal budget as a good thing that can be milked for home-state/district projects."" 
Meanwhile, Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group critical of earmarks, said Lugar is correct that, under the current budgeting process, eliminating earmarks won't save money. That's because when earmarks are stricken by congressional vote, the money is typically reallocated to other spending, rather than saved outright. But he added that it would be possible to devise a budgeting process in which spending goes down if an earmark is eliminated.

A Lugar spokesman, Mark Helmke, said that as long as the administration does not use money dedicated to earmarks for debt reduction, the moratorium would not reduce spending. ""The only way that spending is reduced is to cut program spending, and Sen. Lugar is prepared to do that,"" Helmke said.

Indirectly, earmarks may have an I'll-scratch-your-back-if-you-scratch-mine effect that pushes spending upward. Under the status quo, however, our experts agreed that Lugar is largely correct -- ending earmarks won't directly reduce spending, only re-direct it. There are other plausible reasons to advocate for an earmark ban, such as ending unseemly horse-trading with taxpayer dollars. But without a thorough overhaul of the budgeting process, saving money directly isn't one of them. We rate Lugar's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/18/richard-lugar/richard-lugar-says-ending-earmarks-wont-save-money/

TSA administrator claims new body scanners emit as much radiation as three minutes of air travel
","
New airport security measures are coming under fire from pilots and passengers, who fear the latest post-9/11 protocols are too invasive and potentially harmful.

You've probably seen the stories. The Transportation Security Administration's new full-body scanners, which are in use at 68 airports nationwide, transfer a potentially harmful amount of radiation and produce what amounts to a naked image, critics say. And the alternative to the scan, an embarrassing pat down, may be even worse.

Pilots' unions oppose the measures, as do an increasing number of passengers -- who feel the federal government has taken things too far.

PolitiFact can't weigh in on that. But we can explore the safety concerns about the full-body scan.

Particularly, we found worth analyzing the defense mounted by John Pistole, head of the TSA. During a Nov. 16, 2010, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Pistole said the ""radiation coming from those machines are equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet."" The TSA, on its website, says the radiation emitted from the body scan is equivalent to just two minutes of a plane flight.

Are those claims credible?

Yes. Though there is some disagreement.

Let us explain. In preparing to deploy the scanners to airports across the country, the TSA studied the amount of radiation a person would be exposed to per scan to determine if the machines were safe. Scientists at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory found that the effective dose per screening was 1.58 microrems of radiation, while a researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, said an adult would be exposed to 2.4 microrems of radiation per scan.

We understand those figures mean nothing to most people. So let's put it into perspective.

A single chest X-ray exposes a person to between 8,000 and 10,000 microrems (or 8 to 10 millirems), according to experts at Princeton University and the Department of Energy. A pack-a-day smoker exposes himself to 15,000 to 20,000 microrems of radiation a year (tobacco leaves used in making cigarettes contain radioactive lead and polonium). Put simply, it would take at least 3,300 body scans to reach the equivalent of one chest X-ray.

What's also important to note -- and a bit scary -- is that you're being exposed to radiation right now. Radiation is naturally occurring in our environment no matter where you are. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimates that each year, the average adult is exposed to 300 millirems of naturally occurring radiation (300,000 microrems) and 60 millirems (60,000 microrems) of man-made radiation. Pistole, in his claim, is talking about naturally occurring cosmic radiation you're exposed to during airplane travel.

The amount of cosmic radiation a person is exposed to varies based on a number of factors, but to oversimplify, a key component is how high you are above sea level. People living in Denver, which is 1 mile above sea level, are exposed to more cosmic radiation than someone living in Florida. And people flying 30,000 feet in the air are exposed to more radiation than people on the ground.

The amount of radiation varies depending upon the specific flight plan, but the Environmental Protection Agency, the World Health Organization and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission all say that a person on a six- to eight-hour flight will be exposed to somewhere around 2,000 to 5,000 microrems of radiation. For our analysis, however, we are relying on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which calculates the radiation exposure per hour based on the altitude of the flight.

According to NOAA, a person flying at 30,000 feet will be exposed to between 285 and 406 microrems of radiation an hour, or between 4.75 and 6.77 microrems per minute of flight.

All the numbers and science back up Pistole's claim -- as little as three minutes of air travel produces the equivalent amount of radiation as one TSA body scan. By most estimates, Pistole's claim actually is conservative.

However, all scientists aren't sold on the comparison. Nor are they sold on the safety of the scanners. We think it's important for you hear their side, too.

Four faculty members at the University of California, San Francisco, authored a letter in April expressing their concerns about the body scanning devices. Primarily, the professors worried that the radiation was being concentrated in the skin and underlying tissue, and that it was not being dispersed throughout the entire body. That concentration of radiation to the skin could be ""dangerously high,"" wrote the faculty members -- John Sedat, Marc Shuman, Robert Stroud and David Agard, who said a comparison to cosmic radiation spread over the entire body is misleading.

The FDA, in a detailed response, said the concerns were unfounded, and health risks associated with the full body scanners were ""minuscule.""

To be clear, this fact check isn't declaring TSA's new full-body scanners safe. We're simply looking at the comparative exposure to radiation as suggested by Pistole, who said that the radiation coming from the new TSA body scanners ""are equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet."" It may sound strange, but it's right. We rate this statement True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/18/john-pistole/tsa-administrator-claims-new-body-scanners-emit-mu/

Rep. John Boehner says federal workers make twice as much as their private sector counterparts
","
House GOP Leader John Boehner talks a lot about the need to create jobs as he prepares to take the U.S. House of Representatives’ helm next year.

But the federal government is one entity Boehner thinks shouldn’t create jobs. While talking with reporters Nov. 10, Boehner advocated a hiring and pay freeze on federal workers.

""It’s gotten to a point where the average federal worker makes twice as much as the average private sector worker,"" Boehner said.

Boehner’s office says he bases that claim on an August 13, 2010 USA Today article, headlined ""Federal workers earning double their private counterparts.""

The article uses Bureau of Economic Analysis data from the U.S. Commerce Department to conclude that federal civil servants earned average pay and benefits of $123,049 in 2009, while private workers made $61,051 in total compensation.

Although the USA Today statistics back up Boehner’s claim, a BEA spokesman says the newspaper’s numbers don’t account for the different mix of jobs performed by federal and private sector employees.

The statistic cited by USA Today also includes benefits, which tend to be higher for federal employees. That’s an important distinction because we think the average person would interpret ""makes twice as much"" as getting twice the wages.

We said as much recently when we examined a claim about federal worker pay by Rand Paul, the Republican senator elect from Kentucky. In that item we found BEA statistics show federal employees earned an average salary of $81,258, when benefits were stripped out, compared with $50,464 for private sector employees.

That’s nearly 40 percent short of double.

A statement on BEA’s website explains that the private sector workforce includes a broader range of jobs than the federal government, from minimum wage positions to CEOs. Federal civilian jobs focus on professional areas like law, accounting and economics that require higher education. The federal government has also contracted out many of its lower-skilled, lower paid positions to private industry, which makes the federal average go higher.

John Berry, director of the federal Office of Personnel Management, says it’s untrue that federal workers are paid double the private sector. The USA Today article, he says, compares ""apples to oranges."" OPM maintains that federal workers actually make 24 percent less than their private-sector counterparts.

""The federal workforce today is highly specialized,"" he says. ""Thirty years ago, over 22 percent of our workforce was in blue collar jobs. Now that percentage has dropped by half while the percentage of IT and health professionals has doubled. Data clearly shows that many of these highly specialized workers – doctors, nurses, cybersecurity professionals – are paid less than their private sector counterparts and are making a significant sacrifice in pay to serve their neighbors.""

OPM spokeswoman Jennifer Dorsey did not respond to repeated requests for data that would show lower federal pay for those workers. She did send an email that said the average federal salary is $65,000, and ""the figure that was used by the USAToday reporter was and is inaccurate.""

So we looked at some federal statistics ourselves, using Bureau of Labor data for mean annual salaries from May 2009. Those statistics list a $43,460 mean yearly salary for the nation’s 130.6 million private sector workers, and a $71,500 mean salary for its 1.9 million federal employees.

That’s about 35 percent short of double.

Just as the BEA data does, the labor data’s private sector average also incorporates hundreds of jobs for which there’s no federal counterpart. So we looked at some specific examples -- the doctors, nurses and cybersecurity professionals that Berry mentioned.

Federally-employed doctors make about the same ($173,400 a year) as their private sector counterparts ($173,860). Federal registered nurses actually make more: $77,830, compared with $66,530. BLS didn’t have a ""cybersecurity professionals"" category. We found federal ""computer specialists"" made $88,920, compared to $78,010 for their private-sector counterparts.

So where does that leave us? 
That’s why we rate Boehner’s claim False.",/factchecks/2010/nov/18/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-federal-workers-make-twice-much-/

One Wisconsin Now says Scott Walker told the UW Regents to expect budget cuts
","
Wisconsin’s much-praised university system doesn’t rely on the state budget nearly as much as it used to, but more than $1 billion a year is nothing to sneeze at.

So you might excuse the UW System Board of Regents, a bunch of appointees of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, if they were nervous when Republican Governor-elect Scott Walker -- who has pledged to cut taxes and spending -- arrived to address the group days after his Nov. 2, 2010 election win.

Walker’s speech was an anxiety-booster, at least according to the account in Madison’s Capital Times, which headlined its account: ""Taste of things to come: Do more with less, Gov.-elect Walker tells regents.""

That story prompted the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now-- a frequent Walker critic -- to label Walker a hypocrite and add him to its new ""GOP Promise Breakers"" website.

Walker, the group charged in a Nov. 9, 2010 news release, ""defended the University of Wisconsin system on the campaign trail, but in his first meeting with the regents, told them to prepare for cuts.""

The group added: ""Scott Walker participated in debates with both Republican and Democratic opponents. He traveled around Wisconsin (even on taxpayer expense at times) and visited university campuses. And nowhere can we find him saying that the solution to skyrocketing tuition and lost opportunity for young Wisconsinites was cutting UW funding.""

So, did Walker declare the UW system is in line for cuts?

The group says so, but we decided to do our own homework on this one.

Scot Ross, executive director of the One Wisconsin Now, told PolitiFact Wisconsin the source was the Capital Times story. Specifically, he cited a line in the story that paraphrased Walker’s remarks to regents as a directive that university officials ""do more with less.""

The story goes on to quote Walker as saying: ""It isn’t just always about more money.""

Said Ross: ""If ‘less’ doesn't mean a reduction from what the system currently has, I guess One Wisconsin Now will have to ask Walker to explain to (us) the English language.""

In the government vernacular, of course, a ""cut"" is often a smaller than expected increase.

So, let’s call our class to order.

First, One Wisconsin Now says Walker defended the UW system’s value during the campaign. That is not in dispute. We looked at numerous Walker statements from the campaign. He typically spoke in general terms, such as education quality and the system as a driver for the state’s economy.

But nowhere did we find a spot where he pledged there would be no cuts, or promised an increase. So, when One Wisconsin Now spins the hypocrite angle, its starting point is off the mark.

As for Walker’s brief speech, we listened to an audio recording of it.

Walker started ominously but generally, saying that balancing a state budget with a nearly $3 billion projected shortfall would be a ""serious challenge."" He said ""great opportunities"" could come out of that ""formidable task."" He pledged to ""make sure"" the system’s goal of increasing the number of graduates was met, and offered a road map into his thinking:

""It isn’t just always about more money,"" Walker said, the portion quoted by the Capital Times. ""It’s going to be about finding ways to take the dollars we have and find new ways -- with flexibility, innovation and creativity -- to apply those dollars in the best way possible to meet those goals campus-by-campus across the state.""

Walker concluded by appealing for innovative ideas to help meet the budget and educational goals.

Walker did not use the word ""cuts"" and did not even say ""do more with less,"" the paraphrase that became the headline -- and the primary source for One Wisconsin Now’s claim.

The clearest phrases are ""not...always about more money"" and ""take the dollars we have."" If anything, both suggest a freeze, but don’t spell c-u-t.

What did the regents themselves think?

""It’s a reach to say he called for cuts,"" board president Charles Pruitt told us.

Another regent, Danae Davis, didn’t hear ""cuts"" either but said she understood how someone might jump to that conclusion based on Walker’s suggestion of new efficiencies.

Pruitt said regents actually were encouraged by Walker’s call for collaboration and hint of granting the university system long-sought freedoms from centralized state government rules.

Ah, but in the halls of academia nothing is as simple as A-B-C.

Asked what the regents would consider a ""cut"" to the university budget, Pruitt outlined a scenario under which the system could get more from Governor Walker than under its current budget -- but still consider it a ""cut.""

It’s that old government vernacular thing again.

The university system considers built-in cost increases as the starting point for its annual budget request. The system is  looking for a 2 percent ""cost to continue"" increase for fiscal year 2011-’12 and wants a 2 percent to 3 percent increase on top of that for various initiatives.

Walker could follow the example set by Doyle, whose first budget resulted in an 11 percent drop in real state dollars for the system.

But even if he boosts the university’s budget by 1 percent -- the exact average annual increase over the last decade -- the regents would consider that a cut, according to Pruitt’s formula.

Before we ring the bell, let’s review:

The group One Wisconsin Now says that in the wake of the election, Walker went to the UW Board of Regents and said he would cut the system’s budget. A review of his remarks, however, finds nothing close to that dire language. If anything, the words chosen suggested a freeze, not a reduction in state support. Of course, the regents -- and many others with a stake in the next budget -- would consider a less-than-inflation increase a ""cut.""

But no matter the definition, Walker didn’t say anything about cuts. So when One Wisconsin Now claims he did, that grades out as False.",/factchecks/2010/nov/18/one-wisconsin-now/one-wisconsin-now-says-scott-walker-told-uw-regent/

Austin police chief says Texas leads nation in drunk driving deaths
","
Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo cut to the chase during an interview about a law that lets drivers convicted of driving while intoxicated return to the road.

""We're in the worst state in the union when it comes to drunk driving and drunk driving fatalities,"" Acevedo said in an interview with the Austin American-Statesman and Austin's KVUE-TV, Channel 24. ""We lead the country in drunk driving fatalities."" The interview aired Sunday Nov. 14.

Texas, No. 1 in alcohol-fueled driving deaths? We asked Acevedo how he reached his conclusion, then started checking national comparisons.

An August 2010 report posted online appears to support the claim. In 2009, Texas tallied 1,235 alcohol-impaired fatalities, according to the report by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, which says the statistic reflects fatalities in crashes involving a driver or motorcycle rider with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 grams per deciliter or greater.

The 2009 Texas total exceeded by more than 250 the 950 alcohol-related driving fatalities in California, which was the No. 2 state in the dubious category. States rounding out this top 10 were Florida (770), Pennsylvania (406), South Carolina (377), North Carolina (363), Georgia (331), Ohio (324), New York (321) and Illinois (319). Texas also topped other states in alcohol-impaired fatalities in 2008, the report says.

The report also lays out the percentage of total traffic deaths due to alcohol impairment. Texas ranked No. 5 by this gauge, with alcohol impairment accounting for 40 percent of the 3,071 driving deaths in 2009. Four states had higher percentages: Hawaii, 48 percent of 109 deaths; Connecticut, 44 percent of 223 deaths; South Carolina, 42 percent of 894 deaths; and Washington, 42 percent of 492 deaths. Texas's 40 percent matched the percentages of deaths linked to alcohol impairment in South Dakota, Kansas and Rhode Island.

Though Texas last year experienced one of the country's largest reductions in total traffic fatalities -- from 3,476 deaths in 2008 to 3,071 in 2009 -- more people still died on Texas roads than in any other state. As with drunk-driving deaths, that toll is influenced by factors such as Texas's size, population and number of miles traveled on its roads.

In search of expert perspective on the meaning of such numbers, we reached Bernie Fette, a senior researcher at the Center for Transportation Safety at the Texas Transportation Institute in College Station. He showed us two other ways to compare alcohol-related driving deaths by state, based on the percentage of such deaths for every 100 million vehicle miles traveled or on the number of licensed drivers in each state.

Online, NHTSA has posted state-by-state rates of alcohol-impaired driving fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled for 2005 through 2008. We checked the rates over those years for the 10 states that had the most alcohol-impaired driving fatalities in 2009--and found that Texas's rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, ranging from .55 in 2007 to a high of .59 in 2006, exceeded that of all but one of the states. South Carolina's rate, ranging from .81 in 2008 to .91 in 2007, was higher every year.

The federal agency also provides information on the number of licensed drivers by state as of 2008. We divided the number of alcohol-impaired driving deaths in each state for that year by its licensed driver total. According to the resulting ratios, Texas ranked 9th nationally in alcohol-impaired driving deaths that year. States with higher ratios were topped by Wyoming, followed by Mississippi, South Carolina, Montana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota and West Virginia.

We also wondered how Texas compares in alcohol-related driving deaths when population is taken into account. We divided the 2009 alcohol-impaired driving deaths for each state by U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for each state. Result: Texas trailed 15 states in deaths per resident. States with higher ratios, led by Wyoming, included North Dakota, Montana, South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Dakota, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, New Mexico, Kansas, Delaware and Missouri.

So, it looks like Texas is not No. 1 for drunk driving deaths by every measure.

Still, Fette suggested, no matter how you look at the stats on alcohol-impaired driving deaths in Texas, the news isn't good. ""If all of the measures rank at the top or nearly at the top, no matter what the (state's) rank is, it's a serious problem that deserves attention,"" he said.

Our take: Several statistical approaches show Texas behind other states in the rate of alcohol-related driving deaths. But it's also reasonable to focus on the sheer number of deaths linked to drunk driving.

Gov. Rick Perry says that 153 businesses have moved from California to Texas
","
Looks like Gov. Rick Perry has a new favorite number. During the campaign, he frequently touted an 850,000-net-job gain during his tenure. On the media circuit to promote his new book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, he seems fond of 153. 
""Since the first of the year, 153 businesses at last count had moved out of California to Texas,"" he said on ""Fox & Friends"" Nov. 4. Then on Nov. 8, he said it to host Greta Van Susteren on Fox News's ""On the Record."" Later that day he told the host of Comedy Central's ""Daily Show,"" Jon Stewart, that ""153 businesses have moved out of California to Texas since the first of the year through August."" 
Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger told us that ""the 153 figure came from a Dun & Bradstreet analysis of California business migration from January 2010 to August 2010."" Dun & Bradstreet is a New Jersey-based business-intelligence company with a global database of some 171 million companies in more than 190 countries. 
""Texas was the largest recipient of outbound California business migration with 153 companies,"" she said. When we asked her for the analysis, she directed us to a D&B official. 
Mark Muckerman, D&B government relations director, told us that the company conducted an internal exercise — most of which he said has not been shared outside the company — of ""interstate moves of business locations,"" or businesses that have relocated out of state. He said that 153 businesses relocated from California to Texas from January through August. 
However, Muckerman said, the D&B count does not mean that 153 individual companies pulled up stakes in California to settle in Texas. Muckerman offered this example: If one company with five offices in California keeps its headquarters in state and moves its branches out of state, including one to Texas, that would figure into the D&B count that Perry cites. 
Muckerman revealed one other caveat. He said the ""interstate moves"" don't include new business locations. So if a California company decided to open a brand-new packaging facility in Texas, it wouldn't be counted among the businesses that have moved from California to Texas. 
Muckerman said he didn't know how Perry learned of D&B's internal report though he presumes someone at D&B spoke to someone in the governor's office. 
We wondered how many business sites moved from Texas to California. Muckerman told us there were 92 such moves, leaving Texas with a net gain of 61 business sites from the Golden State. 
How did California rank in landing business sites from other states? Muckerman declined to disclose that information. 
Lacking more data from D&B's research, we struggled to evaluate the significance of 153 business sites having moved to Texas from California over the past eight months. 
Muckerman said that ""from a purely economical development viewpoint,"" any gain from another state is good news. Putting Texas' numbers in perspective, he said, 19,585 business sites in the D&B database showed a change of address from one state to another between January and August. Of those, 1,280 relocated from other states to Texas, which ran second to Florida in relocations. Florida's haul was 2,032, Muckerman said. 
Where does that leave us? 
Wishing for more data. And if it surfaces, we'll consider revisiting this subject. 
Still, based on the limited information D&B has shared, it looks like Texas netted 61 business sites from California from January through August, less than half the one-way total that Perry cites. Also, as D&B advised us, not all of the 153 sites that came here from there necessarily reflect whole companies making the move east. Instead, the 153 moves could have involved individual offices or branches of firms that continue to do business in California.

Michele Bachmann says $250,000 in gross sales means a tax increase.
","
Tax rates will go up in 2011 unless Congress acts to extend the current rates. Members are talking about voting on the matter before the end of the year.

The sticking point is exactly what a final tax package will look like. President Barack Obama campaigned on making permanent the current rates for the middle class, but raising rates for couples who make more than $250,000 and individuals who make more than $200,000. Most Republicans (and some Democrats) would like to see all the current rates made permanent.

Now various compromise ideas are being floated, with ideas for extending some rates temporarily or attempting reforms of the tax code.

Tea party favorite Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., told George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America that she was willing to accept a compromise as long as all the current tax rates stayed the same for taxpayers of all incomes.

But, she said, she opposed a compromise that would be attached to extending unemployment benefits.

Stephanopoulos then asked why it was okay for the wealthy to get their tax cuts extended, but not okay to extend unemployment benefits for the jobless.

""Well, remember again what this is. It's a massive tax increase, and it's on the people who are the job creators,"" Bachmann said. ""And people want to think that these are millionaires, sitting in leather chairs, lighting their cigars with $100 bills. That's not what we're talking about. These are people who, who are carpet layers who maybe employ two or three other guys, or a plumber, maybe himself and his brother, and it's $250,000 in gross sales for their business. They're the ones that are looking at massive tax increases.""

That's probably a compelling narrative for Bachmann -- big government taxes the little guys. We first fact-checked similar claims during the 2008 election, when Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, aka Joe the Plumber, worried he'd get a tax increase under Obama's plan if he bought a company that took in around $250,000 a year.

It wasn't true then, and it isn't true now. Here's why: Plumbers -- or any other small business owner -- get to deduct their business expenses, so they'd have to be bringing in more than $250,000 in gross sales. The tax laws allow small business owners to deduct all kinds of business expenses: employees' pay, supplies, a car or truck, fuel costs, advertising, association dues, utilities, shop repairs, and the list goes on. (For more details, read chapter 8 of the Tax Guide for Small Business published by the IRS.)

Bachmann said that the tax increases kick in at ""$250,000 in gross sales,"" which traditionally means total sales at invoice values, or everything the plumbers billed. And, she said the plumbers would be looking at ""massive tax increases,"" when actually the top two rates would be increasing from 33 percent to 36 percent, and from 35 percent to 39.6 percent.

Finally, of all taxpayers who declare business income, about 2 percent declare enough income to see tax increases if the rates on the top brackets expire. Most small business owners would not see a tax increase, though the most profitable small businesses would.

We're not sure why Bachmann distorted the point about gross sales. As we said, it's something that's been explained several times. Good Morning America posted a note on its website after Bachmann's appearance, noting that her statement was wrong. We asked her spokesperson for a comment but didn't hear back.

The proposed increases have been discussed many times and for several years. Her misstatement of the facts on Good Morning America seems designed to scare small business owners into thinking they're in line for a tax increase, even if their income is modest. For distorting the tax proposals to a ridiculous extent, we rate her statement Pants on Fire.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Taxes', 'Paul Krugman']","
Paul Krugman said Obama's deficit co-chairs suggested tax cuts for the rich
","The co-chairs of President Barack Obama's deficit commission released their ideas for getting control of the federal deficit last week. Economist Paul Krugman had some pretty harsh words for them.

""I think the most important thing to understand is that the commission did not do its job. It has a bunch of ideas for reducing the deficit, some good, some really bad, some of them not ideas about reducing the deficit at all,"" Krugman said on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. ""But it's easy to come up with ideas. I can come up with ideas for reducing the deficit while patting my tummy and rubbing my head, you know?""

The key to reducing the deficit, Krugman said, is reducing the future growth of health care costs. ""They completely wimped out on that,"" Krugman said. ""They simply assumed they were going to reduce the rate of health care cost growth. And they said, how are we going to do that? By monitoring and taking additional measures as necessary. So the report was completely empty on the only thing that really matters and then had a whole bunch of things which involved large tax cuts for the top bracket. What on earth is that doing in there?""

Here, we'll fact-check Krugman's statement that the plan included large tax cuts for the top bracket. We looked at his claim that the panel didn't address health care spending in a separate report.

First, a bit about the commission: Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in February, 2010, asking it to identify ""policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run."" Obama asked the commission to propose ideas designed to balance the budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. He appointed six members, including bipartisan co-chairs, and asked Congressional leaders from both parties -- Democrats Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and Republicans Mitch McConnell and John Boehner -- to appoint three each, for a total of 18 members.

The proposal released Nov. 10 was not the final report, which requires approval from 14 of 18 members and has a deadline of Dec. 1. Rather, the proposal summarized the ideas of the two co-chairs: Alan Simpson, a former Republican Senator from Wyoming and Erskine Bowles, former White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. We're not sure why the two took the step of releasing their proposals ahead of the deadline; some news reports speculate it was an attempt to prod other members to keep negotiating before the December deadline. If the members are not able to come to an agreement, it's possible that no report will be issued.

The co-chairs' proposal included several big ideas for changing the tax code. Its stated goals are to lower rates, simplify the tax code, broaden the base of taxable income, reduce tax exemptions and credits, improve compliance, make the tax code more business friendly and reduce the deficit. The proposal outlines several different options for how this can be achieved, but primarily it advocates eliminating exemptions and deductions and then lowering tax rates across the board.

The proposal suggests several potential rate changes, depending on how many popular credits and exemptions are ended, such as the home mortgage interest deduction, the exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit. The more exemptions and credits you curtail, the lower overall rates can be. It also includes tax measures that could increase taxes on the wealthy such as taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, which means investors would pay higher taxes. If all exemptions were phased out, the co-chairs suggested the following rate reductions:

• Combine the bottom two tax brackets with rates of 10 percent and 15 percent and lower the rate to 8 percent.
• Combine the next two tax brackets with rates of 25 percent and 28 percent and lower the rate to 14 percent.
• Combine the two highest tax brackets with rates of 33 percent and 35 percent and lower the rate to 23 percent.
• Reduce the corporate tax rate from the current 35 percent to 26 percent. Essentially, the proposal makes more income taxable while lowering overall rates, and it estimates that this would cause tax collection to go up, by about $80 billion in 2015 and a cumulative total of $751 billion for the years 2012 through 2020. The report also includes the following fairly broad caveat: ""Rates based on very rough static estimates. No behavioral effects are assumed. Magnitude of tax expenditures estimated broadly.""

We e-mailed Krugman about his comments, and he told us he was primarily concerned with the rate reductions for taxpayers in the top incomes.

In his New York Times column of Nov. 12, he explained his concerns in more detail: What the co-chairmen are proposing, Krugman wrote, ""is a mixture of tax cuts and tax increases -- tax cuts for the wealthy, tax increases for the middle class. They suggest eliminating tax breaks that, whatever you think of them, matter a lot to middle-class Americans -- the deductibility of health benefits and mortgage interest -- and using much of the revenue gained thereby, not to reduce the deficit, but to allow sharp reductions in both the top marginal tax rate and in the corporate tax rate. ""It will take time to crunch the numbers here, but this proposal clearly represents a major transfer of income upward, from the middle class to a small minority of wealthy Americans. And what does any of this have to do with deficit reduction?"" Krugman didn't mention on This Week that the report also includes rate reductions for people of lower incomes. And he didn't mention the prospect of higher taxes on capital gains and dividends. We should note that the proposal also suggests more taxes for Social Security for higher incomes. Right now, taxes apply only to the first $106,800 of a person's income, and that number is indexed for inflation. The proposal suggests increasing that amount faster. So is it possible that the wealthy would pay less in taxes under such a plan? As we were researching this report, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center published an initial analysis of the co-chairs' proposals. They analyzed the proposal two ways, comparing the recent proposal with current tax rates, and comparing it with what the rates would be if all the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 were allowed to expire, which is current law. If you compare the proposal's suggestions to current tax rates, then the new plan does not give an advantage to tax payers with high incomes. Rather, it increases tax rates slightly for most taxpayers and increases them a bit more for the very highest earners. ""If you're looking at it compared to current rates, it's about proportional,"" said Eric Toder, a co-author of the analysis. ""It's actually raising taxes a little more than proportionally at the very high end."" And in fact, the report found that the biggest changes are for taxpayers in the top 1 percent, and especially the top 0.1 percent -- the wealthiest of the wealthy. Toder said the tax increases at the top end are due in large part to the provision that allows capital gains and dividends to be taxed as ordinary income. If you compare the co-chairs' proposals to letting the Bush tax cuts expire completely, then the tax code becomes more regressive -- that is, skewed in favor of higher incomes. But that's because high earners -- the top 20 percent -- tended to benefit more from the Bush tax cuts, the report said. We should also note that because the changes the co-chairs suggest are so far-ranging, the Tax Policy Center did not attempt to model the behavioral effects of the tax changes, which means how people would make different decisions based on the new tax rates. These effects could be significant. ""The problem is that there are so many moving parts put into motion with this plan, that it's hard to tell where things will settle out,"" said Roberton Williams, an economist and senior fellow at the center, who specializes in tax policy and its effect on the deficit. For example, if the home mortgage interest deduction is eliminated, the cost of owning a home goes up. That would influence people's decisions about whether to buy houses or not. That could affect the broader economy. And it's the same with charitable giving: If you eliminate the deduction for charitable donations, some taxpayers would stop giving to charity. That could affect the broader economy, too. ""It is very difficult, if not impossible, to model this plan with the resources we have available today,"" he said. Getting back to our ruling statement, Krugman is right that the plan does include lower tax rates for the top incomes. But the plan also includes lower tax rates for people who make less, and it includes some tax increases for higher incomes. It gets rid of exemptions that have diverse effects. Overall, would taxes go down for the higher incomes? It's very difficult to say; even the analysis from the Tax Policy Center can't account for all the effects of such dramatic change. Krugman's comments on the plan on This Week left out a good bit of context. We rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/17/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-said-obamas-deficit-co-chairs-suggest/

Rep. Tim Ryan not shy about bringing home the bacon
","
You can say what you like about spending and pork, but delivering for the district by bringing home the bacon is a badge of honor for many members of Congress. 
  
It's the reason why Rep. Tim Ryan's campaign boasts that the Niles Democrat ""has secured a grand total of $116,838,763 to date and has an additional $27,095,000 pending in Fiscal Year 2010 spending bills. 
""That means more money to help promote economic growth, strengthen America’s infrastructure and improve the quality of life in the Mahoning Valley,"" the statement adds, with an exclamation point. 
More than $143 million is a lot of kapusta, or cabbage, as they might say in the valley. 
PolitiFact Ohio asked Ryan’s staff to back up the figures, and the congressman's communications director, Heather McMahon, said they were actually outdated and understated. 
She said that appropriations for the 17th District, ""as secured by Congressman Tim Ryan in his eight years in office,"" total $140,133,763 -- with an additional $40,200,000 pending in the Fiscal Year 2011 budget. 
And, she said, ""The figures do not include other grants and funds that Congressman Ryan has assisted in bringing to the 17th District"" -- notably a $20 million Department of Transportation grant signed last summer for the Kent Central Gateway project. 
Saying that Ryan has ""secured"" funding ""means that the congressman submitted each project to the appropriate subcommittee as a piece of congressionally directed spending that has been attached to his name,"" McMahon said. ""Projects that receive funding must be approved by subcommittee, the House appropriations committee, and also the full House."" 
The directed appropriations she is describing are better known as earmarks. 
Ryan was well-positioned to secure them as a member since 2006 of the powerful House Committee on Appropriations and as a member of the defense appropriations subcommittee, another key panel. He topped the list of lawmakers who scored the highest dollar amounts in the House's defense bill for fiscal 2011, according to research by the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense and the newspaper The Hill. 
Critics say earmarks contribute to runaway spending, and contend legislators can improperly use earmarks to enrich themselves. Ryan’s view is that earmarks are a way to direct federal dollars to worthwhile local projects and that they account for a tiny percentage of the federal budget. 
Ryan's office provided an overview of funding he secured in nine budget categories, with example projects. Defense topped the list, with a total of $61,154,000 passed and signed. The money included $17.5 million in earmarks for fiscal 2007, which Ryan inserted into a Defense Department spending bill, for Lockheed Martin's development in Akron of a high-altitude airship. 
Detailed breakdowns appear on Ryan's congressional website. The figures match those listed by critics of earmarks, Taxpayers for Common Sense and the Center for Responsive Politics.

Defending Trump's request for wall funding, congressman inflates foreign aid plan
","Lawmakers don’t want to be blamed for the partial federal government shutdown, which is now the longest in American history. So, after President Donald Trump’s speech Jan. 8, some Republicans took aim at Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer for withholding support for Trump’s plan. U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from Concord, was among those critics. ""Just last week, Democrats voted to give $54 billion in foreign aid. All @POTUS@realDonaldTrump is asking for is 10 cents of every dollar they want to give to foreign governments to go to secure our border and build a wall. Is that too much to ask?"" Hudson tweeted after Trump’s speech. According to the White House website, Trump ""has requested $5.7 billion for construction of approximately 234 miles of new steel barrier on the Southern Border, a $4.1 billion increase over the Senate bill."" To be clear: Experts, even right-leaning ones, agree that neither Trump’s request nor a wall would be enough by itself to secure the border. (Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan watchdog organization, called the wall a ""waste"" and The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, last year said the wall ""won’t work."") But let’s set that aside and look solely at Hudson’s math and his characterization of the bill the Democrat-controlled U.S. House passed on Jan. 3. Hudson’s tweet mischaracterizes both what it pays for and who has supported it. Not quite $54B in aid Generally speaking, estimates on foreign aid spending sometimes vary depending on which agencies and funds are considered, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. For instance, the council estimates aid at more than $40 billion per year, and The Economist reports that foreign aid levels remained at $35 billion for 2017 and 2018. As it relates to the bill in question – HR 21, which has passed the House but hasn’t come up for a vote in the Senate – FactCheck.org and the Washington Post noted that the $54 billion includes more than foreign aid. It also includes $16 billion for the State Department, they reported. The State Department operations budget typically includes a range of items, from embassy security to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s salary, said Stephen Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. So it ""would be wrong"" to conflate department funding with foreign aid funding, Ellis told PolitiFact in an email. Hudson spokesman Tatum Gibson acknowledged that State Department funding was included in the number the congressman cited, but didn’t explain why. ""The point is Democrats voted for tens of billions of dollars for that – roughly $12 billion more than what the president requested – but won’t support President Trump’s requested $5 billion to secure our own borders,"" Gibson said. If we subtract the $16 billion for the state department from Hudson’s claim, that leaves us with $38 billion in foreign aid spending. Trump’s $5.7 billion request is about 15 percent of that. Not exactly Democrats' idea Now to the origins of the $54 billion spending plan. It’s misleading to cast the spending plan as a Democratic proposal. Spending at the same level was first proposed when Republicans controlled the House, as both FactCheck.org and the Washington Post included in their stories. In June, the House Committee on Appropriations approved a $54 billion State and Foreign Operations bill. And in July, the Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a similar $54.4 billion budget. Our ruling Hudson said ""Democrats voted to give $54 billion in foreign aid,"" and that Trump is asking for ""10 cents of every dollar they want to give to foreign governments to go to secure our border and build a wall."" Hudson has a point that Trump’s $5.7 billion request is far less than the amount spent on foreign aid. But he incorrectly included standard State Department funding in his claim about foreign aid funds. More importantly, his tweet misleads by giving the impression that the spending plan was Democrats’ idea. We rate his claim Mostly False.

Fox Business host clashes with Ocasio-Cortez over taxing the rich
","Pro-business pundits are pushing back against progressive politicians who argue that, given America’s wealth inequality, the U.S. tax code should not allow billionaires to exist. Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo fired back at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who said it’s morally wrong that billionaires can coexist alongside people living in extreme poverty. Ocasio-Cortez has discussed a 70 percent marginal tax rate on income that exceeds $10 million a year. Bartiromo called this view ""quite naive,"" saying high earners already pay their fair share. Besides, they would have less incentive to work hard if a larger portion of their income went to fund the government, she argued. ""What is it going to do to the economy if you make it so economically difficult for the highest earners?"" Bartiromo said on Fox News, via satellite from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""According to the Tax Foundation, the top 10 percent of earners already pay almost 80 percent of all taxes. So you already have the highest earners paying their fair share."" We’ll leave it to others to debate whether taxes on the wealthy should stay flat or go up. Here, we wanted to know if the numbers Bartiromo cited reflect the proportion of taxes paid by the rich. Turns out, they’re pretty far off. Bartiromo did not reply to our request for comment. But a post on Fox News’ website about her response to Ocasio-Cortez cited the pro-business Tax Foundation. We reached out to the Tax Foundation, which pointed us to a recent study that summarized the latest federal income and tax data from the Congressional Budget Office's ""Distribution of Household Income, 2015,"" including individual and corporate income tax, payroll and excise taxes. The numbers were not as high as what Bartiromo said. The following chart shows the share of the aforementioned federal taxes paid by America’s top earners. The three bars on the left give a granular view of the top 10 percent of earners’ tax burden. The blue bar on the right shows the top decile’s overall share.  According to the latest federal data, which a Tax Foundation analyst confirmed, the top 10 percent of earners paid around 55 percent of all federal taxes — not almost 80 percent, as Bartiromo said.  She would have been closer to the mark if she’d limited her claim to income tax, of which the top 10 percent accounted for around 74 percent. However, Bartiromo’s statement referred to ""all taxes."" Bartiromo said, ""According to the Tax Foundation, the top 10 percent of earners already pay almost 80 percent of all taxes."" The latest federal data shows the top 10 percent of earners paid around 55 percent of all federal taxes. Her point that the wealthy pay a lot of taxes was right, but her number was significantly off.

No, 18 million illegal immigrants did not get a 'government check' this month
","As the government shutdown continues its stretch as the longest in U.S. history, claims on who is and isn’t affected, and everything in between, have been called into question. If you still have some lingering questions, we tackled many of them here and here. But now, a viral Facebook post is alleging that millions of undocumented immigrants have received checks from the government while federal workers remain unpaid. One post claiming this, shared on Jan. 20, has been shared more than 4,100 times. An identical one, posted a day later, has racked up more than 3,200 shares. The full post reads: ""18 million illegal immigrants got their government checks this month… Federal works...let that sink in."" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to some of the people who shared this meme on their pages for evidence. One user responded in the comments of the post, pointing to a 1997 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The other, a Facebook account called ""Washington State for Donald Trump 2020,"" told us it came from comments made by U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on a Fox News segment. Jordan’s spokesperson, Ian Fury, said he was not familiar with the claim, and when we searched Fox News content, we did not find evidence that the congressman said the phrase. The 1997 report only covers what types of benefits undocumented immigrants can receive, which are food programs or Medicaid through their U.S.-born children, and how much that had cost 20 years ago. While it does discuss that some of these families may misrepresent their income to receive more, it isn’t relevant to the claim that ""18 million"" just received a government check. In our research we found that, no, 18 million illegal immigrants did not receive a check from the government amid the shut down. Here’s how we know. First, a November 2018 study by the Pew Research Center puts the total number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. far lower than 18 million. As of 2016, the most recent data available, the report found the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country decreased to 10.7 million from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. In a fact sheet published the same month by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, they estimated the figure is closer to 11.3 million. Taking either figure into account, it would be impossible for 18 million undocumented immigrants to receive checks from the government, because there are only approximately 11 million living in the country. We spoke with Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. ""Obviously, unauthorized immigrants themselves are hardly eligible for any government assistance that it’s hard to know what they would be getting checks for,"" Capps said. ""Their children who are born in the U.S. may be eligible for emergency Medicaid, but that is not the majority.... And as far as food stamps go, most illegal immigrants are ineligible for that. If they are receiving them, it’s only a fraction of the population and it isn’t for themselves it’s for their children, and again that’s not a check."" The mathematical misstep may have stemmed from lumping the number of legal immigrants into the equation. According to a December 2018 report by the Center for Immigration Studies, 63 percent of non-citizen households use welfare programs. But the same report states, citing census data, that only about half of non-citizen households are made up of undocumented immigrants. The rest of the folks in this group include long-term temporary visitors such as guest workers and foreign students as well as permanent residents who have not be naturalized but hold green cards Then, there are also legal restrictions that limit immigrants from receiving most federal benefits. Undocumented immigrant households primarily benefit from government food programs and Medicaid through their U.S.-born children. Undocumeted immigrants are ineligible to receive the following federal benefits: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program), non-emergency Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and its precursor, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), according to the National Immigration Law Center. Another report by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low levels of immigration, estimated that in 2012, of the number of  households headed by immigrants who are in the country illegally, 4 percent used housing programs. ""While households headed by illegal immigrants make some use of housing and cash programs, their use is lower than that of households headed by the native-born for these programs,"" the study said. Viral Facebook posts are claiming that 18 million illegal immigrants received a government check this month, while federal workers remain unpaid amid the government shutdown. We could not find any evidence that supports this figure, and multiple reports put the total number of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. far lower than 18 million. Moreover, illegal immigrants are barred from receiving most federal benefits, and primarily will benefit from food programs and Medicaid through their U.S.-born children.

Sen. Rick Scott said he always supported Dreamers, but that's not correct
","Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., applauded President Donald Trump’s proposal to swap border wall funding for protection for Dreamers, immigrants who came to the United States illegally when they were children. In an effort to end the government shutdown, Trump offered to continue to provide temporary protections for 700,000 Dreamers in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Scott called on Democratic leaders in Congress to accept his offer, but they rejected it. ""Children should never be punished for the actions of their parents,"" Scott tweeted Jan. 19, ""and I’ve always supported protections for our DREAMers."" Children should never be punished for the actions of their parents, and I’ve always supported protections for our DREAMers. Now it’s time for Democrats to decide if they want to negotiate in good faith and accept a compromise that secures our borders... Scott did soften his stance on illegal immigration during his eight years as Florida governor. But his support for their cause was not ""always"" there. We are not judging whether Scott's change of positions on immigration, including Dreamers, was sound policy, but whether his words about his own record are accurate. It's worth noting that in Florida, there has been significant support among some high-profile Republican politicians — including members of Congress — for helping Dreamers. Scott's most recent position more closely aligns with that perspective. Early in his tenure, Scott took stances that were counter to helping undocumented immigrants, including Dreamers. A few Twitter users replied to Scott’s tweet with a link to a a statement Scott made about Dreamers in 2010, a few weeks before the was sworn in.. Hours before the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass the Dream Act, Scott said he opposed the legislation. ""I'm against the Dream Act,"" Scott said Dec. 8, 2010, while touring the Port of Miami. ""Why? I don't believe in amnesty."" The bill would have given a conditional path to citizenship to hundreds of thousands undocumented immigrants. The bill passed the House but then narrowly died in the U.S. Senate. Miami's three Republican Cuban-American lawmakers, Reps. Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, joined Democrats in voting in favor of the bill. At the time, Scott’s comment was consistent with the approach of his Republican primary campaign against illegal immigration. Scott promised to adopt a law similar to Arizona’s controversial SB1070, which required immigrants to show their citizenship papers if stopped by law enforcement, among other stances. Once he was elected governor, Scott stopped talking about that promise. In June 2012, Obama announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an extension of executive power to defer deportation for Dreamers who met certain criteria on a renewable two-year basis. In 2013, Scott vetoed a bill to let Dreamers get driver’s licenses. Among other reasons, Scott criticized DACA as a policy ""absent congressional direction"" in his veto message. The same month that Scott vetoed the bill, the U.S. Senate was moving toward voting on a bill to change immigration laws, including a path to citizenship. The bill was written by a bipartisan group of senators, including Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican. While some leading Florida Republicans publicly endorsed the bill, Scott’s response was more tepid. When asked by the Tampa Bay Times on June 13, 2013 whether he supported the bill, Scott wouldn’t commit either way but praised the border security portion of the bill. ""I think Senator Rubio has really done a great job, focusing on the discussion, making sure we have an immigration policy that works. I'm happy that he's really focused on securing our borders and having a policy that we all understand,"" Scott said. When asked about it again in July 2013 — a couple weeks after it passed the Senate — he called the bill the ""right thing"" and mentioned border security repeatedly, but nothing on the path to citizenship. As he sought re-election in 2014, Scott took a more positive approach: He signed a bill that easily passed the Legislature to give Dreamers in-state tuition. ""Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition,"" he said. That was a Full Flop from 2011 when he said, ""With regard to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants I completely oppose it."" In September 2017, the Trump administration announced it would phase out DACA. (The renewals stand for now, after the U.S. Supreme Court took no action.) In response to the planned phase-out, Scott called on Congress to act and help the Dreamers. ""I do not favor punishing children for the actions of their parents,"" Scott said in a statement Sept. 1, 2017. ""These kids must be allowed to pursue the American Dream, and Congress must act on this immediately."" Scott was most direct in his support of Dreamers during his successful 2018 bid for the U.S. Senate. In a USA Today op-ed, Scott said Congress should ""secure the immigration status of Dreamers"" and ""do the right thing for these kids by removing the uncertainty hanging over their future goals and dreams."" As then-U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., was trying to force votes on immigration in June 2018, Scott again called on Congress to ""get DACA legislation done."" We asked Scott’s press office if he had evidence that he ""always"" supported protections for Dreamers. Sarah Schwirian pointed to Scott’s USA Today op-ed and signing the bill for in-state tuition. ""Sen. Rick Scott has been an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration but has been clear that he supports a legal pathway for kids who were brought here through no fault of their own,"" she said. Scott said, ""I’ve always supported protections for our DREAMers."" In 2010, Scott said, ""I'm against the Dream Act,"" and called the legislation ""amnesty."" In 2013, he criticized Obama’s deferred action program for Dreamers, saying that Obama bypassed Congress. He also vetoed a bill to give Dreamers driver’s licenses. Scott has softened his position in recent years, and politicians are allowed to change. But his rewrite of his Dreamers record doesn't match what really happened. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2019/jan/23/rick-scott/sen-rick-scott-said-he-always-supported-dreamers-s/

The post goes on to speculate that Pelosi was paving the way for her own elevation to the White House by plotting a terrorist attack on President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. There are no declarative sentences claiming Pelosi actually planned to take 93 family members along on her trip -- nor is there any evidence. Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, said, ""No spouses were on the trip that was postponed."" When asked about other family members, he declined to comment on ""every fabrication."" The details of the trip had not been previously announced. But credible news outlets reported the trip would consist of seven lawmakers, along with top staffers, not their families. These include House Speaker Pelosi and U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, Susan Davis, Eliot Engel, Elaine Luria, Stephen Lynch and Mark Takano. They were headed to Brussels to meet with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and military leaders, and then to Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops. Trump announced to Pelosi the trip would not take place on Jan. 17, 2019, in the form of a letter, which Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders posted to Twitter. It was a response to an earlier letter by Pelosi, in which she urged Trump to either reschedule his upcoming State of the Union address or to deliver it in writing, in light of the continued partial government shutdown. The only source the story cites is @BLUEPRINT_Q, a Twitter user who frequently posts conspiracy theories like this one. One tweet claimed ""All Pelosi’s children and grandchildren were also booked, totaling 7 congressman and 93 family members grounded."" But the link attached leads back to a Trump's letter to Pelosi, which did not mention her family. On Twitter, @BLUEPRINT_Q linked to tweets by another conspiracy theory peddler, @5Strat. According to that user, the 93 family members were not only Pelosi’s own children and grandchildren, but her colleagues’ family members. There are no credible sources to back this claim.

Fake rumor spreads about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's credit score, bank accounts
","U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has attracted a ton of attention since her swearing-in earlier this month, with fake quotes being attributed or criticism for her dance moves in college. Now, after securing a seat on the House Financial Services Committee, the internet is calling her personal money management into question. A Facebook post, which appeared on Jan. 16, has been shared over 28,000 times and generated nearly 2,000 comments. We also found that several other versions of the claim have been spread across the internet with no sourcing or any sort of evidence. The post in full says: ""Congresswoman Cortez, from New York City, has been selected to be on the house finance committee, her credit score is 430 and has had two checking accounts closed, along with two sheriff evictions."" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to the author of the Facebook post for evidence but did not receive a response.   We found no information that chronicles or supports the notion that Ocasio-Cortez had multiple checking accounts closed or was ever evicted. From many in-depth profiles written about her over the past year, we know she helped support her family by working multiple jobs, and that she has been criticized by some for not having significant-enough savings, but nothing comes close to this rumor. Moreover, a person’s credit score cannot be obtained without their written consent, according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, so it is unlikely the rumor’s originator was granted access to that information. Our search of public records databases turned up no mention of an eviction, or any other property or housing problems involving law enforcement (nor were there any judgments, liens or bankruptcies). According to her April 2018 financial disclosure report, the only liability listed was one federal student loan. ""No this is not true, no her credit score is not 430 and she does not have any sheriff evictions,"" Ocasio-Cortez’s spokesperson told us.   While Ocasio-Cortez has had to work two jobs in the past to help support her family and currently has one student loan, there is no evidence to support she has ever been evicted, has had bank accounts closed or has a low credit score.

Ralph Northam is right: GOP governors and legislatures have OK'd 'red-flag' gun laws
","Gov, Ralph Northam endorsed a number a gun-control measures this year, but he promoted only one in his State of the Commonwealth Address to the gun-friendly General Assembly. ""This year I’m proposing we act to approve an ‘extreme risk law,’"" he said during the Jan. 9 speech. ""It creates a legal way for law enforcement and the courts to temporarily remove firearms from someone who has shown dangerous behavior, and who poses a risk to themselves or others. ""This idea has passed Republican legislatures in other states and been signed by Republican governors,"" Northam, a Democrat, said. He called for starting a ""dialogue"" between Democrats and Republicans on their often adverse views on gun restrictions. Northam’s gun-control package, which also included universal background checks and limiting handgun purchases to one a month, was defeated Jan. 17 by Republican majorities in a Senate committee and, later, a House subcommittee. We wondered whether Northam’s statement - that extreme-risk bills have passed in other states with Republican legislatures  and been signed by GOP governors - is accurate. Thirteen states have extreme-risk laws, also called red-flag laws. They allow police - and usually, family members - to petition a court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may be dangerous to himself or others. After a set amount of time, the weapon is either returned to the person or the court order is extended. Supporters say the laws can prevent violent crimes and suicides. Opponents say the laws allow government seizure of firearms in violation of the Second Amendment. The National Rifle Association opposed the laws for many years, but in 2018 changed position and said it would back bills if they provide due process and require mental treatment for the person temporarily forfeiting his gun. Alena Yarmoski, Northam’s press secretary, sent us a list of states with extreme-risk laws that were either signed by Republican governors or passed in states where both chambers of the legislature were controlled by the GOP. We scrutinized the list, and it held up. Seven Republican governors have signed extreme-risk bills: Two Republican-controlled legislatures have passed such bills: Our ruling Northam, in unsuccessfully urging the General Assembly to pass an extreme-risk gun law, said, ""This idea has passed Republican legislatures in other states and has been signed by Republican governors."" Seven GOP governors have signed extreme-risk gun legislation since 1995. Two Republican controlled state legislatures have passed such a bill since 2005.

Yes, Kamala Harris is eligible to run for president
","California Sen. Kamala Harris had barely become a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination before birther accusations started on Twitter. Harris announced her candidacy on Jan. 21. The following morning, Jacob Wohl -- a self-described Trump supporter who has been described by media outlets as a ""far-right conspiracy theorist"" -- questioned whether Harris was eligible to run. He tweeted, ""Kamala Harris is NOT eligible to be President. Her father arrived from Jamaica in 1961—mother from India arrived in 1960. Neither parent was a legal resident for 5 years prior to Harris’s birth, a requirement for naturalization. Kamala was raised in Canada."" Kamala Harris is NOT eligible to be President. Her father arrived from Jamaica in 1961—mother from India arrived in 1960 Neither parent was a legal resident for 5 years prior to Harris’s birth, a requirement for naturalizationKamala was raised in Canada After getting some online pushback, Wohl doubled down, tweeting, ""There are serious questions about @KamalaHarris' eligibility to serve as President of the United States. This isn't a partisan issue. Ted Cruz faced the same questions of eligibility in 2016. I hope that her campaign addresses those questions sooner, rather than later."" Some have raised questions about whether the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., or Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, could have served as president. McCain was born to U.S. parents in the Panama Canal Zone while his father was stationed there in the military. Cruz was born in Canada to U.S. parents. But most legal scholars said both McCain and Cruz would have been eligible to serve had they won the presidency -- and Harris’ case is even more clear-cut than theirs is, because she was born in the United States. We tweeted at Wohl, who didn’t respond by publication time. However, when we checked in with four legal scholars with expertise in this question, they all agreed that Wohl’s ""serious questions"" are a red herring. A Harris campaign spokesman, Ian Sams, told PolitiFact, ""Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, California, which is, was, and presumably will be in the United States of America. End of story."" Sams refused to provide any additional information about Harris’ parents’ naturalization status, or about her time in Canada. But she has spoken or written about these topics previously, so we’ll recap the story here. She was born in 1964 to Donald Harris, a Jamaican-born economist, and Shyamala G. Harris, a scientist. Donald Harris immigrated to the United States after being accepted to study at the University of California-Berkeley, Harris wrote in her 2019 book, ""The Truths We Hold: An American Journey."" He received his Ph.D. from Berkeley in 1966, and he remains an emeritus professor. In his online biography, Harris lists his citizenship as ""Jamaica (by birth); USA (by naturalization)."" Harris recently wrote that ""in their early years"" he took Kamala and her younger sister Maya on ""frequent visits to Jamaica."" Shyamala Gopalan, meanwhile, was born in Chennai, in southern India, and she graduated from the University of Delhi at 19. She applied to a graduate program at Berkeley to pursue a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology, on her way to becoming a breast cancer researcher. Harris’s parents met at Berkeley and soon married. The couple separated around the time the future senator was five, and they divorced a few years later, Harris wrote in her book. Harris continued to live in California until she was in middle school, when her mother was offered a position in Montreal teaching at McGill University. Harris wrote of being unhappy about the distance from her home, about the cold weather, and about having to navigate the city in a language she barely knew. But ""by the time I got to high school, I had adjusted to our new surroundings,"" she wrote. Harris, left Montreal to attend Howard University in Washington, D.C. She became the junior senator from California in 2017. This makes for an interesting personal history. But contrary to Wohl’s tweet, it is completely irrelevant for determining Harris’ eligibility to run for president. The U.S. Constitution says that ""no person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President."" So the key language is whether Harris is a ""natural born citizen."" And experts say she meets that definition. First, there’s the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The relevant portion says that ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" Second, there’s a 1952 statute (8 U.S. Code § 1401) that echoes the language in the Fourteenth Amendment and says that people born in the United States are ""nationals and citizens."" And third, there’s an 1898 Supreme Court decision, known as the Wong Kim Ark case. In its 6-2 majority decision, the justices ruled that Wong -- and others born on United States soil, with a few clear exceptions -- did indeed qualify for citizenship under the 14th Amendment. ""If you are born in the U.S, you are automatically a natural-born U.S. citizen under the constitution,"" said Harvard Law Professor Einer Elhauge. Sarah Duggin, a Catholic University law professor, agreed. ""Her birth in the United States, to someone other than a member of a foreign diplomatic corps or otherwise not subject to U.S. jurisdiction, makes her a U.S. citizen unless she later renounced her citizenship. There is no reason to look at where her parents came from, how long her parents were U.S. residents before she was born, or where she was raised."" Two other law professors with expertise in this area -- Mary Brigid McManamon of Widener University and Malinda L. Seymore of Texas A&M University -- agreed that Harris is clearly eligible. Wohl tweeted, ""Kamala Harris is NOT eligible to be President,"" based on ""serious questions"" concerning her parents’ naturalization status and her time spent growing up in Canada. Constitutional scholars agree that rehashing details of Harris’ upbringing is a smokescreen, since the only factor that matters is that Harris was born in the United States. The 14th Amendment, an 1898 Supreme Court decision and a 1952 statute make clear that anyone born in the United States is qualified to run for president.

Claim about Nancy Pelosi bar tab is baseless
","Game show host-turned-conservative pundit Chuck Woolery appeared to rehash a nearly decade-old falsehood about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., racking up outsize bar tabs on taxpayer dollars while shuttling between Washington and California. Pelosi’s air travel did make headlines recently — but not for the reason Woolery suggested. The House Speaker was planning to travel to Belgium and Afghanistan on military aircraft, when President Donald Trump canceled her trip, requesting she remain in Washington to negotiate an end to the government shutdown. Woolery posted his tweet the same day Trump denied Pelosi the use of military aircraft. ""Nancy Pelosi's bill for alcohol on her flights from Washington to San Fran every week? We pay for it,"" Woolery tweeted Jan. 17. ""1000 dollars. On average 52,000 Bucks, a year for BOOZE. Tax payer money."" We found zero evidence to back up this claim. Furthermore, the congresswoman doesn’t drink, Pelosi’s office said. Woolery’s claim sounded strikingly similar to a previous statement we checked in 2010, in which onetime presidential candidate Michele Bachmann accused Pelosi of spending $100,000 on alcohol for flights — which we rated Pants on Fire. The original source of Bachmann's allegation was a large collection of documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues. A spokesman for Woolery sent us the same set of documents when we asked for evidence.  But in neither case do they back up the speakers’ assertions. In a 2010 press release summarizing the findings, Judicial Watch wrote that ""the Speaker’s military travel cost the United States Air Force $2,100,744.59 over a two-year period — $101,429.14 of which was for in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol."" (This covered both domestic and international travel.) In Bachmann's case, she cited a figure for alcohol expenditures that was close to a much larger number — $101,429 — for all non-plane costs of the trip. It’s unclear how Woolery came up with his $52,000 annual figure. Neither is correct. Pelosi’s office told us in 2010 — and reiterated for this check — that she ""does not drink alcohol."" An aide added that she no longer takes weekly flights via military aircraft, a once-common practice that has since been phased out. She now travels commercial between Washington and California. Woolery said, ""Nancy Pelosi's bill for alcohol on her flights from Washington to San Fran every week? We pay for it. 1000 dollars. On average 52,000 Bucks, a year for BOOZE. Tax payer money."" We couldn’t find any evidence to support Woolery’s claim, which was strikingly similar to a falsehood about Pelosi’s bar tab from 2010 that we rated Pants on Fire. Furthermore, her office says that she doesn’t drink. We rate this Pants on Fire.

Does pressing 'cancel' twice at an ATM protect your PIN from being stolen? Not likely, experts say
","If you need information on ATM security and safety, it’s best to go to law enforcement or a financial institution – not an unsourced post that your friend shared on social media. Recently, a post claiming to be a ""message from a banker"" professes to share with the world a ""useful tip"" while using an ATM. The post reads: ""Press (the) ‘cancel’ button twice before inserting the card. If anyone has set up the keypad to steal your pin code, this will cancel that set up. Please make it a habit and part of every transaction that you make. Please share with those about whom you care."" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The tip has been shared on social media since at least November 2018, when the same claim was also posted on Twitter. While it is true that scams can impact customers using an ATM machine, we couldn’t find any reports from cybersecurity, banking or law enforcement organizations that recommend pressing the cancel button twice to prevent information from being stolen. We spoke with Dr. Vassil Roussev, a professor of computer science at the University of New Orleans and the director of the UNO Cyber Center, an institution dedicated to research and instruction in the area of Information Assurance. ""There are relatively simple electronic devices made by different criminal groups that get reproduced and sold, and there’s a fairly large number of them, so it is possible that some very simple ones could be disturbed by something like this,"" Dr. Roussev said, ""but it should not, in any way, be taken as a safety precaution. It won’t hurt you, but I would place zero value on this type of advice."" Dr. Roussev explained that many designs, particularly keypad overlays, which attaches a fake keyboard over an ATMs real one, may record everything that is pressed, so pressing cancel twice or 50 times would make zero difference. He went on to recommend that people take actual safety precautions, such as not using random ATMs or ones where they don’t trust the physical security, because those are targeted by scammers most often. Typically, crooks will use a variety of techniques to capture customers information. Here are some of the most common ones compiled from the American Bankers Association and NCR, an ATM developer. Skimming: A slim device containing a microprocessor and flash memory that is attached to a card reader slot that copies card information as it passes the device. Once the information is captured, criminals use the details to create a cloned card.   Cash trapping:  A contraption inserted into the cash-dispensing slot that blocks an ATM’s shutter so that bills cannot be presented to the customer. The criminal then retrieves the cash once the customer leaves. Card trapping: The stealing of the physical card itself through a device fixed to the ATM. Unlimited cash-out: Malware manipulates system controls, inflates account balances and removes daily transactions limits, enabling criminals to withdraw an unlimited amount of cash. Fake keypads or ""pin-pad overlays"": These could potentially be used to steal a PIN number. Hidden camera: To record customer keystrokes, like the entry of a PIN, or the card’s information. Here are some of the best practices financial institutions do suggest people exercise when using an ATM: • When you’re alone, avoid using ATMs in deserted areas, or ones that are obstructed from view or poorly lit. Use ATM’s in public, well-lit areas, like inside banks or supermarkets. • Be aware of your surroundings. If you notice anything out of the ordinary or suspicious cancel your transaction and leave immediately. You can come back later or find another ATM. • If it looks like someone has tampered with the ATM equipment in any way, don’t use it and report it. • Type in your pin discreetly and shield the screen and keypad so others can’t see. • Put your cash, card and receipt away immediately. Count your money later where others can’t see and avoid showing your cash. • Take your receipts with you so potential criminals will not know how much you withdrew or how much money is in your account. • When using a drive-up ATM, keep your doors locked, windows up and your engine running. • When using an enclosed ATM that requires your card to open the door, avoid letting anyone follow you inside. • While many ATMs are available 24 hours a day, try to go during the day. If you must go at night, consider taking someone with you. ATM scams are diverse and range from simple to very advanced. While pressing the ""cancel"" button twice before using the machine doesn’t have any drawbacks, customers shouldn’t expect it will keep their information safe.

No, Congress did not approve $50 billion for border fence in 2006
","The feud over a proposed border wall has fueled retorts on Facebook that Congress approved a much more expensive barrier more than a decade ago. The versions we saw on Facebook and Twitter suggest the money mysteriously vanished. One post, shared more than 6,000 times on Facebook, said: ""The question of the decade: where is the $50 billion approved in ‘06 for the Secure Fence Act that Obama was supposed to build?"" Another post said: ""Where is the $50 billion set aside for the 2006 Secure Fence Act? Bush signed it and Obama was supposed to oversee its construction. Where is the money?"" These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s the problem with the missing money claims: Congress did not approve $50 billion for a fence in 2006. (Snopes previously debunked these social media posts.) Just over half of Democrats in the U.S. Senate voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, including Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton. Most Democrats in the House voted against it, including California Rep. Nancy Pelosi. President George W. Bush signed it into law in October 2006. The law authorized a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the U.S.-Mexico border. By 2015, 654 miles were completed. We read several news stories about the act’s passage in 2006. None pegged the cost anywhere near $50 billion. The Secure Fence Act didn’t mention money to be spent on fencing. Congress separately approved a $33.7 billion spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security, which included  $1.2 billion for fencing, infrastructure and technology on the border. The $1.2 billion was described in news articles as a down payment, but there was disagreement about how much the full fence would cost. Newspapers and politicians cited estimates between $2 billion and $12 billion. So where did this idea of $50 billion come from? It’s not very straightforward. In January 2007, multiple news reports and an article by the Migration Policy Institute started to mention a pot of about $50 billion for fencing. These reports reference the work of the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. About a week before the final September Senate vote, the researchers issued a report that explored costs and benefits of southwest border fencing, a ""relatively new and limited phenomenon."" 
They placed the initial cost of building a double-layer fence at $1.2 million to $1.3 million per mile, citing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Over 25 years, the costs per mile could increase anywhere from $16 million to $70 million per mile depending on the degree of wear and tear. But neither the report nor a December 2006 update calculate the total cost. The latter document references the $1.2 billion that was appropriated to Homeland Security. The Migration Policy Institute did include $50 billion total by taking the highest figures in the CRS report — $1.3 million per mile for construction and $70 million per mile for maintenance — and then multiply $71.3 million by 700 miles to get about $49.9 billion. Once it hit the newspapers, the $50 billion figure sparked some pushback. US Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said, ""These numbers are grossly inflated."" California Republican U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter criticized the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: ""I call them the 'Mission Impossible' crowd,"" he said. The talking point that the Congressional Research Service said the fence would cost $50 billion was repeated for years, reappearing in Mother Jones in 2011, Newsweek in 2015 and the Boston Globe in 2017. The figure has resurfaced during the current debate over Trump’s wall. U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a Jan. 2 Fox News op-ed that 26 Senate Democrats ""voted for The Secure Fence Act, which allocated $50 billion over 25 years for 700 miles of fencing along the border."" Fox News’ Sean Hannity said on Jan. 9, ""The Secure Fence Act allowed over $50 billion over the next two decades to construct and maintain hundreds of miles of new barriers."" The Government Accountability Office said that Border Patrol spent about $2.3 billion to deploy fencing between fiscal years 2007 through 2015 and constructed 654 miles of fencing by 2015. Border Patrol officials did not track funding for acquisition and sustainment for border fencing prior to the implementation of the Secure Fence Act of 2006. In 2009, Border Patrol estimated that maintaining fencing would cost more than $1 billion over 20 years. Social media posts asked, ""Where is the $50 billion approved in ‘06 for the Secure Fence Act that Obama was supposed to build?"" These posts falsely suggest that Congress approved $50 billion as part of the Secure Fence Act. Actually the Homeland Security appropriations bill  included $1.2 billion for the fence, described as a down payment at the time. The claim that $50 billion was approved seems to come from estimates for the total wall that circulated among researchers and journalists. These social media posts try to suggest that Congress did something nefarious by approving the money and not spending it, but there is no evidence that Congress ever approved $50 billion for a wall. We rate this statement False.

Fact-checking Mark Walker’s tweet about migrants and the border
","In the face of the longest government shutdown in American history, President Donald Trump has repeatedly maintained that the border situation is a crisis only a wall can solve. Shortly after Trump used a prime-time television slot to plead for public support of his signature campaign promise, Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., jumped into the mix with a tweet backing the president. ""The debate on securing our border can't be measured in partisan jabs,"" said Walker, who represents North Carolina’s 6th Congressional District. ""It has to be measured in the human toll caused by porous borders: * 1/3 migrant women are sexually assaulted * 7/10 migrants are victims of violence * 20k migrant children were illegally smuggled last month.""  The debate on securing our border can't be measured in partisan jabs. It has to be measured in the human toll caused by porous borders:• 1/3 migrant women are sexually assaulted• 7/10 migrants are victims of violence• 20k migrant children were illegally smuggled last month Walker spokesman Jack Minor said the first two statistics came from Doctors Without Borders, an international nonprofit providing medical care in places marked by conflict and poverty. He said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen presented the third figure to House members during a briefing Jan. 8. Similar numbers have been raising eyebrows across the country for weeks, so we decided to put Walker’s statement to the Truth-O-Meter. Walker pulled these numbers from a 2017 Doctors Without Borders report detailing the conditions faced by migrants fleeing violence in Central America’s Northern Triangle, which includes El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, for the United States. But that report focused on a very different situation than what Walker’s tweet described. Sophie Delaunay, executive director of Doctors Without Borders, said the report was meant to highlight the humanitarian crisis in Central America and the resulting forced displacement — not the situation inside the United States or at the U.S. border with Mexico. The report was based on medical data and a 2015 survey of 467 randomly sampled migrants who were receiving treatment at clinics in Mexico supported by Doctors Without Borders. According to the survey’s findings, 68.3 percent of the migrants and refugees entering Mexico from the Northern Triangle said they had experienced violence during their transit through Mexico to the United States, and 31.4 percent of women said they had been sexually abused. Walker implied these numbers were ""the human toll caused by porous borders"" – that they were somehow the result of current immigration policies and could be fixed by a border wall. But they don’t actually refer to the situation at the U.S. border at all. In reality, the numbers chart the harms suffered by migrants on the journey through Mexico. ""Central American migrants are extremely vulnerable to violence, both in their home countries and along the route to the United States,"" Delaunay said. ""It is unfortunate that our data — that illustrated the dangers migrants face as they journey to the U.S. — are being used by the U.S. government to try to justify immigration policies that put the lives of these very same people at risk."" It’s clear that Walker didn’t pull the numbers out of thin air, but his claim is misleading. Minor said this figure came from DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who presented it to House members during a briefing in January, referring to December data. Fact-checkers at The Washington Post and FactCheck.org looked into the same claim after Trump made it a focal point of his prime-time Oval Office address on Jan. 8. DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman told PolitiFact 19,313 minors tried to cross the border illegally in December, either with a parent or alone. Including others who arrived at legal ports of entry, a total of 22,110 minors showed up at the border without documents that month, she said. But it’s not accurate to describe either figure as the number of children being ""smuggled"" into the country, which Trump’s supporters often link to drug cartels, ""coyotes"" or other bad actors. While there were about 20,000 minors stopped while trying to enter the United States illegally, the number of children smuggled to the border probably was much smaller. That’s because border officials screen for false claims of parentage or guardianship. Between April and September 2018, Customs and Border Patrol separated 170 family units on suspicion of smuggling after determining that the child was not related to the parent or guardian, according to The Washington Post. But as FactCheck.org noted, 170 is a tiny percent of the more than 60,000 family units that were apprehended during that time frame. So it’s far-fetched to suggest, as Walker did, that just about every minor caught at the border was brought there by a smuggler. In a Jan. 9 tweet, Walker said ""porous borders"" had resulted in one-third of migrant women experiencing sexual assault, 70 percent of migrants experiencing violence, and the illegal smuggling of 20,000 migrant children across the border in December. Although Walker got the first two numbers straight from a Doctors Without Borders report, his suggestion that the violence occurred because of existing border conditions was highly misleading. The statistics came from a survey that asked Central American migrants receiving medical treatment in Mexico about their experience traveling through Mexico. Also, the head of the group behind the report said violence in their home countries was a factor in why they left. The third statistic Walker cited was also misleading, since he conflated the 19,313 minors apprehended at the border last month with the much smaller number of minors who would have been caught traveling with smugglers. Overall, Walker’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.
