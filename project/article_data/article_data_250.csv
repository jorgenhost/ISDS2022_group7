Trump falsely claims his administration has deported half of MS-13 gang members
","President Donald Trump recently claimed that in the five months he’s been in office, his administration has deported about half of MS-13 gang members, one of the largest criminal organizations in the United States around since the 1980s. Trump singled out enforcement efforts against the MS-13 gang during an immigration roundtable discussion on two House bills written to withhold funds from jurisdictions that shield immigrants and to impose stricter penalties for criminal immigrants who re-enter the country.  MS-13 gang members are ""bad people, and we've gotten many of them out already. You know, we're pretty much at the 50 percent mark,"" Trump said June 28. ""We're getting them out as fast as we can get them out, and we're freeing up towns.""  Trump’s comment caught our attention since this is one of the most notorious gangs in the country. Is he halfway there in deporting thousands of MS-13 gang members? Not exactly. There’s an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. The latest data shows immigration officials have deported 2,798 gang members in fiscal year 2017 — that’s members of all gangs and includes several months when former President Barack Obama was in office. Trump’s June 28 remarks weren’t the first he’s made about MS-13 and his administration’s efforts against them. At a rally this month in Iowa, he told supporters his administration was ""moving them out of the country by the thousands."" In April, he falsely tweeted that Obama’s policies allowed MS-13 to form across the United States, and again that his administration was removing them fast. But multiple experts told us there is no evidence Obama’s policies caused the gang’s growth in the country. MS-13 grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. It’s grown into an international criminal organization with more than 30,000 members worldwide, the Justice Department said in an April 18, 2017, fact sheet. It’s difficult to peg down exactly how many MS-13 gang members there are in the United States. Trump’s Justice Department in April said there were more than 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. FactCheck.org noted that for years the 10,000 figure has been a consistent estimate. We asked the White House for evidence backing Trump’s claim, but did not get an on-the-record response. A specific number of MS-13 gang members deported is not available because officials don’t track removals by specific gang, Dani Bennett, spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement previously told us. (The FBI says there’s around 33,000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs, and prison gangs criminally active in the U.S. and Puerto Rico — with an estimated 1.4 million members.)  But ICE ""does specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal on the basis of their immigration violations,"" Bennett said, adding that deportations include foreign fugitives wanted for crimes committed abroad and who are removable under U.S. immigration law. So far in fiscal year 2017, ICE said it has removed 2,798 gang members. Even if all of them were MS-13 gang members, that would still be short of Trump’s claim that ""we're pretty much at the 50 percent mark"" — since the Justice Department in April said there’s an estimated 10,000 gang members in the country. Also, fiscal year 2017 started Oct. 1, 2016, when Obama was still in office. Trump said, ""We're pretty much at the 50 percent mark"" on deportations of MS-13 gang members. Trump’s Justice Department has said there’s an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States.  The latest available data from ICE shows 2,798 gang members have been removed in fiscal year 2017. But that includes members of all gangs, not just MS-13. Even if all were MS-13, that would not be half of the estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the country. And fiscal year 2017 includes more than three months that Obama was in office. Trump’s statement is not accurate.

Joke about bills passed by NY State Senate is not a joke
","State lawmakers have left Albany for the year without taking up a bill that would extend the statute of limitations for child sex abuse victims. Current law allows those victims to bring criminal charges against their alleged abuser until the age of 23. The Child Victims Act would extend the age to 28 and create a one-year revival period for past cases regardless of when they happened. Victims could also bring civil cases until age 50. The bill passed in the State Assembly with the support of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, but was blocked by Republicans in the State Senate. Comedian Samantha Bee took aim at the Senate on her weekly late-night talk show last week. ""I don't want you to think the New York Senate is anti-child,"" Bee said. ""This session they passed legislation allowing minors to race snowmobiles, get their own hunting licenses, and not be employed gathering or picking rags, cigar stumps, or collecting bones."" Anyone who does not follow New York state politics closely may be surprised by the claim. Those inside what’s known as the ‘Albany bubble’ were most likely not. But Bee is known for comedy. Some may have seen her claim as satirical. Were those bills a joke, or was Bee talking about legislation that actually passed the Senate? Snowmobile racing The Senate passed a bill in March that would allow people under the age of 18 to compete in organized snowmobile racing events without a safety certificate from the state. Current law requires anyone under the age of 18 to take a state-approved safety course before they ride a snowmobile. Anyone under 14 has to also be supervised by an adult when riding. The regulations do not apply if the minor rides on land owned by their parent or guardian. The bill would throw out those rules as long as the minor is participating in a snowmobile racing event. The bill, sponsored by Republican Sen. Betty Little of the North Country, passed the 63-member Senate with 49 votes. The Assembly did not take up the bill. Looser hunting restrictions Another bill, passed by the Senate in June, would allow 12-year-olds to get a universal hunting license by lowering the age for some hunting activities. You can start hunting when you are 12 in New York, but certain restrictions remain until the hunter is 14. The bill would drop the age from 14 to 12 for someone to participate in muzzle-loading season, obtain muzzle-loading privileges, hunt with a crossbow, and hunt big game. The child would have to be supervised by a parent or youth mentor. The sponsor, Republican Joseph Griffo, says in the bill’s memo it’s intended to give parents the opportunity to teach children about hunting at a younger age. The bill passed the Senate with 53 votes. The Assembly did not take it up. Begging for money The third bill targets people who use children to panhandle on the street. It’s already illegal for someone to use a child to beg for money but the crime is under the state’s arts and cultural affairs law instead of the penal law. This bill, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jeffrey Klein of the Bronx, would transfer the crime to the penal law and strengthen the penalty for repeat offenders. The bill says someone cannot ask or allow a child under 16 to beg for money or receive payment for ""picking rags, or collecting cigar stumps, or collecting bones."" That provision has actually been in state law since 1971. It’s part of a broader law that bans children from doing several things for money. Among the more interesting: children cannot be employed as tightrope walkers and cannot receive money for displaying a physical deformity. The Klein bill to move the crime to the penal law passed the Senate in June with 55 votes. The bill was not taken up in the Assembly. Our ruling Comedian Samantha Bee said the New York State Senate ""passed legislation allowing minors to race snowmobiles, get their own hunting licenses, and not be employed gathering or picking rags, cigar stumps, or collecting bones.""

Rick Perry says France wouldn't buy Texas beef and relies greatly on nuclear power
","Rick Perry roused reporters at the White House the other day by taking multiple questions including an inquiry prompting the former governor to make a curious two-part claim about France. Reporter: ""Can you assure the American people that nuclear waste and nuclear plant safety are such that we should expand nuclear power in this country?’ U.S. Energy Secretary Perry: ""You know, I would reflect that -- or deflect that, if he was here, to President (Emmanuel) Macron of France, who gets 70-plus percent of their power from nuclear energy."" ""Now,"" Perry went on, ""this is the country that wouldn’t buy Texas beef for some reason, yet 76 percent of their energy comes from nuclear power. So the French, who I’ve always thought were a little bit different -- (laughter) -- and that’s in a good way. You know, they recognized us as a state back in the 1830s, so we actually have a really close, personal relationship with the French. We like them. We had an embassy in Paris. They had one in Austin; as a matter of fact it’s still there, called the French Legation. Invite all of you to come and see it. ""But the French are a little different when it comes to some things. And one of those I would find it really interesting -- our French friends are very comfortable getting 76 percent, thereabouts, of their energy from nuclear, and I can assure you they’re very fond of getting it at the rate they’re getting it."" Perry was surely referring to France’s official recognition of the Republic of Texas. The country also had a diplomat placed in Austin who intended to live in a building that’s still in place just east of downtown Austin, the French Legation Museum, though that didn’t work out. Perry’s juxtaposition of beef, nuclear power and France made us wonder. That is, have the French refused to buy Texas beef and does France also rely on nuclear power for 76 percent of its energy? Boeuf? After  unsuccessfully asking the Energy Department for Perry’s factual backup, we chewed on Perry’s beef beef by reaching Joe Schuele of the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Schuele told us the entire European Union has banned imports of beef produced with growth hormones for nearly three decades. As of 2017, France ranked among the EU’s 28 member- nations. A U.S. Department of Agriculture web page, ""Export Requirements for the European Union,"" presents multiple conditions for animal products shipped to EU countries. A portion states: ""All bovine meat exported to the European Union must originate from animals that have never been treated with hormonal growth promotants."" Then again, Schuele advised that the EU still imports beef not produced with growth hormones--including about 16,000 metric tons of it, valued at $264 million, in 2016, perhaps some of that making it to France. Mindful that Perry led Texas from late 2000 into 2014, we asked about the timing of the EU’s beef limits. The ban on beef produced with growth hormones, he said, traces to 1989, when the EU was the European Economic Community. That roped off many U.S. beef producers, according to a 2015 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: ""In the United States, hormones have been approved for use since the 1950s and are now believed to be used on approximately two-thirds of all cattle and about 90% of the cattle on feedlots. In large U.S. commercial feedlots, their use approaches 100%,"" the report said. ""Cattle producers use hormones because they allow animals to grow larger and more quickly on less feed and fewer other inputs, thus reducing production costs, but also because they produce a leaner carcass more in line with consumer preferences for diets with reduced fat and cholesterol,"" CRS said. In 2009, years after the U.S. successfully challenged the EU limits before the World Trade Organization, Schuele said, the U.S. and EU agreed to annual quotas of duty-free beef exports. Any beef shipped in excess of the quota, Schuele said, faces a duty amounting to 20 percent of the shipment’s invoiced value on arrival. A USDA spokeswoman, Kari Heerman, separately emailed us similar background, also pointing out the agency’s Non-Hormone Treated Cattle Program, which regulates beef shipped to the EU. Heerman said by email: ""France does import beef from the United States, but it does not import beef treated with hormones that are commonly used throughout North America."" But, Heerman said, ""we do not have data to determine whether/how much of the beef that is exported to France comes from Texas."" Heerman said data on ""beef flows"" or exports from each state aren’t collected. Summing up, Schuele wrote: ""So while the EU doesn’t exactly refuse to buy U.S. beef, only a small percentage of U.S. beef is eligible for export to the EU."" Nuclear power We turned next to whether 76 percent of France’s power comes from nuclear plants. A web search led us to an International Atomic Energy Agency web page indicating that in 2016, France drew 72 percent of its electricity from 58 nuclear power plants. Our click on the page’s ""trend"" button on the page yielded a graph suggesting that since 1997, nuclear power has come close to accounting for 80 percent of France’s power production. France’s Share of Power Production Attributed to Nuclear Plants, 1997-2016  SOURCE: Web page, ""France,"" Power Reactor Information System, International Atomic Energy Agency, last updated June 28, 2017 Otherwise Jonathan Cobb of the World Nuclear Association replied to our email inquiry by pointing us to a web page overseen by the Paris-based International Energy Agency, whose 29 member-nations collectively respond to oil-supply interruptions. In 2015, according to the IEA, France drew 78 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants. Our ruling Perry told reporters that France ""wouldn’t buy Texas beef for some reason, yet 76 percent of their energy comes from nuclear power."" Perry's main point holds up; France gets about three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear power. But his beef mention lacks clarification in that it was the European Union (not France alone) that banned only hormone-raised beef. Some beef continues to be imported to the EU.

Blogger falsely ties death of U.N. official to Clintons
","A self-described conservative blog revived a rumor from the Clinton body count archives. The blog Conservative Politicus had the stirring headline ""U.N. official John Ashe set to testify against the Clintons may not have died by accident after all,"" on June 17. This has the essential ingredients to meet the appetite of any conspiracy fan: Clintons, a legal case and a dead man. That doesn’t mean those elements are on the money. Yes, Ashe died in 2016, and yes, there was a criminal case. But no, he wasn’t going to testify against either Bill or Hillary Clinton. Now, for the back story. John Ashe represented Antigua and Barbuda at the United Nations and at one time served as president of the General Assembly. In October 2015, the FBI accused Ashe of receiving at least $500,000 in bribes to benefit a Chinese businessman named Ng Lap Seng. Ng isn’t a household name today but back in 1998, a Senate report identified him as the source of hundreds of thousands of dollars funneled through an Arkansas restaurant owner to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton-Gore campaign in the mid 1990s. Ng visited the White House 10 times. That is the known extent of any Clinton connection. In June 2016, the rumor-busting website Snopes asked the office of the U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District of New York if their case involved either Clinton. A spokesman said not at all. The complaint against Ashe makes no mention of the Clintons. Ashe wasn’t scheduled to testify against the Clintons. He was slated for what the spokesman described to Snopes as a standard pre-trial meeting. As for Ashe’s death, he died at home in June 2016 when a barbell crushed his throat. That happened near the time he was scheduled to meet with prosecutors. The death was ruled an accident. Several conspiracy-minded posts emerged soon after his death. One about a month afterward included Ashe’s name with two others who allegedly died under mysterious circumstances. The one common thread was a tie to the Clintons. A conservative blog revived a year-old rumor that a UN official died shortly before he was going to testify against the Clintons. While the man did die and he was scheduled to meet with prosecutors, that’s the extent of the accuracy here. Prosecutors said Ashe had received at least half a million dollars in bribes, and he was headed for trial. The case had no connection to the Clintons, except that the man who allegedly provided the bribe had illegally given to Democrats about 20 years earlier. The official autopsy found he died in an accident and no evidence suggests otherwise. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2017/jun/30/blog-posting/blogger-falsely-ties-death-un-official-clintons/

Ron Johnson offers credible projection for federal debt by 2047
","Could the United States be facing a future with $129 trillion in additional deficits over the next 30 years? Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., contends it’s possible. On June 26, 2017, as a Senate bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was foundering, Johnson wrote an op-ed in the New York Times titled, ""Where the Senate health care bill fails."" The op-ed focused on the difficulty of reining in federal outlays for health care spending. ""We are $20 trillion in debt,"" Johnson wrote. ""The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years. A truly moral and compassionate society does not impoverish future generations to bestow benefits in the here and now."" Let’s take a closer look at those figures. The U.S. Treasury Department’s ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator allows you to track the federal debt on a daily basis. The website lists two kinds of debt -- publicly held debt and gross federal debt. The difference is that federal debt is calculated by taking the amount of publicly held debt and adding to it the debt that is held by the government. These are typically IOUs between one governmental entity and another, such as the money owed by the general treasury to the Social Security trust fund. As of June 29, the gross federal debt -- the more all-encompassing of the two figures -- was $19.8 trillion. That rounds up to $20 trillion, the figure Johnson cited. The other debt figure -- publicly held debt -- is smaller, at $14.3 trillion. However, since Johnson was very close to one of the two official figures, we won’t quibble. It’s trickier, though, to check whether the Congressional Budget Office -- a nonpartisan arm of Congress whose analyses are given significant weight in Washington policy debates -- projected an additional $129 trillion of ""accumulated deficits."" CBO does indeed calculate a figure for accumulated future deficits. CBO’s most recent Long Term Budget Outlook, released in March 2017, mainly discusses deficits and debt between now and 2047 as a percentage of gross domestic product. But we were able to check Johnson’s statement by reverse-engineering the dollar amounts using the percentages in the report. CBO projects $91.5 trillion in public debt by 2047, up from $14.8 trillion in 2017. That’s an increase of $77 trillion over 30 years. But remember that this is the figure for the public debt, the smaller of the two debt measurements, so we used that to estimate the size of the gross federal debt. Today, gross debt is 1.39 times larger than public debt. If that ratio holds steady over the next 30 years -- a big assumption -- then the gross federal debt in 2047 would be about $107 trillion. That still falls a bit short of Johnson’s $129 trillion. Why the gap? The answer: Johnson was applying a no-longer-used CBO formula to make his own calculations Since 2013, Johnson, a trained accountant, has regularly sought to spread the word about the United States’ long-term debt challenges. He put together a series of charts and graphs that he shared with fellow lawmakers and members of the media, focusing on the 30-year time frame, a long-term view that Johnson felt was too often missing from the conversation. To put these charts together, Johnson used a calculation made by the CBO called the ""alternative fiscal scenario."" The main CBO projections usually use current law as the starting point and assume that current law will continue indefinitely. However, to offer a wider range of future possibilities, CBO sometimes offers an ""alternative"" scenario using different assumptions about what the law would look like in the future. Because this alternative scenario tends to project higher future deficits, it explains why Johnson’s figure of $129 trillion is bigger than the official CBO projection of $107 trillion. CBO produced the alternative fiscal scenario itself, so it comes with significant credibility. However, it’s worth pointing out a caveat: The CBO hasn’t produced calculations based on its alternative fiscal scenario since its 2015 report, when Congress made moot a major reason the calculation was devised in the first place. (That year, Congress stopped putting off a planned cut in Medicare reimbursement for doctors and incorporated the higher rates into permanent law.) Johnson’s office said it ran the calculations by CBO while they were being developed. Still, the way Johnson framed the numbers in the op-ed is not strictly accurate. Johnson in his op-ed adapted a past calculation by CBO to make his claim. He wasn’t reporting what CBO produced. This framing matters, because it effectively turns a calculation by a partisan senator into one by an independent analyst. Johnson wrote, ""We are $20 trillion in debt. The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years."" Johnson’s figures are plausible. Even the official CBO figure of $107 trillion in 30 years -- while smaller than Johnson's $129 trillion -- is a huge number. But the attribution is sloppy. While the figure is based on CBO data, it is not an actual, current projection by CBO. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/jun/30/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-offers-credible-projection-federal-deb/

As Milwaukee County executive, Scott Walker didn't hold line on property taxes as much as he says
","Wisconsin Democrats such as U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan say they believe Republican Gov. Scott Walker will run again for president, even though his 2016 candidacy was short lived. And Walker, eying a run for a third term as governor in 2018, continues to stake out positions that draw praise from conservatives around the country, such as aiming to make Wisconsin the first state to drug test Medicaid recipients. Walker even touts his record as Milwaukee County executive, the job he held previously. He did so in a June 5, 2017 interview with Jerry Bader, a conservative radio talk show host in Green Bay, saying:   ""Eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year."" It’s true that Walker never proposed to increase the levy -- the total amount of property taxes collected -- and that he tried, with vetoes, to stave off levy increases approved by the County Board of Supervisors. But saying he ""pushed through budgets"" suggests he was successful, when in fact he largely was not: In eight of Walker’s nine years as county executive, the levy increased. Let’s take a look. Walker’s evidence Walker proposed nine county budgets, for 2003 through 2011, before taking office as governor in January 2011. Working with a left-leaning County Board, typically there was a tug-of-war in which Walker tended toward lower property taxes and less spending, while the board would aim for more. Often there were Walker vetoes and veto overrides by the board. To back Walker’s claim, his staff pointed us to figures from the Milwaukee County budget archive. For his first two budgets, for 2003 and 2004, Walker proposed a property tax levy lower than what the County Board had adopted the previous year. But for both budgets, the County Board adopted levies higher than what Walker proposed. Ultimately, the levy rose in 2003 and dropped in 2004. Then a routine developed: 1. Walker would propose for his new budget a levy that was the same amount as the previous year’s levy. 2. The County Board would override Walker vetoes and adopt a budget that included a levy higher than what Walker proposed. 3. Walker would use that increased levy as his proposed levy for the next year’s budget. For example: Walker’s proposed levy of $225.9 million for 2006 was exactly the same as the levy that the County Board had adopted for 2005. But the levy that the board approved for 2006 was higher -- $232.6 million. And that was the levy Walker then made in his budget proposal for 2007. Here are the figures for the county budgets during Walker’s tenure: Year Recommended property tax levy  and change up or down from previous adopted levy Adopted property tax levy $ and change up or down from previous adopted levy 2002   218.7,734,713 2003 218,708,524 ↓ 219,494.183 ↑ 2004 219,425,702 ↓ 219,436.418 ↓ 2005 219.416,093 ↓ 225,883,651 ↑ 2006 225,883,651 -- 232,592,517 ↑ 2007 232,592,517 -- 241,047,846 ↑ 2008 $241,047,846 -- $249,889,950 ↑ 2009 $249,889,950 -- $257,637,284 ↑ 2010 $257,637,284 -- $263,264,740 ↑ 2011 $262,264,740 -- $269,554,701 ↑ As we noted, Walker frequently used his veto in an attempt to freeze the property tax levy. For example, he vetoed all of the increase in tax levy spending that the County Board added in the 2011 budget. But the board overrode the vetoes. Our rating Walker says that when he was Milwaukee County executive, ""eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year."" It was actually nine straight years that Walker proposed budgets that did not increase the levy -- the total amount of property taxes collected. But, to say he ""pushed through budgets"" that did not increase the levy is wrong. In eight of the nine years, the budgets adopted by the County Board -- over Walker’s vetoes -- raised the levy. And each year, Walker would use that increased levy as his proposal for the next year’s budget.

Shawn Thierry says Texas leads nation in rate of mothers dying in childbirth
","A Democrat credited the Republican governor for highlighting maternal mortality and then made a claim about Texas leading nationally in a disturbing way. Houston Rep. Shawn Thierry noted in a press release circulated the day after Gov. Greg Abbott set the agenda for the special legislative session starting July 18, 2017, that Abbott authorized maternal mortality as a potential topic after Thierry and Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, had urged him to do so. Thierry said: ""It was clear that a special session was going to happen and we now know that our Texas mothers are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation. This time around, we cannot afford for party politics to stand in the way of resolving this crisis."" Abbott included ""extending maternal mortality task force"" in his session ""call,"" he said, to allow lawmakers to maintain the state’s advisory Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force into 2023. The group, created by the 2013 Legislature, is otherwise abolished as of September 2019. We wondered if Texas mothers are more often dying in connection with childbirth than mothers in other states. That’s been reported previously, including in a June 4, 2017, Associated Press news story stating researchers last year found the Texas rate ""not only the highest in the U.S., but one of the highest in the developed world."" To our inquiry, a Thierry aide, Jasmine Connor, emailed us a web link to an August 2016 news story in the Guardian newspaper stating that according to a study in the medical journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, Texas in 2014 had the developed world’s highest maternal mortality rate at 35.8 deaths per 100,000 births. The journal is the official publication of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,  which describes itself as a 58,000-member organization dedicated to the advancement of women’s health. 2016 study When we inquired, an ACOG spokeswoman, Megan Christin, emailed us a copy of the study, which appeared in the journal’s September 2016 issue under the headline: ""Recent Increases in the U.S. Maternal Mortality Rate: Disentangling Trends From Measurement Issues,"" A methodological wrinkle was necessary, the authors wrote, to make sure the mortality rates estimated for each state reflected needed improvements in measurement. That is, the study adjusted each state’s tally of maternal deaths to account for whether the state’s death certificate already included a revealing question devised nationally in 2003 based on providing checkboxes on death certificates to measure whether women had been pregnant at up to a year before death. Adding the question, the study says, drove up reported maternal mortality rates. ""The addition of this question led to increases in reported maternal mortality rates,"" the study says. ""However, delays in states’ adoption of the new pregnancy question together with use of nonstandard pregnancy questions created a situation where, in any given data year, some states were using the U.S. standard question, others were using questions incompatible with the U.S. standard, and still others had no pregnancy question on their death certificates."" Broadly, the study relied on a definition of maternal mortality typically used for international maternal mortality comparisons. The definition, attributed to the World Health Organization: ""The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes."" The study says, though, the WHO also defines late maternal deaths: ""The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes more than 42 days but less than 1 year after termination of pregnancy."" Study: Texas saw a spike So, did Texas have the nation’s highest maternal mortality? The state had a yet-to-be explained spike in rates in 2011-12, the study says, giving it by far the highest rate in the country. Previously, adjusted maternal mortality rates for Texas showed a modest increase from 2000 to 2010, the study says, from a rate of 17.7 per 100,000 live-births to 18.6. ""However, after 2010, the reported maternal mortality rate for Texas doubled within a 2-year period to levels not seen in other U.S. states,"" the report says. A figure in the study shows the Texas rate reaching 35.8 deaths per 100,000 live-births by 2014. ADJUSTED MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE, TEXAS, 2000-2014                      SOURCE: Figure 4 in study, ""Recent Increases in the U.S. Maternal Mortality Rate: Disentangling Trends From Measurement Issues,"" Obstetrics & Gynecology, September 2016 The report also calls the two-year doubling for Texas through 2011-12 ""puzzling."" The authors continue: ""Texas cause-of-death data, as with data for most states, are coded at the National Center for Health Statistics, and this doubling in the rate was not found for other states. Communications with vital statistics personnel in Texas and at the National Center for Health Statistics did not identify any data processing or coding changes that would account for this rapid increase."" The report continues: ""There were some changes in the provision of women’s health services in Texas from 2011 to 2015, including the closing of several women’s health clinics. Still, in the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval, the doubling of a mortality rate within a 2-year period in a state with almost 400,000 annual births seems unlikely. A future study  will examine Texas data by race-ethnicity and detailed causes of death to better understand this unusual finding."" Among 48 other states, the estimated mortality rate in 2000 was 18.8; the rate escalated slowly to 23.8 in 2014, the report says. The remaining state, California, saw ""a marked decline in maternal and late maternal mortality from 2003 to 2014,"" the study says, going on: ""California has made concerted efforts to reduce maternal mortality, including initiating a statewide pregnancy-associated mortality review in 2006 and contracting with the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative to investigate primary causes of maternal death. This collaborative developed and promulgated evidence-based tool kits to address two of the most common, preventable contributors to maternal death (obstetric hemorrhage and preeclampsia) and implemented quality improvement initiatives throughout the state. These efforts appear to have helped reduce maternal mortality in California,"" the study says. Texas expert We were unable to connect with authors of the study including lead analyst Marian F. MacDorman of the Maryland Population Research Center at the University of Maryland, College Park. Meantime, Christin put us in touch with Dr. Lisa Hollier, ACOG’s president-elect and the chair of the 15-person Texas task force focused on maternal mortality. Hollier, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, said by phone the 2012 Texas spike identified in the study was unusual, even strange. In 2014, Hollier said, the task force began a case-by-case review of the 2012 deaths, she said, because that was then the latest year of complete death data. We asked Hollier if the 2012 spike seems to hold up. Hollier said: ""We need a tiny bit more time to give a perfect answer to that,"" with conclusions possibly announced later in 2017. Asked to assess Thierry’s claim about Texas leading the nation in deaths in childbirth, which arguably would overlook deaths in the months after delivery, Hollier said by email: ""As I considered this question, I believe that the proportion of all maternal deaths that occur literally ‘in childbirth’ would be largely equivalent across states. Given the high rates of maternal mortality in Texas relative to other states, I believe this would mean that deaths ‘in childbirth’ would  also be high in Texas relative to other states."" State agency response We also wondered if Texas government officials had analyzed the research suggesting Texas lately has the nation’s highest maternal mortality rate. At the Texas Department of State Health Services, spokesman Chris Van Deusen replied to our query by email by saying the agency doesn’t have data for other states or do related rankings. Van Deusen otherwise confirmed that officials are looking into what appears to have been a ""pronounced difference"" in Texas women in 2012 dying in childbirth or within a year afterward. Van Deusen said that to date, the task force had found the most common causes of maternal death in 2011-2012 were cardiac events (21 percent), drug overdoses (12 percent) and hypertension/eclampsia (11 percent). The task force’s July 2016 report states: ""Cardiac events and hypertension/eclampsia were ranked first and third most common causes of maternal death, which is consistent with medical literature. However, overdose by ingestion of drugs emerged as the second leading cause of maternal death in 2011-2012 (11.6 percent). Review of actual case records (including postmortem toxicology and police reports) showed that the majority of these maternal deaths involved licit or illicit prescription opioids. This finding is alarming and may represent an ongoing shift in maternal causes of death."" Also of concern, the task force said, was the number of maternal deaths that occurred months after delivery. Close to 60 percent of Texas maternal deaths 2011-2012 ""occurred after 42 days post-delivery,"" the task force wrote. ""Case review of these deaths will determine whether they were pregnancy-related, -associated, or neither. Nevertheless, it is clear that women remain at-risk for the first year after their pregnancy has ended. It is possible that lack of continuity of care plays a role in these later maternal death outcomes."" In June 2017, Van Deusen wrote us: ""Maternal deaths have been increasing in Texas at the same time we have seen increases in the chronic diseases that underlie many deaths: from 2005 to 2014, pre-pregnancy obesity of mothers increased 25 percent, hypertension increased 20 percent, and diabetes increased 45 percent."" The state official also provided a chart suggesting that in 2014, 126 or 135 maternal deaths were reported in Texas, giving the state a rate of 31.5 or 33.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 live-births, according to respective counts by DSHS and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with both rates a decrease from 2013 and the CDC-reported rate down 13 percent from the 38.7 deaths per 100,000 live-births posted for 2012: Texas Maternal Deaths Within 42 days After The End of Pregnancy DSHS Data CDC Wonder Data Maternal deaths Live Births Maternal Mortality Rate Maternal deaths Live Births Maternal Mortality Rate 2010 72       385,746 18.7 72      386,118 18.6 2011 100       377,274 26.5 114      377,445 30.2 2012 110       382,438 28.8 148      382,727 38.7 2013 126       387,110 32.5 140      387,340 36.1 2014 126       399,482 31.5 135      399,766 33.8 SOURCE: Emails, Chris Van Deusen, director of media services, Texas Department of State Health Services, June 8-9, 2017 Limited federal data At Hollier’s suggestion, we also checked on whether the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports state-by-state maternal mortality rates. Our web search yielded the center’s 2017 assessment that the national rate reached a high of 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2009 and 2011, according to the center’s review of state-forwarded death certificates for women who died within a year of delivering. CDC says: ""Whether the actual risk of a woman dying from pregnancy-related causes has increased is unclear. Many studies show that an increasing number of pregnant women in the United States have chronic health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic heart disease. These conditions may put a pregnant woman at higher risk of pregnancy complications. Although the overall risk of dying from pregnancy complications is low, some women are at a higher risk than others. The higher pregnancy-related mortality ratios during 2009–2011 are due to an increase in infection and sepsis deaths.""  SOURCE: Web page, ""Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, last updated May 10, 2017 (accessed May 26, 2017) At our request, Kimberly Rodriguez of the CDC emailed charts based on agency data showing that in 2015 among only 15 states with reported maternal death rates, Texas tied with Missouri for the third-highest rate of deaths per 100,000 residents, behind Louisiana, Georgia and Indiana. That’s a different indicator, though, than deaths per 100,000 live-births. In the end, CDC spokesman Brian Tsai suggested by email that we rely on the older figures covered by the 2016 study we'd already reviewed. Our ruling Thierry said Texas mothers ""are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation."" In 2011 and 2012, according to a 2016 study, Texas had by far the nation’s highest maternal mortality rate.

Sean Spicer tweets misleading Obamacare statistic
","After the delay of a vote on the Senate’s controversial health bill, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer took to Twitter to assuage concerns regarding the increase in the uninsured population projected by a Congressional Budget Office report. Spicer tweeted an image that said, ""28.2 million Americans are still waiting under Obamacare and remain uninsured!"" 28.2M Americans are still waiting under #Obamacare and remain uninsured. They need relief now. #RepealAndReplace pic.twitter.com/guEEOiaXDy We checked the National Center for Health Statistics and found that 28.2 million people were indeed uninsured as of 2016. We also found, however, that the tweet neglects to show the full picture. The same bullet point Spicer seems to quote points out that we have 20.4 million fewer uninsured people since 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act went into effect. The current 8.8 percent rate of uninsured persons is the lowest since 1972. ""Nor did he mention that the Senate bill would result in approximately zero of the 28.2 million currently uninsured becoming insured. Quite the opposite,"" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. About 22 million people would be added to the ranks of the uninsured in 2026 under the Senate bill, according to the CBO, while the House-passed American Health Care Act would add 23 million people. The Senate bill would bring the non-elderly uninsured population to 49 million, and the House bill to 51 million by 2026; both numbers are quite higher than the 28.2 million currently uninsured. While there was never the expectation that the ACA would bring the number of uninsured Americans down to zero, there is a viable argument that the ACA did not do enough to expand coverage. But neither bill proposed in Congress now would reverse this trend. ""While there are proposals that could reduce the number of uninsured — including expanding Medicaid in more states and providing more generous financial assistance to people buying coverage on the individual market — those are generally policies that the administration and its congressional allies have opposed,"" said Matt Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings' Economic Studies Program. The states that elected not to expand Medicaid coverage account for about 2.6 million of the uninsured population, according to Kaiser Family Foundation Executive Vice President Diane Rowland. That number may increase because the Senate bill cuts federal assistance to Medicaid. States that have opted into the expansion program might begin scaling back coverage. According to the CBO, ""despite being eligible for premium tax credits, few low-income people would purchase any plan."" The 3 million people who are uninsured because they make too much money for subsidies will not be covered, either, as the poverty level that qualifies people for subsidies is increasing. ""It would lower the subsidy levels and it would make them much more costly for older people who are pre-Medicare, so you would expect fewer of them to try to take up coverage and many who have coverage to drop it,"" Rowland said. The 5.4 million people uninsured because they are undocumented will remain uninsured, too, as the Senate bill doesn’t cover undocumented people. About 4.5 million people now who could get insurance through work go without it. The bill removes the employer penalty, so coverage provided through work would decrease further.   ""It’s basically prohibiting anyone who has an offer of employer coverage from being able to get a tax credit, so it wouldn’t help any of the people who can’t afford their employer coverage,"" Rowland said. Finally, the remaining 12 million people who are eligible for coverage but haven’t participated is expected to grow, as the Senate bill eliminates the individual mandate that was designed to lure those people in. Spicer said that 28.2 million Americans remain uninsured under Obamacare, an accurate claim based on the most recent numbers. However, the talking point is out of context, as it ignores that this is in fact a historic low in the United States. He suggests that repealing the ACA would decrease this figure, but the CBO and health care experts agree that the opposite would happen under the proposed House and Senate versions of the health care bill.

"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Florida', 'Michael Needham']","
Are Medicaid patients more likely to die than uninsured, as Heritage Action CEO says?
","In his defense of the Republican Senate health care proposal, Heritage Action for America CEO Michael Needham argued that some patients on Medicaid are more likely to die than those without insurance. Needham, who heads up the conservative organization, questioned the effectiveness of Medicaid in an interview on Fox News Sunday June 25. ""If the Democratic Party wants to become the party of Medicaid, I don't think it's going to have a lot of success in the 21st century. Medicaid was a program designed in the middle of the last century where health outcomes between people on Medicaid and the completely uninsured are exactly the same. Actually, on some procedures, you're more likely to die if you're on Medicaid than if you're uninsured,"" Needham said. Legislation in both the House and Senate would slow the rate of Medicaid spending and result in enrollment declines, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A spokesman for Needham said his statement about deaths for those on Medicaid compared with the uninsured came from a 2011 Wall Street Journal op-ed by Scott Gottlieb, who was recently confirmed as FDA commissioner. Gottlieb was also a clinical assistant professor at the New York University School of Medicine and a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Gottlieb wrote that for Medicaid patients, ""in some cases, they’d do just as well without health insurance."" He cited four studies about the outcomes of patients on Medicaid for certain types of procedures. We were able to reach the authors of three of those studies, and they disputed Gottlieb’s conclusions. University of Virginia study was only about people who underwent surgery The largest study, done by the University of Virginia and published in 2010, followed the patient outcomes of almost 900,000 major surgeries across the country. The study kept track of whether those patients had private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or no insurance at all. The results showed Medicaid patients were more likely to die following a procedure than the uninsured, but the deaths result from the fact that Medicaid patients tend to begin treatment in poorer health. That's a critical distinction, said one of the key researchers for the study, Dr. Irving Kron, a University of Virginia School of Medicine professor and cardiovascular surgeon. Kron told PolitiFact that Needham’s conclusion is incorrect. Kron has said that his study doesn’t mean Medicaid is to blame for higher odds of patient deaths. While the study adjusts for socioeconomic factors, it notes that if you’re on Medicaid, you’re probably suffering from a long list of risk factors other patients don’t have. Medicaid recipients are the poorest, least educated and sickest of all patients. Those patients have the highest incidence of AIDS, depression, liver disease, neurologic disorders, psychoses and metastatic cancer, according to the study. ""The reality is it’s apples and oranges,"" Kron previously told PolitiFact. ""The problem with Medicaid is there’s more emergencies, because they’re sicker than most people. … They wait for care and unfortunately, emergent patients don’t do as well as elective patients."" Some other studies were narrow in scope Gottlieb’s op-ed also cited studies examining outcomes for Medicaid patients who had cancer of the throat, coronary angioplasty or lung transplants. We tracked down authors of two of the studies; they rejected Gottlieb’s conclusions. Gottlieb cited a 2010 study of 1,231 patients with cancer of the throat, published in the medical journal Cancer. The study found that Medicaid patients and people lacking any health insurance were both 50 percent more likely to die when compared with privately insured patients—even after adjusting for factors that influence cancer outcomes, Gottlieb wrote. However, the authors of that report told PolitiFact that Gottlieb’s conclusion was wrong. One of the caveats of the insurance records used for this study was that no distinction was made between patients who were covered by Medicaid at the time of diagnosis and those who were uninsured at diagnosis but were then enrolled in Medicaid, said Scott M. Langevin, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Health University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Since researchers were unable to consider the Medicaid and uninsured groups separately, it’s an ""errant interpretation"" to conclude that health outcomes for people on Medicaid and those completely uninsured are exactly the same, Langevin said. Gottlieb also cited a study about outcomes for patients who underwent coronary angioplasty (a procedure to open clogged heart arteries). Dr. Michael Gaglia, associate professor of medicine at the University of New Mexico and an author of the 2011 study in the American Journal of Cardiology, said that Gottlieb ignores the full findings of his study and the broader picture about Medicaid. For those younger than 65, the Medicaid patients fared a little better than those who were uninsured, he said. He said that such arguments that having Medicaid is worse than not having insurance is ""absurd."" ""This implication that somehow you get worse care with an insurance plan -- Medicaid -- than you would by not having an insurance plan at all -- no coverage, just going to the ER for emergencies -- for most reasonable people that doesn’t make any sense,"" he said. PolitiFact has previously found at least seven academic papers that detected a link between securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. In general, these papers present a stronger consensus that having insurance saves lives. Harvard researchers recently wrote a piece summarizing the evidence on the effect of Medicaid or other insurance on mortality. Their review of the evidence concludes that insurance like Medicaid significantly reduces mortality relative to being uninsured, said Katherine Baicker, one of the authors. The researchers found that ""coverage expansions significantly increase patients’ access to care and use of preventive care, primary care, chronic illness treatment, medications, and surgery. These increases appear to produce significant, multifaceted, and nuanced benefits to health."" Our ruling Needham said, ""Actually, on some procedures, you're more likely to die if you're on Medicaid than if you're uninsured."" Needham points to a 2011 op-ed that cited studies about the outcomes of patients on Medicaid for certain types of procedures.

Newt Gingrich misleads with point that House health care bill grows Medicaid spending
","Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said all the media coverage that declares the Republican health care bills would cut Medicaid is wrong, because he claimed the program actually gets a significant boost over the years. Reports about both the House and Senate bills have pointed out the measures reduce funding for Medicaid, the joint state and federal health insurance program for the very poor. Using the House bill as an example, Gingrich said it’s really the opposite. ""After all the news media talking about cutting Medicaid in the House Republican bill, I did some research,"" Gingrich said June 27, 2017, on Fox & Friends. ""It actually goes up 20 percent over the next 10 years."" Gingrich said Republicans had a ""communications problem"" for not pointing this growth out when discussing the bill, resulting in coverage focused on deep Medicaid cuts. Those news reports mostly focus on analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bill before the Senate would reduce Medicaid spending by $772 billion over 10 years by 2026, the CBO said. A similar analysis for the bill that passed the House in May would winnow Medicaid spending by $834 billion in the same time frame. So where is Gingrich getting his 20 percent increase in Medicaid spending from? We reached out to his office and didn’t hear back. But it appears he’s talking about the rate at which Medicaid will grow over the next decade — something the program’s slated to do whether Republicans pass a health care law or not. The GOP proposals, however, put major limits on future funding for that growth. Medicaid originally was a program for low-income children, pregnant women, elderly and disabled individuals, and some parents, but it excluded other low-income adults. As part of its efforts to provide health coverage options for as many people as possible, the Affordable Care Act allowed states to expand Medicaid and help pay for it with more federal dollars. Thirty-one states plus Washington, D.C., currently have extended Medicaid benefits to essentially all adults making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The poverty line for a family of four is $24,600 in 2017. That coverage is expensive, and it’s only going to cost more as the years go on. For calculating how the GOP bills may affect Medicaid spending, the CBO used baseline figures from March 2016 to draw estimates for how much the program would cost. ""There are two reasons Medicaid costs go up: More people are being served and the cost of serving them is going up,"" said Joan Alker, Georgetown University public policy professor and executive director of the Center for Children and Families. Costs could rise due to increasing drug prices, inflation, an aging population with more older Americans, or any number of other considerations. ""CBO's baseline projects what Medicaid will need to account for these factors,"" Alker said. From 2017 through 2026, the federal government would spend more than $5 trillion on Medicaid under current law, the CBO projected. Another way to measure that growth is to calculate the percent change from current spending levels to that estimated 2026 level. If the Affordable Care Act stayed in place and nothing changed, the CBO said Medicaid spending would increase from $393 billion in 2017 to $624 billion in 2026. That’s a 58.8 percent increase. Now come the semantics: The House and Senate bills both slow the rate of that increase in spending, although they do so in different ways and on different schedules. But they both assume major reductions in how high the dollar amount for funding increases. Opponents of the GOP bills call that a cut. The CBO calls that ""reductions in outlays."" Gingrich is saying it’s an increase. How? It looks like Gingrich focused on the projection for how the House bill would affect future funding. Starting with the $393 billion in spending in 2017, Medicaid spending would go up steadily each year to reach $474 billion in 2026, under the House bill. That’s a 20.6 percent increase. The Senate’s plan would increase funding to $466 billion in 2026, or about 18.5 percent higher than 2017. The projections assume what would happen if the bills took effect, with reductions starting in 2018. The CBO said that under the House’s bill, 14 million fewer people would be enrolled in Medicaid by 2026, relative to current law. The Senate bill would see 15 million fewer enrollees. Keep in mind that Medicaid spending goes up under any scenario. It’s just at a far lower rate under the Republican health care bills. Policy analysts told us it makes reductions to Medicaid with no allowance for how the program may need to grow in the future. ""If he's claiming that there's no cut in the (House bill) because Medicaid spending in 2026 would be higher than it is now, that's largely irrelevant,"" Ben Sommers, a Harvard University health policy and economics professor, told PolitiFact. ""Given that this dramatically reduces spending to what would occur under current law, most people would call this a ‘cut.’ "" Such reductions also put new limits on how many people have access to Medicaid. The changes all but guarantee states will have to alter eligibility requirements and take away benefits — without regard to whether people actually need them. ""The bills restrain the rate of increase well below Medicaid’s actual rate of increase,"" said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor. ""Of course it’s a cut. If federal growth is kept artificially low, the only choice is to spend more to make up the deficit."" Gingrich said under the House health care bill, Medicaid spending ""actually goes up 20 percent over the next 10 years."" By any CBO projection and under any proposed legislation, Medicaid spending will increase over the next decade — because health care costs are increasing. The House health care bill limits that increase to 20 percent, while maintaing the status quo requires a 60 percent increase, according to the CBO. Both the bills in the House and the Senate limit the growth of spending. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Paul Ryan wrong that most of the 22 million uninsured would be uninsured by choice
","One of the strongest complaints about the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, is it requires everyone to have insurance. To one degree or another, both the Senate and House bills do away with that requirement. When asked about the estimated 22 million people who would become uninsured under the Senate bill, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., emphasized the upside of giving people the freedom to choose. Ryan offered this take on the report on the Senate bill from the Congressional Budget Office report on Fox News on June 27: ""What they're basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office is, if you're not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won't buy it. So it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan. It's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want."" Ryan added that ending the expansion of Medicaid also played a role in the relative drop in the insured. We went back to the CBO report to see if in fact, it ""basically"" said that people will choose not to buy insurance. In terms of 22 million fewer insured, the CBO did not. Ryan’s press office said he was talking about the first year after the bill would take effect, and it that respect, he has a point. The CBO said it and the Joint Committee on Taxation ""estimate that, in 2018, 15 million more people would be uninsured under this legislation than under current law — primarily because the penalty for not having insurance would be eliminated."" But Ryan was asked about the 22 million figure, which is the estimate for 2026. That estimate was the sum of two groups — a Medicaid group totalling 15 million people, and the non-group insurance market amounting to 7 million people. Medicaid is a free or low-cost government health insurance plan for the poor. The biggest single chunk of savings under the Senate bill comes out of Medicaid. The CBO said that compared with the laws in place today, 15 million fewer people who need insurance would be able to get it through Medicaid or anywhere else. Ryan’s answer flipped the CBO presentation. According to the CBO, the Senate bill’s impact on people who would get coverage through Medicaid is double that of people who buy on the insurance market. That’s where people make the kind of choices Ryan was talking about. On top of that, this CBO chart shows that people currently eligible for Medicaid represent about two-thirds of the drop in Medicaid enrollment. These are people who otherwise would have had a plan — Medicaid — but wouldn’t under the Senate bill. But even for the smaller group of 7 million people in the nongroup insurance market, Ryan’s answer oversimplifies the CBO message. The reports says, ""Fewer people would enroll in the nongroup market mainly because the penalty for not having insurance would be eliminated and, starting in 2020, because the average subsidy for coverage in that market would be substantially lower for most people currently eligible for subsidies — and for some people that subsidy would be eliminated."" So the CBO number includes people who want insurance but are priced out of the market when coverage subsidies fall or disappear. ""People are going to become uninsured because they can't afford insurance any more, just like they couldn’t before the Affordable Care Act,"" said Diane Rowland, executive vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health care data. As this CBO chart shows, the loss of insurance would be heavily concentrated among people making less than 200 percent of federal poverty. That is consistent with the idea that unaffordability, not choice, is the driving force. Ryan paraphrased the CBO as saying that millions more would not be insured basically because they would be free not to buy a policy they didn’t want. Some people won’t buy policies due to simple choice, but many others will become uninsured because they’re no longer eligible for Medicaid. The CBO said two-thirds of the 22 million without insurance would lose out through cuts in the Medicaid program. For the remaining 7 million, some portion of those would have chosen not to buy coverage, but some portion would want to buy but find insurance unaffordable. Ryan’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores a lot of what the CBO said. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/jun/28/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-wrong-most-22-million-uninsured-would-be/

Top cause of preventable death: heroin, prescription opioids, AG candidate Brad Schimel says
","Federal health officials have documented a rise in overdose deaths from opioids -- heroin, as well as prescription painkillers such as OxyContin that can lead to heroin abuse. The latest figures, reported in July 2014, show there were 4,397 heroin deaths across the country in 2011, up 44 percent from 2010. Meanwhile, prescription opioid deaths, following a more than decade-long rise, claimed many more lives -- 16,917, up 2 percent. But, comparatively speaking, just how serious is the opioid problem? In an Aug. 15, 2014 interview on Wisconsin Public Television, Waukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel, the Republican candidate for state attorney general, was asked what he considered the most important facing the winner of the Nov. 4, 2014 election. Schimel -- who faces Jefferson County District Attorney Susan Happ, a Democrat -- gave this response: ""Well, right now, the biggest public safety issue we face is the heroin and prescription opioid problem. It is the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin. It surpassed traffic crashes quite a few years ago already."" Is it true that overdoses from heroin or prescription opioids not only outnumber traffic fatalities, but are the top cause of accidental deaths in Wisconsin? The statistics The latest figures from the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that nationally, there were 41,340 fatal drug overdoses of all types in 2011, making it the leading cause of injury death in the country. But what about in Wisconsin? When we asked Schimel’s campaign about his claim, Schimel replied in an email that he had misspoken. He told us he meant to say that the number of all drug overdose deaths in Wisconsin -- not just heroin and prescription opioid deaths -- exceed the number of motor vehicle deaths and are the top cause of accidental deaths. We checked the latest report from the state Department of Health Services, which said there were 2,789 accidental deaths in 2012. The leading cause was 1,091 falls (which also was the leading cause in 2011, according to the department). There were 615 motor vehicle deaths. The same number of deaths -- 615-- was caused by ""accidental poisoning and exposure to noxious substances."" But those 615 included deaths caused by a variety of drugs, as well as other substances such as alcohol. Separately, we obtained figures from the health department showing there were 511 opioid deaths in Wisconsin in 2012. That included 187 heroin deaths, up from 27 in 2002. And there were 324 deaths caused either by prescription opioids or a mix of prescription opioids and heroin, up from 144 in 2002. Our rating Schimel said heroin and prescription opioidss are ""the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin."" Schimel acknowledged to us that he misspoke and in fact opioid deaths are down the list. The latest figures, for 2012, show falls was the leading causes of accidental death in Wisconsin. Tied for second were motor vehicle deaths and drug overdose of all types -- including 511 deaths from heroin or prescription opioids.

Georgia's finances not alarming as report suggests
","Outside rankings of Georgia have fueled the fire of some of this year’s political campaigns. Republican Gov. Nathan Deal has boasted that both the little-known magazine Site Selection and media heavyweight CNBC have deemed Georgia the top place in the nation to do business. Democratic challenger Jason Carter questioned the political mileage of the rankings, saying they mask other problems such as an unemployment rate that ranks 50th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia. Now the nonpartisan think tank Truth in Accounting in Chicago has released a study blasting Georgia for carrying a nearly $16 billion debt burden, mostly from unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities. It ranks Georgia’s financial condition as the 28th worst among all states. ""In order to fill this financial hole, each Georgia taxpayer would have to send $5,000 to the state’s treasury,"" according to a summary of the study. Who has that kind of coin lying around? PolitiFact Georgia sure doesn’t. But how is it the state have both a balanced budget requirement and that kind of debt? Sheila Weinberg, the certified public accountant who founded TIA, thinks the problem lies with Georgia (and other states) not including long-term pension and retiree health care compensation in the annual budget. Georgia’s audited financial report shows $2 billion in retirement benefits. But Weinberg claims by adding in those other compensations, the state has more than $14 billion of unfunded retirement programs over the next three decades. Every state has that kind of long-term obligation. Now, those unfunded liabilities are in the footnotes of the financial statements filed yearly. The Government Accounting Standards board, though, is changing those accounting rules. Pension liabilities will be on the balance sheets starting with the 2014 reports. If Georgia followed those standards this year, the state Employees Retirement System, or ERS, would show a $4.8 billion unfunded liability. But those rules affect only how those debts are reported. It doesn’t change their totals or decide the policies on funding them. In Georgia, pension funding is governed by state law, which requires an actuary to calculate the annual required minimum contribution to meet the long-term obligation. As of 2013, Georgia also adds extra cash to that minimum, amortized over 25 years, to fill the gap. The state sets aside that money first, before determining the rest of the budget. It has never failed to do so. The ERS – which covers 60,000 active members and 45,000 retirees – was 71.4 percent funded in 2013. That puts it just shy of the 72 percent average for the nation’s largest pension funds and among those funds considered well-funded for the future, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ""Our contributions come in like clockwork every year,"" said Jim Potvin, the ERS’ executive director. ""The support has come from multiple administrations literally spanning decades."" But if pension costs are obligated, retiree healthcare costs are optional. The TIA study projects the retiree health care liability at $7.4 billion. It would require changes to state law – most likely to reduce benefits – to lower that cost. Alan Essig, executive director of the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said such changes are far more likely than the option of tax hikes in our fiscally conservative state. ""It’s not as if we have to pay tomorrow,"" Essig said. ""We have 30 years to plan budgetarily and change policy to meet our obligations."" In other words, Georgia has never missed its obligations on retiree health care or pension, and there is no reason to expect that will change anytime soon. And, since no one expects Georgia taxpayers to march downtown and make a lump sum payment, the report’s calculations strike some as a silly exercise. There is value in discussing the obligations, said Alicia H. Munnell, the executive director of the Center for Retirement Research. But a more useful exercise would be to have a separate discussion about ways to pay the debt long-term. Georgia, Munnell said, has already had many of those discussions that resulted in the existing laws and policies that have it on the right financial track. ""The whole report has this alarmist tone, as if they’ve discovered something new,"" Munnell said. ""Really, Georgia should be proud of itself for being fairly prudently managed to pay off its debts."" So, that $5,000 bill facing Georgia taxpayers? It’s a great way to get us to pay attention to the promises we’ve made with public dollars. The statement suggests that the state is being reckless, or that a one-time payment is coming soon. That is not the case. Georgia has been thoughtful about its looming obligations and positioned itself to pay down those debts over time. For that reason, we rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/27/truth-accounting/georgias-finances-not-alarming-report-suggests/

An unarmed black person is shot 'every 28 hours,' says Marc Lamont Hill
","In the days before the funeral of 18-year-old Ferguson, Mo., resident Michael Brown, two black pundits appeared on CNN to debate what his killing meant for race relations in America. It quickly turned into a shoutfest driven by the opposing political views of conservative radio host Larry Elder and liberal professor and author Marc Lamont Hill. Elder blamed the media for inflaming the racism narrative and ignoring that black homicide is the No. 1 cause of death among young black men. (We previously fact-checked a similar claim and found it to be True.) ""How often does it happen that an unarmed black is shot by a cop?"" Elder asked in the Aug. 20, 2014, interview. ""Every 28 hours,"" Hill said. ""Every 28 hours, Larry. Larry, every 28 hours. According to the MXGM study, a black person is killed by law enforcement, vigilantes or security ..."" Elder cut in, but Hill revisited his point later in the interview, saying, ""But if this study bears out, and it does, that every 28 hours an unarmed black person is killed, then that also is a problem."" We wanted to see if that statistic is correct. We didn’t hear back from Hill, but as he said on CNN, he is referencing a 2013 report by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement called ""Every 28 Hours,"" which examined killings of African-Americans in 2012 by law enforcement, security guards and ""vigilantes"" who claimed self-defense. The report is not an academic, unbiased representation of these deaths. It was put together by one volunteer researcher and details 313 deaths based on news clips and police reports. It arrives at one death ""every 28 hours"" by dividing the number of hours in a year, 8,760, by the number of deaths, 313. But the report doesn’t say what Hill offered on CNN, that an ""unarmed black person is killed"" every 28 hours. In fact, less than half of the people who were killed were unarmed, according to MXGM. PunditFact found 136 were labeled as unarmed after reviewing the compiled profiles. The 28-hour calculation factored in all 313 deaths, which included people who were armed, ""allegedly"" armed and unarmed. That’s an important distinction not reflected in Hill’s claim. Also, not all of the ""unarmed"" people are analogous to Brown’s case or were killed by police. Included in the unarmed tally, for instance, is Trayvon Martin, the Miami Gardens teen who was killed by a neighborhood watchman named George Zimmerman. In other cases, whether someone was really ""unarmed"" may depend on your definition. In nine cases, police said they shot at suspects because they were charging at them from behind the wheel of a vehicle. Another case to make the list is Rudy Eugene, the Miami man who attacked a homeless man and gnawed his face before police shot him to death. We also found several ""unarmed"" deaths that were due to accidents, many car crashes as officers sped to a scene. In another example, one woman was killed at her birthday party, hosted by an off-duty police officer, when she hugged the officer from behind and somehow set off his gun. Our ruling When asked how often an unarmed black is shot by a cop, Hill answered ""every 28 hours."" He then referenced a report issued by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement and said ""that every 28 hours an unarmed black person is killed."" Either description is incorrect. The report, which is not an academic work, reaches its conclusion by including deaths that were not at the hands of police, deaths of blacks who were armed, car accidents, and deaths of blacks who were in aggressive or hostile situations. The report only classified 136 of 313 deaths as unarmed, which does not support his claim that an unarmed black person is shot by police every 28 hours. We rate the claim False.

CNN's Don Lemon says automatic weapons are easy to get
","Fans of the Second Amendment have been chiding CNN’s Don Lemon for his comments about the sorts of guns you can legally buy in this country. They’ve said Lemon was confused, and his exchange with conservative radio host Ben Ferguson on Aug. 20, 2014, was embarrassing. It began when Lemon, broadcasting live from Ferguson, Mo., said he supported the Second Amendment but that he doubted the Founding Fathers were thinking about automatic weapons when they wrote it. Ferguson shot back. ""Let’s deal with the facts here,"" Ferguson said. ""A semi-automatic weapon is a gun that you or I is allowed to own and in different places they have different rules. But to imply that anyone can just go out and buy an automatic weapon is just not true, Don."" ""What do you mean?"" Lemon said. ""During the theater shooting in Colorado, I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon, and I maybe have shot a gun three, four times in my life. I don’t live in Colorado. I think most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon."" This fact-check zeros in on Lemon’s claim that ""most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon."" The gun Lemon bought in Colorado was an AR-15. The version sold by the Bushmaster company is described as a semi-automatic. When Ferguson pointed out the difference between a fully automatic and an semi-automatic weapon, Lemon dismissed the distinction as a matter of semantics. ""An automatic weapon is something that you can shoot off a number of rounds very quickly,"" Lemon said. That is not the legal definition of an automatic weapon, but this debate pulls back the curtain on a couple of wrinkles in what federal law says and does not say. For starters, the law fails to define the term ""automatic."" Semi vs. fully automatic The 1968 Gun Control Act defines a semi-automatic as ""any repeating rifle which utilizes a portion of the energy of a firing cartridge to extract the fired cartridge case and chamber the next round, and which requires a separate pull of the trigger to fire each cartridge."" The key part there is the ""separate pull of the trigger."" One pull = one shot. The law speaks clearly about what it means by the term semi-automatic. When it comes to the term ""automatic,"" a little inference is required. The 1934 National Firearms Act defines a machine gun as ""any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger."" Note that part about more than one shot by ""a single function of the trigger."" One pull = many shots. That’s the legal difference between a semi-automatic and a fully automatic weapon. The AR-15 that Lemon bought was a semi-automatic. People can go out and buy such guns at many stores across the country. Buying a fully automatic gun is a very different and more restricted process, which we’ll get into in just a bit. But it’s interesting that while the legal definition of a machine gun talks about firing automatically, there is no definition of an automatic weapon as such. We asked the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and a couple of top legal experts on federal gun laws. No one could point to legal language, court ruling or federal rule that make a machine gun interchangeable with an automatic, even though in a practical sense, they are. Yes, you can buy a machine gun During the exchange between Lemon and Ferguson, Ferguson said ""the majority of private citizens are not allowed to own full automatic weapons."" Steven Howard is a lawyer and firearms expert based in Lansing, Mich. Howard said the ban on machine guns is not quite as complete as Ferguson’s words might sound. ""Most people can buy machine guns in lots of states,"" Howard said. ""But, and this is one of those classic big ‘buts,’ they have to get through a background check by FBI that is as thorough as if you are getting clearance to become a federal agent."" Howard said those checks can take up to six months. States such as California, Iowa and Kansas, ban private ownership under any circumstances. But in about half the country, including Florida and Texas, if you pay the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms $200 and have a clean record free of any history of domestic violence or a felony conviction, you can get yourself a machine gun legally. However, Joseph Olson, recently retired as professor of law at Hamline University, and a former board member of the National Rifle Association, said it won’t be a new one. ""There was a freeze put on them in 1986,"" Olson said. ""New Jersey representative (William) Hughes had an amendment that limited them to the ones that were registered at that time. There are a bit under 300,000 in circulation."" New devices blur the lines Since the key legal difference between a semi-automatic and a machine gun is whether pulling the trigger releases one bullet or many, it is worth noting that government regulators have approved devices that, when added to a rifle, allow a gun like an AR-15 to fire many rounds at great speed. They are called bump stocks, or trigger activators. The hunting supplier Cabela’s offers one called the Slide Fire. ""Maximize your fun with this safe and innovative AR-15 stock, which uses bump-fire technology to shoot as quickly as desired,"" the retailer says on its website. Videos show shooters going through clip after clip of ammunition. Howard said that while the rate of fire mimics a machine gun, the mechanism is different. ""If you very slowly pull the trigger, the recoil causes the gun to jump back and forth,"" Howard said. ""And that causes the trigger to be pulled."" By government standards, this retains the role of human intervention for each shot fired. Howard said the impact of trigger activators is less than meets the eye. He said they easily fail and make a gun difficult to aim. ""People don’t use them in crimes because you have to use them so carefully,"" Howard said. Still, there are enthusiastic reviews on the Cabela's website. A buyer who calls himself ""Freddie Joe"" wrote, ""This is an extremely fun addition to your A/R. The only problem will be the amount of shells you will go through. I went through 300 in a couple of days ... When you get really good at using this product, you can empty a 30-round clip in a matter of seconds. Cool!"" Our ruling CNN’s Lemon said that many people can go out and buy an automatic weapon. Lemon spoke as though the gun he had purchased was an automatic. It was not. It was a semi-automatic, meaning each shot requires a separate pull of the trigger. The ease of purchase that Lemon described applies to semi-automatic guns. The legal status and availability of semi-automatic and fully automatic guns are quite different. Lemon was further incorrect when he didn’t revise his language and insisted that the distinction was just a matter of semantics. Acquiring a machine gun is prohibited in some states, while much more heavily regulated in others. We rate Lemon’s claim False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/26/don-lemon/cnns-lemon-says-automatic-weapons-are-easy-get/

Ad says Senate candidate Thom Tillis gave tax breaks to North Carolina's yacht and jet owners
","Supporters of Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., say giving tax breaks to yacht and jet owners is one way that her opponent has shown he is out-of-touch with the state’s average families. In the North Carolina race for U.S. Senate, much of the debate has focused on Republican candidate Thom Tillis’ actions as a state leader. In 2013, the North Carolina government received national attention for a wave of conservative legislation. The Republican-dominated General Assembly -- with Tillis as speaker of the House -- passed laws increasing voter ID requirements, lowering business regulations, upping restrictions on abortion providers, tightening education spending, trimming unemployment benefits and changing the tax code. In another fact-check, we found that the controversial tax code changes reduced taxes for everyone -- but much more for wealthier people than lower-income people. Supporters of Hagan, the incumbent, keep harping on this point about the tax code in particular: Tillis supports tax breaks for yacht and jet owners. You can hear that claim here, here and here. Most recently, we heard it in an ad from Senate Majority PAC, a liberal political action committee. ""When it comes to education, Thom Tillis is gambling with our future,"" the ad’s narration says. ""As speaker, he cut nearly $500 million from education, eliminating 9,000 teaching positions and overcrowding classrooms. Now he’s promising more lottery money for education? We’ve heard that broken promise before. Meanwhile, Tillis gives tax breaks for yacht and private jet owners."" Some of the other ads said Tillis ""protected"" tax breaks for yacht and jet owners, but others -- including this one -- say he gave them the tax breaks. We decided to look into the claim a little more closely. N.C. tax code In 2013, under Tillis’ leadership, North Carolina lawmakers passed legislation to overhaul the tax code -- which hadn’t had comprehensive reform since the 1930s. The primary change was switching the income tax from a progressive rate to a flat rate. The law also eliminated tax holidays, sales tax exemptions and the State Earned Income Tax Credit, which is a refundable tax credit for low-income workers. So what did the law do for yacht and jet owners? Well, nothing, really. It preserved the tax breaks that were already in place. Since 1991, boats and aircraft -- a broader category than just yachts and jets -- have had a sales tax rate of 3 percent, with a $1,500 cap. This means that anyone who buys a boat or plane worth $50,000 or more pays exactly $1,500 in taxes. The rate had been 2 percent from 1969 to 1991, and the cap was $300 until 1989, according to a document prepared by the North Carolina General Assembly research division. While Tillis and other Republican state lawmakers did not create tax breaks for plane and boat owners, they left the prior tax breaks in place. According to the News and Observer in Raleigh, the law only cut 48 of the more than 300 tax breaks included in the tax code. Additionally, the legislature did not include the boat and airplane tax breaks in a bundle of loopholes that received additional scrutiny in a study committee. It’s also worth noting that Tillis, though he was speaker at the time and supported the bill, was not an author or primary sponsor of the tax code legislation. The cap on boat and aircraft sales taxes amounts to $10 million in lost annual revenue, according to the N.C. Budget and Tax Center, a liberal advocacy group. Our ruling A Senate Majority PAC ad said, ""Thom Tillis gives tax breaks to yacht and jet owners."" North Carolina lawmakers, under Tillis’ leadership, overhauled the state’s tax code in 2013. But they left in place a 23-year-old tax break for boats and aircraft. By using the word ""give,"" the statement suggests Tillis created the tax breaks, which he didn’t.

Cornel West: Obama reacted quicker to Robin Williams' death than Michael Brown's
","President Barack Obama is being criticized on the left and right for his response to the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer. Conservatives have accused Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder of siding with protesters before the facts of the shooting have been established. Some liberals say Obama has been too silent on the case. In an Aug. 25 interview with Salon, ultra-liberal African-American professor Cornel West blasted Obama  for posing as a progressive while actually being a ""counterfeit"" centrist. Obama’s need to find the middle ground, West argued, is apparent in his recent handling of the Ferguson protests. ""The Obama administration has been silent. Completely silent,"" West said. ""All of a sudden now, you get this uprising and what is the response? Well, as we know, you send out a statement on the death of brother Robin Williams before you sent out a statement on brother Michael Brown."" We wondered if Obama commented on Williams’ death before he addressed Brown’s. A tale of two statements It's important to note that the two deaths are hardly similar. Williams was a worldwide celebrity and news of his death quickly spread. His death did not spark protests or involve questions of police misconduct. Statements from political leaders and the White House when celebrities die are often fast and received without controversy. Brown, meanwhile, was mostly an unknown figure to the world when he was killed Aug. 9, and it took time for the story of his death to spread. The New York Times, for instance did not put a story about Brown or the city of Ferguson on its front page until Aug. 12. But as comparisons go, West has his facts correct. Obama issued a statement hours after Williams’ death was announced by police officials on Aug. 11. In his statement, Obama praised the late actor as ""one of a kind"" and offered his condolences to Williams’ loved ones and well-wishers. ""He arrived in our lives as an alien -- but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit,"" Obama wrote. ""He made us laugh. He made us cry. He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most -- from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets."" Brown was shot at noon Central Time on Aug. 9, and news broke of the police-involved shooting that afternoon. Obama, who was on vacation in Martha’s Vineyard at the time, did not release a statement until Aug. 12, three days after Brown’s death. That’s also one day after his statement about Williams. Obama said that Brown’s passing was ""heartbreaking"" and offered his and Michelle’s condolences to Brown’s family and community. ""I urge everyone in Ferguson, Mo., and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" Obama wrote. ""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve."" In his statement, Obama alluded to an earlier statement made by Holder. Holder’s statement, which did not mention Brown by name and largely discussed the role of federal investigations, was released on Aug. 11 -- two days after Brown’s death. Seen but can’t be heard An Aug. 22, a New York Times/CBS poll reported that 60 percent of African-Americans were satisfied with Obama’s response, compared to 35 percent of whites. But Obama’s words and actions around Brown have been targeted by conservatives, liberals and netizens alike. A day after Brown’s shooting, an online petition was launched, calling for Obama to issue a statement on the deaths of Brown and two other black men, and to demand congressional action. On Aug. 11, Twitter users began pointing out the disparity between his quickness to comment on Williams’ passing and his silence on Brown’s death, reported the International Business Times. Obama made additional comments about Ferguson on Aug. 14, describing Brown’s death again as ""tragic and heartbreaking."" Following the statement, conservative columnists accused him of being racist against whites. Meanwhile, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, the labor union for law enforcement officials across the nation, said to the Hill that Obama was being unhelpful by ""discussing police tactics from Martha’s Vineyard.""   When Obama discussed the subject again on Aug. 18, speaking only of the reaction and investigation, his comments were blasted as ""tone deaf and disappointing"" by an MSNBC analyst and drew derisive complaints from Twitter users who wanted to see a more emotive, assertive stance. And Obama’s recent decision to send a delegation of White House officials to Brown’s Aug. 25 funeral sparked additional ire from the right. All this has proved that Obama is too polarizing a figure to talk freely and talk effectively about matters of race, wrote Vox’s Ezra Klein. According to Fox News’ Howard Kurtz, Obama’s past comments and actions on Trayvon Martin and other racially tinged cases over the years had been equally divisive, and so Obama has learned to keep mum. Our ruling West said that Obama released ""a statement on the death of brother Robin Williams before (he) sent out a statement on brother Michael Brown."" While the two cases are hardly similar, West is right on the facts. It took Obama three days to issue a statement regarding Brown’s Aug. 9 death and about three hours to comment on Williams’ passing, which was reported on Aug. 11.

Tear gas was banned for warfare in 1993 but police still use it, viral meme says
","Law enforcement officers in Ferguson, Mo., have used tear gas extensively in the wake of the police-shooting death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed African-American. The conflict in Ferguson led one PolitiFact reader to ask us to check the accuracy of a social-media meme now circulating that addresses the legality of tear gas. The meme -- posted by the group OurTime.org, an advocacy group for young Americans -- said, ""Tear gas has been classified as a chemical weapon and banned in international conflict since 1993. Why is its use allowed by U.S. police forces?"" The post had garnered 143,000 likes, 42,000 shares, and 35,000 comments by late August. We wanted to know if it was accurate. First, some background on tear gas. It is a broad term for chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pepper spray and CS gas are among the most commonly used. The CDC says that ""prolonged exposure, especially in an enclosed area, may lead to long-term effects such as eye problems including scarring, glaucoma, and cataracts, and may possibly cause breathing problems such as asthma."" However, the agency adds that ""if symptoms go away soon after a person is removed from exposure to riot control agents, long-term health effects are unlikely to occur."" Has tear gas been 'banned in international conflict since 1993'? This is close to being accurate. The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of chemical weapons. And tear gas qualifies under the convention as a chemical weapon. Specifically, Article I (5) of the convention says, ""Each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare,"" while Article II (7) defines ""riot control agent"" as: ""Any chemical not listed in a Schedule, which can produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure."" The meme is incorrect, however, when it comes to the year the convention came into force. It was finalized in 1993 but took effect on April 29, 1997 -- 180 days after the 65th country, Hungary, ratified the treaty, as the convention set forth. The United States is covered by this provision, the Senate having ratified the convention five days before it went into force. In addition, there may be a gray area for use by the military. When President Gerald Ford signed an earlier, decades-old agreement covering chemical weapons, the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925, the United States reserved the right to use tear gas in a limited number of contexts, such as for controlling a riot at a prisoner-of-war detention area -- just not against troops engaged in battle. Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service, said he believes that this limited exception would also hold water under the Chemical Weapons Convention. How relevant is that to police? This part is more murky, because the same convention being touted by the meme’s authors specifically states that law enforcement use within a country is permitted. ""Law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes"" is ""not prohibited under this convention,"" says Article II (9) (d). This bifurcation between a permitted domestic use and a banned international use is unusual in such accords, said Brian Finlay, managing director of the Stimson Center, a think tank that focuses on global security issues. As for how it happened, there’s a backstory. According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the international group that helps enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention, riot control agents were ""the topic of long and heated debates"" during negotiations of the convention. In the end, a compromise was reached, the group says, allowing the use of tear gas for riot control but prohibiting it for warfare. Indiana University law professor David P. Fidler, who has studied the issue, said that while there’s been some controversy over what this article of the convention permits in some contexts, ""law enforcement use of tear gas has not been one of them."" When we contacted OurTime.org, co-founder Jarrett Moreno told us that ""the focus of our post was raising an ethical and moral question: If we can't use tear gas on our enemies, why is it acceptable to use on our own citizens? After Ferguson where we saw children, disabled people, and members of the press being hit with tear gas while exercising their First Amendment rights, why are they being contained with something that we don't even use on the battlefield?"" Experts acknowledged that the treatment of tear gas under the convention is somewhat paradoxical, and it stems in part from horse-trading by convention negotiators. But they added that there are other, more substantive reasons as well. • The use of any type of gas on a battlefield is problematic.  ""Part of the thinking is that soldiers in the field don't have the ability to readily distinguish in the heat of battle if a gas being used is tear gas or something more lethal,"" said Richard Price, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia who has studied the issues. The negotiators, he said, thought that, ""as a practical matter, it was best to ban them all"" on the battlefield. • There are few immediate alternatives to tear gas for riot control. There are strategies to prevent riots, including better community relations, a less militaristic appearance, and improved training, all of which have been raised in relation to Ferguson. But once rioting is under way, police need tools to control it -- and ""even though tear gas is far from perfect,"" said David A. Koplow, a Georgetown University law professor, ""it continues to be used in that role because there’s nothing else better."" Israel has deployed an organic riot-control agent dubbed ""skunk water,"" described by a BBC journalist as the ""worst, most foul thing you have ever smelled. An overpowering mix of rotting meat, old socks that haven't been washed for weeks -- topped off with the pungent waft of an open sewer."" However, it is sprayed from water cannons, which in the popular imagination are associated with their use against civil rights protesters in the 1960s, making them highly unsuitable for use in a scenario like the one in Ferguson. Projectiles such as rubber bullets can be effective, but they can cause serious injury or, if poorly aimed, death. An emerging technology called the Active Denial System -- or more colloquially, the ""pain ray"" -- creates millimeter-wave frequencies that impart a searing sensation of heat on the skin, but amid concerns, the United States military has been slow to adopt it. Meanwhile, new forms of ""incapacitating chemical agents"" that use anesthetic chemicals have been proposed, but they have drawn the concern of such groups as the International Committee of the Red Cross. The problem with new-generation chemical techniques, said Fidler of Indiana University, ""is that their physiological effects are stronger than tear gas, which creates the potential for more injuries and other health harms. Tear gas is well understood as a riot control agent, and it seems to function well enough for law enforcement purposes. • A lack of desire for change. There is little sign that the convention’s signatories have any desire to reconcile the tear gas paradox. ""There is certainly an argument to be made that the fundamental segregation of these two issues is inherently unreasonable,"" said Finlay of the Stimson Center. ""That said, this is very unlikely to change, as it is both a matter of treaty law as well as customary international law today. There is not much appetite among states to alter the status quo."" Our ruling The meme said police in the United States use tear gas even though it ""has been classified as a chemical weapon and banned in international conflict since 1993."" The Chemical Weapons Convention did outlaw the use of tear gas in warfare, though that went into effect in 1997, not 1993. However, the meme glosses over some context. It tries to leverage the Chemical Weapons Convention’s decision to ban tear gas as evidence of why the technique should be illegal for policing, yet that very same convention explicitly allows its use for domestic law enforcement purposes. The claim is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/26/facebook-posts/tear-gas-was-banned-warfare-1993-police-1997/

Herman Cain says wages flat thanks to the Federal Reserve
","Earlier this year, President Barack Obama asked Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10, following a national conversation about wages and income inequality. But according to 2012 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain, a higher minimum wage isn’t enough, since the real value of paychecks hasn’t budged in four decades. Appearing on Aug. 11’s Varney and Co. on Fox News Business, Cain criticized former Bill Clinton labor secretary Robert Reich who blamed a rise in income inequality on the financial elite. Cain told host Stuart Varney it’s the Federal Reserve that is responsible. ""This is a fact, Stuart, over the last 40 years, real wage growth has been flatlined because of the policies of the Federal Reserve,"" Cain said. ""It had nothing to do with greedy CEOs, nothing to do with what companies wanted to do. It was all driven by the Federal Reserve trying to control unemployment with the faulty control of wage growth."" We wanted to see if real wages -- which is a worker’s salary adjusted for inflation -- have indeed seen no growth for four decades and whether that could be tied to Federal Reserve policies. Cain’s research associate Rich Lowrie, his former economic adviser and one of the creators of Cain’s 9-9-9 tax plan, referred us to this video. The video takes its data from the World Top Incomes Database, a project of leading economists whose calculations are based off of income tax records. As for the theory that the Fed’s policies are responsible for real wage stagnation, that was Lowrie’s and other Cain researchers’ independent conclusion. ""We think it’s unmistakable that there is a connection,"" Lowrie said. For this fact-check, we talked to Lowrie, researchers at think thanks with various political leanings, and a number of independent economists. What we found was that this claim is about competing theories on labor economics and monetary policy. Cain's viewpoint is an outlier. Incoming fail We’ll start by assessing Cain’s claim that real wage growth has flatlined over the past 40 years. Later we’ll talk about the role of the Federal Reserve. Cain got the stat after analyzing data from a reputable source, the World Top Incomes Database. But Cain off the bat made a mistake of describing his analysis as measuring wage growth. Really, the statistics he looked at measure income growth. (Wages refers to the paychecks a worker receives within a certain time frame and constitute a part of income. Income also includes investments, rent checks, and other sources of incoming cash.) Between 1972 and 2012, real income has grown by an average of 0.52 percent from year to year. Paltry growth, but growth. Lowrie, a corporate financial adviser, said Cain was focusing on a group Lowrie called the ""striving majority,"" the bottom 90 percent of American wage earners.  Real income for that group has actually decreased annually at an average 0.16 percent, according to the World Top Incomes Database.  As you can see, income growth hasn’t literally flatlined -- it’s bounced up and down a bit. Real income growth was the most stagnant in the 1970s, but saw some gains in the 1990s before falling in the 2000s. Cain ""just ignores the ups and downs,"" said Mark Bils, a professor of macroeconomics at the University of Rochester. ""Forty years is a long span."" And average incomes, even adjusted for inflation, don’t capture the differences in working conditions between 1972 and today, according to Bils. Working hours are different and purchasing power has risen. All quiet on the wage front What happens when we focus on wages? Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the liberal think tank Economic Policy Institute, looked at real wage growth from 1979 to 2013, using data from the Bureau of Labor Economics. The results show that Americans who earn less have seen very little wage growth while top earners have made gains. For the 70th percentile workers (those who make more than 70 percent of all workers), hourly wages saw virtually no growth between 1979 and 1995. The years 1995 to 2000 were an exception, with an annualized growth rate of 1.4 percent.  So in sum, if you factor in inflation, the average American has been bringing home the same amount of bacon for the past four decades, while the economic elite earn more from year to year. That doesn’t necessarily tell the entire story, economists told us, noting that wages do not factor in things like health benefits, tuition assistance, vacation time and sick leave. But by Cain’s yardstick, he is largely correct. Federal reservations Cain, however, did not simply say wage growth has flatlined. He blamed the Federal Reserve. That view is an outlier. According to Bivens, the claim is ""not very grounded."" John Makin, a former economist at Federal Reserve banks in Chicago and Atlanta currently at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, and University of California, Berkeley labor economist Michael Reich said they have not seen any research that ties Federal Reserve policies to real wages flatlining. Both Makin and Reich (a colleague of Robert Reich’s, but no relation) pointed out that neither Cain nor Lowrie are economists. At best, the Federal Reserve has ""a marginal effect on the long term trend of real wage growth,"" said Kenneth Rogoff, author of This Time is Different and a professor economics and public policy at Harvard University. Though economists don’t give much credence to the general claim, they helped us dissect Cain’s theories, which boil down to how the Fed affixes the value of the dollar, how the Fed sets interest rates, and how the Fed defines and measures inflation. Fed policies, according to the Fed Fed policies, according to Cain and Lowrie Real wages Cannot directly affect real wages, which is determined by largely nonmonetary factors. Treat real wages as inflation, thus intentionally kept stable. Inflation Aim for inflation rate of 2% to stabilize prices and maximize employment Keep inflation down and thus real wages as well. Price index Use the personal price expenditures index largely, as well as many other indices, to measure inflation. Use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to measure inflation, but in reality substitute real wages for the CPI. Value of the dollar  Do not target the exchange value, but take into account the effect of the dollar on the U.S. economy. Used to measure inflation, keeping the value stable. Now float the dollar, letting the value fluctuate. Sources: Federal Reserve FAQ and interviews with Lowrie The dollar Lowrie pinpoints 1971 as the year when real income began to flatline, which is also the year when the United States stopped tying its currency to gold. The theory goes that when the dollar was backed by gold, real wages were growing increasingly; and when the gold exchange standard was nixed, the dollar began to float -- subject to fluctuation on the foreign currency and exchange markets -- and wages flatlined. With a stable currency, material costs for businesses flatlined and thus rose wages, Lowrie said. This is the debased currency argument -- a floating dollar has less purchasing power, leading to inflation and thus depreciating real wages -- and one virtually all economists are skeptical of. At best, the theory is ""hand-wavy,"" according to Bivens. ""You would really need to see an increase in inflation for this to make sense, and that’s not the story of the past decades for sure,"" he said. What’s more, the value of the dollar is largely under the U.S. Treasury’s purview, not the Fed’s. Interest rates According to Lowrie, the Fed will lower interest rates when the economy is expanding, making it easier for businesses to borrow money and boosting wealth. When the economy begins to contract, the Fed raises interest rates to curb inflation but instead leading to less investment in business and thus a decrease in wages. Lowrie's description of interest rate policies sits well with economists. Bivens said that the Fed is certainly ""quick on the trigger"" when it comes to enacting policies that heat up and cool down the economy, potentially affecting wages immediately. But the idea that policies have a direct or even significant impact on real wages is a tall order, experts said. ""Productivity has grown steadily over the postwar period, but only since 1980 have real wages failed to grow with productivity growth. Interest rate policy has not changed during that period,"" Reich said. While it’s true that higher interest rates generally increase unemployment and slow nominal wage growth (not adjusted for inflation) in the time immediately following the hikes, they don’t do much for real wages, according to Reich. ""Over 40 years, it’s not going to matter,"" said Bils. ""Maybe they create some asset run-rups in the short term, but it doesn’t follow that wages would decrease."" Inflation Lowrie’s third point suggests that the Fed treats real wages as inflation and attempts to keep growth down to keep inflation down. Lowrie said the Fed uses lagging data, namely the CPI, to measure inflation but because the data doesn’t reflect the market in real time, the Fed defaults to using real wages as a proxy. Since part of the objective of the Fed is to stabilize prices, they stabilize real wages instead. Economists take issue with the characterization of how inflation is measured. The Fed focuses on general rises in prices, not wages, to evaluate inflation, but to predict inflation, other factors like GDP growth and unemployment are also taken into account.   Bivens compared it to baseball projections. ""Looking at strikeouts and walks is a better predictor of wins than past wins,"" he said. And according to Makin, the very definition of inflation means that real wages can’t be its proxy, because doing so would discount the other part of the equation -- wages. ""Real wages are nominal wages adjusted for inflation,"" he said. ""If the Fed caused the price level to rise more rapidly, then prices would rise faster than money, and real wages would go (down) fast. If prices rise slowly, then real wages would go up."" In other words, in order for real wages to grow, nominal wage growth would have to rise faster than inflation. Since inflation has been below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent, it’s the lack of nominal wage growth that’s keeping real wages down. In real-wage-ality If it’s not the Fed, what’s actually been holding real wages down? Economists attribute it to many factors. An economist at the Fed itself wrote that labor market conditions are to blame. Bils listed changes in technology, risk taking and investing, and human capital. There’s also increased international trade, fluctuating demand for different skill levels and income tax policy, said Stephen Moore, a former senior economist at the congressional Joint Economic Committee who now works at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Makin and Biven pointed to a rise in labor productivity combined with a weak demand for labor. And Reich said all of the above: increased competition from low-wage countries, technological change that has reduced the need for jobs in the mid-level pay scales, while encouraging growth in low-paid occupations, the decline of unions and the decline of real minimum wages. ""While professional economists' opinions on the relative importance of each of these varies, I have never seen a statement that Fed policies regarding inflation are at all a factor,"" Reich said. Our ruling Cain said, ""Over the last 40 years, real wage growth has been flatlined because of the policies of the Federal Reserve."" Cain’s research associate was looking at real income growth, but the findings are consistent if you measure income or wages. In short, wage growth has remain relatively flat. But Cain goes too far in blaming policies of the Federal Reserve, both conservative and liberal economists told us us. Various nonmonetary policy factors are much more likely to cause a lack of wage growth. Cain’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/26/herman-cain/herman-cain-says-wages-flat-thanks-federal-reserve/
"['Small Business', 'Women', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Greg Abbott celebrates growth in women-owned businesses in Texas, overlooks meaningful details
","In an email blast, Greg Abbott’s campaign said Texas businesses owned by women flourished with Barack Obama in the White House. Abbott, the attorney general and Republican gubernatorial nominee, wasn’t saluting the Democratic president. In the July 10, 2014, email message, Kim Snyder, Abbott’s deputy campaign manager, called Texas the ""land of opportunity – especially for women."" Texas does better than other states, Snyder wrote, adding: ""Let’s compare: the growth rate of women-owned businesses in Texas has nearly doubled that of the nation since President Obama has taken office."" A reader, bringing the email to our attention, wondered about the described growth rates. To our inquiry, Abbott spokesman Avdiel Huerta said by email Abbott’s near-doubling reference was based on reports by American Express OPEN, which American Express describes as the leading payment-card issuer for small U.S. businesses. According to the 2013 State of Women-Owned Businesses report, Huerta said, there were 8,617,200 woman-owned U.S. firms, including 737,300 in Texas, in 2013. In 2007, AMEX said there were 7,793,139 woman-owned firms nationally and 610,007 in Texas, Huerta said. ""Based on these numbers during the 2007-2013 period, which is approximately the time President Obama has been in office,"" Huerta wrote, ""the number of woman-owned firms grew by ~10.57% nationally, and by ~20.87% in Texas – nearly double the rate of growth."" A hitch in this giddyap: Obama’s first term as president began in 2009. Still, we spotted the cited estimates in the report, which said its tallies were based on an outside firm's extrapolations starting from U.S. Census Bureau business surveys taken every five years; the government’s latest available figures trace to the 2007 surveys. The report said: ""Data from the past three census surveys – 1997, 2002, and 2007 – were collated, analyzed and extrapolated forward to 2013, factoring in relative changes in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) not only nationally but also at industry and state levels,"" with the GDP data coming from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Upshot: Nationally from 1997 to 2013, the report said, the number of women-owned firms increased by 59 percent – and women-owned firms in Texas increased by 93 percent, the second-highest growth among the states behind the 112 percent surge experienced in Georgia. ""The states with the greatest number of women-owned firms are, naturally, the most populous states,"" the report said. ""California is home to the greatest number of women-owned firms in the country, and is the only state in which there are 1 million or more women-owned firms... California is followed by Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. Rounding out the top ten are Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio and Michigan,"" the report said. Nationally, women-owned firms account for 29 percent of all enterprises, the report said, but women-owned firms also only employ 6 percent of the country’s workforce and contribute just under 4 percent of business revenues—roughly the same share they contributed in 1997. To our inquiry, the Michigan-based researcher behind the report, Julie Weeks, said by phone the growth in women-owned businesses in Texas has outpaced growth nationally, but it’s meaningful to look at how states compare in the number of employees in women-owned firms and annual revenues, a metric that Weeks folds in with growth rates as ""combined economic clout."" By her clout measure, averaging together rankings of growth in the number, revenue and employment of women-owned firms, Texas ranked 11th among the states and the District of Columbia for 1997 through 2013, according to the 2013 report. Weeks told us an updated report, drafted at the time Abbott’s camp sent out its email blast, shows Texas ranked ninth in 2014 by the clout measure. A March 26, 2014, press release announcing the 2014 edition said Texas enjoyed a 98 percent spurt in women-owned businesses from 1997 into 2014, a growth rate second only to Georgia’s 118 percent. Among the nation’s 25 most-populous metropolitan areas, San Antonio had the No. 1 combined economic clout score from 2002 into 2014, the release said. A spokeswoman for AMEX Open emailed us a chart showing trends in the growth of women-owned firms nationally and in Texas from 1997 into 2014. From 2007 to 2014, the figures indicate a national growth of 17 percent in women-owned firms; Texas saw a 24 percent increase. However, AMEX spokeswoman Elisha Stavropoulos said state-by-state figures weren’t published at the time Abbott’s email blast went out; see the report, posted online in August 2014, here.  Source: AMEX Open, August 2014 Another perspective For another assessment, we reached California-based economist Alicia Robb at the recommendation of the advisory National Women’s Business Council, a federal body. In April 2014, Robb co-authored a paper for the council cautioning that less than 30 percent of U.S. businesses are owned by women and only 12 percent of the firms employ anyone other than the owner herself. Only 2 percent of such firms have 10 or more employees, the paper said. By email, Robb told us Weeks’ methodology was adequate for estimating the growth rate in women-owned businesses, but she said that indicator alone isn’t very meaningful since any growth would look impressive considering how few businesses were previously women-owned. It’s ""a bit misleading in that the NUMBER of businesses is increasing at a faster rate, but that is more a reflection of the lower base,"" Robb said. ""If you look at growth in sales, employment, and payroll, women-owned businesses are actually growing more slowly"" nationally ""based on the most recent"" data from the U.S. Census Bureau. A chart in the 2014 paper indicates women-owned firms generated 4 percent of all U.S. business receipts in 2012, amounting to no change from five years before. Nationally, according to the paper, the number of women-owned businesses escalated by 65 percent from 1997 into 2012, outpacing the 44 percent increase in all businesses. Then again, the 66 percent growth in receipts for women-owned-firms trailed an estimated 91 percent growth in total U.S. business receipts, the paper said. Our ruling Abbott said the ""growth rate of women-owned businesses in Texas has nearly doubled that of the nation since President Obama has taken office."" A reasonable estimate shows the described growth rate in Texas was nearly double the national rate from 2007 into 2013. Then again, Abbott’s trumpeting of Texas under Republicans versus the country under Obama also pokes at the last two years of George W. Bush’s presidency, which the Abbott email didn’t acknowledge. Also, the implied message that women-owned businesses are booming ignores that most women-owned firms remain extremely small and don’t generate huge revenues. We rate this statement Half True.

John Carlevale: 60% of provisional ballots in 2012 R.I. election were cast by unregistered voters
","The issue of voter identification continues to percolate through the political campaign season. It surfaced again when John Carlevale, a Republican running for secretary of state, was interviewed on the Aug. 10 edition of WPRI's ""Newsmakers"" program. Carlevale said he supports the state's current -- and controversial -- voter ID law, which requires voters to present photo identification. He contended that evidence for why it is needed surfaced during the 2012 election, the first in which the law was partially in effect. ""Those folks who were not able to show valid ID were given a provisional ballot,"" he said. ""And what did we learn from that? Over 60 percent of the provisional ballots cast in that election were disqualified because those folks were not duly registered as voters."" (Voters may also be issued provisional ballots if they show up at the wrong polling place or didn’t register 30 days before the election. Such ballots are later counted if the voter’s registration is confirmed.) We wondered whether 60 percent of the folks who got a provisional ballot weren't actually registered to vote. We emailed Carlevale to ask for supporting evidence. Meanwhile, we called the state Board of Elections, where executive director Robert Kando reported that 2,357 provisional ballots were issued in 2012;  1,189 of those were ultimately disqualified because the person had not registered. That's 50.4 percent, not 60 percent as Carlevale reported. When we heard back from Carlevale, he reported getting slightly different numbers from the Board of Elections: 2,231 provisional ballots with 1,188 (53.2 percent) not counted because they were disqualified. Kando said Carlevale was given incorrect numbers. Whether it's 50.4 percent or 53.2 percent, that's well below the ""over 60 percent"" Carlevale claimed. He said in an email that he had misread his notes, apologizing for the error. It turns out that the number can vary. In the 2010 non-presidential election, where the turnout was much lower, there were 918 provisional ballots statewide and only 197 of those -- 21.5 percent -- were disqualified because the person was not registered. That was before the Voter ID law had been implemented. We also checked Providence's numbers. Kathy Placencia, administrator of elections for the Board of Canvassers, said the city gave out 449 provisional ballots for the 2012 general election and 98 were rejected because the person had not registered by the deadline. That's 21.8 percent. In 2010 it was 38.3 percent. Our ruling Secretary of State candidate John Carlevale said, ""Over 60 percent of the provisional ballots cast in [the 2012] election were disqualified because those folks were not duly registered as voters."" Data from the Rhode Island Board of Elections shows that the actual total was 50.4 percent. He's off the mark, but close enough to earn a Half True.

"['Georgia', 'Michelle Nunn']","
Nunn's ad claim misses the mark
","President George H. W. Bush spoke at his inauguration in 1989 of ""individuals and community organizations spread like stars through the nation doing good."" Out of that vision came the nonprofit Points of Light. And out of Points of Light came Michelle Nunn, a Georgia native with a do-gooder resume, political pedigree and desire to be the state’s next U.S. senator. In a new television ad, Nunn, a Democrat, criticizes the business tactics of millionaire David Perdue, her Republican opponent in the race to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. The TV ad begins by introducing Nunn as ""CEO of the world’s largest volunteer organization."" That line gave pause to a PolitiFact reader, who contacted us to say he was pretty confident that the international Red Cross, not Points of Light, holds that distinction. We truthfully had no idea but promised to investigate. First, a little on the very different work undertaken by the two nonprofits. The Red Cross, the world’s largest humanitarian organization, is best known for promoting blood donations and for being on the scene when disaster strikes with food, clothing and temporary housing assistance. Points of Light, President Bush’s brainchild, mobilizes volunteers through a network of 250 volunteer action centers worldwide, through its programs for youth and national service alumni and through its partnerships with thousands of companies and nonprofits. Nunn, daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, has been its CEO since 2007, when it merged with the Hands on Network, a nonprofit she helped create and ran. She’s on leave from Points of Light while campaigning. On its website, Points of Light says it had 4 million volunteers worldwide in 2012. By contrast, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, shows a volunteer force worldwide of about 17 million, including 501,208 in North America. (We got that data by adding up country-by-country data we found on its website.) Benoit Matsha-Carpentier, a spokesman for the organization in Geneva, Switzerland, confirmed the accuracy of our math. He provided a Red Cross powerpoint presentation, showing the organization had 17.1 million volunteers around the globe in 2012. So how can Points of Light claim to the ""world’s largest volunteer organization?"" Points of Light routinely provides a much more nuanced description of its work, although the campaign pointed us to at least two instances -- one in 2007 and one in 2012 -- where the nonprofit did refer to itself as the ""world’s largest volunteer organization."" Currently, on its web site and elsewhere, Points of Light is identified as ""the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service."" It’s a title the group is confident it can claim. ""We are unaware of any other organization solely dedicated to volunteer service that is using such a wide range of assets to increase the number of volunteers in the world and the impact of the work they do,"" Stefanie Weiss, Points of Light spokeswoman, said in an email. ""We say that 'Points of Light is the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service.' We work with millions of people and tens of thousands of partner organizations to increase the number of volunteers in the world and the impact of the work they do."" Tom Pollak, senior research associate at the Urban Institute’s Center for Nonprofits and Charitable Organizations, said the ad’s description of Points of Light ""doesn’t strike me as patently disingenuous or deceptive."" But he said Points of Light’s description of itself as the ""the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service"" seems more accurate and ""a little less subject"" to being misconstrued. Data on volunteerism should be viewed with some skepticism, Pollak said. That’s because some people can be involved in long-term volunteering. Others may be involved in a single event, such as a weekend helping to build a home for a needy family, and the organization may not be keeping careful track of the number of participants, he said. Relying on data reported by non-profits on their federal tax forms, Pollak was able to provide us with a list of the 25 nonprofits reporting the highest number of volunteers, nationwide. No. 1 was the American Heart Association with 22 million volunteers, followed by the Muscular Dystrophy Association Inc. with 15 million. Pollak said he wasn’t aware of information available to do a similar comparison on a worldwide scale. And the Red Cross’s 17.1 million volunteers doesn’t appear to be a record just based on the numbers U.S. organizations use. So where does that leave us?

Republican ad says Scott Rothstein bought Charlie Crist's judicial appointments
","Florida’s famous Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein now lives in a federal prison, but Republicans hope that he can help smear the reputation of former Gov. Charlie Crist. Back when Crist was a Republican, Rothstein and his Fort Lauderdale law firm donated generously to Crist and the Republican Party of Florida, as well as several other politicians. In 2010, Rothstein was convicted in a $1.4 billion Ponzi scheme and sentenced to 50 years in prison. Rothstein’s testimony in a related case provided fodder now being used by Republicans to attack Crist in a TV ad. ""Convicted swindler Scott Rothstein bought expensive things with stolen money. He even bought a governor,"" says the narrator. ""Rothstein boasted about contributing huge sums of money to the campaign of then Gov. Charlie Crist and the influence it gave him over judicial appointments. Now cooperating with prosecutors, Scott Rothstein admits he gave hundreds of thousands of campaign cash to control Crist’s appointments of key state judges."" Florida newspapers have extensively covered Rothstein’s case over the years. We wanted to know if the facts matched up with the ad’s brief description. To do that, we reviewed everything we could find on the case and conducted new interviews of people who had dealings with Rothstein on judicial appointments. What we found doesn’t reflect well on Crist, who took Rothstein’s money and placed him on a key commission that recommended judges. But we also failed to find hard evidence that Rothstein actually controlled Crist’s judicial appointments as the ad claims. Those who served on a judicial nominating commission with him painted a portrait of someone who was all style but not much substance. Rothstein craved access to politicians More than 20 people were convicted as part of the scheme Rothstein ran, and it had all the markings of a great novel: investors losing millions of dollars, tales of mafia connections and prostitutes, as well as glitzy parties. Rothstein first founded his law firm with Stuart Rosenfeldt in 2002, which became Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler in 2005. He drove luxury cars, lived in a waterfront home with a gold toilet and had a stake in the former Versace mansion in South Beach. He befriended politicians and held fundraisers for them, posing for photos which he framed on his law firm walls. He wanted connections to power at all levels: He invested in the county sheriff’s race, held fundraisers for Sen. John McCain’s presidential bid and supported Crist’s campaigns for governor in 2006 and U.S. Senate in 2010. It all came crashing down in early November 2009, when federal authorities revealed they were investigating his scheme of selling bogus legal settlements. Rothstein briefly fled to Morocco before he returned to face charges and the demise of his 70-lawyer firm.   The Republicans’ ad focuses on Rothstein’s connection with Crist and the governor’s judicial appointments. The ad relies on Rothstein’s February 2014 testimony in a related case that led to the conviction of a law firm employee for her role in bilking investors. In August 2008, Crist appointed Rothstein to the Judicial Nominating Commission for the Fourth District Court of Appeal in West Palm Beach. The JNC is a nine-member panel that recommends applicants for the governor to appoint. Rothstein testified that he told Crist the names of lawyers to appoint to the Broward County bench. Here is part of Rothstein’s testimony: Question: ""You were able to convince the Governor to appoint you to the Judicial Nominating Committee?"" Rothstein: ""Yes, sir. I was able to convince the governor to do a lot of things."" Question:  ""Well, what other things were you able to convince him to do?"" Rothstein: ""I was able to convince him to appoint people to judicial positions."" Question: ""So there are sitting judges right now that are sitting as judges because of your influence over the governor?"" Rothstein: ""Yes, sir."" Rothstein testified that while he was on the JNC, he gave additional input to Crist about judicial appointments. Rothstein: ""Based upon conversations that I had with Gov. Crist and with his chief of staff and general counsel, my job in my position on the nominating commission was to be the governor's voice on the commission. In other words, he had his preferences as to who he wanted to see get the appointments. And I would, in my role on the commission, push these particular candidates as hard as I possibly could on the governor's behalf."" Question: ""So in essence, are you telling us that you were basically thwarting the efforts of the commission?"" Rothstein: ""In certain ways. Yes, absolutely. I had significant influence with the governor on judicial appointments to the circuit bench in Broward County. It was quid pro quo between the governor and I."" When asked how he chose candidates to recommend to Crist, Rothstein replied: ""Someone who is going to favor our law firm."" During his testimony Rothstein said that he expected Crist to ""do certain things in exchange for large political contributions."" When asked if he put that in writing, he replied: ""Some of them I did. I wrote them to one of his assistants."" But during his testimony Rothstein didn’t name any particular judges that he supposedly told Crist to appoint. What others on the JNC said Rothstein said he pushed as hard as possible on the JNC to get the nominees he wanted. To see if that was the case, we turned to meeting minutes and attempted to contact every member of the JNC who served with Rothstein. Members vote by secret ballot and then forward a handful of names to the governor, who makes the final pick. The current chair of the JNC, lawyer Debra Jenks, emailed us copies of the minutes which showed Rothstein attended at least two meetings and missed at least two other meetings. (The JNC, however, doesn’t record minutes for every meeting, including when they vote on nominees.) The brief minutes aren’t verbatim records, though. They indicate who was present, procedures and information about upcoming meetings. JNC members were assigned based on a rotating blind assignment list to investigate judicial applicants. At his first meeting in October 2008, Rothstein was assigned to investigate two: one was Spencer Levine, who would later get appointed by Crist, and Palm Beach Judge Elizabeth Maass. Crist appointed four judges to the Fourth District’s Court of Appeal during Rothstein’s tenure. Three were previously county or circuit judges: Cory Ciklin, Jorge Labarga and Jonathan Gerber. (Labarga served a single day, and then Crist appointed him to the Florida Supreme Court. This year he became the first Cuban-American chief justice.) The remaining appointment was Levine, who had worked a variety of government jobs including at the Florida attorney general’s office, a sheriff’s office and most recently as chief operating officer at the North Broward Hospital District. Levine had connections to Rothstein, according to a newspaper article. But what we read isn’t proof that Rothstein was the reason Crist appointed Levine. The Broward New Times reported that Rothstein’s law firm met with Levine about representing the hospital district in September 2008. The article indicated that the district had an agreement with Rothstein’s firm, but a spokeswoman for the district said that there is no record of the firm doing actual work for the district. Levine said he knew Rothstein and had attended Republican fundraisers with him. But he also said they were basically acquaintances. ""He claimed to never socialize with Rothstein alone. He said he was ‘insulted’ by the idea that he helped Rothstein's firm get work at the district as a way to curry favor for his judicial appointment,"" the New Times wrote. PolitiFact Florida interviewed six members who served on the JNC with Rothstein, including Democrats and Republicans, many of whom had donated to Crist. The members said they didn’t see Rothstein do anything to taint the process or even particularly push hard for specific nominees. David Ackerman said that the JNC followed the procedures carefully ""to assure checks and balances and to prevent any suggestion of the kind that has been claimed by Mr. Rothstein."" Another member, Gordon James, said, ""I didn’t find him to have any special influence other than he was on it. He was just incidental. He was there -- he attended."" Some members said they wondered at the time why Rothstein was named to the JNC. Rothstein wasn’t known for courthouse victories but simply for his recent wealth. A couple members recalled Rothstein mentioning Crist, though not in the context of selecting judges. Gerald Richman said he recalled at one meeting Rothstein said he might be able to talk to Crist’s office. Richman couldn’t recall the exact nature of the procedural issue but said it might have related to how many names they should forward to Crist’s office when they had more than one vacancy to fill. Rothstein ""never said anything about any particular candidate -- he didn’t seem to be overly Democratic or Republican,"" Richman said. Greg Barnhart recalled Rothstein showing up with a driver in a fancy car and wearing breast pocket hankies that stood out 4 or 5 inches. ""He was almost a caricature of somebody trying to be a big shot. I do remember we did not take him seriously, but we tried to be polite,"" Barnhart said. Donald Beuttenmuller said he recalled Rothstein talking about Crist with respect to fundraisers, but not about judicial appointments. ""You would think they were bosom buddies, but he talked that way about everything.....That Rothstein had a big ego -- that was clear. That’s about all I can say. There was nothing that he talked about that he wasn’t superior at in his own mind. But all this later stuff, it did not happen at the JNC."" Rothstein’s donations to Crist and state GOP In addition to the four judges that Crist appointed related to Rothstein’s JNC, Crist also appointed about nine Broward judges between 2007 and Rothstein’s downfall in November 2009. The timing of some of the Broward appointments occurred around the same time as some of Rothstein’s donations to the Republican Party of Florida. We can see why the timing after the scandal broke raised questions about whether there was a link, but we found no evidence to prove that Rothstein made the donations because Crist promised to appoint certain judges at his request. For example, Rothstein's law firm gave $52,000 to the state GOP on July 28, 2008, the same day that Crist appointed Jay Hurley to the Broward bench. A day later Rothstein's firm donated another $25,000 to the party. But Hurley, a former prosecutor, already had a connection to Crist unrelated to Rothstein: They were members of the same fraternity at Florida State University, though Hurley told the Sun-Sentinel that they weren’t there at the same time. ""The governor didn't invite me to his wedding. I don't know him that well. ... I stand on my resume,"" Hurley said. (Hurley lost a judicial race and later sought an appointment about six times before Crist appointed him, the Sun-Sentinel wrote.) Hurley told the Tampa Bay Times in 2006 about giving Crist a $500 contribution: ""You kind of feel obligated, but in a good way. He's a member of the fraternity. There's a lot of camaraderie there."" When he ran for election in 2009, Hurley got a $500 donation from a lawyer at Rothstein’s firm. Hurley was one of several judges Crist appointed to the Broward bench. In January 2009, Crist appointed Carlos Rodriguez, who had worked as a public defender and in private practice, and General Magistrate Barbara McCarthy to the Broward bench. Two days earlier Rothstein and his firm gave about $100,000 to the RPOF. At the time, the lack of the diversity of Broward’s judges received frequent media attention and Crist was urged to appoint a minority. Rodriguez was a native of Cuba and a former public defender. McCarthy was a former social worker and special-needs teacher and had worked as a general magistrate. McCarthy had connections to Rothstein’s law firm but we didn’t find proof that Rothstein’s influence led Crist to appoint her to the bench. She was married to long-time Broward Judge Arthur Birken -- his son Shawn Birken worked for Rothstein’s firm but was among employees not charged with any wrongdoing. In 2009 as she faced an election, McCarthy’s first campaign treasurer was Rothstein law partner Stuart Rosenfeldt. After the scandal broke, she replaced Rosenfeldt and returned donations from him and a few other Rothstein lawyers. Rosenfeldt later pled guilty for his role, which included illegal campaign donations. Rothstein gave big bucks to Crist and his Republican Party News reports at the time put Rothstein-related political donations between $2 million and $3 million including more than $500,000 in donations to the state Republican party and $200,000 to the Florida Democratic Party. The donations helped fuel Crist’s campaigns and his party, but we found no documented proof that Crist agreed to follow Rothstein’s personal advice on which judges to appoint in exchange for those donations. Rothstein and others associated with his firm gave Crist about $81,000 for his U.S. Senate race in 2010, according to media reports at the time. Rothstein threw fundraisers for Crist, and for the governor’s 52nd birthday in 2008, he donated $52,000 to have his name prominently displayed on Crist’s birthday cake. As Crist gave a speech, Rothstein was talking loudly. ""Scott, if you want the mic, it's going to cost you another $100,000!"" Crist joked. After Rothstein faced charges, several politicians and political groups gave at least a portion of the money back, including Crist from his Senate bid. (Donations related to some earlier races had long since been spent.) Crist’s response We asked a Crist campaign spokesman whether Rothstein and Crist discussed judicial appointments. ""Charlie Crist made his own decisions about appointing judges,"" Crist campaign spokesman Brendan Gilfillan said. ""When the JNCs submitted a list, he selected judges based on their resume, their experience, and their understanding of the law. Period."" When Crist was asked by a reporter about the ad attacking him for his Rothstein connection, Crist didn’t address the specific allegations but simply dismissed it as ""desperate."" Crist counterpunched in his own ad attacking his likely opponent Republican Gov. Rick Scott. ""Now,"" the Crist ad says of Scott, ""he's teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist with false attacks."" There is no evidence Scott and Rothstein have ""teamed up"" -- that’s simply a reference to the Republicans using the Rothstein scandal to attack Crist. In February, former state Sen. Dan Gelber who is supporting Crist’s campaign characterized Rothstein as the ""Hannibal Lecter of liars."" ""He's the most-accomplished liar in South Florida history, which is an incredible feat if you consider all of the scamsters around here,"" said Gelber, an attorney who successfully defended a client from what he said were false Rothstein claims in another case. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida ad said that Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein ""gave hundreds of thousands of campaign cash to control Crist’s appointments of key state judges."" Rothstein and his firm spent huge sums donating to the Republican Party of Florida back when Crist was a Republican, and they also gave directly to Crist’s campaigns. Crist appointed Rothstein to serve on a commission that recommended appeals judges, but in his official capacity he was only one of nine votes. Rothstein boasted in court testimony that in exchange for donations he was able to dictate judicial appointments. But nobody who served with Rothstein remembered him as a strong advocate. It is certainly possible that Rothstein and Crist discussed judicial appointments. We may never have a full accounting of what the two men said to each other. But to say that Rothstein controlled the appointments seems to be an overstatement that lacks evidence. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/25/republican-party-florida/republicans-ad-says-scott-rothstein-bought-charlie/

Beyer says U.S. is only developed nation not mandating paid family leave
","Former Lt. Gov. Don Beyer has his eyes set on the 8th District congressional seat in Northern Virginia, calling for stronger guns laws, protecting the environment and expanded family leave when a baby arrives. ""The United States is the only industrialized country that does not guarantee paid time off to care for a new child..."" Beyer, a Democrat, says on his campaign website. We wondered if he’s right. The Family and Medical Leave Act entitles some workers to 12 weeks of unpaid leave time when they have babies. The law has many exceptions; it does not apply, for example, to businesses with fewer than 50 employees or to workers who have been at a company for less than a year. Three states -- California, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- provide paid family leave through payroll taxes. And some companies go beyond federal requirements and provide paid leave. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates 12 percent of private industry workers have access to paid leave. But the bottom line, as Beyer says, is that the U.S. does not require parents be compensated when they take time off to care for newborns. How does that compare to the rest of the world? Beyer’s office pointed us to a report released this year by the International Labour Organization, a United Nations agency. It examined maternity and paternity leave in 185 countries and territories and found that 99 percent of them  require compensated maternity leave -- paid by the countries through a social insurance program, by employers, or a combination of these sources. Mothers in only two countries, the United States and Papau New Guinea, aren’t guaranteed paid maternity leave, according to the report. Beyer’s office also sent us a link to a PolitiFact National story that President Barack Obama’s claim in June that the U.S. is the only developed country that doesn’t provide paid maternity leave. Our colleagues rated Obama’s claim Mostly True, saying that U.S. leave policies for mothers is among the most meager in the world. But they noted that paid maternity leave isn’t a universal right around the world because many countries don’t offer the benefits to all working mothers of newborns. For example, temporary workers don’t receive cash benefits in Canada, home workers don’t get maternity leave in Norway and Switzerland, and some civil servants don’t get leave in Japan. Canada also excludes migrant workers and moms that own more than 40 percent of their business and it requires women to have at least 600 hours of insurable employment to be eligible. There’s a wrinkle that makes Beyer’s statement a slightly different from Obama’s comment on maternity leave. Beyer uses the phrase ""family leave,"" which can be interpreted as including paid time off for fathers. In the U.S. dads, just like moms, have a right to time off, but it’s not paid. The ILO worldwide data on fathers is not as extensive as on mothers, but suggests most developed nations offer paternity leave benefits. Amy Raub, a principal research assistant at the World Policy Analysis Center at UCLA told us a handful of other developed countries, in addition to the U.S., don’t provide paid time off for fathers. Our ruling Beyer says the U.S. is the only industrialized country that doesn’t guarantee parents paid time off to care for their newborns. To a very large extent, he’s right. The U.S. is the only developed country that doesn’t mandate paid leave for working mothers, according to United Nations’ statistics. But there are two footnotes to Beyer’s statement: 1) Many nations that mandate paid maternity leave don’t offer the benefit to all moms and; 2) There are a handful of developed nations in addition to the U.S. that don’t offer paid paternity leave. So we rate Beyer’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/25/don-beyer/beye/

Alison Lundergan Grimes ad says Mitch McConnell made millions in public office
","Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, thinks her opponent has been in office way too long. Grimes released a new ad last week that blasted McConnell for his 30-year tenure in Washington. McConnell -- the expected Senate majority leader if he defeats Grimes and the GOP wins enough seats in November -- is running for his sixth term. The ad says that one of the side effects of staying in office too long is that a senator can become a multi-millionaire and lose sight of the needs of average constituents. ""What can happen in 30 years?"" the ad’s narration says. ""A senator can become a multi-millionaire in public office, while voting 17 times against the minimum wage, three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas, and 12 times against extending unemployment benefits for laid off workers."" That’s a lot to chew on, but we’ll limit our assessment here to the question of whether senators can really make millions in office. Our friends over at the Washington Post Fact Checker looked into a similar claim by Grimes in May and found that it fell flat. Because the charge is being aired anew, we decided to take a look. Senate salaries It’s true that McConnell was not a millionaire when he became a senator in 1985 but has become a multimillionaire since then. As of 2012, his estimated worth was $22.8 million, making him the 10th-richest senator, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which collects data on money in politics. That’s almost twice as much net worth than the typical senator in 2012; the average was $12.1 million. The problem with the ad is its strong suggestion that McConnell made his millions from being a senator. That’s not the case. When we asked the Grimes campaign for evidence, they pointed to Senate salaries going back to 1985. Senators’ salaries have grown from $75,100 in 1985 to $174,000 in 2009, and they haven’t changed since. McConnell has been the Senate minority leader since 2007, meaning his salary is higher -- about $193,400, according to the Congressional Research Service. (For comparison, Grimes’ current annual salary as Kentucky’s secretary of state is $117,329, according to the Kentucky state government’s salary database.) So adding up annual salaries between 1985 and 2014 and adjusting for McConnell’s leadership positions, McConnell would have earned more than $4 million before taxes and deductions.  But as of 2012, McConnell is worth nearly $23 million. If his wealth didn’t come from his office, how did McConnell get so rich? McConnell’s wealth The truth is, much of McConnell’s money comes from his second wife, Elaine Chao, whom he married in 1993. (McConnell was married to his first wife, feminist scholar Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 until 1980.) Congressional financial disclosure forms cover both spouses if the lawmaker is married. Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush, is the daughter of James S. C. Chao, the founder of a major international trade company. After immigrating to the United States from China in the 1960s, Mr. Chao founded Foremost Maritime Corporation -- now the Foremost Group, of which he is the chairman. We couldn’t figure out exactly how much James Chao is worth. But the Chao Family Foundations recently donated $40 million to build a new executive education center at Harvard Business School. So how did McConnell’s finances change when he married Elaine Chao? The good news is that elected officials are required to fill out public financial disclosure forms annually. The bad news is that the Senate Public Disclosure Office at the Capitol tosses out any forms that are more than six years old. However, we were able to access McConnell’s disclosure forms back to 1995 through the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. And McConnell’s campaign gave us the forms for 1994, 1993 and 1992. All congressional financial disclosure forms show assets, income and liabilities in broad value ranges. For example, if someone owns a piece of property worth $800,000, it will be categorized on the form as being valued between $500,000 and $1 million. For consistency, let’s assume the maximum amount possible based on those broad ranges. In 1992 -- in the middle of his second term and the year before he married Chao -- McConnell had up to $825,000 in assets and about $46,000 in income (such as speaking fees and investment returns) on top of his Senate salary. He also had up to $300,000 in liabilities, such as property mortgages, bringing down his net worth. After marrying Chao in 1993, McConnell reported a maximum of $2.6 million in assets -- including a piece of real estate worth up to $1 million that belonged to Chao -- and $93,500 on top of his Senate income. He also had $815,000 in liabilities. And that same year, McConnell inherited his mother’s estate. Fast-forwarding to 2012, his net worth -- $22.8 million -- was nearly three times higher than it was five years earlier (in 2007, it was $7.8 million). In 2008, as we found in McConnell's discloure forms from that year, he and his wife received a gift of between $5 million and $25 million after Chao’s mother died. This apparently accounts for the bulk of the increase during that five-year period. Our ruling Grimes’ ad said, ""What can happen in 30 years? A senator can become a multi-millionaire in public office."" What's problematic here is the ad’s strong suggestion that McConnell somehow managed to leverage his public office into personal riches. In truth, most of the growth in his wealth stems from his marriage and money his wife received after her mother died. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate this claim Mostly False. Correction, Aug. 25, 2014: An earlier version of this article included the figure for Grimes’ salary that was reported on her Senate candidate financial disclosure form. However, this figure -- $188,000 -- included earnings from 2013, as well as from part of 2014. To make the comparison equivalent to McConnell’s salary, we’ve adjusted her annual pay to $117,329.)",/factchecks/2014/aug/25/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-ad-says-mitch-mcconnell-ma/

Mary Burke says Spotted Cow beer available only in Wisconsin
","During a ""getting to know you"" Q&A with ABC News, Democrat Mary Burke fielded a question that hardly will change the course of Wisconsin’s future.

But it did present a dilemma for the would-be governor of the state of beer and brats.

The question: Spotted Cow or Summer Shandy?

The question forced Burke to choose between two well-known Wisconsin beer makers: New Glarus Brewing Co. and Chippewa Falls-based Leinenkugel’s.

She had to choose between a regional craft brewery and a much larger company. And between a slightly cloudy ""farmhouse ale"" and a wheat beer mixed with lemonade.

Burke didn’t equivocate in her reply.

""Spotted Cow,"" she said. ""New Glarus is a great brewery and Spotted Cow, you can only get it in Wisconsin and (it's) one of my favorites.""

Wait, what? We didn’t realize Spotted Cow was so exclusive.

And when we asked some beer drinkers — journalists know a few — several seemed surprised that the brew wouldn’t be available beyond the border.

""People love when politics and beer collide,"" noted Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl.

So we decided to set aside policy debates (it is late August, after all, and we are planning that Labor Day cookout...) and tap this claim.

Is Spotted Cow available only in the Badger State?

Breweries and their brews

Spotted Cow is the most popular beer produced by New Glarus, the brewery founded in 1993 by Deb and Dan Carey in the village of the same name in south central Wisconsin. New Glarus has enjoyed rapid growth, including a $21 million expansion, and then another $11 million addition.

But compared to the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co., New Glarus is tiny.

Last year, New Glarus sold 146,000 barrels, making it the 17th largest craft brewery in the nation, said Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketer’s Insights, a trade publication. Leinenkugel sold almost seven times as much, 975,000 barrels.

Also, Leinenkugel is a subsidiary of Chicago-based MillerCoors ,which has breweries in Milwaukee and other locations around the country. New Glarus is privately owned with 27 investors.

More important, for Burke’s claim, is where the suds are sold.

New Glarus sold beer in Illinois for about six years before making a business decision to pull out in 2003. At the time, the Careys said they were unable to keep up with the demand and wanted to focus only on Wisconsin.

In 2010, Deb Carey gave a little more colorful elaboration to the Madison Beer Review, a beer-oriented website.

""Brewers call Chicago a whores' market,"" she said.

Carey said New Glarus pulled out because ""it didn't want to participate in illegal business practices such as giving away beer to get bars to carry its products.""

""Everyone has a hand out and everyone wants some cash, (free) beer or a discount,"" she said in the story. ""As far as I'm concerned, it's not worth the graft and hassle.""

She added: ""Small brewers can't afford to pay to play. I really blame the big domestic brewers for creating this mess.""

In an interview, Carey said that even though the brewery has ramped up production and could reach 250,000 barrels a year, the sales strategy won't change.

""I'd be happy to die and not sell beer out of state,"" she said. ""We're going to really drill down and focus on our No. 1 asset, which is (brewmaster) Dan, and make world class beer for our friends in Wisconsin.""

New Glarus' website highlights the Wisconsin-only status with the prominent message: ""Only in Wisconsin."" Labels say: ""Drink Indigenous""

Shepard says New Glarus’ strategy is unique among small brewers.

""New Glarus is by far the biggest craft brewer available in a single state,"" he said in an email.

Shandy also a hit

Introduced in 2007, Summer Shandy became a huge hit for Leinenkugel. Like Spotted Cow, it’s the company’s top seller.

But it’s a lot easier to find a bottle of Shandy. Leinie’s brews are advertised nationally, including during the NCAA men’s basketball tourney. They’re found in all 50 states. New Glarus does virtually no advertising.

Of course, you can find Spotted Cow in fridges around the country, thanks to visitors who snare a case on their way home from Wisconsin, or who use the online gift shop.

So let’s drain this one.

Our rating

Burke chose Spotted Cow as her beer of choice, saying she liked the beer and the fact it was available only in Wisconsin.

The brewery made a business decision and stopped out-of-state sales about 11 years ago. And that’s become an important, if not entirely well known, selling point for the brewery ever since.

We rate her statement True.
  Correction: This item originally stated that Summer Shandy was introduced in 2011. The correct year is 2007.",/factchecks/2014/aug/25/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-spotted-cow-beer-available-only-wi/

Obama wanted to keep 10,000 troops in Iraq, ABC's Raddatz claims
","Sunday show pundits weighed provocations by the Islamic State this week after the public beheading of American journalist James Foley, with some military analysts arguing for a stronger military response from President Barack Obama. On ABC This Week, retired Marine Gen. John Allen said ending the threat from the Islamic State will require a coalition approach that targets the extreme militant groups across the larger region of Iraq and Syria. Martha Raddatz, ABC’s chief global affairs correspondent, was wearing her TV pundit hat when she said Allen’s idea for a strategy ""makes me think back about what the Obama administration originally wanted."" ""They wanted 10,000 troops to remain in Iraq -- not combat troops, but military advisers, special operations forces, to watch the counterterrorism effort,"" she said. ""So perhaps they'd go that way, but it would be a tough one."" The number sounded interesting to PunditFact given Obama’s 2008 campaign pledge to pull out of Iraq entirely (which PolitiFact monitors here) and his repeated 2012 campaign proclamations that the war was over. So we decided to check it out. The plan Shortly before Obama took office in January 2009, his predecessor, George W. Bush, finalized an important agreement after about a year of negotiations with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Called the Status of Forces Agreement, it spelled out the withdrawal of all American troops by the end of 2011. Obama, who won office in 2008 partly for his pledge to end the war in Iraq, announced his own draw-down plans a month after taking office. ""Let me say this as plainly as I can: by Aug. 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end,"" he said Feb. 27, 2009.  His speech revealed more details: He would keep between 35,000 to 50,000 military personnel there through the end of 2011 to train and advise Iraqi military and for counterterrorism purposes. What would happen after Jan. 1, 2012, -- a central point in our fact-check -- was not settled until the fall of 2011. Obama and the Iraqi government had been open to leaving more troops behind to help the country remain stable. But it didn’t happen. The result On Oct. 21, 2011, Obama announced the pullout of the vast majority of American troops in Iraq by Christmas. Staying behind were a couple hundred Marines to train the Iraqi army and provide security for diplomatic personnel. Essentially, he implemented the phase-out plan laid out by Bush. Facing a re-election challenge, Obama held the drawdown of all troops as the fulfillment of a campaign pledge. He did not harp on what some, namely Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, would see as a failure: failure to reach an agreement regarding how many American troops would remain in the country beyond Jan. 1, 2012. This was something Obama and his defense advisers had pushed for as they wrangled in negotiations with the al-Maliki-led government in the summer of 2011. The administration feared a virtually complete pullout would allow for big attacks from militant groups. Here’s what they wanted, and why it failed. Behind the numbers Military commanders in Washington and in Baghdad pushed for a residual force between 16,000 and 24,000 to conduct counterrorism work and train Iraqi security forces. The White House, reports show, was not open to a force that size. The Obama administration was initially open to leaving up to 10,000 troops in Iraq after the scheduled pullout at the end of 2011, a controversial pitch that would have required approval from Iraq’s divided government to change the 2008 agreement, the Los Angeles Times reported. The troops were to be placed in Baghdad and other ""strategic"" locations around the country. It did not stay there. The New York Times detailed how the one-time goal of a 10,000-person force shrank before negotiations failed altogether. Obama ruled out the 10,000-troop option in an Aug. 13, 2011, conference call, according to the New York Times, and ""the new goal would be a continuous presence of about 3,500 troops, a rotating force of up to 1,500 and half a dozen F-16’s."" What killed the deal The agreement failed over a demand that American troops be given immunity from prosecution by Iraqis, a very touchy political issue within the Iraqi Parliament. Some experts said Iraqi leaders may not have been willing to take great political risk with their citizens in exchange for a relatively small American force. But no immunity meant no sizable residual troop presence. ""When the Americans asked for immunity, the Iraqi side answered that it was not possible,"" al-Maliki said in an October 2011 news conference. ""The discussions over the number of trainers and the place of training stopped. Now that the issue of immunity was decided and that no immunity to be given, the withdrawal has started."" Three years later, as the Islamic State advanced in the country and shocked the world, a CNN reporter asked Obama if he regretted the decision not to leave a residual force in Iraq. Obama said, ""Keep in mind, that wasn't a decision made by me. That was a decision made by the Iraqi government."" The political overtones have ratcheted up with international headlines about Islamic State, which also is called ISIS. Conservatives blame Obama for pulling out too soon, for leaving Iraq vulnerable, and liberals argue the pullout deadline was prescribed by Bush. ""You pick your poison there,"" said Lance Janda, chairman of Cameron University’s Department of History and Government. ""It’s fair to say no one saw this ISIS stuff coming."" An ABC spokesman said Raddatz was unavailable for comment. The White House did not respond to emails. Our ruling Raddatz said the Obama administration originally ""wanted 10,000 troops to remain in Iraq -- not combat troops, but military advisers, special operations forces, to watch the counterterrorism effort."" For a period, at least, the Obama administration did envision leaving 10,000 troops in Iraq past the Dec. 31, 2011, pullout of forces. That number went down to about 5,000 before negotiations stalled amid a legal snare over immunity of American forces in Iraqi courts. Her claim is accurate but needs additional information.

Juan Williams: No. 1 cause of death for African-American males 15-34 is murder
","Amid ongoing protests in Ferguson, Mo., the national conversation about racial justice and police force has ignored a critical point that needs to be discussed, said Fox News pundit Juan Williams Civil rights activists and black leaders have failed to address the very thing that’s fueling conservative, white backlash — the high crime rate among the black community, particularly among young black men, Williams said on Aug. 24th’s Fox News Sunday. ""I think there’s fear of intimidation, harassment being legitimized by the fact that there is a high rate of crime, especially among young black men,"" Williams said. ""No. 1 cause of death, young black men 15 to 34 — murder. Who’s committing the murder? Not police. Other black men."" Last year, PolitiFact found that 93 percent of murder victims were killed by someone who shares their race. This time, we want to check out Williams’ claim that homicide is the No. 1 cause of death for black men 15-34 years old. Unnatural causes  We looked at numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which lists the leading causes of death across all demographics. Experts said that CDC data, compiled from coroner reports, are in line with FBI numbers, sourced from police reports. The CDC does not distinguish between the types of homicide (criminal, justified, etc.) or the types of accidents (auto accidents, falls, firearm discharge, etc.). The numbers for 2011, the most recent CDC findings, are consistent with data from previous years. According to the CDC, homicide was indeed the No. 1 killer of black men between the ages of 15 and 34 in 2011. Accidents ranked second in causes of death, and suicide claimed the third amount of black male lives between 15 and 24 years old, while heart disease ranked third for men 24-34. Leading causes of death among black males 1st 2nd 3rd All ages Diseases of the heart Malignant neoplasms Accidents 1-4 Accidents Homicide Congenital malformations 5-14 Accidents Malignant neoplasms Homicide 15-24 Homicide Accidents Suicide 25-34 Homicide Accidents Diseases of the heart 35-44 Diseases of the heart Accidents Homicide 45-54 Diseases of the heart Malignant neoplasms Accidents 55-84 Malignant neoplasms Diseases of the heart Cerebrovascular diseases 84-older Diseases of the heart Malignant neoplasms Cerebrovascular diseases Source: CDC Compared to other ethnicities, the numbers really stand out. Forty percent of African-American males 15-34 who died were murdered, according to the CDC, compared to just 3.8 percent of white males who died. Overall, 14 percent of all men 15-34 who died in 2011 were murdered. In 2011, black males 15-34 were 10 times more likely to die of murder than whites of the same age group.  Sources: CDC, PunditFact calculations For men of all ages, homicide was ranked fifth in leading causes of deaths for blacks (4.6 percent), seventh for Hispanics (2.8 percent), and ninth for American Indians (2.3 percent). Homicide was not one of the top 15 causes of death for whites 15-34. Color lines  Why are so many young black males dying from homicide? As the laws of aging go, younger men are less prone to fall victim to natural causes of death, so they are more likely to die of unnatural causes. And the racial disparity between those causes has partially to do with the likelihood of getting into car-related accidents, said James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University. ""Suburban whites drive more than urban blacks, and putting in more miles on highways —  that’s important because not a lot of people are going to get killed in fender benders in neighborhood streets,"" Fox said. ""There are relatively few auto-accidents in black urban areas."" Beyond driving habits, the criminal homicide rate among young black males is significantly higher than other groups. This, experts agreed, has to do with poverty and geography. The difference in social structures, access to jobs, educational opportunities, and many other factors between impoverished black neighborhoods and others is often a matter of life and death, according to Eli Silverman, professor emeritus at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.   ""The (homicide) numbers highlight the condition in minority areas, where a lot of violence occurs and the whole way of life is further intensified because police surveillance is always trying to track down people,"" he said. ""People have heightened survival instincts, will do anything to survive, and they’ll seek retribution for anything...because they don’t trust law enforcement."" Though it is tempting to pinpoint one cause as more impactful than others, Silverman cautions against singling out poverty or drugs or any other factor as the cause, because all of them intermix and interact. Our ruling Williams said that the No. 1 cause of death for black men 15-34 years old is murder. CDC data supports the claim. Out of all causes of death, homicide claimed about 40 percent of black lives between 15 and 34 years. This was significantly higher than the national average for males of that age group, and all other racial groups.
