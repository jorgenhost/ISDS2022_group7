John Kasich touts role in balancing budget, creating surplus, boosting jobs
","
Jobs are the central theme of this fall’s election campaigns, and John Kasich's TV ad ""Busted"" neatly delivers the Republican candidate's two-pronged message about the state's economy: The policies of Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland have failed, and Kasich can do better.

""Kasich,"" the ad says, ""was the architect who balanced the budget, cut spending, created a surplus, igniting record job creation.""

It's a sweeping claim that begs for explanation and context. The ad doesn't provide it. Neither does the posting about the ad on the campaign's blog, though it more helpfully calls Kasich ""chief architect of the 1997 Balanced Budget.""

PolitiFact Ohio looked into the record for more.

We started with ""Balanced Budget."" That refers to the federal Balanced Budget Act of 1997, H.R. 2015, a bipartisan agreement to balance the federal budget by the year 2002. The 537-page bill was sponsored by Kasich, a U.S. House member representing a suburban Columbus district from 1983 through 2000 and chairman of the House Budget Committee.

The legislation also promised the first major tax cuts in 16 years, and it reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments to health care providers.

Kasich was widely recognized as the its chief architect and a key player in negotiating its passage. When President Clinton signed the agreement into law, Kasich stood beside him in the Rose Garden.

Failure is an orphan, but success has a thousand fathers -- or custody-seekers.

Newt Gingrich, Kasich's mentor and then-speaker of the House, called him ""a historic figure. More than any single man, he is responsible for balancing the budget.""

Clinton, appearing in Cleveland for Strickland in September, said Kasich ""always tells people that he brokered for the Republicans the balanced-budget bill that I signed. That is true but misleading"" -- because, Clinton said, Kasich earlier was among congressional Republicans who shut down the government because the president refused to slash federal agencies and programs.

Regardless, conditions were comparatively favorable for the budget agreement. It came amid a booming economy and increased tax revenues that already had driven down the deficit, ultimately leading to a surplus. (The increase in tax revenues is credited to the improved economy and to tax increases that were part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.)

Clinton announced that surplus in September 1998, a year after the agreement was signed. It was the first U.S. budget surplus in 29 years. Federal budgets were balanced in both fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000.

Republicans claimed credit, saying they had pressured Clinton to adopt their balanced-budget commitment.

Clinton said he and congressional Democrats deserved the credit for passing the 1993 budget bill, which did not win a single Republican vote in the House and which Cinton has said ""led to an enormous flowering of the economy in America."" (PolitiFact examined that claim in detail last April and rated it Half True. The economy did improve after the 1993 budget bill became law, but economists say many factors played a role.)

Unemployment was one key indicator of the economy's health. It fell from 4.9 percent in 1997 to 3.9 percent in 2000, continuing a steady decrease that started in 1993.

But the impressive amount of job creation does not mean that a record number of jobs were added.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added 3,154,000 jobs in 1998 -- about 100,000 more than were created in 1997 -- and another 3,063,000 in 1999. But neither year reaches the peak of 3,447,000 jobs in 1994. (Job creation began to slow in 2000.)

Kasich deserves credit for conceiving, sponsoring and negotiating passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

But the ad overstates his role by saying he balanced the budget. And it exaggerates by giving Kasich, or the the budget agreement, credit for a surplus or ""record"" job creation.

We rate Kasich’s statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809781A880>],/factchecks/2010/oct/31/john-kasich/john-kasich-touts-role-balancing-budget-creating-s/

Opponent of Amendments 5, 6 claims ""liberal, out-of-state"" donors have spent millions
","
The group fighting a proposal to change how the state Legislature draws state and congressional district boundaries says in a new TV ad that the issue is being funded and supported largely by liberal, out-of-state special interests.

Amendments 5 and 6, which will appear on the Nov. 2, 2010, ballot, seek to amend the state Constitution so that districts are compact, contiguous and rely on existing city, county and geographical boundaries.

The group backing the changes, Fair Districts Florida, says the changes to the Constitution would prevent elected leaders from drawing legislative boundaries to benefit incumbents or one political party. But opponents, including the group Protect Your Vote, say the changes create standards that are impossible to meet and may actually make preserving minority representation more difficult. Instead, the opposition group — funded primarily by the Republican Party of Florida — characterizes the amendments as ""designed to elect more Democrats.""

A new ad by the group says:

""Take a close look at Amendments 5 and 6. They are a con job and a power grab.

""Liberal out-of-state special interests are spending millions on 5 and 6 to change the way Florida draws its congressional and legislative districts so they can elect more liberals to support the Obama-Pelosi agenda.

""More taxes, more spending, more debt, more job loss.

""How can the same liberal groups that helped bring America to its knees put Florida back on its feet?""

The ""liberal, out of state special interests"" claim is accompanied by symbols of the AFL-CIO, SEIU, the American Trial Lawyers Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, and ACORN — the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. Below the symbols is text that says ""Spending on 5 & 6 ... $5,786,364.""

In this claim, we're checking that ""liberal, out-of-state special interests are spending millions"" supporting Amendments 5 and 6.

For the record, here are official summaries of the two amendments. They are almost identical, with 5 applying to the state Legislature and 6 to Florida’s congressional districts.

Amendment 5  — Legislative districts or districting plans may not be drawn to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party. Districts shall not be drawn to deny racial or language minorities the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice. Districts must be contiguous. Unless otherwise required, districts must be compact, as equal in population as feasible, and where feasible must make use of existing city, county and geographical boundaries.

Amendment 6 — Congressional districts or districting plans may not be drawn to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party. Districts shall not be drawn to deny racial or language minorities the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice. Districts must be contiguous. Unless otherwise required, districts must be compact, as equal in population as feasible, and where feasible must make use of existing city, county and geographical boundaries.

Through Oct. 8, Fair Districts Florida had raised $6.9 million, more than two-thirds of which came in large donations of $25,000 or more. We’re looking at contributions before Oct. 8 because new reporting Oct. 28 wasn’t taken into account for Protect Your Vote’s ad.

It’s well-covered ground that ""liberals"" — or at least groups that traditionally support Democrats — are dominant contributors to Fair Districts Florida. The Orlando Sentinel and other news organizations characterize the issue as one of incumbents vs. those out of power, since Republicans will draw the new lines in 2012 based on fresh data from the 2010 census. Republicans also drew them 10 years ago, since they had gained control of the state Legislature after a redistricting effort led by Democrats the previous decade had been redrawn by the courts. The resulting congressional delegation had 15 Republicans and 10 Democrats even though registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state. The Orlando Sentinel analyzed campaign contributions and concluded in an Oct. 20 article that ""Democrats and their traditional allies have provided more than $5.7 million of the $6.9 million raised by Fair Districts Florida.""

But what about the part of the claim that says ""out of state?"" Campaign contributors provide an address, so it’s easy to separate contributions inside Florida from those outside it. PolitiFact Florida removed contributions from Florida addresses (ignoring a handful of small contributions that didn’t come with an address), and came up with $2.2 million in outside funding, with large contributions from the liberal group America Votes and labor union the National Education Association. That $2.2 million is about 32 percent of Fair District Florida’s funding through Oct. 8.

PolitiFact Florida also wondered about contributions from the groups whose logos appeared in the ad along with the amount ""$5,786,364."" How much had they contributed? We confirmed that SEIU contributed $625,000; Florida ACORN, $25,000 (back in 2007); and AFL-CIO chapters more than $18,000. But we were unable to find contributions from the American Trial Lawyers Association or the American Civil Liberties Union.

We contacted Ryan Duffy of public relations firm Ron Sachs Communications, who had provided us with a link to the ad and a four-page document supporting its claims. Did the Protect Your Vote campaign also come up with $2.2 million in out-of-state contributions and zero campaign cash from the ATLA and ACLU?

On the ""out-of-state"" question, he responded that according to Politico, America Votes had contributed $500,000 to the Florida Watch Ballot Committee, which in turn handed the money to Fair Districts Florida — making it out-of-state money that merely looked like in-state money. The same was true of a Florida Education Association donation of $500,000 after it received the same-sized donation from the National Education Association, he wrote.

He added: ""These findings suggest the possibility that even more money than this is being filtered through local organizations that has yet to be uncovered.""

Meanwhile, he acknowledged that the American Trial Lawyers Association and American Civil Liberties Union were not direct contributors to Fair Districts Florida. Rather, he said, they were included in the ad because donations from attorneys amounted to $1.2 million and 18 percent of the total contributions made to Fair Districts Florida, while the ACLU used its own money to organize rallies, distribute campaign literature, issue news releases and send out e-mail alerts in support of Amendments 5 and 6.

""Thus while the ACLU does not show up as a donor, it is clear that both the Florida and national organizations have contributed numerous resources (e-mails to their mailing list, organization of rallies, promotion on their website etc) to Fair Districts Florida,"" Duffy wrote.

What does the Truth-O-Meter make of all this?

When it comes to the phrase ""Liberal, out-of-state special interests are spending millions on 5 and 6,"" the Protect Your Vote group does reasonably well. PolitiFact Florida identifies $2.2 million in out-of-state money — though it’s not immediately possible to confirm all 230 contributions are from ""liberal"" donors or ""special interests."" Many donations come from individuals. But arguments from Duffy about the Florida Watch Ballot Committee and National Education Association hold some weight, providing an additional $1 million that fits the ""out-of-state special interests"" category and tipping the claim closer to true.

But this claim wasn’t made in isolation: The words appeared just as five logos and a number flashed on the screen for viewers. The AFL-CIO, SEIU, American Trial Lawyers Association, American Civil Liberties Union and ACORN logos appear above text that says: ""Spending on 5 & 6 ... $5,786,364."" We know two of those organizations didn’t contribute directly to Fair Districts Florida, and the rest contributed less than $669,000 combined. Also, the number on the screen represents ""liberal"" donations to Fair Districts Florida — not just those from out of state. Anyone watching without other background could fairly conclude that nearly $5.8 million had been contributed by ""liberal, out-of-state special interests,"" with significant contributions from the organizations on the screen. That’s simply not the case.

Meanwhile, it’s not clear that the message itself came from a partisan group — the top six donations to Protect Your Vote come from the Republican Party of Florida: $750,000 as of Oct. 8, and $1.9 million since then.

""Liberal, out-of-state special interests"" is the claim we’re checking, and there are clearly more than $1 million in donations that fit that category, and possibly more. But the mix of group logos and dollar figures is misleading. Not all those groups contributed money directly. Those who did contributed less than $1 million combined. And the number dramatically overstates ""liberal, out-of-state special interests"" since it represents all ""liberal"" donations from both inside and outside the state.  We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097559700>],/factchecks/2010/oct/31/protect-your-vote/opponent-amendments-5-6-claims-liberal-out-state-d/
"['Taxes', 'Texas', 'Valinda Bolton']","
Rep. Valinda Bolton says that Paul Workman wants to raise the sales tax
","
The run-up to Nov. 2 is full of frightful statements. For instance, a recent political mailer from Rep. Valinda Bolton, D-Austin, that casts GOP challenger Paul Workman as a vampire with a tax scheme that will suck your wallets dry. 
Flip the mailer over to see a picture of a Jack-O-Lantern bucket filled with money. ""Paul Workman's scary sales tax: A treat for politicians and a trick on families."" 
When Bolton's leaflet landed on our desks, we were already reviewing a similar statement from an earlier mailer. In it, Bolton says ""Paul Workman wants to raise the sales tax"" and that he ""admitted that he supports a plan to raise the sales tax dramatically."" 
Both ads cite a Sept. 9 Oak Hill Association of Neighorhoods (OHAN) forum where Workman and Bolton each spoke. 
When we asked Bolton to back up her statement, her campaign manager, Elizabeth Hartman, sent a campaign document citing both the Republican Party of Texas platform and Workman's remarks at the forum. 
The Bolton camp's document says that since Workman is listed as a Republican candidate on the Travis County Republican Party website and received campaign contributions from the Republican Party of Texas, ""one can assume his positions are in alignment with his party's platform."" 
According to the document, the Texas GOP's platform proposes to abolish the Internal Revenue Service, repeal the 16th Amendment — the one that allows Congress to collect income tax —and implement a national sales tax in place of all other federal taxes. ""However, until such time that the income tax is abolished, we support deductions for private and home schooling, home mortgages and sales tax,"" the party's platform states. 
On the state level, the party supports abolishing ""property taxes for the purpose of funding schools and to shift the tax burden to a consumption-based tax while maintaining or reducing the overall tax burden."" The party opposes ""all professional licensing fees and real estate and similar transaction fees or taxes,"" taxes on Internet sales and wants the state to repeal the revised franchise tax. Under the GOP scenario, until property taxes can be abolished property valuations should remain fixed for no less than three years following each revaluation. Currently, property is taxed based on its Jan. 1 market value. 
Bolton's take-away point: the platform ""urges the elimination of property taxes and would have that revenue stream replaced by a consumption-based tax — in other words, a sales tax."" 
From the OHAN forum, the Bolton camp's document quotes Workman saying: ""We're not going to get an income tax in this state. It ain't gonna happen, so there's really only two ways to pay for schools. It's either going to be a property tax or it's going to be a sales tax... The only way that I would be in favor of a sales tax is if we eliminated property tax. But if you believe that the state of Texas is the one who is responsible for providing that free education, then the money needs to be collected to the state and then distributed to the school districts in some equitable basis."" Workman then says that Texas would need to increase the sales tax by 5 cents for every dollar spent in order to replace the property tax system. The state sales tax is now 6.25 percent, though Texas cities, counties, transit authorities and special purpose districts can impose an additional local sales tax up to a total tax of 8.25 percent. 
The Bolton campaign's conclusion: ""Mr. Workman gave an 'either or' scenario — property taxes or sales taxes... Workman would support his party's plan to reform school funding — to first eliminate property taxes and then to replace them with increased sales tax."" 
On Oct. 19, Workman's campaign issued a press release responding to what it called Bolton's ""intellectually dishonest attack."" ""Workman didn't advocate raising the sales tax at the OHAN forum,"" the release says. Eric Bearse, a consultant for Workman's campaign later cited another statement Workman made at the forum: ""My position is that we will balance the budget by cutting spending,"" he said. ""We will not raise taxes."" 
Lastly, we reviewed an audio recording of Workman's Oct. 12 interview with Austin American-Statesman reporter Kate Alexander. In it, he says: ""There's really in my mind only three ways to pay for schools. That's an income tax, a state sales tax, or the current system of property tax plus whatever state revenue. Because we're not going to have an income tax, and I don't know if you can get the people to buy off on a state sales tax in lieu of property tax, so it appears to me that we're liable to be just kicking the can down the road further with no real fair equitable solution to the problem."" 
We'll stop kicking our own can to sum up what we've learned. 
The state GOP platform, in keeping with the so-called national Fair Tax agenda, advocates replacing current taxes with a national consumption or sales tax. (A bipartisan panel convened under former President George W. Bush estimated that such a scheme would require a sales tax of 34 percent or more.) While Workman doesn't seem to have distanced himself from his party's platform, he has indicated he has practical concerns — like getting ""people to buy off on a state sales tax in lieu of property tax."" 
True, going the GOP's preferred school-funding route would require a dramatic increase in the sales tax. Workman said as much at the forum attended by Bolton. He also said he'd favor such a change only if school property taxes were wiped out. Her statement ignores this critical fact, distorting Workman's position. 
We rate the statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097298980>],/factchecks/2010/oct/31/valinda-bolton/rep-valinda-bolton-says-paul-workman-wants-raise-s/
"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Matt Wand']","
Republicans try to turn health care tax -- and children -- against Democrats
","
Just a couple weeks back, House Democrats were picking on one Republican incumbent for sponsoring a bill that would have ended a 1 percent tax on health insurance premiums -- and, as a result, cut off the funding stream used to insure 80,000 Oregon children.

Now Republicans are trying to turn the tables and use that 1 percent tax -- and children -- against Democrats.

In a recent mailer, Republican candidate Matt Wand in Oregon’s 49th District tells voters that his Democratic opponent was making it harder for children to get insured.

Wand’s mailer -- and a similar one sent by Mark Johnson in the 52nd District -- features a young, wide-eyed boy and the words ""His illness just got a little harder to pay for.""

The mailers go on to say that (depending on the district) either Nick Kahl (49th) or Suzanne Van Orman (52nd) ""supported a new tax on health care, making it harder for many families to cover basic heath care expenses.""

Since we had so much fun checking out the initial health care ad, we figured why not look into this one.

First things first: According to legislative records, Kahl, along with Van Orman, did indeed vote for House Bill 2116. That  bill instituted a ""health insurance premium assessment."" For those of you who like government speak in plain talk (we sure do) that’s the 1 percent tax on health insurance premiums levied against insurance companies but ultimately passed onto consumers.

As Johnson sees it, that means less money in Oregonians’ pockets, and therefore less for paying medical bills. ""I don't think there's any way to deny that employees ... will have fewer dollars to take home,"" he said.

But this 1 percent tax -- and its impact on families -- is begging for some context.

In terms of insurance premium increases, a 1 percent bump may not exactly be welcome, but, according to the state, it’s a small part of what typically are higher annual rate increases.

Not all of the increases for 2010 have been submitted, but so far they range from 8 to 17 percent, according to the Insurance Division of the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services.  In 2008, some Oregonians saw increases of nearly 30 percent.

Again, a 1 percent increase isn’t negligible, but given these numbers, it doesn’t account for most of the increases Oregon families see.

""Not every consumer can afford to pay the increase,"" Wand says. ""How many additional children have become uninsured as a result of the increases in premiums?""

But there’s one last thing to consider in this debate: the cost of the uninsured.

That 1 percent tax went toward eventually insuring 80,000 children. Now, it might not seem as though insuring those kids has any sort of effect on anybody other than those kids, but there are some indications that say otherwise.

Yet another health care report, this one by John McConnell of Oregon Health & Science University and Neal Wallace of Portland State University, says the cost of caring for the uninsured -- which often takes place in hospital emergency rooms -- accounts for 6 to 9 percent of the average health insurance premium.

Numbers about how much children contribute to that total are hard to come by, but a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation study from 2004 looked at numbers from 1998 through 2000 and estimated that, overall, there was about $40.7 billion in uncompensated health care spending during those years. Of that, $5.4 billion came from uncompensated care for children. Those figures are in 2004 dollars.

Because of this indirect cost, Democrats could -- and do -- argue that insuring these 80,000 children will, over time, lead to a slowdown of premium increases. Of course, as Wand points out, that’s no help to families today.

Now, for the ruling. While it’s true that the new 1 percent tax is being passed onto consumers, it’s also true that this tax is helping insure 80,000 children. What’s more, the 1 percent is small  compared with average premium increases, and there’s an argument to be made that insuring these children will eventually lower the cost for everybody.

There’s a grain of truth in the Republicans’ claim that their opponents are ""making it harder for many families"" to cover basic health care expenses, but it’s missing so much context that we rate this claim Barely True.

President Barack Obama claims Mitch McConnell says his main goal is for GOP to regain the White House
","
With the looming possibility of Democrats losing their grip on the House and possibly even the Senate in Tuesday's midterm elections, President Barack Obama took some time in his weekly address on Oct. 30, 2010, to talk about the need to work in a bipartisan way to solve the country's most pressing issues, such as the weak economy.

But Obama said a couple recent comments from Republican leaders weren't a good harbinger.

""Whatever the outcome on Tuesday, we need to come together to help put people who are still looking for jobs back to work,"" Obama said.

""On these issues -- issues that will determine our success or failure in this new century -- I believe it’s the fundamental responsibility of all who hold elective office to seek out common ground,"" Obama said. ""It may not always be easy to find agreement; at times we’ll have legitimate philosophical differences.  And it may not always be the best politics.  But it is the right thing to do for our country.

""That’s why I found the recent comments by the top two Republican in Congress so troubling.  The Republican leader of the House actually said that ""this is not the time for compromise.""  And the Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one.""

We're fact-checking the last part, the claim that ""the Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one.""

It's based on a comment Sen. Mitch McConnelll made in an interview with the National Journal's Major Garrett on Oct. 29, 2010: ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.""

So McConnelll said it. But we think some further context is in order.

McConnell said he had been studying the history of presidents who suffered big defeats in midterm elections in Congress, but then won re-election in two years anyway. McConnelll said he doesn't want Republicans to repeat the same mistakes that allowed that to happen.

""After 1994, the public had the impression we Republicans overpromised and underdelivered,"" McConnell said. ""We suffered from some degree of hubris and acted as if the president was irrelevant and we would roll over him. By the summer of 1995, he was already on the way to being re-elected, and we were hanging on for our lives.""

McConnell said Republicans need to treat the midterm elections as ""the first step in retaking the government.""

It was in that context that McConnell said, ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.""

Garrett asked if that meant ""endless, or at least frequent, confrontation with the president?""

Said McConnell, ""If President Obama does a Clintonian backflip, if he’s willing to meet us halfway on some of the biggest issues, it’s not inappropriate for us to do business with him.""

In other words, in the very same interview, McConnell said that he'd be willing to work with Obama if Obama is ""willing to meet us halfway."" That's called compromise. And that sounds very much in the spirit of Obama's call to ""seek out common ground.""

The other comment Obama referred to came from House Leader John Boeher in a radio interview with Sean Hannity on Oct. 27, 2010. It was made in the context of the health care bill, in response to retiring Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) saying it wouldn't be a good idea to repeal the bill. ""This is not a time for compromise,"" Boehner said. ""...We're going to do everything -- and I mean everything -- we can do, to kill it, stop it, slow it down."" We think Obama's comment leaves the impression Boehner's ""not a time for compromise"" statement was more general in nature -- as opposed to being specifically targeted at the health care bill.

As for McConnell's comment ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,"" that sounds an awful lot like Obama's summation that ""his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one."" But while McConnell said it, Obama left out an important detail -- that McConnell also said in the same interview that he is willing to meet the president halfway. That leads us to a ruling of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DE6380>],/factchecks/2010/oct/30/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-claims-mitch-mcconnell-says/
"['Energy', 'Virginia', 'Tom Perriello']","
Tom Perriello says Robert Hurt voted for a bill that raised electric rates seven times.
","
Electricity has become a hair-raising issue in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District race, with Democratic incumbent Tom Perriello blaming Republican challenger and state Senator Robert Hurt for steep increases in Appalachian Power Company rates.

In a recent TV ad replete with ""zap!"" sound effects, lightning bolt graphics, a frightened kitten and photos of wide-eyed people with static-spiked hair gawking at utility bills, Perriello lays out his claim.  

""How do most Virginia families react to their electric bills? Pure shock,"" the ad says. ""That’s because Senator Robert Hurt voted for a bill that’s raised your electric rates seven times. Rates have gone up over 50 percent. Those increases also caused factories to close and jobs to be lost. For ignoring your pain, Senator Hurt received over $80,000 from the energy interests. After 10 years in office, Hurt is so out of touch, it’s just plain shocking.""

While the ad offers plenty of fact-check fodder, PolitiFact Virginia chose to focus on the charge that legislation Hurt voted for in 2007 has been responsible for seven electric rate increases.

Asked for the source of the claim, Perriello’s camp pointed to seven Appalachian Power Company rate hikes approved by the State Corporation Commission since 2007. That was the year Hurt, then a member of the state’s House of Delegates, voted for Senate Bill 1416 to establish a new form of electric utility regulation.

The law essentially re-regulated electricity supply rates after they were unregulated by the state’s legislature in 1999 to introduce competition to the electric supply business.

But the competition failed to materialize. In 2007, the legislation was amended to re-regulate electric rates for both supply and distribution service, but it was an alternative form of re-regulation, not a full return to the way the SCC set rates prior to 1999. The provisions built into the new regulatory model are what some opponents, including Perriello, say allow rates to be higher than they might otherwise be if the SCC had been permitted to regulate rates as it had in the past.

Now, back to the claim. Yes, it’s true that Appalachian rates have increased seven times since the 2007 legislation was passed. But let’s take a closer look at why the rates have risen.

Appalachian Power’s rates remained essentially flat from the early 1980s to 2005, when the company began to add environmental compliance facilities to coal-burning power plants. Between 2005 and the end of this year, the company will have spent $2 billion on environmental compliance, a cost that the company had to pass on to consumers, said company spokesman Todd Burns. Burns said the company also saw an increase in coal prices in late 2008 and an increase in customer electricity usage.  

""Those were the three things that stacked up to increase electric rates,"" he said. ""The bottom line is that Virginia regulation didn’t raise rates at all,"" Burns said. ""Regardless of which regulatory structure you come under, electric utilities are permitted to cover environmental compliance, costs and fuel.""

That’s backed up by a ruling from the State Corporation Commission following the steepest of the rate hikes in 2008. TheSCC said ""a significant portion of the increase relates to capital expenditures made to generation and distribution facilities needed to provide service to customers.""

The SCC’s ruling continued  ""A large portion of this increase is attributable to environmental improvements made to the generation facilities to comply with federal laws and regulations.""

Periello’s campaign points out that the seven increases were all filed under the new ""2007 legislation."" But Burns said that the SCC decided on six of the seven rates increases using the old regulations, adding that the new rate-setting system did not take effect until 2009.

According to the State Corporation Commission, that’s partly true. Because the 2007 legislation did more than just re-regulate, some amendments to existing law took effect in 2007 and the rate increases were actually decided by the SCC using a combination of the old regulatory model and new pieces.

But Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican, who represents consumers in utility rate cases before the State Corporation Commission, says the increases would have been allowable well before 2007.

""Ultimately, the types of costs that APCO has sought to recover in its rate cases (fuel, environmental costs, etc.) would also have been recoverable under the law as it existed not only prior to 2007, but dating back to before the 1999 restructuring law, as well,"" Cuccinelli wrote in a Sept. 13 commentary piece for the Martinsville Bulletin.  

Finally, it bears mentioning that when Appalachian’s rates jumped again last December, Hurt was among the legislators to vote for emergency legislation requiring the company to suspend the interim rate charge on customers.

So, let’s recap.

Yes, Appalachian electric rates have risen seven times since re-regulation legislation was passed with Hurt’s support. And yes, those seven rate increase requests were filed under 2007 legislation.

But Perriello is distorting the significance of Hurt’s vote. The reality is that the cases were decided using a combination of the old regulatory system and a few new provisions.

The SCC confirms that APCO’s rate increases were substantially the result of outside factors that would have been permissable under the previous legislation.

For these reasons, we find the claim to be False.     ",[<zip object at 0x000002809755C840>],/factchecks/2010/oct/30/tom-perriello/tom-perriello-says-robert-hurt-voted-bill-raised-e/
"['Voting Record', 'Virginia', 'Robert Hurt']","
Robert Hurt says Tom Perriello ""voted in lock step with Nancy Pelosi 90 percent of the time.”
","
In congressional races across the country, Republicans are trying to link Democratswith House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been demonized by GOP leaders.

One example can be found in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, where the Republican challenger, state Sen. Robert Hurt, has repeatedly lashed out at Democratic incumbent Rep. Tom Perriello for his alleged loyalty to the House speaker, particularly on high-profile issues.   

In a recent posting on Hurt’s website, his campaign lays out a ""Breakdown of Congressman Perriello’s actions while in Congress."" Second on the list: ""Congressman Perriello voted in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi 90 percent of the time, 100 percent of the time on the signature issues that kill jobs, increase Washington’s reckless spending spree, and vastly expand the size and scope of the federal government.""

Having found that similar claims in other states were exaggerated, PolitiFact Virginia decided to check the assertion that Perriello voted with Pelosi 90 percent of the time.

Asked for the source of the claim, Hurt’s campaign pointed to the same Washington Post congressional voting database that has been cited as the foundation for similar claims in other races.

But that’s where the claim begins to stray from the truth. While that database measures the the percentage of votes on which a lawmaker agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members, it does not measure how often they agree with a particular party leader.

A look at the database reveals that Perriello voted with his party 90.4 percent of the time, so we set about the task of finding out how often he voted in with Pelosi specifically.

Because House Speakers rarely vote, Pelosi has only cast 94 votes since the start of 2009, while Perriello has cast 1,502. So we measured the number of times Perriello has agreed with Pelosi on matters where both recorded votes. Of the 88 times, excluding procedural roll calls, where both have voted, Perriello went against Pelosi 19 times, making his true record of following the House Speaker’s lead 78.4 percent. That’s significantly lower than 90 percent.

Hurt’s campaign is correct that the two voted together on some major Democratic initiatives -- the stimulus package, health care and cap and trade. But Perriello did notably dissent from Pelosi and his party on the Wall Street bailout. In fact, of Virginia’s 11 members of Congress, Perriello breaks rank more than anyone else other than Rep. Glenn Nye, a Democrat from Hampton Roads.

The average party loyalty of all 444 House members on votes over the past two years is 90.6 percent, so by that measure, Perriello is typical. But he’s less faithful than the average Democrat, who votes with the party 92.2 percent of the time.    

Amanda Henneberg, Hurt’s spokeswoman, said voting with the Democratic Party is the equivalent of voting with Pelosi since she is the party’s House leader and has voted with her party 100 percent of the time. Furthermore, Henneberg notes that Pelosi has not missed any votes, but has chosen not to participate in the traditional sense when it didn’t matter.

University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said that if the House Speaker did vote on every issue, the claim would have more truth.

""A good case can be made that the recorded number is only part of the real, larger story,"" he said. ""Our Congress today is so partisan that almost all Democrats vote together on anything important, and almost all Republicans vote the other way. The Speaker would side with her party every time ... So you don't get the full picture with the 94 recorded votes.""

So let’s recap.

First, the Hurt campaign says Perriello voted with Pelosi 90 percent of the time, which is incorrect. He voted with his party 90 percent, but voted with Pelosi only 78.4 percent, which is significantly lower.

Still, there is support for Hurt’s underlying point that Perriello votes with his party much of the time. So we find the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966C9080>],/factchecks/2010/oct/30/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-says-tom-perriello-voted-lock-step-nan/
"['Message Machine 2010', 'Voting Record', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Jason Isaac']","
Jason Isaac says Patrick Rose voted to explore a state income tax
","
On two fronts, it's suddenly income-tax season.

The other day, Green Party gubernatorial candidate Deb Shafto called for creation of a state income tax in a televised Austin debate with Democrat Bill White and Libertarian Kathie Glass. And channel flippers that night might have spotted a TV ad by GOP Texas House hopeful Jason Isaac of Dripping Springs in which the narrator says incumbent Democrat Patrick Rose of San Marcos ""voted to explore a state income tax.""

Isaac referred to his claim again in a TV faceoff with Rose aired live Oct. 20 by Austin's Fox News, saying: ""I will not work towards investigating an income tax."" Rose shot back: ""My opponent is lying about a state income tax.""

Their exchange reflects a sensitive political reality. Most Texas elected officials are loathe to even mention a state income tax. They've seen the idea crash and burn. Nearly 20 years ago, Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock advocated an income tax, then quickly backed down before championing a proposed constitutional amendment -- which passed -- that requires statewide voter approval of an ""i"" tax before it could ever happen.

Texas is among seven states that don't levy an individual income tax, according to the nonpartisan Washington-based Tax Foundation. Foundation spokesman William Ahern told us that the other 43 states require residents to report their income on a form similar to the federal 1040 and pay a certain amount on the income the state considers taxable.

So how is it that Rose voted to explore that option?

Corbin Casteel, Isaac's consultant, pointed us to Rose's 2009 vote for a measure ordering a study of ""circuit breaker"" property tax programs. The term ""circuit breaker"" refers to the programs' intent, which is to keep households from being overloaded with property taxes.

The 2009 bill was later vetoed by GOP Gov. Rick Perry. Casteel pointed out that Perry said in his veto message that the circuit-breaker tax could function like a progressive income tax. Progressive tax rates result in higher earners paying higher taxes compared to their lower-earning counterparts.

Before weighing Perry's analysis, we first confirmed that Rose voted for the cited legislation, House Bill 3983. Next, state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, D-Austin, the bill author, told us that Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, added the section mandating the study. The Senate Journal says Watson's amendment was adopted by the Senate in a May 22, 2009, voice vote. (Watson's proposal previously had been attached to a bill by GOP Sen. Tommy Williams of The Woodlands, the Journal says, but that measure died.)

Watson's amendment would have directed the comptroller to examine ""circuit breaker"" programs as a ""means of expanding and protecting the homestead interests of low-income and moderate-income families."" It says that the study should cover potential effects of various provisions, including ""limiting which taxing units are involved; basing eligibility on a maximum annual income level; limiting the dollar amount of the benefit that a property owner could receive in the program; and basing eligibility on a minimum ratio of residence homestead ad valorem taxes imposed to annual income, including a progressive scale of minimum ratios based on annual income.""

There's no mention of an income tax in the proposal.

Next, we turned to Perry's June 2009 veto message, which says circuit-breaker ""programs are designed to provide property tax relief to certain individuals based upon their income."" If ""such a program were to be adopted in Texas,"" the message says, ""it would make the distribution of the property tax burden less equitable by shifting it to middle-class property owners. This would make the property tax function more like a progressive income tax in that the tax burden would slowly be pushed upwards until only the owners of the most valuable property paid any actual tax.""

As of 2008, 33 states had such programs, according to a 2009 report by the non-partisan Massachusetts-based Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, which says on its website that it looks at issues involving the use, regulation, and taxation of land. It shows Texas and Florida as the only states with neither an income tax nor a circuit breaker on its property taxes.

We asked the institute's Adam Langley, who helped research the report, to compare circuit-breaker programs to state personal income taxes.

""An income tax and circuit breaker are very different things,"" Langley said. ""An income tax is imposed on your income. A circuit breaker is not imposed on your income. It's based on your property taxes. But the degree of property tax relief you get is related to your income. Its effects are in some ways simliar to a progressive income tax. But you don't need to collect income taxes from everyone in a state to get a circuit-breaker program up and running.""

Ahern of the tax foundation said it doesn't make sense to term a circuit-breaker tax an income tax. ""It's income-dependent tax relief,"" Ahern said. ""That does not translate into income tax."" 
Casteel stood by his candidate's statement, saying in an e-mail that the study that Rose voted to support was ""to explore basing property taxes on income. A tax based on income is an income tax. Can't get any plainer than that.""

Our take: Isaac would have had a legitimate point if he'd limited himself to saying Rose voted to study a property tax mechanism that's related to income. 
But his statement grossly overstates things. Indeed, we'd suggest, if Watson's proposal had even been judged the back door to an income tax, it would never have drawn legislative backing.

Group says four Wisconsin senators voted to raise taxes on workers so “freeloaders” can get free health care
","
Before the federal law derided by critics as ""ObamaCare"" overshadowed earlier attempts at health care reform, a proposal for universal health care in Wisconsin gained national attention.

""Perhaps the boldest move on health care reform ever in a state,"" declared the Progressive States Network, a left-leaning public policy organization, after the state Senate approved ""Healthy Wisconsin"" in 2007.

""Wow, is ‘free’ health care expensive,"" countered a Wall Street Journal editorial headlined ""Cheese Headcases.""

""Healthy Wisconsin"" did not become law, but it has returned to the spotlight in the 2010 elections for the state Senate in TV ads produced by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce.

The state’s largest business group is targeting four Democratic senators in key districts: Jim Sullivan of Wauwatosa, John Lehman of Racine, Pat Kreitlow of Chippewa Falls and Robert Jauch of Poplar. The ads vary a bit, sometimes doubling up the targets, but all follow the same theme.

""Do you refuse to get a job? Looking for a free ride?"" a narrator asks in one of the ads. ""Well, Jim Sullivan says, Come to Wisconsin. No job? No problem! Don’t pay taxes? Don’t worry about it!""

Then comes the punch line:

""Jim Sullivan’s been working hard to raise taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month so freeloaders can get free state-run health care.""

Whoa.

For some workers, that’s a car payment or two worth of higher taxes every month. And ""freeloaders"" is, well, a pretty loaded word.

So, let’s see what Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is talking about.

The ads cite votes by the four Democrats for Senate Bill 40, which was the Senate version of the 2007-’09 state budget and included ""Healthy Wisconsin."" The proposal would have provided health coverage to nearly all state residents.

Senate Bill 40 died after being approved by the Senate. It faced opposition from Assembly Republicans and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who said at the time he had to live in the ""real world"" of ideas that could become law.

Let’s examine the two parts of the major claim in the ads:

The Senate Democrat’s plan would have raised ""taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month ...""

The proposal was to be funded through a payroll tax. The average monthly cost would have been $370 for employers and $140 for employees, or a total of $510, according to the Senate Democrats’ summary of the plan.

When asked why the ads claim the full tax would have been picked up by workers, WMC policy analyst R.J. Pirlot told PolitiFact Wisconsin: ""It ultimately comes out of the worker’s pocket.""

That’s one view of it. But clearly $510 per month would not have been deducted from paychecks, as the ads suggest.

Now the second part.

"" ... so freeloaders can get free state-run health care.""

""Freeloaders"" means people who don’t work, said WMC spokesman Jim Pugh.

Indeed, WMC’s ad against Jauch -- unlike the ones against Sullivan, Lehman and Kreitlow -- is explicit on that point.

That ad says ""Healthy Wisconsin"" was ""like ObamaCare, only worse. It would cost us $510 a month, but it’s free for people who move here and refuse to work.""

Is that right? Only to a point.

""Healthy Wisconsin"" would have covered state residents and out-of-state residents working in Wisconsin, except those already covered by plans such as Medicare, Medicaid and BadgerCare, according to the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

Unemployed people would have been eligible for health care under the proposal. So would new unemployed residents, after living in Wisconsin for one year -- although that waiting period would have been waived for pregnant women.  

Let’s punch the clock on this item.

With a focus on key state Senate seats, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is airing ads against four Democrats for their votes on a failed universal health care plan. Citing a $510 a month cost, the ads overstate how much the plan would have raised payroll taxes on workers. As for the second half of the charge -- that ""freeloaders"" would get free care -- unemployed Wisconsin residents would have qualified, as long as they’d been state residents for at least a year.

We rate the claim as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DF4BC0>],/factchecks/2010/oct/30/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/group-says-four-wisconsin-senators-voted-raise-tax/
"['Health Care', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Wisconsin', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
Republican group says Julie Lassa pushed for a Canadian-style health care system in Wisconsin
","
In the 2010 campaign, many national Democrats have been forced to defend their votes for health care reform. In Wisconsin, the same is true of state-level Democrats, including state Sen. Julie Lassa, who is running for the U.S. House.

At issue: A 2007 vote by state Senate Democrats to include ""Healthy Wisconsin,"" a state-level universal health care program, in their version of the budget.

Lassa voted for the package -- and that vote became key part of a TV ad aired by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Lassa is facing Republican Sean Duffy in a bid for the northwest Wisconsin seat held since 1969 by retiring Democrat Dave Obey.

In the TV ad, the GOP lists a litany of complaints about Lassa’s record, including the fact she pushed for a ""Canadian-style government takeover of health care."" It even labels the plan ""LassaCare.""

There’s no question about the vote. But what about the ""Canadian-style takeover"" part?

We turned to several experts.

They said the Canadian health system — praised by some, but treated as an expletive of sorts in the ad — includes these key aspects: 
Now let’s take a look at the Healthy Wisconsin plan, which went nowhere. The Assembly was controlled by Republicans at the time, and even Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle did not sign on.

The plan was an effort to provide health insurance to all eligible Wisconsin residents, so it matches Canada as universal coverage. But it was paid for through a payroll tax on both employers and workers -- not an income tax.

What’s more, a variety of private insurance plans would have been offered to state residents. The plan would have resembled the health insurance benefits provided for state employees.

""It’s not a single payer plan in any respect,"" said Thomas R. Oliver, a University of Wisconsin-Madison health policy professor. ""The idea was that a number of plans would be available for individuals.""

Others agreed.

""This is not Canadian-style health care at all,"" said Susan Giaimo, a visiting assistant professor of political science at Marquette University who wrote a paper about Healthy Wisconsin, and a book on health care systems in Germany and the United Kingdom.

""Individuals, not employers, would choose their health plan from among a range of plans,"" she said, adding private insurance plans would have continued, with regulation by the state.

David R. Riemer, an architect of the Healthy Wisconsin plan, told PolitiFact Wisconsin the key difference was who pays the bills. In Canada, the government pays. With Healthy Wisconsin, insurance companies would have paid.

At the time Healthy Wisconsin was being debated, there was sharp disagreement about how far-reaching the proposal was.

A report by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative-leaning group, declared: ""Healthy Wisconsin would turn every aspect of the health care system over to state government.""

The report noted ""cost containment"" was an aspect of the plan, and said other countries with a single-payer system have rationed the use of ""high-cost new technology.""

In testimony before a state Senate committee, Michael Tanner, an official with the Cato Institute, a libertarian group, said the plan ""combines many aspects of a single-payer health care system with the central structure of a concept known as ‘managed competition.’ ""

This, he said, would almost inevitably reduce the availability of and access to care, and lead to a reduction in capital spending on health care.

Both opponents used problems with the Canadian system to warn against the perils of government involvement in health care. But they did not say Healthy Wisconsin resembled a move to that country’s system of health care.

So, let’s return to the GOP claim against Lassa.

Did Lassa and Senate Democrats push a plan that a Canadian would recognize? Hardly. The differences are many: Who pays, how the plan is funded, insurance choices for consumers. Broad strokes are often used in political attacks, and in some cases those making them paint outside the lines. In this case, the lines got painted over.

We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097053A80>],/factchecks/2010/oct/30/national-republican-congressional-committee/republican-group-says-julie-lassa-pushed-canadian-/
"['Georgia', 'Ethics', 'Georgia House Democratic Caucus on behalf of Elena Parent']","
Backers of state House candidate Parent said incumbent ""profits"" from taxpayer money
","
If you believe her foes, state House Rep. Jill Chambers is the candidate of your nightmares.

Chambers ""sold out our families,"" according to a mailer by Democrats on behalf of challenger Elena Parent. The Republican lets businesses ""prey on consumers.""

But wait. There's more.

""Even worse, Jill Chambers personally profits from taxpayer money,"" the mailer said.

Profiting from taxpayer money? That claim begged for a fact check.

District 81 is home to the Atlanta area's hardest-fought General Assembly race this season. Although the stretch of DeKalb County along Buford Highway leans toward Democrats, Chambers has managed to keep her seat since 2003.

Parent, a political newcomer, could finally put the district in Democratic hands. The corporate attorney and former chief of staff for a state senator has strong backing and is not afraid of a fight.

Mud is flying. Earlier this month, we checked out an attack by Chambers that accused Parent of taking money intended for the education of DeKalb children. We ruled that claim Pants on Fire.

Now it's Parent's turn on the Truth-O-Meter. The Democrats' claim on her behalf that Chambers ""profits"" off of taxpayer money cites information from the General Assembly's Legislative Fiscal Office, which keeps track of member expenses.

The mailer, received by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Oct. 13, elaborates:

""This year alone, Chambers billed taxpayers $9,000 for her expenses on days when the Legislature wasn't even in session ... If that wasn't enough, Chambers has charged taxpayers an additional $110,000 for her 'expenses' on top of her taxpayer-funded salary."" 
Parent's camp said they did not pay for the ad and did not coordinate with state Democrats who wrote it. 
They referred us to Don Weigel, director of the Georgia House Democratic Caucus, for additional details. He said they're not accusing Chambers of fraud.

""The point we're making is she is abusing the system,"" Weigel said.

In addition to an annual salary of about $17,300, state law entitles members of the General Assembly to a per diem and mileage for their services. Most receive $173 per day plus 50 cents per mile.

This money is for session days and out-of-session committee work.

Chambers chairs the MARTA Oversight Committee, which oversees spending for the transit agency. She is also assigned to the Appropriations, Rules and Governmental Affairs committees.

The Democrats' argument goes like this:

The business Chambers ran with her now ex-husband selling art supplies to interior designers faltered in recent years and closed. She filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.

According to Parent's camp, as Chambers struggled financially, the number of days she said she performed out-of-session committee work jumped from 17 in 2008 to to 43 in 2009, even though the full MARTOC committee met only a few times in 2009.

Weigel said Chambers could have exaggerated the amount of work she performed to get more money. A document Democrats sent AJC PolitiFact Georgia laying out their argument said that they were unable to get the Legislature to produce records that say ""what, if any"" services she performed for the state.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia came up with expense records stretching back eight years.

To receive a per diem for out-of session committee work, legislators must file a voucher that names the committee and lists the dates of service and miles driven.

To receive reimbursements for costs such as stipends for legislative aides, yearly parking at the Capitol, printing and post office boxes, legislators must submit vouchers and proof of payment.

We took a look at those vouchers and receipts and compared them to figures Democrats provided us on Chambers' expenses.

We will take the mailer's points one at a time:

Chambers billed taxpayers $9,000 for her expenses on days when the Legislature wasn't in session

This statement is misleading. So far this year, Chambers' actual expenses total $3,324.95. This is less than half the $7,000 that state law allows. She paid the money out of pocket and was reimbursed after the state received proof of payment.

Chambers also reported she performed 42 days of committee work out of session for a total of $7,266 in per diem payments and $743.40 in mileage.

This means that Chambers did receive money for days the Legislature was not in session. But so long as she did the work, state law says she is legally entitled to the money.

We found no evidence that the number of days she reported was alarmingly high, or that she failed to perform a claimed day's work.

A 2003 AJC investigation into per diem days found it was unusual for legislators to claim more than 50 days after the end of the legislative session. Chambers' 42 days included days of out-of session committee work during spring session breaks.

According to that 2003 investigation, that year's MARTOC committee chair claimed he worked 99 days after the spring session.

Chambers charged taxpayers $110,000 for her expenses on top of her salary

This statement is even more misleading than the first. The paragraph that includes this sentence begins with the words ""this year alone."" Therefore a reader might easily think that Chambers billed the state $110,000 for a single year's expenses.

A closer look at Democrats' data shows the $110,000 is a total for about eight years of service in the Legislature, not one. And the money was not solely for expenses such as legislative aide work or office furniture. It was the entire amount she had received from the state in per diem, mileage and expense reimbursements. Once again, state law entitles her to the money, so long as she does the work and makes real payments.

We took a closer look at some of Chambers' vouchers. They included work while the Legislature was on break during session, and duties for committees other than MARTOC such as Appropriations and Rules.

So even though the full MARTOC committee met only a few times out of session, Chambers was involved in other committees that also met.

And contrary to Democrats' claims, Chambers' per diem days did not post an unusual jump during her financial difficulties. Their 2010 numbers excluded vouchers she filed after April 19.

According to Oct. 21 Fiscal Office records, Chambers has worked 42 days outside of session this year -- one day less than in 2009. Since Chambers began as MARTOC chair in 2005, her days have typically hovered between 32 and 43, although they dipped in 2008 to 17.

This means Chambers would have actually received less money when she needed it most.

Given this information, the accusation that Chambers ""profits"" from taxpayer money is out of bounds.

As Parent is a former chief of staff to a state senator, she and her camp should have known better.

At AJC PolitiFact, the burden of proof rests on the accuser. Democrats have not proved Chambers exaggerated the amount of work she performed.

Furthermore, the accusations are misleading. Parent's backers suggest Chambers is wasteful or dodging the rules. But her actual reported expenses in recent years have been less than half of what is allowed by law. Her per diem is set by state statute, and the days she claimed dropped when she could have used the cash.

Given the flimsy backing to the claim, by the Parent camp's rules, you could say any legislator ""profits"" from her work if she claims per diem and mileage.

We therefore rule this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809666FE00>],/factchecks/2010/oct/30/georgia-house-democratic-caucus-behalf-elena-paren/state-house-candidate-parent-said-incumbent-profit/
"['Oregon', 'Taxes', 'Taxpayer Association of Oregon']","
Anti-tax group claims Richard Devlin raised taxes by $1 billion in one day
","
The claim by the Taxpayer Association of Oregon PAC is that state Senate Majority Leader Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, implemented $1 billion in new taxes in one day.

The mailer goes even further to drive the point home to voters: The $1 billion comes down to more than $41 million an hour, or nearly $700,000 a minute, or $11,574 each second, and the question asked on the other side of the mailer is, ""Can we afford four more years of Richard Devlin?""

It certainly sounds like we can’t.

But, as always, context matters, and PolitiFact Oregon set about to uncover the meaning behind the mailer.

First up, a call to Jason Williams, co-founder of the PAC that paid for the mailers, which have also targeted other Senate Democrats in swing districts. He cited three bills, which legislative records show were passed on one day: June 11, 2009.

The Oregon House had approved and sent to the Senate separate bills that (1) would raise personal income tax rates on wealthier households, (2) would raise taxes on corporations, and (3) would raise taxes on hospitals and insurers to provide health care for needy kids and adults. All told, the bills added up to $1 billion in the 2009-11 budget period. So that’s true.

But let’s take a closer look at those bills.

House Bill 2649 created two new tax brackets, including a 10.8 percent bracket for joint filers with income above $250,000 and for single filers with income above $125,000. For tax years after 2011, the rate is scheduled to drop to 9.9 percent. The bill also phased out some federal tax deductions. The Legislative Revenue Office estimated it would raise taxes for 2.5 percent of full-year individual filers (38,000) and 6.1 percent of returns (25,600) that report business income or loss. The proposal was projected to raise $472 million in 2009-11; it became Measure 66 in the January 2010 special election.

House Bill 3405 raised the corporate minimum tax from $10 -- first set in 1931 and untouched until 2009 -- to a sliding scale of $150 to $100,000 depending on sales in Oregon. The $10 minimum for S-corporations went from $10 to $150. The bill also created a second tax rate of 7.9 percent and implemented filing fees. The Legislative Revenue Office estimated this would affect more than 75 percent of C-corporations and nearly all 62,000 S-corporations. The proposal was projected to raise $261 million in 2009-11; it became Measure 67 in the January 2010 special election.

That gets us to $733 million, by targeting upper-income households and corporations. Both bills were approved to help close an estimated $4 billion state budget gap. All 18 Democrats in the Senate voted for both bills; no Republicans did. Anti-tax activists collected enough signatures to put the issue to voters, who agreed to keep the tax increases.

These are not taxes that would hit the pocketbooks of the average Joe, but PolitiFact Oregon accepts that such taxes could affect employees and consumer prices.

Now, for House Bill 2116, which wasn’t designed to balance the state budget but to expand health care coverage in Oregon.

This proposal did two things. One, it levied a 1 percent tax on insurers, projected to raise more than $115 million in 2009-11 to insure 80,000 children. Two, it replaced an expiring tax paid by hospitals, and was projected to raise $300 million for low-income adults without health care. Hospitals, the entities paying the tax, actually backed the legislation because it would allow them to recoup more money from Medicaid. Two Republicans joined all 18 Democrats in the Senate to approve this bill.

Again, we’re not sure how much the hospital tax -- not the insurer tax -- affects regular people in Oregon. So we called Williams back to get his take on the impact of the three bills. He was flabbergasted that we would even ask. Everyone pays, he said, when businesses fail or workers are laid off or prices go up.

""It’s a billion dollars of taxes,"" he said.

PolitiFact Oregon understands that a little bit of hyperbole is allowed in campaigns, although the per-second breakdown makes it sound as if Devlin is continuing to tax people at an unbelievable clip. The statement also ignores the fact that when measures 66 and 67 were put to Oregon voters they passed by wide margins.

On the one hand, the statement is accurate -- taxes did go up by $1 billion. And Devlin as majority leader had considerable influence even though the statement makes it sounds as if he did it alone.

But the statement leaves out important details, such as why the need, over how long and who agreed to them. We rate this Half True.

Employees can lose their job -- or switch jobs -- and end up with a different plan that doesn’t include the same doctor. Switching jobs -- and therefore, potentially health insurance -- can happen often. In 2012, the median job tenure was 5.4 years, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. ""It's hard to imagine many people on the same health plan for 15-20 years given natural job turnover,"" said Paul Fronstin, senior research associate at Employee Benefit Research Institute. The health care law leaves in place the current health insurance system, so switching plans and possibly doctors will still happen. The law also puts more requirements on insurance companies, so that they have to offer more comprehensive coverage. For people who are uninsured or have to buy insurance on their own, the law creates state-by-state health insurance exchanges where people can buy their own insurance. These new options mean people may end up switching health plans, and that could mean switching doctors. But experts on the health care law told us it’s difficult to predict how many will fall into that category. There are many factors at play, including the particular insurance plan, geography and if the patient shops for a plan on the exchange. ""Most people are not going to be affected, at least in the short term,"" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. ""Will it be huge numbers? Probably not. Will some people find they can’t keep their current doctor? Yes."" If Rubio wants to protect people from involuntary changes in their doctors, ""the best remedy is to abandon the current employer-based insurance system and to provide insurance on some other basis -- e.g., a single-insurer system of the kind they have in Canada,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. Now let’s examine the possibilities as it relates to Obamacare: • Employers that offer health insurance: It’s possible that employers will switch their health care plans and that a new plan won’t include some employees’ current doctors in network. But that was already the case before Obamacare. ""If the ACA results in more employers switching plans, it is possible that more people will be in a situation where their new plan isn't in the network, but I've seen nothing that quantifies this,"" Fronstin said.   It’s also possible that some large employers could decide to drop their plan and pay the penalty, forcing employees to buy insurance from the exchanges. Also, a small employer who won’t face a penalty could drop their plan, sending workers to the exchanges. But industry experts are not expecting the changes to be particularly widespread. Barry Schilmeister, a health care actuary and senior consultant at Mercer, said that ""it's not likely that employers will be making a lot more carrier changes than in the past, if they're keeping their traditional programs (which most are, for now)."" • Exchanges: A patient’s current doctor may not be available through some -- or potentially any -- of the plans offered on the exchanges. There are lots of different scenarios here. A patient’s doctor might be on an exchange plan, but the consumer might choose a cheaper alternative instead that doesn’t cover that doctor. If that consumer truly couldn’t afford the plan covering their doctor, we might call that being ""forced"" to switch doctors, but if someone simply chooses to save money, then they are making a choice. Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that there is some truth to Rubio’s claim, because there is the potential for some patients to lose access to their doctor. But she said at this point, it’s not possible to predict how many people that will happen to in the first year of the exchange -- or beyond. ""Just like private plans now don’t include all the doctors, many doctors may not choose to be in the plans offered in the exchanges,"" she told PolitiFact. That ""will depend on which companies participate in the exchanges, whether they have a relationship with those plans, and the payment rates that the plan will use for the exchange.  Many states have pushed plan premiums way below what the companies thought it would take and may come in with narrow networks to live within those rates."" News reports indicate that some health care insurance companies are forgoing some state exchanges, at least for now. Aetna announced Aug. 2 that it was pulling out of Maryland’s individual exchange. We interviewed spokespersons at a few health care companies and learned that United Health plans to participate in about a dozen exchanges, while Aetna plans to join about 14. Cigna currently offers individual plans in 10 states and has chosen half for initial participation in exchanges. This means for consumers who now have a particular insurance company and have to buy a plan on the exchange, ""whether your doctor might be on other plans is a crapshoot -- maybe yes, maybe no,"" Wilensky said. • Medicare: Jeff Johnson, state director of Florida AARP, said that nothing in the Affordable Care Act would force patients on Medicare to switch doctors. Future changes to Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors ""could affect doctors getting out of Medicare."" However, that has been an issue years before Obamacare. The ""sustainable growth rate"" passed into law under President Bill Clinton is supposed to set Medicare reimbursement costs but is routinely bypassed by Congress. ""The Affordable Care Act did not include a permanent fix to that,"" he said. Judith Stein, executive director of Center for Medicare Advocacy, said every year doctors decide whether to continue serving patients on Medicare or Medicare Advantage -- and that’s unrelated to Obamacare. With Medicare Advantage, doctors consider how many of their patients are on the plan, reimbursement rates and administrative hassles   ""It may be your Medicare Advantage plan may not include your doctor next year, but not because of Obamacare. ... That has always been the case and continues to be the case."" Our ruling Rubio said that for people who currently have health insurance, ""They have a doctor they’ve been seeing for the last 15 or 20 years, they won’t be able to keep going to that doctor,"" due to Obamacare. Rubio ignores the fact that without Obamacare, patients can lose access to their doctor when their employer switches plans or they switch (or lose) jobs. Some patients who buy health insurance through the exchange could lose access to their current doctor, but it’s difficult to predict how many. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F2A900>],/factchecks/2013/aug/05/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-patients-wont-keep-doctors-obamac/

McAuliffe says a judge removed Ken Cuccinelli from the Star Scientific tax case
","Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Terry McAuliffe has repeatedly sought to link GOP opponent Ken Cuccinelli to Jonnie Williams, the CEO of the troubled Star Scientific dietary supplement company. In a recent debate, McAuliffe cited a series of gifts Cuccinelli received from Williams -- including stays at the CEO’s Smith Mountain Lake home and a catered turkey dinner. McAuliffe argued those gifts swayed the Republican attorney general's conduct in a 2011 lawsuit that Star Scientific brought against the state over an assessment on property the company owns in Mecklenburg County. The company has told investors it would owe $1.7 million in taxes and penalties if it loses the case, according to the Associated Press. The Democrat accused Cuccinelli of ignoring the case, rather than taking the company to court -- a charge Cuccinelli vehemently denied, but McAuliffe continued. ""Finally a judge took the case away from him because of a conflict of interest,"" McAuliffe said. We asked Josh Schwerin, McAuliffe’s campaign spokesman for proof that a judge removed Cuccinelli from the case. Schwerin cited a May 6, 2013 order from Mecklenburg Circuit Court Judge Leslie M. Osborn that moved the case from Cuccinelli’s office to two attorneys at the Richmond-based Troutman Sanders law firm who are representing the state on a pro bono basis. Technically, McAuliffe has a point in that a judge did take the case away from Cuccinelli. But McAuliffe’s campaign omits a major point -- the fact that the judge did that at the request of the attorney general’s office. In a motion that was signed by the pro bono attorneys -- Stephen D. Rosenthal and William H. Hurd -- Virginia assistant attorney general Elizabeth B. Myers requested that outside counsel handle the case. The motion granting that request makes no reference to whether the attorney general has a conflict of interest. It’s merely a pro forma order granting the request to switch counsel. Cuccinelli asked to be removed from the case after Democrats accused him of a conflict of interest in representing the state in the case involving Williams -- who had given Cuccinelli $13,000 in gifts. Cuccinelli later disclosed that he received an additional $5,000 in gifts. Cuccinelli also disclosed -- belatedly -- his sale of Star Scientific stock because he said he hadn’t realized its value had crossed the $10,000 threshold above which the state requires  disclosure. In a prepared April 5 statement, Cuccinelli explained his decision to remove the attorney general’s office from the case and appoint outside attorneys to handle it. ""To be clear, there was absolutely no conflict of interest with the attorney general’s office,"" Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for the attorney general said in the statement. ""But in an abundance of caution, and to move past what has become an unnecessary distraction for the office and the attorney general, the case was given to outside counsel."" Gottstein went on to say Cuccinelli was not personally involved in the tax case and that the attorney general’s office had filed all of its required pleadings within court deadlines. But In a March 22 article, the Associated Press quoted Paul Campsen, a private Norfolk attorney who specializes in tax litigation saying the attorney general’s previous connection to the case ""isn’t just the appearance of a conflict, it is a conflict of interest."" Our ruling McAuliffe said a judge took the Star Scientific tax case away from Cuccinelli. There is a grain of truth in McAuliffe’s claim, because a judge did indeed grant a motion removing the attorney general from the case. But McAuliffe’s statement is misleading because it ignores some crucial information -- the fact that the attorney general’s office was the one that requested to be removed from the case. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809706A740>],/factchecks/2013/aug/05/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-judge-removed-ken-cuccinelli-star-s/

Hawaii Senator says 97 percent of Greenland's ice sheet thawed in July 2012; it was just surface ice
","Everybody's looking for evidence that pollution, particularly the carbon dioxide released into the air, is (or is not, depending on your point of view) altering Earth's climate. On July 24, U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, whose state stands to face some serious consequences if warmer temperatures cause sea levels to rise and storms to become stronger, was on the floor of the Senate speaking about an event in July 2012 that produced a dramatic change in the massive ice sheet covering Greenland. Because of global warming, ""glaciers continue to retreat. The Greenland ice sheet provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice,"" Schatz said. ""For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed."" Ninety-seven percent? One way to read that is that only 3 percent of Greenland's ice sheet remained. That would be A LOT of melting, especially for a mass of ice that is, over large stretches, a mile or two thick. Losing that much arctic ice would have a HUGE impact. Not only would sea level rise by roughly 20 feet, the ice would no longer be reflecting sunlight back into space, warming the planet even faster. We contacted Schatz's office, which directed us to two sources. The first was a web page from the National Snow & Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder, which tracks melting on a daily basis. It says, ""Greenland’s surface melting in 2012 was intense, far in excess of any earlier year in the satellite record since 1979. In July 2012, a very unusual weather event occurred. For a few days, 97% of the entire ice sheet indicated surface melting."" The estimate comes from satellite measurements. We also found a NASA web page that reported that in July 2012, ""an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet surface had thawed by July 12."" So the key word in each case is ""surface."" The melting the satellites tracked was at and near the surface, often to a depth of no more than an inch. The ice sheet itself never thawed, or came close to thawing. Dorothy Hall, a senior scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, whose examination of the event is to be published in Geophysical Research Letters, said unusually warm temperatures that month did produce some unusual melting, but it didn't wipe out most of the ice sheet. ""Sen. Schatz's statement is very misleading,"" she said in an email, noting that her estimate of surface melt is even higher. ""The correct statement would be that approximately 99% of the surface of the Greenland ice sheet experienced some melt during a two-day period in July of 2012. In fact most of the ice sheet surface re-froze within hours or days of the big melt event."" Hall said that the last time that much surface ice temporarily melted was about a century ago. ""If that begins to happen more frequently, that is a red flag,"" she said. At the highest elevations, ""the surface will only melt a few centimeters for a few minutes or hours, so none of that liquid water can run off and contribute to sea level rise,"" she said in an interview. The thaw was deeper and more extensive at lower altitudes, producing some ponds and runoff, but even in those cases, much of the water re-froze, although quite a bit made its way to the ocean to contribute to sea level rise. How much of the ice sheet was actually lost? Satellite data show that Greenland lost about 325 billion metric tons of ice that month, enough to raise sea level by nearly a millimeter. That's a lot. Typically, 340 billion metric tons are lost in a full year, according to climate researcher Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. However, the amount of ice lost was only about 0.01 percent of the nearly 3 million billion tons of ice locked in the sheet. When we asked Schatz's office if the senator misspoke, spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa stood by his comment. ""The senator said that 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed . . . which means to become soft, and does not mean vanish. He also specifically said 'for several days in July of 2012,' so that it would be clear that he was not implying that the ice vanished forever. To suggest that the senator said it disappeared is inaccurate."" Thomas Mote, a geographer at the University of Georgia, says it's a ""common mistake"" to confuse the thawing of the surface ice with the thawing of the ice sheet. ""Certainly we did not lose 97 percent of the ice. Sea levels would quickly go up 20 feet,"" he said. ""We would notice that pretty quickly."" Our ruling Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said: ""For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed."" His first sentence is correct. Because he also prefaced his comment by asserting that ""glaciers continue to retreat"" and the ice sheet ""provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice,"" his contention that  ""97 percent of the ice sheet thawed,"" could easily be misinterpreted as referring to the whole ice sheet. Because parts of the statement are accurate but the wording of the second sentence leaves out an important detail, we rate it Half True.

Chris Christie claims Kentucky gets more than twice back in federal funding from Washington than New Jersey
","The past week’s political sandbox match between Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul kicked up a lot of dust. But after a week of increasingly insulting barbs between the two possible Republican presidential contenders for 2016, fueled by a disagreement about national security matters, there’s one claim that caught the Truth-O-Meter’s attention – and it’s not whether Christie is the ""King of Bacon"" when it comes to government spending, as Paul claimed July 30 during an interview on CNN. ""In fact New Jersey is a donor state, we get 61 cents back on every dollar we send to Washington,"" Christie said July 30 in response to Rand’s claim that New Jersey has a ‘gimme, gimme, gimme’ attitude about federal spending. ""And interestingly Kentucky gets $1.51 on every dollar they send to Washington."" Kentucky receives more than double what New Jersey gets in federal funding? For this claim, Christie’s got the numbers on his side. We reviewed data from the business-backed Tax Foundation, which tracked from 1981 through 2005 how much each state gets back in expenditures for every dollar sent in taxes to the federal government. Tax Foundation spokesman Richard Morrison said the group is working to update the data. The Washington, D.C.-based foundation calculated the federal tax burden -- a measurement meant to account for taxes that are assessed in one state, but impact taxpayers elsewhere -- to conduct its analysis. Christie’s figures come from data for 2005, which shows that New Jersey received 61 cents and Kentucky received $1.51 for every dollar each state sent to Washington. Paul didn’t challenge Christie’s numbers but noted that two military bases in Kentucky (Fort Campbell and Fort Knox) might be one reason why Kentucky gets the rate of federal funding it does. Two bases? Perhaps the senator didn’t know that New Jersey has five active military bases: the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst; the Army’s Picatinny Arsenal; the Coast Guard’s Loran Support Unit in Wildwood and the Training Center in Cape May; and Naval Weapons Station Earle. Let’s look beyond Christie’s claim and review the Tax Foundation’s 25 years’ worth of data in more depth. For example, as New Jersey’s rate of return on dollars sent to Washington decreased from a high of about 72 cents in 1981, Kentucky’s increased, from $1.06 that year to $1.51 in 2005. Further, in 17 of the 25 years analyzed, New Jersey came in last place, receiving 70 cents or less for every dollar it sent to the federal government. Kentucky, however, has climbed from about 23rd place among all states to 9th place. But since Christie’s data is about eight years old, we also checked with other organizations that track these types of numbers. The Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research organization based in Washington, D.C., that promotes 18 states in the region, released a May 2011 report on federal spending and taxation patterns that focused on New Jersey. New Jersey ranked 48th nationwide, according to the report. Only Minnesota and Delaware received smaller returns on their federal tax dollars in 2009. Colleen Cain, a senior policy analyst with the Northeast-Midwest Institute who prepared the 2011 report, said in the report that New Jersey’s low ranking is due to the state’s ""relatively high income levels and greater-than-average business income tax contribution, coupled with a relatively low need for federal aid. It does, however, underscore the importance of states like New Jersey in supporting the fiscal health of the nation generally."" Cain did not respond to a request for additional comment. Our ruling Christie said, ""In fact New Jersey is a donor state, we get 61 cents back on every dollar we send to Washington,"" in response to Rand’s claim that New Jersey has a ‘gimme’ attitude about federal spending. ""And interestingly Kentucky gets $1.51 on every dollar they send to Washington."" Christie’s claim is right on the money: even though the most recent data available is eight years old, the Tax Foundation backs up the governor’s statement to the exact penny for both New Jersey and Kentucky. So when it comes to a game of fiscal ""gimme, gimme, gimme,"" it might behoove the senator to check his own state’s coffers first before attacking New Jersey. Christie’s statement rates True.

GOP bill would put traditional home mortgages out of reach for masses, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore says
","After the real estate market collapsed during the Great Depression, the federal government created entities to encourage families to buy houses and banks to make home loans. The Federal Housing Administration, founded in 1934, issues mortgage insurance to guarantee banks they will get their money back even if a homeowner doesn’t make payments. That made it easier for banks to approve mortgages for people who don’t have a lot of money or have mediocre credit. Fannie Mae and later Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises, were created to buy up, bundle and sell mortgages as mortgage-backed securities on the open market. That gave lenders more money to make home loans. But by 2008, Uncle Sam had to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the recession took hold. And several years later, FHA was also in financial straits. Those developments helped precipitate a move in July 2013 by Republican leaders of the House Financial Services Committee. They announced they would introduce the Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners Act (PATH), aiming at largely removing the government from the financing of home purchases. That prompted U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a member of the committee, to go on the attack. ""This radical bill would push the dream of home ownership further and further out of reach for Wisconsin families. The so-called PATH Act is, in actuality, the PATH to Nowhere,"" the Wisconsin Democrat charged in a July 24, 2013 news release. The bill, Moore continued, ""would eliminate a person’s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages – the cornerstone of our housing finance system."" Let’s see if that’s so. Moore's evidence  Moore spokeswoman Staci Cox told us that when Moore referred to ""a person’s"" ability to obtain a traditional fixed-rate mortgage, she meant the ""average American."" To back the statement, Cox highlighted testimony made to the House Financial Services Committee by Mark Zandi, chief economist for the Moody's Analytics economic research firm. He said the PATH bill would put 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans ""out of reach for most Americans."" Without the government guarantees, mortgage rates would increase, adding $130 per month to the cost of a mortgage for the typical borrower, Zandi said. And while three-quarters of mortgage loans currently are fixed rate, that would drop to 20 percent to 25 percent, he said. Moore also cites opposition to aspects of the bill from several major players in housing. The National Association of Home Builders, for example, said the bill would ""greatly limit homeownership"" for ""many qualified Americans""; and the Credit Union National Association said it feared the bill could not ""ensure continuation of long-term fixed-rate mortgage products."" So, Moore doesn’t have hard evidence that the PATH bill would eliminate the ability of a person to get a traditional mortgage; that remains to be seen. But experts say such mortgages could become unavailable or unaffordable for many people. GOP response  The PATH bill, pushed by U.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, would shut down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in five years and limit the focus of the FHA's mortgage insurance to first-time home buyers with moderate incomes. Jeff Emerson, a staff member of the House Financial Services Committee, gave us a response to Moore's claim. Emerson cited a Washington Post editorial that rebutted the assertion that 30-year mortgages would go away. The editorial noted that 30-year fixed-rate loans known as jumbo mortgages ""already exist without government help,"" saying: ""Presumably private-sector innovation could create loan products, with 30-year terms or otherwise, appropriate for smaller borrowers as well."" But current jumbo mortgages require a borrower to have a higher income, a good credit score and typically a 30 percent down payment, according to Realtor.com. Emerson also said PATH ""is designed to create more opportunities for more choices, including the 30-year fixed rate loan. The market will respond to customer demand, as it always does."" So, while there is no indication that traditional mortgages would cease to exist, neither of Emerson's points are evidence that they would remain as available as they are with today's government guarantees. Other evidence Other experts, while disagreeing on the overall impact of PATH on traditional fixed-rate mortgages, acknowledge that the elimination of government guarantees or subsidies inevitably means that the terms of such mortgages would change. Georgetown University law professor Adam Levitin, whose specialties include housing finance, agreed with Zandi. He testified to House Financial Services Committee that the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is ""heavily a function of federal backing of the housing finance system"" and that if PATH became law, ""it would be difficult for most American families to obtain 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages."" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum, and Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, testified that affordable fixed-rate mortgages would still be offered, but they weren’t specific. Calabria noted the current availability of fixed-rate jumbo home mortgages, as well as fixed-rate auto loans. In a New York Times opinion column, University of Maryland public policy professor Phillip Swagel, who is also a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, praised the PATH bill. But he acknowledged that without government guarantees, mortgage interest rates would rise, though ""it is hard to know quite how much."" He also stated the housing market ""is in an upswing and affordability remains high, so it seems likely that the housing sector would continue to recover even with higher rates."" Our rating Moore stated that a Republican bill to largely privatize the nation’s housing finance system ""would eliminate a person’s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages."" It's unknown how exactly the effects of the bill would play out. But there is reason to believe that without government guarantees, traditional home mortgages would become less available, less affordable, or both, for many Americans. Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details. That fits for this one.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280979C6100>],/factchecks/2013/aug/04/gwen-moore/gop-bill-would-put-traditional-home-mortgages-out-/
"['Rhode Island', 'Health Care', 'Elizabeth Roberts']","
“They’ve seen employer-supported coverage increase in Massachusetts after this law (Romneycare) was implemented.”
","One of the defining public policy debates of our time has been about Obamacare, formally the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010. So PolitiFact Rhode Island was listening closely to the July 28, 2013 broadcast of Channel 12 ""Newsmakers,"" on which Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth H. Roberts appeared. She is a leading figure in the debate, as chairwoman of the state Healthcare Reform Commission, which is charged with implementing Obamacare in Rhode Island. Providence Journal reporter Felice Freyer, one of the panelists, asked Roberts a hot-button question about Obamacare, which calls for the creation of state health insurance exchanges where individuals who don’t have health insurance or are seeking an alternative to plans provided by their employers may buy their own coverage. Since World War II, employer-paid coverage has been a cornerstone of health care insurance in the United States. Any possibility that the cornerstone will crumble has been a major topic in the debate. The Obamacare exchange is scheduled to open for enrollees in Rhode Island Oct. 1. After that happens, Freyer wanted to know, might employers just cancel their own insurance -- in order to save money and trouble -- and fob off their employees on the exchange. In reply, Roberts pointed to ""Romneycare."" That is the seven-year-old health care insurance program in Massachusetts nicknamed for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and often cited as the model for Obamacare. ""They’ve seen employer-supported coverage increase in Massachusetts after [Romneycare] was implemented,"" Roberts declared. ""I think lots of people were worried [that employers might drop coverage] but it hasn’t been what has happened."" Are more Massachusetts employers providing coverage now than before ""Romneycare?"" First, a little background. Obamacare requires businesses with 50 or more employees to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. In Massachusetts, a penalty that applied to businesses with 11 or more employees was in force until July 1, when it was abolished in anticipation of the implementation of the Obamacare penalty. But then implementation of the federal employer mandate and accompanying penalty unexpectedly were delayed until 2015. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has warned employers in his state not to take advantage of the hiatus by dropping their insurance. A trip to the website of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Health Insurance Connector Authority, the agency that oversees Romneycare, showed that Roberts had her facts right. In 2001, well before Romneycare took effect, 69 percent of Massachusetts employers offered insurance, according to the Connector. As of 2010, four years after Romneycare was enacted, 77 percent offered insurance, the Connector says. Fresher data from another government body, the Center for Health Information and Analysis of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services, confirmed the trend. From 2005, the year before Romneycare was signed into law, through 2011, the percentage of employers offering insurance increased from 70 percent to 76 percent, according to a survey of employers. And a study by the independent Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, ""Massachusetts Health Care Reform: Six Years Later,"" found that employer coverage had not decreased. When we checked with Roberts’ office about the basis of her statement, her spokeswoman, Maria Tocco, referred us to the Health and Human Services survey, albeit from a companion report. Nationally, according to Massachusetts authorities, only 60 percent of employers offer health insurance. Asked why more Massachusetts employers offered insurance even though an alternative had been created, Jason Lefferts, the Connector director of communications, said the business community responded to a call to duty from government when health care reform was enacted. ""We saw great buy-in from the business community"" and an acceptance that health care is a shared responsibility of the individual, business and government, Lefferts said. ""There was a message that everyone was in this together."" The Massachusetts authorities went even further on the Connector website, to predict that as employment rebounds in their state, ""reliance on public sector insurance will decrease."" Lefferts said the business community’s track record makes that a safe prediction. Our ruling Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth H. Roberts said that Massachusetts has ""seen employer-supported coverage increase"" since ""Romneycare"" was implemented. Massachusetts officials have published figures that back her up. The judges rate her claim True.      ",[<zip object at 0x00000280979CE600>],/factchecks/2013/aug/04/elizabeth-roberts/theyve-seen-employer-supported-coverage-increase-m/

Democratic group says Abbott misspent $1 million-plus in grant funds targeting and harassing senior Texans helping others with mail-in ballots
","A pro-Democratic group says Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican aspirant for governor in 2014, misspent $1 million-plus bothering elderly Texans. The Lone Star Project said in a July 14, 2013, blog post, ""Just a few years ago, Abbott converted over $1 million in federal grant money intended for use to prosecute online sexual predators and other cyber crimes and instead used it to harass and prosecute senior citizens who were assisting other senior citizens in applying for mail-in ballots."" That's a familiar claim; the project said in a May 18, 2006, press release that Abbott and Gov. Rick Perry had decided to divert ""part of $1.4 million in federal funds."" Abbott aides countered that the grant-aided voter investigations were legitimate expenditures, in response to referrals. What's what? Grant spending aired before In 2006, Abbott touted his office’s efforts to prosecute and deter voter fraud and Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland recently told us by email that the initial grant aid helped the office carry out an array of initiatives from June 2005 through September 2006. Strickland sent a spreadsheet indicating too that the grant was renewed through September 2008. Ultimately, about $3.2 million was spent on multiple initiatives, the spreadsheet indicates, while Strickland told us $93,579 in grant funds ended up being spent investigating possible violations of election law. The amount of grant money spent on election-law cases has previously been publicized. A Nov. 13, 2009, Austin American-Statesman news story quoted the attorney general’s office as saying that about $93,000 in grant funds went toward voter investigations, with the rest of some $690,000 in costs covered by state funds, though total spending was expected to grow because cases were pending. At the time, 22 voter cases had ended with guilty pleas or verdicts, Abbott’s office said, and one had been dropped. By email, Angle pointed out that Abbott earlier ballyhooed much more spending against voter fraud. A Jan. 25, 2006, Abbott press release said the agency’s new Special Investigations Unit, poised to help local authorities identify, investigate and prosecute voter fraud offenses, was established with a $1.5 million grant from Perry’s office. Similarly, a March 1, 2006, Abbott release said officials in the agency’s unit, ""working through a $1.5 million grant from the governor’s office,"" had been visiting key counties to conduct voter fraud training for law officers. An Abbott commentary at the time had nearly identical language. Then again, the governor’s earlier grant announcement listed other priorities--not even specifying voter fraud. Perry’s Aug. 23, 2005, press release said $1,476,848 awarded under the federal Byrne Grant program would be spent on assisting local law enforcement agencies in investigations of cyber crimes, child pornography, organized crime, fugitives, criminal consumer fraud, public corruption and other criminal activities. Byrne grants noted for flexibility Amounts aside, did Abbott have permission to spend grant funds on voter investigations? By email, Angle conceded Byrne dollars could be spent investigating voter fraud, though he said the Lone Star Project is unaware of such aid being used that way in any other state. At the federal level, the National Center for Justice Planning, which teams the Bureau of Justice Assistance, U.S. Department of Justice and the National Criminal Justice Association, refers to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grant, which originated in 1968, as the nation’s ""cornerstone federal justice assistance program."" Byrne’s strength, the center says, lies in its flexibility with states and local communities permitted to spend the funds on areas including law enforcement, crime prevention and education. Separately, Strickland emailed us the attorney general’s June 1, 2005, grant application, which said the sought funds would enable additional staff to focus on Internet criminal investigations, fugitive apprehensions, criminal consumer fraud investigations and ""fraudulent voter and public corruption investigations."" The application also said: ""There seems to be a generally accepted method in which groups of campaign workers have gone door-to-door for years to help elderly or disabled voters obtain a mail-in-ballot, then the workers collect the voted ballots from the voters with intent to mail them outside of the presence of the voter. These investigations take several weeks or months to complete, as there are numerous documents to collect and analyze, and multiple witnesses."" Prosecutions as persecutions? Finally, did the state harass and prosecute senior citizens? Senior Texans were pursued in connection with a 2003 state law requiring individuals conducting absentee ballot campaigns to disclose certain information, including their names, if they handle a ballot or ballot application. According to an April 18, 2008, story in the liberal Texas Observer magazine, Willie Ray of Texarkana, 69, was indicted after she and her granddaughter, Jamillah Johnson, helped homebound senior citizens get absentee ballots and, once they were filled out, put them in the mail. In a Feb. 17, 2006, press release, Abbott said that Ray, a member of the Texarkana City Council, and Johnson were charged with illegally possessing and transporting ballots of several voters before the November 2004 elections. ""The integrity of our election process must be protected,"" Abbott said. The release also mentioned largely similar voter indictments in Reeves, Hardeman, Bee and Nueces Counties. A Jan. 31, 2008, Abbott press release described indictments of several Duval County residents, aged 55 to 71, for helping voters misrepresent themselves as disabled. The release said the helpers also did not identify themselves on the outside of ballot envelopes. The Observer and Dallas Morning News each referred to an incident described in a lawsuit joined by the Texas Democratic Party against the state. The Observer story said Fort Worth's Gloria Meeks, 69, was a community activist who helped homebound seniors vote by mail. Its story said, ""Meeks is in a nursing home after having a stroke, prompted in part, her friends say, by state police who investigated her--including spying on Meeks while she bathed--and then questioned her about helping"" others vote. According to the lawsuit, later settled, Meeks said she had seen two investigators ""peeping at her through her bathroom window"" while she was taking a bath on Aug. 10, 2006 and ""later learned that these two persons were investigators"" with the attorney general’s office. By email, Strickland said the agency denied  that  the investigators intentionally peeped. The agency’s legal response said the investigators were standing on Meeks’ porch when their attention ""was drawn to a nearby window because of movement from inside the window, and the investigators looked toward the window."" In a May 18, 2008, Morning News story, the newspaper said it had tallied 26 cases, largely involving mail-in ballots, that had been prosecuted by Abbott, all of them against Democrats and almost all involving blacks or Hispanics, with no revelations of ""large-scale"" voter fraud schemes with the potential to swing elections. In 18 cases, the newspaper said, the ""voters were eligible, votes were properly cast and no vote was changed -- but the people who collected the ballots for mailing were prosecuted. Eight cases, the story said, involved ineligible voters or manufactured votes: ""They include a woman who voted for her dead mother, another in which a Starr County man voted twice, and three South Texas women who used false addresses to get voter registration cards for people who did not exist."" By email, Strickland sent a roster showing agenc involvement from late 2005 through June 2013 in prosecuting individuals on election-law charges including alleged violations tied to carrying ballots for others. About 25 cases resolved from November 2005 through November 2008, the chart indicates, with 13 guilty pleas, three guilty jury verdicts, two ""nolo contendere"" pleas, five pre-trial diversions, one deferred adjudication and one dismissal. Most of the convictions related to possessing someone else’s ballot or carrier envelope. Strickland emailed another chart indicating that 23 election-law cases developed by state investigations were resolved and seven are pending. Angle said by email that the point of the claim holds. ""The entire process was intended to harass and intimidate minority senior voters,"" he said. Our ruling The Lone Star Project said Abbott ""converted over $1 million in federal grant money intended for use to prosecute online sexual predators and other cyber crimes and instead used it to harass and prosecute senior citizens who were assisting other senior citizens in applying for mail-in ballots."" Actually, less than $100,000 of a grant—less than one-fifteenth of it--was spent investigating alleged violations of election law. The grant aid also wasn't restricted, or necessarily intended for, other purposes. So there was no conversion. Senior citizens were pursued, but our sense is it’s an eye-of-the-beholder question whether the investigations were harassment. We rate this claim as False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C003EC0>],/factchecks/2013/aug/02/lone-star-project/democratic-group-says-abbott-misspent-1-million-pl/

Dan Patrick says the 2014-15 state budget “cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs.""
","In a video announcing his run for lieutenant governor June 27, 2013, state Sen. Dan Patrick said that border security is a federal responsibility but Texas’ problem, and the state shouldn’t budget less for it. ""This year’s budget, despite increasing nearly 9 percent, actually cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs,"" the Houston Republican said. ""It was one of the reasons I voted against the budget."" In a recent PolitiFact check, we found that state spending (aka general revenue) rose no more than 8.7 percent from 2012-13 to 2014-15. Did that include cuts to combating gangs and securing the border? Analysis showed us that wasn’t exactly so -- in fact, budgeted border spending rose about $118 million. Border security has been a fiscal priority for Gov. Rick Perry, who has urged state efforts to supplement federal border operations starting in 2005. In 2010, he said those efforts had decreased border crime 60 percent, a claim we rated as Pants on Fire largely because its basis was crime in rural areas only, excluding towns and cities. Texas’ border security efforts, according to an April 2013 issue brief from the Legislative Budget Board staff, began with state programs funded by federal grants in 2005-2007, followed by lawmakers signing off on $124 million in state spending from 2008-09 through 2012-13. State border operations are coordinated by the Governor's Office of Homeland Security within the Department of Public Safety, it said. The state created centers in the border area and Austin to gather intelligence, built a crime laboratory in Laredo, used software to map criminal activities in real time and coordinated federal, state, local and private law enforcement, the brief said, and also bought six aircraft, six patrol boats and 326 patrol vehicles. Patrick spokesman Logan Spence told us by email that Patrick’s claim referred to three specific categories of DPS spending in the biennial budget: ""organized crime,"" ""border security"" and ""local border security."" Spence emailed us summaries from the budget board, which advises lawmakers on state funding issues, giving the amounts appropriated for those categories in the past two budgets sent to Gov. Perry. The summaries, from Sept. 7, 2011, and May 20, 2013, showed all-funds spending, meaning state plus federal and other funds: ""Organized crime"" -- $17.4 million drop, from $134.6 million to $117.2 million. ""Border security"" plus ""local border security"" -- $6.1 million drop, from $89 million to $82.9 million. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us via email that those changes were attributable to funds being moved to different areas within the department, plus ""one-time big ticket items"" under border spending and revised estimates for items such as federal grants in the ""organized crime"" spending. Spence had also sent us budget board summaries that wrapped in border operations conducted under Texas Parks and Wildlife and Trusteed Programs in the Governor’s Office. Those summaries, from May 2011 and June 2013, indicated that all-funds border security spending in those programs plus the DPS ""border/""local border"" categories went from $219.5 million in 2012-13 to $94.1 million in 2014-15 -- indicating a drop of $128.1 million. Then again, the June 2013 summary also said ""additional funding is provided"" to DPS for border security above the $94.1 million total. Including that unspecified spending, the budget allocates more than $100 million to border security operations not spelled out in those estimates, we heard from a chief budget-writer and the staff of the board that advises lawmakers on spending issues Budget board staff spokesman John Barton told us via phone that by July 15, 2013, the board had estimated a total for border spending in all parts of DPS’ budget: $331.2 million in the 2014-15 budget. That total suggests an increase of $118.3 million over the agency’s revised 2012-13 border security budget total of $212.9 million. Vinger confirmed the amounts in the July 15 estimate were budgeted for DPS, offering no further comment. For another legislative perspective, we contacted a spokesman for Senate Finance Committee chairman Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands. Via email, Gary Scharrer asserted that as a committee member, Patrick would have known the wider scope of border spending and could have requested such numbers before his June campaign announcement. Scharrer said via email that according to Senate Finance Committee staff, border operations spending across all agencies in 2014-15 was $343.2 million, up $121.6 million from the previous budget. We weren’t able to learn what date that estimate was produced, but Scharrer said Patrick would have been aware that such spending was going into the budget. ""He would have been in the loop on border security budget discussions,"" Scharrer said. Noting the Senate gave the budget act its final approval on May 25, Scharrer said, ""The numbers were available"" to Patrick. ""Sen. Patrick could have checked with LBB or DPS for clarification – or verification –  before going public. Many members fact-check ahead of time,"" Scharrer said, adding with a note of humor that they do so ""to save themselves from PolitiFact sweeping in after them."" As to budgeted money to battle criminal gangs, Barton told us DPS’s ""organized crime"" category was not the only state money spent to fight gangs. However, he said, the budget board did not have an estimate of such a 2014-15 total. Spence said he stood by the information he sent us. ""People read those summaries and rely on those summaries as accurate data from the Legislative Budget Board,"" he said. Asked about the budget board staff’s July 15 estimate of $331.2 million border spending in DPS for 2014-15, Spence said, ""I think there’s a disagreement about what is border security spending."" Citing a couple of items mentioned in the July 15 estimate, Spence said, ""A raise for troopers is not border security spending. Police academies and all those things... If the budget says ‘Border security spending is this,’ then members of the committee and members of the Senate are going to rely on that."" Barton said all items in the estimate relate directly to border security. For instance, he said, the nearly $75 million in listed pay raises reflects money going to officers involved in border operations.  Our ruling Patrick said the 2014-15 state budget written by lawmakers and signed into law by Perry ""cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs."" Yet his cited figures drew from budget summaries that did not show all border spending. Budgeted border security funding in 2014-15 exceeds the total in the 2012-13 budget by about one third, while budgeted 2014-15 spending on battling gangs has yet to be fully calculated. It’s a PolitiFact principle not to hold people responsible for information that wasn’t available when they made their claims. In this instance, though, our sense is Patrick could at least have pinned down total border security funding before he spoke. The fact that anti-gang spending has still not been totaled leaves Patrick’s claim with a possible element of truth. We rate the full statement as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976AAF80>],/factchecks/2013/aug/02/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-2014-15-state-budget-cut-border-s/

Rep. Tom Cole says his NSA vote backed by entire Intelligence Committee
","Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., says he recently voted to keep a controversial National Security Agency data collection program in part because he trusts lawmakers who know it best. ""I'm going to go with the people that actually know the program and looked at it,"" he said. His position had bipartisan support, he explained on MSNBC’s Morning Joe: ""Every member in both parties who served on the Intelligence Committee voted in favor of this."" Did every Republican and Democrat privy to the committee’s classified briefings vote to keep the NSA program? Section 215 of the Patriot Act Lawmakers recently targeted the scope of the program authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which was thrown under bright lights by leaks in June from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. A secret court order published by the Guardian showed the government routinely collects metadata about Americans’ phone calls — such as phone numbers and times and lengths of conversations. (The administration says such data is only accessed under strict guidelines.) That was news to some lawmakers who assumed a narrower interpretation of U.S. Code that had been amended by Section 215. It allows for collection of records relevant to investigations of foreigners. Who would have thought that included data for every single domestic call placed by some major American communications companies? So last week, House lawmakers voted on two proposed amendments to a defense spending bill that sought to clarify or curtail the government’s use of Section 215. (The Senate's also considering measures to limit the program.) The Pompeo amendment, sponsored by an Intelligence Committee member, clarified no funds could be used by the NSA to store the content of a U.S. person’s electronic communications, but left the metadata program in place. It passed 409-12. The Amash amendment, which got more attention, refused funding to carry out any court order that didn’t restrict records collection to just those ""that pertain to a person who is the subject of an investigation."" One opponent called it ""an on/off switch for Section 215 of the Patriot Act."" It failed, 205-217. Cole explained his position on Morning Joe on July 30 — though he didn’t name the amendment he was talking about. ""This is a debate worth having,"" he said. ""It's an important debate, and it's not particularly a partisan debate. You know, the majority of Democrats actually voted with Rand Paul on this issue and against Barack Obama and their own leadership in the House. So the majority of Republicans actually supported the president's position."" Host Joe Scarborough asked: ""How did you vote on this one?"" Cole replied: ""I voted in favor of keeping the NSA program. I think we're going to review it and change it probably. But this would have ended it. And you're talking about — you know, we've stopped over 50 attacks. Every member in both parties who served on the Intelligence Committee voted in favor of this."" We assumed Cole was talking about the Amash amendment, and that he interpreted the votes against that amendment as de facto votes for the NSA program.

Cole's' office, however, claimed he was talking about the Pompeo amendment.

But that doesn't entirely make sense. Cole said the vote in question would ""have ended"" the NSA program, and the Pompeo amendment didn't do that. So how did the 21 members of the House Intelligence Committee vote? Every one of them supported the Pompeo amendment, which didn’t end bulk metadata collection, same as Cole. Almost every one of them opposed the Amash amendment, which would have removed funding for bulk metadata collection. (In this case a ""no"" vote functioned as a vote ""in favor of keeping the NSA program."") Cole’s ""no"" vote wasn’t shared by Rep. Ed Pastor, an Arizona Democrat. Pastor, an influential member of the House’s Progressive Caucus who generally stays out of the national news, didn’t speak out on the House floor, and declined to explain his vote to us. ""Mr. Pastor confirms that the roll call is accurate. He declined further comment,"" his spokeswoman said. His vote was the committee’s sole ""yes,"" among nine Democrats and 12 Republicans. Our ruling Cole told Morning Joe that when it comes to the NSA program, he’s going to vote with ""the people that actually know."" He said his support was shared by every member of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican or Democrat. He was close. One Arizona Democrat disagreed. We find his statement only Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D087C0>],/factchecks/2013/aug/02/tom-cole/rep-tom-cole-says-his-nsa-vote-backed-entire-intel/

Rick Scott 'increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double digits,' Florida Democratic Party says
","Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who grew up with working-class parents, paid for college by working at a doughnut shop he bought with a friend and with help from the G.I. Bill. Now a millionaire and a former hospital executive facing re-election next year, Scott has tried to channel the pain of Florida families trying to pay for college. In April, he vetoed the Legislature’s 3 percent tuition hike.   ""It’s ridiculous how much tuition has gone up in the past five years,"" Scott said. ""Families are struggling."" Is wealthy Scott now the savior of the ramen-noodle eating, penny-pinching college crowd? Not so fast, says the Florida Democratic Party. Don’t forget about the first two legislative sessions under Scott. In July, the Democrats unveiled a new website www.realrickscott.com. (Ads for the site have appeared on PolitiFact Florida.) The attack website accuses Scott of trying to hide his ""real record,"" including that he ""increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double digits."" We decided to do our homework on how higher education tuition has changed under Scott. The complicated way tuition is set First, here's some background about tuition. The Legislature sets base tuition. If there is no base tuition increase provided in the state budget, tuition goes up by the rate of inflation. Individual universities can ask the Florida Board of Governors for an extra increase known as the ""tuition differential."" Together, the base tuition and tuition differential can add up to no more than a 15 percent increase. Technically, it’s the Board of Governors, not Scott, that gets to vote on a tuition differential increase. But Scott appoints that board, and he has asked their opinions about tuition raises in interviews. Florida has 11 existing universities -- a new one, Florida Polytechnic, will start enrolling students in 2014. Florida also has 28 state colleges and community colleges. Those schools don’t need permission from the Board of Governors. Instead, the individual boards of state can generally approve tuition increases. Scott's actions on tuition Here we will focus on the part of tuition that Scott clearly has power over: the base tuition increase. Under Scott’s first approved budget in 2011, the base tuition for universities increased by 8 percent -- the same as the preceding two years under Gov. Charlie Crist. For state colleges, the increase was also 8 percent. In 2012, Scott vetoed a bill that would have allowed the University of Florida and Florida State University unlimited flexibility to raise tuition. The Legislature did not grant any base tuition increase for universities that year, but it structured the budget in such a way that universities were expected to seek that 15 percent tuition differential, the Tampa Bay Times reported. (In reality, those increases were all over the map.) For state colleges (again, separate from state  universities), the budget included a 5 percent tuition increase. So Scott didn’t have to sign a budget with a tuition hike -- even though schools received tuition increases that year from the Board of Governors. The Democrats arrive at their double-digit figure by adding the 8 percent in Scott’s first year to the 5 percent in Scott’s second year. But that 5 percent only applied to state colleges -- not universities. We asked the Florida Democratic Party why they included colleges and universities in the claim. Spokesman Joshua Karp noted that two other pages on their attack website specified ""college tuition"" only -- for example stating ""hiking college tuition by double digits.""   ""The distinction between colleges and universities is something very few papers make,"" he said. (Karp sent us a few articles in major newspapers that didn’t make it clear that the 5 percent only referred to colleges.) John Holdnak, chief financial and budget officer for the Florida College System, said he would not call the 8 percent increase one year followed by the 5 percent increase the second year a double-digit increase. ""The annual tuition growth is less than double digits,"" he said. (One page of the Democrats’ website specifies that the 13 percent is over two years.) Holdnak gave us this example: an employee who gets a 3 percent raise one year, a 3 percent the next year and a 4 percent raise the third year would not say he received a 10 percent raise. This year, Scott vetoed the 3 percent tuition increase and encouraged universities to forgo the 1.7 percent automatic increase -- a few schools found a way to offset that hike, for example by decreasing fees. Scott isn’t to blame for a law that requires the automatic increase. It’s worth noting that despite increases, Florida’s tuition remains among the lowest in the country. Tuition has risen largely in response to the drop-off in state funding. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said Scott ""increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double digits."" Democrats point to the base tuition increases of 8 percent in Scott’s first budget year and 5 percent in his second year. The state colleges did have those increases, but the universities only had the 8 percent hike -- not the 5 percent the next year. That line also didn’t specify a time period: that increase is over two years, not one. More recently, Scott has opposed additional tuition increases.

Barack Obama says this year has been the best start for private-sector job creation since 1999
","During a July 30, 2013, visit to an Amazon.com facility in Chattanooga, Tenn., President Barack Obama gave another in a series of speeches on the economy. At one point, Obama said, ""This year, we're off to our best private-sector jobs growth since 1999."" We decided to check his math. We looked at data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for private-sector employment to measure the change between December and the following June of every year since 1999. (June was the most recent month for which data was available when Obama gave his speech.) Here’s the summary:
  Year (endpoint) Change in private-sector jobs, December-June 2013 +1,234,000 2012 +1,146,000 2011 +1,209,000 2010 +344,000 2009 -3,876,000 2008 -861,000 2007 +688,000 2006 +1,109,000 2005 +1,211,000 2004 +1,111,000 2003 -366,000 2002 -531,000 2001 -773,000 2000 +953,000 1999 +1,296,000   As the chart shows, the total for 2013 is indeed the highest since 1999. However, we’ll take this opportunity to note a caveat that’s often overlooked in the discussion of employment statistics: The figures released by the BLS actually represent the midpoint in a range. BLS obtains these numbers through a survey of businesses and government agencies, and as with any survey, there’s a margin of sampling error. BLS told us that for private-sector employment figures, the standard margin of error for a six-month comparison of this sort is 106,370 jobs on either side. This means, for instance, that if the reported change in jobs is 1,000,000, the actual change is assumed to be somewhere within the range of 893,630 to 1,106,370 jobs. This point may seem esoteric, but it’s relevant for the comparison Obama’s making because several other years since 1999 have produced job increases very close to the gain of 1,234,000 during the first six months of 2013. In the three years noted in italics in the chart -- 2012, 2011 and 2005 -- the gain in private-sector jobs fell shy of the 2013 amount by fewer than 106,370. Such cases are analogous to an election poll with a margin of error of 3 percentage points that shows one candidate two points ahead of the other. Such races are deemed too close to call. So too, technically speaking, is the contest for which six-month period created the biggest gain in private-sector jobs -- 2013, 2012, 2011 or 2005. Of course, three of these four years came on Obama’s watch. One -- 2005 -- came under President George W. Bush. Our ruling Obama said, ""This year, we're off to our best private-sector jobs growth since 1999."" The official statistics show that more jobs were created in the first six months of 2013 than in any equivalent period going back to 1999, but it’s worth noting that three other years came very close to the amount gained in 2013 -- so close that they were within the survey’s margin of error. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097026100>],/factchecks/2013/aug/02/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-year-best-start-private-sector-j/

Educational levels generally make a difference in earnings
","Fox political commentator Bill O’Reilly waded into the national conversation on race with a rant last week about what he sees as lingering problems in the black community. During a ""Talking Points"" segment, the conservative white commentator took aim at the breakdown of the African-American family, drugs and the entertainment industry’s promotion of ""gangsta culture."" Then CNN anchor Don Lemon took O’Reilly’s commentary a step further. Lemon, in a response that has since gone viral, launched his own rant last weekend during an on-air ""No Talking Points"" segment. Lemon, who is black, outlined five points for African-Americans to fix their problems, a kind of free self-help session. They included: pull up your pants, respect where you live and finish school. Lemon threw out a couple of statistics to cement his points. So we decided to check out his numbers referenced in his education argument. ""You want to break the cycle of poverty?"" Lemon says in the rant. ""Stop telling kids they're acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English. A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year. Over the course of a career, a college grad will make nearly $1 million more than a high school graduate. That's a lot of money."" A lot of money, indeed. Enough money to warrant a check of the facts. The CNN anchor’s rant led immediately to a huge blowback from people across the country, and much of it unfolded on social media. Atlanta political insider-turned MSNBC contributor Goldie Taylor even referred to Lemon as a ""turncoat"" in a series of fiery Twitter posts. Lemon’s opinions are his own and not up for checking. PolitiFact looks at statements of purported fact, not opinions. But what of Lemon’s educational attainment stats? There are several sources that have examined Americans’ earnings by education level. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that weekly median annual earnings in 2012 for a high school dropout were $471; $652 for a high school graduate; and $1,066 for a college graduate with a bachelor’s degree. Multiplying those weekly figures by 52, and the annual earnings for a high school dropout were $24,492, compared with $33,904 for a high school graduate and $55,432 for a college graduate. The BLS data, last modified in May, is for people age 25 and over, and earnings are for full-time wage and salary workers. A study by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal economics think tank, found that the average hourly wage in 2012 for people without a high school diploma was $11.75, compared with $15.78 for high school graduates and $28.28 for college graduates. In 2012, the BLS reported that Americans at private, nonfarm companies worked an average of 34.5 hours per week. Do the math on those numbers, and high school dropouts earned $21,080 for the year; high school graduates, $28,309; and college graduates, $50,734. Several university and economic studies have used 2010 census data of median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers age 25-64. The data, released in 2011, found that non-high school graduates made $25,705; high school graduates, $35,035; and college graduates with a bachelor’s degree, $55,864. Over the course of a lifetime, a Georgetown University study found that high school graduates would make $1.3 million, while college graduates with a bachelor’s degree would make $2.3 million. The report, and others, note that occupation, gender, race and ethnicity can influence outcomes. Those influences, along with a tough economy, have caused some researchers to lower the lifetime gap to between $280,000 and $450,000. So, does Lemon’s claim pay off? Depending on what data is collected, how that data is collected and what data set you consider, Lemon’s claim could be correct, or at least within a few thousand dollars for each educational level. But use other data, and his claim could be off by several thousand dollars. Also of note, several factors -- including gender, occupation, age and the economy -- can influence annual and lifetime earnings for workers at all education levels. Still, his overall theme that higher educational attainment equals higher wages seems to be correct no matter which data set is considered.

Rick Kriseman says red light cameras change driver behavior, reduce most dangerous crashes
","Hopefuls for St. Petersburg mayor are divided on the city’s red light camera program. Mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford argued in her response to a Tampa Bay Times questionnaire that the city’s technology is flawed, the cost to appeal is ""prohibitively high"" and unfair, and the program should be stopped. Mayor Bill Foster, who pushed for the cameras, still supports them. Mayoral candidate Rick Kriseman aligns with Foster. ""I support them for the purposes of public safety, not as a revenue generator. ... The fact is that red light cameras change driver behavior and cut down on the most dangerous types of accidents,"" Kriseman wrote. We wanted to know if Kriseman’s point is accurate. St. Petersburg’s program The cameras seem to be just about everywhere. St. Petersburg is one of about 70 municipalities in Florida with red light cameras, along with five other cities in Pinellas County, Tampa, Miami, Clearwater and Orlando. About half of U.S. states have authorized the technology in the past two decades. The St. Petersburg program started in fall 2011 with cameras at 10 intersections. Tickets for running a red light are $158. (Locations here.) Already the cameras have been at the brink of wipeout, having survived a few City Council votes that would effectively end the program. A number of municipalities have had buyer’s remorse. In Houston, a voter referendum killed the program. Collier County (Fla.) commissioners voted to kill their program in December 2012 because they did not find evidence that the cameras reduced accidents. Los Angeles officials ended the program there after realizing it was difficult to pursue violators who ignored their tickets. An audit found the cameras did not improve public safety. Still, other cities tout benefits. More than a year in, the question remains for St. Pete: Are the cameras reducing the most dangerous crashes? A consultant’s performance report in December 2012 concluded that the red light crash rate fell by 31 percent at St. Petersburg traffic approaches with cameras from November 2011 to October 2012, compared to the three-year average preceding it. Crashes from red light running resulting in injury fell by 47 percent compared to the three-year average preceding the program, the consultants found. But the lengthy report omitted facts later reported by the Tampa Bay Times, such as the fact that rear-end wrecks at intersections with red light cameras jumped 44 percent and overall crashes at those intersections increased 10 percent compared to the previous year. Interpretations all depend on how you dice the data, said Michael Frederick, the city’s transportation manager. The consultant compared the first year of traffic data with a three-year average instead of data just for the year before. A more in-depth review is expected after three years with the cameras, he said. Not included in the report? Fatal crashes. Frederick said that’s because there were none in the year examined. University of South Florida researchers found that St. Pete averaged about one fatal crash a year in the years before the cameras went up. Many studies, many findings Both sides of the camera debate tout a plethora of research espousing their opinions. Kriseman’s campaign manager said he was talking about the effect of red light cameras in general on motorist behavior and dangerous crashes. The campaign sent materials from national pro-camera groups, the National Coalition for Safer Roads and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (funded by auto insurance companies), in addition to a study that appeared in The Journal of Trauma in 2010. We’ll sum up that research, as well as a couple others. • The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety asserts red light cameras reduce the most dangerous crashes, pointing to 2011 in-house research that found large cities with red light cameras between 2004-08 saw a 24 percent reduction in fatal red light running crashes compared to those without. The institute also points to a 2002 study in California, showing significant declines in injury crashes and right-angle injury crashes across the city after some intersections got cameras. • The Journal of Trauma study examined driver behavior for nine months at a dangerous intersection in a New Orleans suburb. The report concluded the cameras decreased the rate of red-light running and had a ""lasting effect on driver behavior."" The study, however, said the cameras did not seem to prevent collisions at the intersection, recommending more studies over more time. • The Texas Transportation Institute of Texas A&M University examined crash records at 275 intersections in Texas cities with red light cameras. The researchers concluded that the most severe crashes, those at right angles, dropped 32 percent. Another study is planned this fall to examine what happened to crashes in cities that took down their red light cameras. • A 2004 study by the Urban Transit Institute at North Carolina A&T State University concluded no demonstrable safety benefit from red light cameras. ""There isn’t a conclusive study that would say that in all circumstances that red light cameras are going to provide the safety benefits that they’re looking at,"" said Jason Bittner, director of USF’s Center for Urban Transportation Research. ""It’s kind of on a case-by-case basis."" More research Three USF researchers reviewed seven red light camera studies held up by the federal government as the best designed studies and found none concluded a statistical safety benefit from the cameras. They noted several government-funded studies actually stated injury or severe crashes increased with the cameras, according to their 2011 paper in Florida Public Health Review.  The professors, who became interested in the cameras years ago because a portion of the revenue goes to trauma center hospitals, pointed out in 2011 that red light cameras often have a ""double effect"" on motorists: They are put at higher risk for fines and rear-end crashes. The researchers objected to the IIHS California study and others for not using scientific research methods, and have faulted other research for not taking into account traffic trends, such as the fact that the state has been seeing a decrease in red light running, said Barbara Langland Orban, a USF health policy professor. The professors agree that red light cameras influence driver behavior -- just not for the better (though they had not seen studies of psychological effects of the cameras on drivers). ""There’s a difference between a driver being more aware and a driver being more skittish,"" said Etienne Pracht, a USF professor of health care economics. We turned to another local camera critic. Matt Florell, who runs StPeteCameras.org, analyzed more than 20 North American red light camera studies published in academic journals or cited by government agencies and determined most of them showed an increase in total crashes with red light cameras installed. In the 15 studies that measured crashes with injury, there was an increase of 21 percent, Florell found. Florell is highly critical of the city’s one-year report, saying it cherry-picks statistics, lacks raw numbers and makes unproven assumptions. Our ruling Kriseman’s point is not new: Many supporters of red light cameras tout, as he did, that benefits include changed motorist behavior and reducing the most dangerous kind of crashes. We found some studies that say cameras changed motorist behavior -- by either putting them on high alert or teaching them a lesson. But whether they truly ""cut down on the most dangerous types of accidents"" remains a matter of much debate. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B71780>],/factchecks/2013/aug/01/rick-kriseman/rick-kriseman-says-red-light-cameras-change-driver/

Marco Rubio says union for IRS workers is 'begging' to be let out of Obamacare
","During a recent interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., picked up a talking point that had been widely repeated in the conservative blogosphere about workers at the Internal Revenue Service wanting to get out of Obamacare. Referring to President Barack Obama’s health care law, Rubio said, ""Even the employees’ union for the IRS -- the very people in charge of enforcing this law -- are begging to be let out from under this law."" Since federal-employee unions tend to be some of Obama’s staunchest supporters, it would be unusual if the National Treasury Employees Union had turned against the president over his signature legislative accomplishment. Is that really what happened? There’s a kernel of truth here, but the episode is considerably more nuanced than Rubio, or most of the other commentators, let on. The union wasn’t lobbying against Obamacare per se, but rather against a bill sponsored by one of the law’s opponents that would change how Obamacare operates. (You can read the union’s form letter here.) This is a complicated tale, so we’ll start at the beginning. When the health care law was being written in 2009 and 2010, Republicans proposed requiring lawmakers and their staffers to obtain insurance through the exchanges, arguing that if the law was good enough for ordinary Americans, then it was good enough for the people in Congress who wrote the law. Presumably fearing a public backlash if they refused, Democrats accepted the language, and it became part of the law. But as the New York Times recently put it, the provision ""has been a headache for many in Congress ever since."" That’s because the law does not include an explicit mechanism to allow the federal government to pay its employer share of congressional employees’ health insurance if they use the exchanges. For most Americans with employer-based insurance, including government employees, the employer pays a majority of the cost of insurance, lessening the financial burden for employees. Unless a fix can be found, congressional employees will have to foot the entire cost of their health insurance when buying insurance on the exchange -- a financial hit that could go well into the thousands of dollars. Despite longstanding concerns about the provision’s impact, neither Congress nor the administration has yet come up with a workable solution, although the administration promises action in time for the opening of the exchanges this fall. However, after word leaked to Politico in April that congressional leaders in both parties were ""engaged in high-level, confidential talks"" to rescind the provision, U.S. Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., decided to offer a bill that would expand the mandate to use the exchanges beyond Congress to the president, vice president and all federal employees. As of this writing, the bill had not advanced to a committee hearing. Still, the fact that the bill was introduced at all set off alarm bells at the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 employees in 31 federal agencies and departments. That includes the IRS, which has a role in enforcing the tax penalties for failing to secure health coverage. This is why the union has urged its members to oppose Camp’s bill. In a statement to PolitiFact, union president Colleen M. Kelley called Rubio’s claim ""a misrepresentation."" She said the union’s beef is not with Obamacare itself, and the episode does not represent a policy rift between the union and Obama. Rather, the union is concerned that an opponent of Obamacare wants to change the law, effectively uprooting 150,000 of its members from their existing plans and potentially leaving them to pay the entire cost of their health insurance without employer assistance. When we checked with health policy experts, most said they don’t blame Rubio for seizing on a juicy dispute among longtime allies, but they agreed that the actual story is a lot more complicated. Obama and his allies created a system in which most Americans -- at least three quarters -- who had insurance would remain on their existing plans and would see few if any disruptions from the new law. The exchanges were created to provide a marketplace for Americans who lack insurance entirely or have to buy insurance on their own. By contrast, Camp’s bill would force federal employees out of their longstanding coverage and into a new system. An added irony is that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is widely considered a key model for the exchanges themselves. Under the program, federal employees under the age of 65 can choose among a variety of health insurance offerings, just as people will be able to do under the exchanges. In 2003, the conservative Heritage Foundation published a paper touting the program as a model for market-based health care reform. ""The union is correct that the primary purpose of the ACA is to provide a marketplace for the sale of health insurance for those who do not have such coverage, which would of course exclude IRS and other government employees,"" said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. In fact, she said, ""Federal employees, unlike most other employees, have been offered a wide variety of plans through the FEHBP program and are probably the least likely to want to leave their present"" coverage. Our ruling Rubio said that ""even the employees’ union for the IRS -- the very people in charge of enforcing this law -- are begging to be let out from under this law."" He has a point that the National Treasury Employees Union has asked its members to oppose efforts to force its members into the exchanges created by Obama’s health care law. But he ignores a lot of context that would give a listener a different impression. The union’s quarrel is not with Obamacare itself, but rather with efforts by the law’s opponents to uproot federal employees from their longstanding health plans, a change the union views as punitive. By contrast, Obamacare was written to keep as many Americans as possible on their existing insurance plans, with the exchanges envisioned as a way for people without insurance or with inadequate insurance to purchase a plan. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AF5540>],/factchecks/2013/aug/01/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-union-irs-workers-begging-be-let-/
"['Oregon', 'Taxes', 'Kari Chisholm']","
Is Oregon alone in having a political tax credit?
","One of the more quirky aspects of Oregon Tax Law is a little provision that lets folks donate $50 to a political causes -- $100 per couple -- and get a tax credit back on their next return. An actual credit, too, none of that deduction stuff. The law has been around since 1969, according to a report by the Oregon Secretary of State’s office. The provision, however, was up for expiration at the end of this year and some were calling for the Legislature to let it die as lawmakers looked for savings. The Oregonian’s own editorial board urged lawmakers to kill the credit: ""There's nothing wrong with contributing money -- as much as you want -- to political committees and candidates who share your views. Even during the best of times, however, there's no compelling reason for the state to subsidize people's political activities through the use of an income tax credit."" As it turned out, though, the provision -- with one change that we’ll get to later -- managed to survive by piggybacking on a larger tax bill. Kari Chisholm, the man behind the left-leaning political blog Blue Oregon, was explaining the tax break’s good luck in an interview on ""Carl in the Morning,"" a progressive internet talk radio show. ""Tucked deep into that bill was an extension of the Oregon political tax credit, something I think is an extraordinary expression of our Democracy in Oregon that every state should have and no other state does. ""If you give $50 to a political campaign or a political organization of your choice then you get 50 bucks off your taxes the following year."" Naturally, the superlative caught our attention. Was Oregon really the only state with such a provision? We called the National Council for State Legislatures first to see if they had any experts on hand. Mandy Rafool, who works with their financial affairs program, got back to us immediately via email. ""I think it is unusual for states to offer credits for these contributions, although there are a few that offer them (Ohio and Oregon come to mind)."" Rafool then pointed us toward a January 2013 study by the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau that looked at every state’s tax code and teased out the various rates, credits and exemptions in each. We did a quick look through the study and found that three other states, aside from Oregon, offered a political contribution credit: Ohio, Virginia and Arkansas. Now each state’s law varies some, and none of them is quite as expansive as Oregon’s. Arkansas’ law is the closest, but it doesn’t allow the credit for federal offices, where as Oregon’s does so long as the candidate appears on a state ballot. Meanwhile, Ohio limits its credits to donations made toward statewide offices and races for the legislature. Virginia’s is fairly strict as well. That state only gives credits for donations made during an election year and even then it offers half of what the other states do, $25 per person or $50 per couple. Oregon’s law, relatively speaking, is pretty loose. It can be applied to donations made, at any time, to political parties, state political action committees and any candidate -- federal, state or local -- that appears on an Oregon ballot. For as expansive as the credit is, though, it turns out it doesn’t get much use. The credit gets claimed most often during presidential election years, according to the Secretary of State’s office, but even at it’s peak, only about 7.8 percent of filers took advantage. For the 2011-13 biennium, the estimated cost to the Oregon’s bottom line was about $15 million. For the 2013-15 cycle, the state is expected to pay out just less than $7 million. Also worth a note: People making more than $77,000 a year account for 58 percent of those using the credit. That last fact may change moving forward. Remember that tweak to the credit we mentioned in passing? Well, when lawmakers re-approved the measure, they took the perk away for singles with adjusted gross incomes above $100,000 and joint filers above $200,000. All that aside, we asked Chisholm to weigh in on what we’d found. Initially, he was unaware the other three states gave tax credits for political contributions. After some research, he pointed out, as we have, that Oregon’s tax credit is more generous than the other three states. ""While it's true that three other states have a political contribution tax credit -- and they are to be hailed for their forward thinking! -- it's also true that Oregon provides donors with the greatest possible choice about where to direct their donations,"" Chisholm wrote in an email. ""And that, truly is ‘an extraordinary expression of our democracy in Oregon that every state should have and no other state does.’"" He may be right, but his initial comments were not so specific. He said on the radio show that Oregon was the only state to offer a political tax credit. Had he said specifically that Oregon offered the most expansive political tax credit, or some similar qualifier, we’d be inclined to give him a higher rating. But as it stands, he used a superlative that just doesn’t stand up under scrutiny. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097071F40>],/factchecks/2013/aug/01/kari-chisholm/oregon-alone-having-political-tax-credit/
"['Population', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Tom Pauken']","
Tom Pauken says recent state budgets have greatly outrun inflation and population growth
","Gubernatorial candidate Tom Pauken of Port Aransas says that unlike ruling Republicans, he knows how to be tough on spending. In an Austin American-Statesman oped column posted online July 25, 2013, Pauken wrote: ""There are a number of areas where I differ with the direction that Texas is headed. Our recent state budgets have far exceeded population and inflation growth. ...I will veto any budget which exceeds that criteria."" We’ll take that as Pauken’s promise. And have recent state budgets ""far exceeded"" inflation and population growth? Pauken’s campaign spokesman, Joe Gimenez, told us by email that Pauken based his claim on a June 7, 2013, Wall Street Journal editorial stating that Texas lawmakers this year agreed to increase spending by a whopping 26 percent, per research by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. We spotted flaws in the foundation’s analysis while recently rating as Mostly True a counter-claim by Gov. Rick Perry that the 2014-15 budget he signed into law did not outpace projected population and inflation growth. The foundation did not contrast the latest two-year budgets. Instead, it compared spending approved by lawmakers in 2013 for the rest of this fiscal year plus spending budgeted for two more years to spending approved by lawmakers and Perry in 2011. For our part, we concluded that general revenue, or state, spending is budgeted to increase no more than 8.7 percent through August 2015. That is less than a 9.85 percent increase in population and inflation projection embraced by legislative leaders before the 2013 session, though officials also have mulled lower population growth/inflation predictions. Most authorities agree it makes sense to focus on general revenue because it’s directly under the Legislature’s control -- it comes from taxes and fees set by the state, not the federal government, and how such revenue is spent also is not controlled by dedications in the Texas Constitution. If the 2014-15 budget isn’t expected to outpace population growth/inflation, what of recent budgets? The latest Fiscal Size-Up report from the advisory Legislative Budget Board, issued in January 2012, includes a chart suggesting that ""all funds"" spending usually exceeded population and inflation growth from 2002-03 through 2012-13. However, the report’s Figure 22 indicates, general revenue spending usually ran short of population and inflation growth. Specifically, spending of all funds adjusted for population and inflation growth increased as little as 0.4 percent (from 2002-03 to 2004-05) to as much as 9.9 percent (from 2006-07 to 2008-09). All spending adjusted for population and inflation growth went down by nearly 15 percent in 2012-13, according to the chart. By telephone, though, budget board staff spokesman John Barton cautioned that legislative actions in 2013  will soon result in updates to the 2012-13 spending totals, changing the percentage growth. According to the report’s chart, state spending alone, adjusted for inflation and population growth, went up 2.5 percent from 2004-05 to 2006-07 and 10.8 percent from 2006-07 to 2008-09. Conversely, state spending adjusted for population and inflation decreased in four recent budgets: 2002-03 (down 0.3 percent); 2004-05 (down 9.6 percent); 2010-11 (down 5.9 percent); and 2012-13 (down 8.4 percent). The public policy foundation has said that by its calculations, state appropriations have greatly outpaced population growth plus inflation. When its conclusions were aired in 2012, though, the Statesman said in a Nov. 15, 2012, news story that the budget board said the foundation was inflating spending growth by starting its count in 1990, the year before the state’s last major tax increase took effect. The story quoted the budget board as saying that Texas' total budget had increased 176 percent over two decades, but ""that number drops to an average rate of 1.5 percent per budget biennium when adjusted for population growth and inflation. In fact, when federal dollars are taken out of the equation, the adjusted state spending has decreased by 2.6 percent over the same period of time, according to a budget board analysis."" We asked Lori Taylor, an associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service and an adjunct associate professor in Texas A&M University's Department of Economics, to pinpoint distinctions between the calculations of the foundation and budget board. By email, Taylor said the biggest difference lies ""in the way the two sources adjust for population growth. Although people who want to make a political point do it all the time, you shouldn’t just add the inflation rate and the population growth rate and call that the baseline. You should calculate the expenditures per capita and then apply an inflation adjustment like the"" Consumer Price Index ""to get to the real (i.e. inflation-adjusted) growth in spending."" She said if this approach is taken with the foundation figures, the long-term results align with the budget board’s math. Talmadge Heflin, director of the foundation’s Center for Fiscal Policy, had no objections to Taylor’s math, but stood by the foundation’s approach. ""Different chefs cook differently,"" he said by phone. Our ruling Pauken said recent state budgets have far exceeded population and inflation growth. Spending of all funds, which folds in federal aid, exceeded population and inflation growth in five of six recent Texas budgets. Adjusted for those factors, the two-year budgets went up as little as 0.4 percent to nearly 10 percent. And while total spending trailed population growth/inflation in 2012-13, that conclusion could change once number-crunchers account for final spending decisions by the 2013 Legislature. In contrast, state spending alone, over which lawmakers have the most direct control, trailed population growth and inflation in four of the six two-year budgets from 2002-03 through 2012-13--and it’s not expected to exceed inflation/population growth through August 2015.

Reid says sequester has already cost 1.6 million jobs
","As discussions over the future of the federal budget grind forward, both Democrats and Republicans talk about replacing the sequester -- across-the-board budget cuts hitting much of the federal government --  with something more targeted. So far, the two sides have found little common ground. For their part, the Democrats are eager to highlight the harm sequestration causes. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters this week he was disappointed with what he sees as GOP intransigence. ""Let them do whatever they want to do,"" Reid said. ""Talk to the president. My office is always open. I'm anxious to do anything. The sequestration to this point, we have already lost 1.6 million jobs."" That seemed like a pretty big number for an economy that has added about 1.2 million jobs in the past six months. We emailed Reid’s office to learn the source behind his statement. We did not hear back. Under the rules of sequestration, the government will cut about $85 billion in spending by the end of this fiscal year. Setting aside long-term consequences to the federal debt, putting money into the economy does create jobs and the reverse is also true - less money leads to fewer jobs in the short run. We asked Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a private research group, what he thought of Reid’s number. His answer was brief. ""I have no way of evaluating this at all, there is no official count of job losses due to the sequester,"" Shepherdson said. Sal Guatieri, vice president at BMO Capital Markets, another economics research group, also said he had no estimate.""It is difficult to calculate both the direct and indirect effects,"" Guatieri said. Back in February, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that sequestration would reduce the number of jobs by 750,000 by the end of the year.  That is about half the figure Reid used, and in any event, we are not yet at the end of the year. Reid said we have already lost 1.6 million jobs because of sequestration. The source of Reid’s number seems to be a CBO letter to Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who asked what would happen if the sequestration were canceled for the rest of this year and 2014. The CBO said that would increase spending by $14 billion in 2013 and about $90 billion the next year. According to its model, this would boost employment by anywhere between 300,000 to 1.6 million. That is a forecast for what would happen in the future, 2014, not an estimate of the sequester’s current impact. While the number of jobs would rise, the letter also cautions that ""if the spending reductions under current law were reversed, that policy would lead to greater federal debt, which would eventually reduce the nation’s output and income below what would occur under current law."" Our ruling Reid said that sequestration has already led to the loss of 1.6 million jobs. There is no official estimate of the current impact of the sequester, and Reid's office provided no proof for the claim. The figure Reid seemed to rely on is a projection of the number of jobs that might be created if Congress put the sequester on hold and spent about $100 billion more than is currently planned. And from that forecast, Reid appears to have used the high end. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097071C00>],/factchecks/2013/aug/01/harry-reid/reid-says-sequester-has-already-cost-16-million-jo/
