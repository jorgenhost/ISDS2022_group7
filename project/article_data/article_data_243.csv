Does NC have the 5th highest health insurance premiums?
","Americans spend more on health care than comparable countries, according to a recent analysis. So it’s probably no surprise that the Pew Research Center found health care to be a top concern of voters, or that North Carolina politicians are talking about it ahead of the midterms. This November, Democrats hope to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature. Among them is D. Cole Phelps, an attorney running for state Senate in northeastern North Carolina’s District 1 against Republican state Rep. Bob Steinburg. On Labor Day, Phelps claimed in a Facebook post that health care premiums in North Carolina are among the most expensive in the country. ""Health care premiums in North Carolina are now among the five highest states in the country — and rural health care is struggling,"" Phelps posted on Sept. 1. ""Our opponent is protecting insurance company profits — not his constituents. As your state senator, I will fight for every person in Senate District One, including people with pre-existing conditions."" Are health insurance premiums in North Carolina higher than those in 45 other states? PolitiFact reached out to Phelps for the source of his information. To support his claim, Phelps cited a recent WalletHub story, ""The Best and Worst States for Healthcare."" WalletHub, which looked at all 50 states and Washington, D.C., ranked North Carolina’s health care system 47th for overall care. The Tar Heel State ranked 45th for average monthly insurance premiums. But there’s a key piece of information that’s buried in the WalletHub story and that Phelps doesn’t mention in his Facebook post: WalletHub only looked at health care plans through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. It didn’t take into account premiums for insurance plans acquired through employers. More than 55 percent of Americans have employer-based health insurance plans, according to 2016 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau. In North Carolina, employer-based plans covered 52 percent of all non-Medicare recipients during 2016, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health analysis organization. So, with that in mind, we wondered whether North Carolinians are paying some of the highest premiums for health insurance plans across the board. Here’s what we found for both customers in the ACA markets as well as on employer-sponsored plans. True, for ACA premiums When it comes to premiums for people with plans through the Affordable Care Act, Kaiser found that North Carolina had the seventh-highest average benchmark premiums in 2018. In 2017, NC had the second-highest. More than 478,000 people enrolled in such plans in 2018, KFF reports. However, the average benchmark isn’t an accurate reflection of what most customers pay, said Craig Palosky, KFF communications director. Though the benchmark shows the full sticker price, it’s ""not what people who get tax credits would end up paying,"" Palosky said. "" The distinction is important because the vast majority of marketplace customers do get tax credits – 87 percent nationally and 94 percent in North Carolina."" The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known as CMS, is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. David Anderson, a research associate for the Duke University Center for Health Policy, noted that the CMS risk adjustment formula found high average premiums in NC for 2017. At $501 a month, North Carolina in 2017 had the fourth-highest average premium in the individual market, Anderson noted. Erik Wengle, a research analyst for the Urban Institute Health Policy Center, said premiums for North Carolina’s most popular ACA plans are ""frequently"" among the highest in the country. North Carolina’s silver and gold ACA plans were both the fifth-most expensive in the country, he said. ""We’ve found that competition is a large driver associated with lower premiums. NC hasn’t had as robust competition as other states,"" Wengle said. Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only insurer to offer ACA plans in all 100 NC counties, while Cigna offers plans in Wake, Johnston, Orange, Chatham and Nash counties. Another insurer, Centene, is expected to enter the Wake and Durham markets next year. Not true for employer-based insurance While North Carolina’s government-subsidized plans are on the expensive side, PolitiFact couldn’t find any evidence that NC’s non-ACA premiums are among the highest in the country. Kaiser examines employer insurance data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which collects data from insurance providers and is part of the U.S Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. KFF statistics from 2016 (the most recent year available) show that the average annual premium for a single employee was $5,717 — one of the lowest averages in the country. Add a ""plus one"" (spouse or child) to the employee’s coverage, and North Carolina still had one of the lowest average premiums in the U.S. Meanwhile, KFF found that premiums for employer-based family plans in NC were middle-of-the-road. Statistics from the 2017 MEPS show that the average employer-plan premium for an employee in North Carolina is slightly below the national average. For those plans, the annual North Carolina average was $6,348 a year while the national average was $6,368. So Phelps’ claim appears to be true for about 520,000 of North Carolinians on an ACA plan, according to CMS. Going by the latest Census estimates, that’s only 5 percent of North Carolina’s population. Our ruling Phelps said health insurance premiums in North Carolina ""are now among the five highest states in the country."" He has a point when it comes to premiums for ACA plans. Those plans, however, only affect a fraction of North Carolina’s population. Millions of North Carolinians have plans on the private market, and data show that private plans in NC aren’t among the most expensive in the country. On balance, we rate Phelps’ claim Mostly False.

In Arizona, McSally falsely claims Sinema backed bill encouraging child trafficking
","The federal government’s separation of children from their parents as they arrived at the southwest border is pivotal in Arizona’s Senate race. Republican U.S. Rep. Martha McSally said in a Sept. 16 Fox News interview that her party was working on a bill to enforce the laws and keep families together. She claimed that her Democratic opponent in the Senate race, U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, in contrast supported a bill that encouraged child trafficking. ""My opponent and every Democrat got on a bill that essentially says if you cross the border illegally, and you have a kid with you and you commit a crime, another crime within 100 miles of the border, you can’t be arrested,"" McSally said. ""This is essentially encouraging child trafficking and that’s what my opponent supported."" McSally’s campaign told us she’s referring to the Keep Families Together Act, co-sponsored by nearly all Democrats, including Sinema. Did the Sinema-backed bill enable or encourage child trafficking? Not according to several immigration experts and researchers who study human trafficking. They said the bill is about keeping families together and that it includes safeguards against trafficking. U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., introduced the Keep Families Together Act in June amid calls for President Donald Trump’s administration to end a policy leading to the separation of immigrant families. Nadler’s proposal would prohibit the Department of Homeland Security, Justice Department, and Health and Human Services from removing a child (under 18 years old and without permanent immigration status) from his or her parent or legal guardian, at or near the port of entry, or within 100 miles of the U.S. border. However, the bill lays out several circumstances in which border officials can separate children. A child could be removed if: • the child is a victim of trafficking or is at significant risk of becoming a victim of trafficking; • there is a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent or legal guardian of the child; and • the child is in danger of abuse or neglect at the hands of the parent or legal guardian, or is a danger to themselves or others. If a child is removed, an independent child welfare expert licensed by the state or county where the separation happened has to authorize it within 48 hours. If not authorized, families are reunited. (Experts said child welfare is regulated by states.) The bill also gives state courts and state or county child welfare agencies their own authority to separate a child from a parent or legal guardian, if it’s in the child’s best interest. McSally said that the proposal prevented the arrest of people who came with children and committed ""another crime within 100 miles of the border."" But the bill doesn’t say that. The bill says asylum seekers may not be prosecuted for immigration law violations until their asylum application is adjudicated. Under current law, asylum seekers must be in the United States to request the protection. They can apply for it even if they entered the country illegally. Nadler’s measure calls for periodic reports on separations. The reports would need to include whether an adult was charged with a crime, the type of crime, whether that charge was prosecuted and the outcome. Sinema’s campaign said the bill would keep families together while removing them from potential trafficking situations. The bill is unlikely to pass so long as Republicans control the U.S. House. The bill diminishes federal enforcement and empowers ""state government determinations that would likely happen well after the point of apprehension and detention on a federal level,"" said Torunn Sinclair, a spokeswoman for McSally’s campaign. Sinclair also argued that the bill incentivizes traffickers to claim children as their own. While it may not be easy to determine in some cases whether an adult is the parent of a child, border officials who come in contact with them are trained to figure that out, said David Kyle, associate professor of sociology at University of California-Davis. The onus remains on parents to prove a relationship, Kyle said. ""No matter how the law is written, law enforcement officials have laws they can invoke if there is a suspicion that the child is not with their legal guardian or parent,"" Kyle said. ""I don't think anything in the bill would undercut those laws and clearly supports exceptions based on those suspicions."" The part of the bill saying an ""independent child welfare expert"" has to authorize separations within 48 hours raises questions regarding the practical implementation of the bill, Kyle said. Still, ""on the face of it, I don't see the bill facilitating child trafficking,"" Kyle said. Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, an associate professor and director of the Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention Research at Arizona State University, also doesn't see the bill as encouraging child trafficking. ""This is much less to do with sexual exploitation and more to do with separating families,"" she said. McSally said Sinema supported a bill that encourages child trafficking. Sinema co-sponsored a bill to limit the separation of immigrant families arriving at U.S. borders. McSally’s team said the bill reduces federal authority and incentivizes traffickers to claim children as their own. However, the bill says a child can be separated if federal immigration officials believe that the child is being trafficked or faces that risk. Separation can also take place if there’s a strong likelihood that a child and adult are not related. Under the bill, a state or county child welfare expert has to authorize a separation within 48 hours. It also gives state courts and agencies their own ability to separate a child from an adult, especially if the child’s safety is at risk. Immigration and human trafficking researchers disagree with McSally’s assessment of the bill. We rate McSally’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A381F40>],/factchecks/2018/oct/02/martha-mcsally/did-kyrsten-sinema-support-bill-encouraging-child-/

GOP super PAC ad skips over Jacky Rosen's yes vote on criminal immigrant bill
","A Republican super PAC ad faults Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen for failing to take a tough line on criminals who try to sneak across the border. The $1.3 million ad buy from the Senate Leadership Fund is on the air and on the web statewide in Nevada’s U.S. Senate race. The ad opens with images of MS-13 gang members. The violent criminal organization runs rampant in El Salvador and is a threat in communities across the United States. ""MS-13 violent gang members,"" a narrator says. ""They exploit immigration loopholes and commit vicious crimes in the U.S. Jacky Rosen, she voted against Kate’s Law, which would close immigration loopholes and help stop criminal illegal immigrants from re-entering the U.S."" The words ""Rosen voted against stopping criminals from re-entering the U.S.,"" play across the screen. We gave it a fact-check. Kate’s Law came after 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle died in San Francisco from a shot by a Mexican national with seven felony convictions who had been deported five times. The tragic death in 2015 inflamed the debate over immigration and sanctuary cities. In June 2017, a group of four House members introduced Kate’s Law. The bill imposed stricter penalties on people who had been deported or sent back before and tried to sneak back. Someone with three misdemeanors on their record, or a felony, could face up to 10 years behind bars. Those who had served time in an American jail faced ever increasing penalties, depending on the length of the original sentence. For a two-and-half year sentence, the maximum was 15 years. For a five-year sentence, the maximum was 20 years. And for the worst crimes, such as murder or rape, the maximum went to 25 years. ""It is already a federal crime to enter the United States without the federal government’s permission,"" said César Hernández, associate professor of law at the University of Denver. ""Right now, the maximum prison sentence is 20 years. Kate’s Law would increase that to 25 years, but only for people with prior convictions for a small set of serious crimes."" Kate’s Law passed the House by a 257-167 vote in June 2017 but died in the Senate. Rosen voted against it. Kate’s Law targeted repeat immigration offenders and created ever more stringent penalties based on an offender’s past felony sentences. Under current law, the maximum penalty for any re-entry attempt is two years. Under Kate’s Law, after three attempts, the maximum rose to 10 years. It also expanded the universe of misdemeanors from drug-related under current law, to any misdemeanor, which could include offenses as common as traffic violations. ""It will discourage people from entering the United States illegally, particularly when they have already entered illegally earlier and have been convicted of a crime for doing so,"" said the bill’s main sponsor, Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., in 2017. Although Rosen voted against Kate’s Law, she was one of 11 Democrats who voted for the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act in September 2017. That bill made it easier for federal officials to detain and remove gang members. Under the bill, an official could act if he or she ""knows or has reason to believe that such person is or has been a member of a criminal gang or has participated in criminal gang activities."" The measure provided broad latitude in defining gangs and if officials had any suspicions, the person would be ineligible for asylum, temporary protected status, or special treatment because they are under 18. The bill passed in the House in September 2017, but has yet to win Senate approval. In White House press briefing, U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber said Kate’s Law would help prosecutors keep gang members off the streets. ""What Kate's Law does is give us one more tool that is fairly easy to use, because we're not reliant upon witnesses who may be intimidated by the gangs or victimized by the gangs,"" Huber said. ""This enables us to, based on a person's status and their criminal record and their deportation record, to simply prosecute them in federal court, obtain a prison sentence, and get them out of here."" But gang expert Robert Bunker at the University of Southern California’s Safe Communities Institute said MS-13 gang members are a special case. Imprisonment is part of initiation. ""Being in prison for a gang member is considered part of ‘making one's bones’ to gain street cred and status within the gang,"" Bunker told us. ""So, unlike cartel members who may be deterred by facing a prison sentence, a gang member — such as an MS-13 one — is not going to be deterred by it. Further, if an MS-13 gang member from Central America was ordered by his clique leader or a higher up shot-caller, to journey to the United States, they would do so. Not following orders would get them severely beaten if not killed outright."" Before Kate’s Law emerged, while deportations in general more or less held steady, people deported because of their criminal history declined. This chart comes from deportation proceedings gathered by Syracuse University’s TRAC project. There are two ways to read the numbers. It’s possible that immigrants with felonies drew less attention over the years (although during most of the period, Washington put more focus on them). But it’s also possible that current law has been effective, without the threat of Kate’s Law. Hernandez at the University of Denver said he’s not seen any study that shows a connection between increased penalties and reduced border crossings. The Senate Leadership Fund said Rosen ""voted against stopping criminals from re-entering the United States,"" citing Kate’s Law. Rosen did vote against Kate’s Law, which increased penalties for those trying to re-enter the country. However, the ad leaves out that Rosen voted in favor of another bill that specifically targeted the sort of gang members presented in the ad. The measure gave federal officers wide latitude in defining gang membership and empowered them to detain and remove any person they had reason to believe was involved with a gang. Rosen’s voting record undercuts the ad’s claim. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1C2FC0>],/factchecks/2018/oct/02/senate-leadership-fund/gop-super-pac-ad-skips-over-jacky-rosens-yes-vote-/

Donald Trump: GOP just passed veteran's Choice after 44-year wait. Actually, it's 4 years old
","President Donald Trump has been barnstorming for Republicans in the midterms. On Oct. 1 he landed in Johnson City, Tenn., to help U.S. Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn, covering familiar ground about the improving economy. He touted securing $716 billion for the military, and he gave Republicans credit for giving veterans a new health care option. ""We just passed Choice,"" Trump said. ""That was 44 years, they’ve been trying to pass Choice. So that if you have to wait for nine days, 30 days, 21 days, months, you don’t do that anymore. If the line is big, and you’re unhappy, you go to a private doctor, they take care of you and we pay the bill."" Trump repeated the point, saying, ""They’ve been trying to pass that one for many, many decades. They couldn’t do it. We got it passed. We’re good at passing things, right?"" Trump is wrong that Choice wasn’t passed until he came into office. Congress passed a new version of a Choice program in June 2018 — but the program itself has been around since 2014. After the scandal of long waits and the efforts of administrators at some facilities to cover that up, Congress and the Obama administration passed the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014. For veterans who couldn’t be given appointments quickly enough, or who lived more than 40 miles from a Veterans Health Administration hospital, the government would pay for private care. In four years, Washington spent $12 billion on the program. The bill signed by Trump, the VA Mission Act, is a major effort to fold a variety of community care programs at the VA into one integrated whole. That change won’t take place for at least a year. Until then, the law provides $5.2 billion to continue the Choice program in its present form. We reached out to the Trump administration but did not hear back. Trump said that he and his fellow Republican ""passed Choice,"" something that others had been trying to do for 44 years. He described the program as one that allowed veterans to get private care at government expense. The program to do exactly that has been around for four years. And it’s always been referred to as Choice. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C13AFC0>],/factchecks/2018/oct/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-gop-finally-passed-veterans-choice-af/

No, Christine Blasey Ford didn't say she used a cell phone after alleged attack
","  Social media platforms have been overwhelmed by posts about Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony alleging a sexual assault by then 17-year-old Brett Kavanaugh, who is now a nominee for the Supreme Court. Here’s one that is eye-catching -- but wrong. A reader found it on the Facebook page for Top Stories USA, a hyper-partisan website with such recent headlines as, ""Loud-mouthed Woman Who Confronted Flake In Elevator Was A Soros Funded Hit Job!"" ""Hillary Thinks She’s A Star – TANKS ‘Murphy Brown’ Ratings Just By Showing Her Face,"" and ""Watch Lindsey Graham’s EPIC Democrat Butt-Kicking at Kavanaugh’s Hearing."" The Facebook post, dated Sept. 29, featured an image that said, ""Christine Blasey Ford claims that she called a friend on her cell phone after the ‘attack’ in or around 1982. The first cell phone was sold for $3,995 in March of 1984."" (The claim is accompanied by the image of an ancient-looking Motorola cell phone.)   However, we found no evidence that Ford ever made that claim. (We did not hear back from Top Stories USA. A spokeswoman for Ford referred us to a fact-check by Snopes.com) The claim of a cell phone call does not appear in the Washington Post’s original story on Sept. 16, 2018, in which Ford went public with her claim. ""Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband,"" the article noted. Ford elaborated on her recollections during in her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 27, 2018. After the alleged attack by Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, she testified: ""I left the bathroom, ran down the stairs, through the living room, and left the house. I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house and that Brett and Mark were not coming after me. ""Brett’s assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys. … Over the years, I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience."" Neither of these accounts mentions a cell phone call. On questioning from Rachel Mitchell, a prosecutor retained by the Republican Judiciary Committee majority to question Ford and Kavanaugh, Ford said she did not recall how she got home. Mitchell: ""You've described this as being near the country club, wherever this house was, is that right?"" Ford: ""I would describe it as it's somewhere between my house and the country club in that vicinity that's shown in your picture. And the country club is about 20 -- a 20-minute drive from my parents' home."" Mitchell: ""A 20-minute drive. And, of course, I've marked (it on a map) as the crow flies."" Ford: ""Yes."" Mitchell: ""Would it be fair to say that somebody drove you somewhere, either to the party or home from the party?"" Ford: ""Correct."" Michell: ""OK. Has anyone come forward to say to you, 'Hey, remember, I was the one that drove you home?'"" Ford: ""No."" In her official post-testimony report, Mitchell noted some concern about this aspect of Ford’s recollection. ""Given that this all took place before cell phones, arranging a ride home would not have been easy,"" Mitchell wrote. ""Indeed, she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did, or that she called anyone else thereafter."" But while Mitchell mentions cell phones in this context, Ford did not. (And Mitchell’s report is dated Sept. 30, so it could not have been a source for the meme posted on Sept. 29.)

Marsha Blackburn hits Phil Bredesen over shredded documents in sexual harassment cases
","Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn brought the #MeToo movement into the first U.S. Senate debate with Democrat Phil Bredesen. Blackburn took a question about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and turned it into a jab at Bredesen’s handling of sexual harassment cases as Tennessee governor. ""When Phil was governor there was an issue where sexual harassment claims doubled one year,"" Blackburn said. ""And what they chose to do was to shred some of the documents so that women’s voices would never be heard. They died in that shredder and their voices were not heard."" The claim contains some serious charges. Upon review, we found that Blackburn embellished on some of the details. • An Associated Press review found that at end of 2005, the number of harassment claims was on track to double from the year before. • We identified about 30 sexual harassment investigations that occurred in state government from 2003 to 2011, while Bredesen served as governor. In two of those cases,  a state investigator destroyed interview notes. • Bredesen proposed changing the state open records law to try and shield the identify of accusers who came forward with claims of harassment. He also issued a policy to stop the shredding of any documents related to a sexual harassment investigation. • The Nashville Women’s Political Caucus praised Bredesen at the time for ""his open concern for protecting complainants' rights."" Midway though Bredesen’s first term in 2005, top adviser Mack Cooper was accused of harassing a young woman in the governor’s office. Bredesen removed him from his staff and assigned him to a state job that paid about $10,000 less. Officials released no details on what Cooper had done. When reporters dug further, they found that the state’s investigator had shredded the handwritten notes she took when interviewing the woman who made the allegation. Less than two months later, the State Corrections commissioner Quenton White resigned. The prison chief faced multiple problems, including driving a state car while his license was suspended and failing to punish guards who smuggled contraband goods into prisons. Reporters quickly learned that he had faced harassment allegations a year earlier, but those notes had also been destroyed. The governor’s office said the harassment claim lacked proof, and he was dismissed for other reasons. Bredesen took office in 2003. In 2004, he instituted workplace harassment training across all state offices. Right after demoting Cooper in May 2005, Bredesen proposed changing the state’s open records law to protect the identities of people who file sexual harassment complaints. ""We have got a problem with sexual harassment in state government,"" Bredesen told the Associated Press May 22, 2005. ""People are not going to come forward if it's going to be on the front page of the newspaper."" The Nashville Women’s Political Caucus immediately praised Bredesen. In a letter published in the Tennessean, caucus head Holly Span said her group supported Bredesen’s ""swift actions in the workplace harassment case involving one of his legislative lobbyists and his open concern for protecting complainants' rights."" (Supporters of transparency in government opposed the move. In 2006, Bredesen backed down when news organizations agreed to keep accusers’ names private.) On July 17, 2005, Bredesen issued a policy to stop all shredding by the Personnel Department. He said he didn’t know about the problem until the episode with his top adviser. In August 2005, Bredesen released a new policy on sexual harassment investigations. It required that all documents be preserved. During this period, investigations by the Tennessean newspaper and the Associated Press found a lack of consistency across state government in how claims were handled. Tennessean reporters identified 30 cases on Bredesen’s watch. They noted that claims made by or about higher ranked officials were ""investigated more thoroughly and more privately than those involving lower-level civil service employees."" The more high-profile the official, the thinner the file left behind, reporters found. Bredesen said the difference was because the rules for civil servant employees were more stringent than for executive staff. Civil service workers enjoy more legal protections, which produces a more detailed paper trail. In 2005, Frank Gibson was executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government and an editor at the Tennessean. Gibson told us he opposed Bredesen’s plan to shield records from the press. But that issue was separate from any concerns about whether allegations were taken seriously. ""I knew of no rule that would have prevented any woman from being heard,"" Gibson said. ""As for a policy that sex harassment complaints were to be shredded, I never heard of such a thing."" Blackburn said that documents in sexual harassment cases were shredded ""so that women’s voices would never be heard."" The attack stretches the facts of the case and ignores Bredesen’s remarks at the time. Out of 30 cases, investigation notes were shredded in two prominent cases. In both, the implicated officials were either demoted or resigned. When the issue came to light, Bredesen ordered that files be preserved going forward. The Nashville Women’s Political Caucus praised Bredesen for ""his open concern for protecting complainants' rights.""

The seat has been held by Republicans since 1963 but suddenly is competitive. McCready, the Democrat, says that if elected, he won't vote for Nancy Pelosi for House Democratic leader, or House speaker if the party wins a majority. But Harris says McCready is just trying to hide that he is ""with"" the ""Pelosi crowd."" So we took a look at the ad’s factual claims to find out. Federal campaign records show McCready, a Marine veteran, Harvard MBA and investor in solar farms, donated to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016. He gave $500 to Clinton’s presidential campaign and $500 to the Hillary Victory Fund, a fundraising entity that gave proceeds to Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties across the country. But what about the ""Pelosi crowd?"" We asked the Harris campaign and the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports Republican candidates. They cited donations to McCready by Democrats on Pelosi’s leadership team. They also said the House Majority PAC, a leading super PAC spending heavily to elect Democrats, has spent money in the race. Tallies tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics show the House Majority PAC has spent $327,925 to oppose Harris. Technically, this is not Pelosi’s PAC, but it is considered affiliated. It works on the same goal as Pelosi: to win a Democratic House majority. And while the money is not legally considered a donation to McCready, it unquestionably helps him. Through its founder, the PAC has ties to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, the official campaign arm of House Democrats -- and Pelosi is the House Democrats’ elected leader. Also: The DCCC supports McCready. While it would likely support any Democrat who has a chance of winning, McCready was among the first candidates on the DCCC’s ""Red to Blue"" list, which ""arms top-tier candidates with organizational and fundraising support,"" the DCCC said when announcing this. Pelosi chose Rep. Ray Ray Lujan, of New Mexico, to chair the DCCC, although fellow Democrats had to affirm her choice. That puts him in the ""Pelosi crowd,"" the NRCC said. Lujan has his own leadership PAC, Turquoise PAC, and the PAC along with Lujan’s own reelection campaign committee have given McCready $5,000. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland is the House Democratic whip, a key member of the Pelosi leadership team. He has given McCready’s campaign $14,000 through his own leadership PAC and his campaign committee. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina is assistant Democratic leader. His leadership PAC gave McCready $5,000. The PAC affiliated with Rep. Linda Sanchez of California, the Democratic caucus vice chair, donated $2,000.. McCready ""has the blessing of party leaders — he is their candidate,"" Kerry Rom from the NRCC told us. ""Support from Pelosi-linked organizations and her leadership team tells us where he ultimately stands on the issues."" Is there a straight line from financial support for a candidate and the people — say, Pelosi — he’ll support? Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University, said it’s more like a set of ""big, gray smudges."" ""It would be folly to say that Nancy Pelosi has nothing to do"" with decisions on where to put House leadership or allied resources, Greene said. ""But it doesn’t suppose any loyalty to Pelosi"" on McCready’s part, since McCready has made clear he wants a different Democratic House leader. McCready in November criticized Pelosi in a Charlotte Observer column, saying Pelosi ""used moves from the Bill Clinton-era playbook"" when initially defending Rep. John Conyers against charges of sexual assault. McCready told the Washington Post and others that Democrats need ""new blood."" His campaign told PolitiFact that if elected, McCready will not vote for Pelosi as leader. And he has received campaign donations from others who want Pelosi out.  For example, the NRCC, in an email to us, listed Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, as part of Team Pelosi. Crowley’s leadership PAC donated $5,000 to McCready. But Crowley — who lost his recent primary election and won’t be in Congress next year — had said he would oppose Pelosi’s return to leadership. Harris uses the ""Pelosi crowd"" label to say that McCready wants to ""grow government and repeal your tax cut."" Yet there is no evidence of that. McCready has only said he wants to make sure the tax cuts for individuals and families stay in place after their scheduled 2025 expiration. ""Dan will fight for middle-class tax cuts and policies to level the playing field for hardworking North Carolinians,"" his campaign website says. It is impossible to know what other policies ""to level the field"" might face a House vote, although some liberal Democrats have suggested raising corporate income tax rates closer to their pre-cut levels. This takes us into supposition for issue after issue: What would McCready do? That is actually the subtext of the Harris ad. McCready is a Democrat. He's ""with"" the Pelosi crowd. But there are degrees of beliefs and votes within the Democratic Party. To simplify in the spirit of the ad: There are California Democrats, and there are Southern Democrats. They are not all the same. Are there ties between members of Team Pelosi and McCready? Absolutely. Does McCready support the same agenda as Democratic leaders such as Pelosi? Based on his website, he supports much of it, but it is the agenda of Democrats in general. He opposes turning Medicare into a voucher program. (House Republicans have proposed a program they say would be entirely voluntary.) He wants to protect the EPA from ""a hatchet."" He supports abortion rights.  Such agreement, however, would make the overwhelming majority of Democrats ""in with"" Pelosi. It would mean the southern ""blue dog"" Democrats are. It would mean the East and West Coast Democrats are -- even those who want to replace her because they say she hasn't been foreceful or confrontational enough. There would be few distinctions When Republicans invoke Pelosi’s name and say an opponent is ""with them,"" they are using ""shorthand for ‘Oh, those liberals,’"" Greene said. Harris’ claim has elements of truth. But it affixes a generic label that needs fuller context. We can’t say which shade of blue will come out of the wash, but we can rate the claim: Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C42FA00>],/factchecks/2018/oct/02/mark-harris-nc/powered-pelosi/
"['Iran', 'North Carolina', 'Rickey Padgett']","
Republican candidate claims Kerry is working on behalf of terrorist organizations
","A day after President Donald Trump slammed former Secretary of State John Kerry for private meetings with a top Iranian official, a North Carolina state Senate candidate lobbed similar accusations in a tweet of his own. ""When will the President Strip Former Sec of State of his Security Clearance,"" said Republican Rickey Padgett, who is running to unseat Democrat Mike Woodard in District 22. ""With John Kerry now working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments (Now) should be the answer. Drain the Swamp now! John Kerry should be next!"" Before Trump’s decision in May to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal — which had lifted some economic sanctions on Iran so long as Iran discontinued its pursuit of nuclear weapons — Kerry worked behind the scenes to preserve the pact, according to a May 4 report by the Boston Globe detailing the quiet lobbying efforts as described by anonymous sources. Who has Kerry been meeting with? Specifically, Kerry met with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and made several phone calls to European officials and members of Congress in an effort to rescue the deal. Kerry, who was the nuclear deal’s chief architect under President Barack Obama, said during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, that he met with Zarif three or four times to discuss the agreement. Kerry’s private meetings have sparked an outcry from congressional Republicans, who say he may have undermined U.S. foreign policy interests. On Sept. 18, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sent a letter asking the Justice Department to investigate the meetings, according to a press release. Previously, PolitiFact found claims that Kerry met secretly with Iranian officials in Paris to be unsubstantiated. PolitiFact also gave several websites Pants on Fire ratings for false reports that Kerry was facing prison charges under the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized American citizens from working to subvert U.S. foreign policy. But Padgett’s claim that Kerry has been ""working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments"" seemed particularly sweeping, so we decided to give it a look. When asked for comment, Padgett said he stands by his statement and suggested Kerry has been compromised and should be examined under the Logan Act or brought before the Senate for hearings. ""His efforts appear to represent the interests of the Iranian government more than American citizens right here on American soil,"" Padgett said. ""He is part of the previous administration and he should stop trying to ink deals (in the) foreign interest as though he is still part of President Trump’s administration."" How normal is this? Kerry spokesman Matthew Summers acknowledged that Kerry has maintained contact with his counterparts from other countries. But he explained that other secretaries of state did the same and that Kerry told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a phone conversation earlier this year about the discussions he had with Zarif at international conferences. ""At those conferences, (Kerry) urged Iran to keep its commitments under the Iran nuclear agreement,"" Summers said. ""He was advocating for what was wholly consistent with U.S. policy at the time, as the United States was still a part of the Iran deal."" David Wade, Kerry’s former chief of staff, also pointed to an email newsletter from Diplomacy Works, a pro-diplomacy organization that includes Kerry on its advisory council, addressing the idea that Kerry’s meetings were secret and illegal. Citing Kerry’s interviews with Hewitt and Fox News host Dana Perino, the email said his meetings with Zarif were routine and occured at a time when the Iran nuclear deal was still U.S. policy. ""There’s nothing unusual, let alone unseemly or inappropriate, about former diplomats meeting with foreign counterparts as Secretary Kissinger has done it for decades with Russia and China,"" Summers said. ""But certainly anyone can agree it doesn’t constitute working ‘for’ another country."" We consulted some experts, and they agreed. ""Of course Kerry did not work on behalf of Iran,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. Peter Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University and a former National Security Council staff member, said there is ""nothing unusual or untoward about formers continuing or extending relationships they fostered while in office."" ""Former national security officials like John Kerry meet with foreign leaders all the time,"" he said. Feaver said such meetings can be useful for relaying messages back to current policymakers, and that departed diplomats are usually very careful to emphasize that they are not advocating or creating policy. Still, although Kerry’s meetings were fairly standard practice, Feaver noted that it’s not strange that they raised some eyebrows among Republicans. ""Based on published reporting, it is possible that former Secretary Kerry’s interactions danced close to the line — a line measuring professional norms, not legal restrictions — in terms of discussing ways to thwart current Administration policy,"" he said. ""The Obama Administration would have been angry if former Bush Administration officials had crossed that line and so it is understandable that the Trump Administration is suspicious of Kerry’s activities."" ""One can have a good debate about the Logan Act,"" O’Hanlon added, referring to the law prohibiting unauthorized citizens from working to undermine U.S. policy. Padgett said the government should look into Kerry’s meetings as a potential violation of that statute.   How does the Logan Act play into this? But as PolitiFact has noted before, there are only two known instances where Americans have been indicted for violating the Logan Act. The most recent of the two indictments came in 1853, and neither led to a conviction. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, told the Boston Globe that the act probably would not apply to what Kerry has been up to, even if it was commonly enforced. ""If all Kerry is doing is working to keep in place something that’s still technically a ‘measure of the United States,’ I don’t see how the statute would apply even if someone was crazy enough to try it,"" Vladeck said, according to the Globe. So Kerry may have come close to ""a line measuring professional norms,"" as Feaver said. But his meetings are unlikely to warrant prosecution under the Logan Act, and they certainly did not amount to ""working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments."" For the record, Feaver also said the Iranian regime would more precisely be described as ""major state sponsors of terrorism,"" not foreign terrorist governments. Our ruling Padgett said Kerry is ""now working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments."" Experts we consulted said that is not the case. Kerry’s meetings with Zarif were not unusual, and there is no clear evidence that his efforts to salvage the Iran deal were undermining current U.S. policy because the meetings occurred before Trump actually moved to scrap the deal, when the deal was still consistent with U.S. policy. More to the point, there is no evidence that Kerry has been in cahoots with or working for Iran. We rate Padgett’s statement False.

The NC Local News Lab Fund and the International Center for Journalists provide support for the project, which shares fact-checks with newsrooms statewide.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C445C0>],/factchecks/2018/oct/02/rickey-padgett/republican-candidate-claims-kerry-working-behalf-t/
"['National', 'Bipartisanship', 'Congressional Leadership Fund']","
New Jersey's Leonard Lance is bipartisan, at least from this perspective
","Labels like ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" provide a shorthand for understanding political positions. So does ""bipartisan,"" conferring an air of grownup responsibility -- someone who won’t throw flames. A new TV ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to elect Republicans, says that GOP Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey was ""rated among the most bipartisan in Congress."" The ad seeks to draw a contrast with Lance’s Democratic challenger, Tom Malinowski, a former State Department official for human rights in President Barack Obama’s administration. Although there’s certainly some flame-throwing in this very ad, casting Malinowski as fiercely liberal and Lance as the adult in the room, it raised a good question: Is Lance really that bipartisan? To understand the answer, understand first that labels comes with certain conditions. Here’s how Lance got that label. The Congressional Leadership Fund, which has no formal ties with Lance but wants to keep him in Congress, based its claim on rankings from the Lugar Center and Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. They produce rankings of bipartisanship that are not based on single bills or issues -- say, the Affordable Care Act, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or gun rights. Instead, they assess the frequency with which a lawmaker sponsors bills that draw support from the opposite political party, and how often a member joins as a co-sponsor of a bill introduced on the other side of the partisan aisle. For all of 2017, Lance ranked 13th most bipartisan in the House of Representatives. When looking at the entirety of the previous Congress, factoring in 2015 and 2016, Lance ranked 75th. While not in the very top tier, it was high, considering the House of Representatives has 435 members (although only 427 were counted because some members served too short a time for the rankings). These ranking do not count ceremonial bills or legislation to name a post office. They also are statistically weighted and standardized for such things political party, so as not to unfairly disadvantage scores of the current party in power. That’s because minority party members generally can’t move legislation without getting a sponsor from the party in power -- and therefore, they could appear to be more bipartisan. But this is just one set of ratings. So we checked others. Interest groups pushing specific agendas show different results, which is natural. For example, the League of Conservation Voters, which supports environmental legislation, says Lance voted for its positions 34 percent of the time in 2017, but he has only a 23 percent lifetime score. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, promoting a pro-business agenda, gave Lance an 86 percent score in 2017 but a 90 percent cumulative score. FreedomWorks, allied with the tea party movement, gives Lance a score of 44 so far this year, and 47 for 2017. That meant Lance had the highest tea party-related score in 2017 of anyone in the New Jersey delegation. For the sake of perspective, New Jersey isn’t a hotbed of tea party activism, and Lance has at times voted against its positions on taxes and health care. Yet the Tea Party Express recently announced it would endorse him anyway, saying Lance ""has a stellar record of advocating policies that encourage economic growth, job creation, fiscal responsibility and a less intrusive federal government."" Want a different viewpoint? The Planned Parenthood Action Fund, vowing to maintain reproductive and women’s health rights,  gives Lance a rating of only 3 percent this year. The Human Rights Campaign, supporting legislation for LGBT rights, gave Lance a score of 48 for the combined two sessions of the 114th Congress in 2015 and 2016. That was a big leap from his score of 30 in the previous two-year session -- and only 15 in the two years before that. How does Lance stack up in New Jersey itself? GovTrack, a project that gathers data from across the partisan divide, ranked Lance second, not first, for bipartisan leadership in 2017, with Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey’s 4th Congressional District, ranked first. Yet the Lugar Center ranked Smith 24th nationally, which is not chopped liver, but it is below Lance’s rank of 13. The explanation: Different groups use different methodologies. We wondered how Congressional Quarterly, which closely follows the votes and actions of every member of Congress, summed up Lance. In a summary last updated in July 2017, Congressional Quarterly said Lance ""is one of about two dozen moderate-to-mildly conservative Republicans, many of them from New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, who wield outsized influence since they can make the difference between victory and defeat for GOP leaders on high-profile legislation."" He doesn't consistently vote with the party. For example, Lance was one of a handful of Republicans who voted against the repeal-and-replace health care bill in 2017 -- and thus, against his party’s position -- saying he worried it wouldn’t fully protect people with pre-existing medical conditions. Lance is also a member of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, a group equally divided between Republicans and Democrats who say they want to find bipartisan solutions to the nation's problems. Yet the website FiveThirtyEight said Lance votes in line with President Donald Trump’s positions 87.1 percent of the time.  How one views Lance can depend on ideology and agendas. There are plenty of partisan votes when he sides with his party, as the interest-group ratings show. Yet he crosses the aisle at times, especially on sponsorships and co-sponsorship, and sometimes on important messaging or substantive bills.  How do we put all this together? The Congressional Leadership Fund did not say Lance was the most bipartisan member but, rather, that he was rated among the most bipartisan. Based on one standard -- sponsorships and co-sponsorships -- he was. Yet it helps to have this additional information, including the views of other rating systems and groups. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ACDE40>],/factchecks/2018/oct/02/congressional-leadership-fund/new-jerseys-leonard-lance-bipartisan-least-perspec/

Fact-checking Gov. Rick Scott's attack on Sen. Bill Nelson for skipping security hearings
","Gov. Rick Scott portrays U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson as an ""empty chair"" who often skips meetings on the important topic of security. ""Nelson skipped 45 percent of the hearings on national security,"" said a TV ad from Scott’s campaign. ""National security! Bill Nelson doesn’t write laws — he doesn’t even show up."" The ad refers to Nelson’s tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Nelson is defending his seat in a close battle with Scott. Attacks for missed hearings are common. But these attacks omit several caveats about committee attendance. ""I have never been one that put much stock in the ‘attendance’ statistics to measure a senator's work"" on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Arnold Punaro, who served as the committee's Democratic staff director from 1983 to 1997. Scott’s campaign published a spreadsheet showing that between 2001 and 2018, Nelson missed 45 percent (or 284 out of 636) of Senate Armed Service Committee hearings. (He wasn’t on the committee in 2011-12.) The campaign said it counted full committee hearings and subcommittees on which Nelson served and was expected to attend. Nelson’s attendance varied with each two-year congressional session, ranging from 44 percent in 2005-06 to 76 percent for the current 2017-18 session. Scott’s campaign pulled attendance records from the Senate Armed Services Committee website and the Government Printing Office. However, attendance isn’t published for closed or classified hearings. Since there aren’t public attendance records for all types of hearings, that means we don’t get the full picture of Nelson’s service on the committee. Dan McLaughlin, Nelson’s spokesman, said by his count Nelson attended 104 of 126 Armed Services hearings, informal meetings, sessions and briefings — including more than two dozen that were closed or classified — in 2017-18. PolitiFact can’t verify the Nelson campaign’s figures since that includes meetings that lack a public attendance record. Experts on Congress agreed that a straight-up attendance record doesn’t tell us much. ""A hearing about a national security threat, for example, is much more significant than routine budget hearings the (committee) holds every fiscal year,"" said Georgetown University professor Joshua Huder, who studies Congress. It is common for senators, who serve on multiple committees and subcommittees, to miss hearings. Sometimes, multiple committees will hold hearings at the same time, forcing the senator to split their time or prioritize one hearing over another. Roll Call, a Washington publication that regularly covers Congress, wrote in 2014 that unless the senator wields the gavel, he or she may only show up for five minutes, or when it is their turn to ask questions ""The results include guffaw-inducing scenes where even senior lawmakers enter the wrong hearing room, misidentify a witness and question the wrong person on the other side of the dais,"" Roll Call wrote. Scott said Nelson ""skipped 45 percent of the hearings on national security."" The Scott campaign’s data for Nelson’s 16 years on the Senate Armed Services Committee shows he missed 284 hearings out of 636. However, this omits that for some types of hearings there is no publicly available attendance record. This count is not perfect. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ACAAC0>],/factchecks/2018/oct/01/rick-scott/fact-checking-gov-rick-scotts-attack-sen-bill-nels/

Has US racked up $2 trillion in trade deficits since NAFTA began?
","During a press event to announce a successor trade pact to the North American Free Trade Agreement, President Donald Trump sought to portray NATFA as a disaster for American trade. ""Since NAFTA’s adoption, the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion,"" Trump said at the Oct. 1, 2018, event at the White House. (Watch it at about the 20:00 mark.) Is that true? We turned to data for trade in goods with Canada and Mexico published by the U.S. Census Bureau. We totaled up the trade surpluses or deficits with each country between 1994 — the year the agreement was signed — and 2017, the last full year for which data is available. (Reminder: A trade surplus means that exports exceed imports; a trade deficit means that imports exceed exports. It doesn’t literally mean the United States lost $2 trillion.) Here’s the year-by-year summary of the balance of trade of goods with both countries. With one exception, they were all annual deficits. (Mexico is marked in red, while Canada is marked in blue.) If you add it all up, the accumulated U.S. trade deficit with both countries in goods between 1994 and 2017 was $1.97 trillion. Rounded up, that’s $2 trillion. But it’s not a fully comprehensive description. These figures are for goods only — not for goods and services. When Trump has talked as president about trade statistics, he has often referred to the deficit for goods only. That paints the United States’ trade position in a worse light than If the calculation had included services (such as legal or accounting services). We couldn’t find data on services all the way back to 1994, but we’ll use data for 2015, 2016 and 2017 for a sense of how the numbers differ. In each of those years, the United States erased its modest trade deficit in goods with Canada by running a trade surplus in services. The impact of services on the trade balance with Mexico was smaller, but the trade deficit with Mexico typically shrank when services were included. Second, Trump uses this statistic to emphasize the negative impact of NAFTA while minimizing the positive impact. NAFTA certainly had negative aspects for the United States. We recently rated a Trump statement that ""we lost thousands of plants"" due to NAFTA Mostly True. Still, the agreement has had positive impacts as well. For instance, NAFTA increased the amount of U.S. exports to both countries, which in turn produced jobs that didn’t exist before. Here’s a chart showing the level of U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico in 1994 and 2017. ""There are volume benefits to trade under NAFTA,"" said Ross Burkhart, a political scientist specializing in U.S.-Canada relations at Boise State University. ""Exports across NAFTA are one of them. Across the vast majority of U.S. states, Canada remains the No. 1 trading partner both in exports and imports."" It’s also worth noting that the concept of ""exports"" and ""imports"" between NAFTA-member countries has blurred, since partially assembled goods often cross the Canada-U.S. border several times before the final product is assembled, especially in the automobile sector. ""If Ford used to ship engines from a parts plant in Dearborn, Mich., to one in Ypsilanti, Mich., but it now ships those parts to Monterey, Mexico, for assembly into a car or truck that is shipped back to the United States (and if the Ypsilanti assembly plant has closed), then the increase in exports to Mexico has not supported any new jobs,"" said Robert E. Scott, senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, which is skeptical of trade agreements. Various independent estimates have found that the net job losses from NAFTA were modest, with the gains roughly offsetting losses. In general, experts who are favorable to free trade say that arguing over deficits and surpluses misses the point. Specifically, trade deficits stem from demand among U.S. consumers for products that U.S. producers cannot meet, whether that’s because no American company makes the product in question, because American companies aren’t making the product cheaply enough, or because U.S.-produced wares simply aren’t appealing enough to consumers. ""We should be running deficits with some countries and surpluses with others, since comparative advantage will vary, country by country,"" I.M. (Mac) Destler, who teaches at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, has told us previously. Trump said, ""Since NAFTA’s adoption, the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion."" The trade deficit is different from the national debt in that it is not money owed to another country in the future. But if you compile the trade deficit for goods alone, Trump is on target. The amount might be smaller once services are factored in. It’s worth noting that this statistic emphasizes the negative impacts of the trade deal but ignores positive impacts, such as significant increases in U.S. exports to both countries.

Did Paul Davis vote to allow strip clubs to open nears homes and schools?
","A new ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to protect the GOP Majority in the U.S. House, attacks a Kansas congressional hopeful for an incident at a strip club 20 years ago. You bet we wanted to see if the facts here stood up to scrutiny. Democrat Paul Davis is locked in a competitive race with Republican Steve Watkins in Kansas’ 2nd Congressional District, a seat that includes Topeka, Lawrence and the communities west of Kansas City. The ad targets Davis for his alleged involvement in a 1998 strip club drug raid, where he was found in a dark room with a nearly naked woman. ""What’s worse than getting caught at a strip club during a drug bust? Ask Paul Davis."" The ad then claims Davis was found in a VIP room with a woman wearing only a G-string. Then it says, ""Even worse, after Davis was caught with a stripper, he voted to allow strip clubs to open near our homes, churches, schools and even daycare facilities. Shady Paul Davis can’t be trusted."" Here, we are checking the details surrounding the strip club incident, along with the claim that Davis voted to allow strip clubs to operate near places like schools, homes, churches and daycares. The situation involving Davis and a strip club came to light in September 2014 during his bid for governor, which he lost. According to reports, Davis was getting a lap dance in a back room in the late 1990s when cops raided the club in search of drugs. He was not charged with a crime, but police involved in the raid reported he was found in a ""compromising position."" Davis said he ""was at the wrong place at the wrong time."" Independence Police Chief Harry Smith later corroborated Davis’ account that the candidate was not involved in any wrongdoing, or, to his knowledge, the focus of an investigation. He said Davis was questioned briefly before being released. Kelsi Browning, a spokeswoman for Davis’ campaign, told PolitiFact that the ad is based on something that happened 20 years ago when Davis was 26. As a new lawyer, she said, Davis went with his boss to meet an ""unsavory client"" of the law firm. The ad refers to HB 2107, or the Community Defense Act, which was a 2011 state bill that would have prohibited strip clubs and other sexually oriented businesses from being established within 1,000 feet of the property line of an existing one as well as any schools, churches, public parks, residences, libraries or daycare centers. The bill would have also required semi-nude dancers to remain at least 6 feet away from their customers and for sexually oriented businesses to remain closed from midnight to 6 a.m. Davis was one of 28 Kansas House members who voted against the bill, which ultimately failed in the Senate. The Davis campaign says that the legislation was a perennial bill that rarely made it out of committee. When it first came up in 2010, Davis actually voted for the bill before it was struck down in the Senate. It came up again in the 2011 session, but this time, he voted against it. Critics of the legislation, which included Davis, argued at the time that regulating these businesses was best left to cities and counties. Some also questioned taking the time to focus on the issue when the state was facing a massive budget deficit. In a Lawrence Journal-World story around the time of the vote, Davis, who was the House minority leader, was quoted saying that the Legislature was ""probably intruding in areas where we don’t need to be. We’ve got a lot more important things that we need to be dealing with here."" The Congressional Leadership Fund ad says that Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycares. The ad is piecing together two unrelated issues to draw an unsavory conclusion, while embellishing parts of the story. Davis did not vote to allow strip clubs to open near schools, churches, daycares and the like. He once voted against a measure that would have banned them from opening near these places. He also once voted for the same proposal. The ad’s claim that he was found in a strip club during a drug raid is accurate, but any suggestion he was connected to the drug raid is misplaced. Overall, this claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

Karl Rove writes that Democrats abolished state treasurer's office after she won it and she later became senator

Hutchison later became a U.S. senator.” The book was released March 9. Rove correctly reflects on Hutchison winning election as state treasurer in 1990, succeeding Richards, who won election as governor. However, we're intrigued by Rove’s statements about what happened next: According to him, Democrats then abolished the treasurer’s position. Later, Hutchison was elected to the U.S. Senate. Rove told us he stands by his account. Chronologically speaking, for starters, it's not so: Hutchison won her Senate seat in June 1993 while still serving as state treasurer, and the treasury remained a stand-alone agency after Hutchison left for Washington. Richards appointed an East Texas Democrat, Martha Whitehead, to serve out Hutchison’s term. Whitehead won election in her own right in 1994. So when -- and how -- was the treasurer's job abolished? According to legislative records, the Democratic-majority 1995 Legislature proposed a constitutional amendment abolishing the agency and shifting its operations elsewhere. Contrary to Rove's take, it wasn’t a move backed solely by Democrats. Senate Joint Resolution 1 was authored by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, and sponsored in the House by Reps. Mark Stiles, D-Beaumont, and Bill Siebert, R-San Antonio. The proposed amendment cleared the Senate by 23-7 with five Republicans and two Democrats voting ""no"" and the House by 107-18 with several Republicans who voted “no” saying afterward they’d intended to vote “yes,” according to Senate and House journals. Texas voters approved the change by 69 percent to 31 percent in November 1995. And Whitehead--who’d campaigned for election vowing to eliminate the agency—marked her last day in office Aug. 31, 1996 by scraping her name and title off the glass front of the agency’s Austin headquarters. “I am the last treasurer of the State of Texas,” she said. Another Democrat, State Comptroller John Sharp, had proposed the agency’s abolition in a report issued in 1994, after Hutchison was already in the Senate. His report called the treasury a “bureaucracy with an annual operating budget of more than $11 million whose most important tasks are duplicated elsewhere across state government… Consolidating the bulk of the State Treasury's responsibilities with those of the Comptroller's office would cut costs, improve services and maintain accountability. It would also offer Texans the chance to prove that they're serious about reducing the size of their state government.” How does Rove’s statement shape up? As noted, he's correct that Hutchison succeeded Richards as treasurer. But he's wrong about the order of subsequent events, and assigns an unsupported motive—that Democrats abolished the agency because a Republican had its top spot. Some Republicans backed the abolition, too, and it was Hutchison’s Democratic successor whose stint in the office came to a sign-scraping close. We rate Rove’s poor job of retelling history as False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3CDCC0>],/factchecks/2010/mar/19/karl-rove/karl-rove-writes-democrats-abolished-state-treasur/

Is St. Pete Beach a valid case study for Amendment 4?
","
A group fighting a statewide ballot initiative that would give voters direct say on land use decisions says people need look no further than the disastrous results of a similar initiative in tiny St. Pete Beach.

In an Internet advertisement, a political action committee called Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy claims that St. Pete Beach's local version of Amendment 4 has cost the 10,000-person community.

""Some people wonder what Florida would be like if Amendment 4 passed, but the people of St. Pete Beach already have the answer. They adopted a local version of Amendment 4 in 2006,"" says the ad, with sweeping images of St. Pete Beach's shoreline and its famous pink hotel, the Don Cesar.

""St. Pete Beach has become a victim of lost jobs, the enormous costs, wasted tax dollars, endless litigation and economic gridlock,"" the 2-minute, 15-second ad says. ""All because they approved a local version of Amendment 4.""

Amendment 4, which will appear on ballots in November, essentially would give citizens veto power over major development proposals and land use changes.

We've previously explored two of the ad's claims about legal fees and property taxes. Now we want to step back and tackle the fundamental question: Are St. Pete Beach's experiences a valid comparison when voters consider Amendment 4?

""If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. It's a fair example and a damning one,"" said Ryan Houck, executive director for Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, which was formerly called Floridians for Smarter Growth. The group is being funded by Florida business groups, including Publix, homebuilders and U.S. Sugar.

""Ryan's being very disingenuous,"" responds Leslie Blackner, an environmental attorney and president of Florida Hometown Democracy, the group advocating for Amendment 4.

St. Pete Beach's story

Blackner, who already has spent almost $750,000 of her own money supporting Amendment 4, says St. Pete Beach's process for dealing with major land use issues and the process proposed in Amendment 4 are significantly different.

To start, let's look at what has happened in St. Pete Beach.

In 2005, St. Pete Beach's five-member city commission was considering changing the town's road map for growth, the Comprehensive Plan. The commission was debating incentives to lure additional hotels that could increase the density of a development and change the allowed uses.

The talk of change didn't sit well with many residents, who formed a group called Citizens for Responsible Growth. They collected enough petitions to get a series of city charter amendments on the city ballot that would require voter approval for height increases and other changes to land use plans.

From there it got contentious. The city sued to stop the vote, saying the proposed charter amendments violated state land use law. A developer also sued saying the petition process was costing him money.

The city lost its case on appeal, and in November 2006, voters narrowly approved most of the changes to the city charter. The results: St. Pete Beach became the first town in Florida where residents directly controlled development decisions. Voters also elected two members of Citizens for Responsible Growth to the city commission, giving them a majority.

That prompted a pro-developer group -- Save Our Little Village -- to start its own petition drive and propose their own amendments to the city's comprehensive plan. The city's elected officials -- who had gone from being largely pro-development to anti-development -- tried to stop them.

It got even more contentious. Save Our Little Village sued. The city's attorney resigned under pressure from the commission.

Then, another election, another change of power, more lawsuits, and eventually, another referendum. This time, the pro-development side won.

The upshot -- four years after city voters decided they wanted control over land use decisions, the entire process has been sidetracked and stymied by lawsuits and politics, petition drives and egos. Taxpayers have paid $734,000 in legal bills associated with the comprehensive plan changes, the city says.

The guts of Amendment 4

Like in St. Pete Beach, Amendment 4 seeks citizen control over land use decisions. On that, the proposed constitutional language is clear: 
""Public participation in local government comprehensive land use planning benefits the conservation and protection of Florida’s natural resources and scenic beauty, and the long-term quality of life of Floridians. Therefore, before a local government may adopt a new comprehensive land use plan, or amend a comprehensive land use plan, such proposed plan or plan amendment shall be subject to vote of the electors of the local government by referendum, following preparation by the local planning agency, consideration by the governing body as provided by general law, and notice thereof in a local newspaper of general circulation. Notice and referendum will be as provided by general law. This amendment shall become effective immediately upon approval by the electors of Florida."" 
Blackner walked PolitiFact Florida through how she believed the new process would work (we say ""believe"" because her opponents think the process is open to interpretation).

Say a developer proposes an amendment to the comprehensive plan to build a condo high rise in the middle of town. Currently, an application would be submitted to the local government that has jurisdiction; the local government would follow its approval process -- two public hearings, etc.; and then the state Department of Community Affairs would be asked to sign off on the amendment. None of that would change.

But if the developer gets his approvals, Amendment 4 would add one more step. Voters would either ratify or veto the developer's plans at the next regularly scheduled election.

Amendment 4, which supporters also call Hometown Democracy, ""is all about process. It is a neutral provision,"" Blackner said. ""I don't claim to know how anyone would vote on any particular referendum. We think we need this added layer of voter accountability because too often elected officials don't represent the interest of citizens.""

Similarities and differences

Let's look at this from each side. Proponents of Amendment 4 say the analogy between the statewide initiative and what's happening in St. Pete Beach is bogus.

Yes, both processes deal with voter approval of comprehensive plan amendments. But that's pretty much it, they say.

The case of St. Pete Beach is as much about one city's politics as it is a comprehensive plan. Moreover, the entire disagreement began with a citizen petition to change the city's charter -- an option to most any city regardless of Amendment 4's outcome.

And what's critical to note in St. Pete Beach's case, supporters say, is that citizens themselves proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan -- an end-run of the development process that was established by state law. Amendment 4 doesn't deal with citizens' proposals to their local comprehensive plans. It allows people to vote on proposals either submitted by their government, or a developer.

The counterargument from opponents like Houck focuses on the outcomes, instead of the process, in St. Pete Beach. Every attempt to amend the comprehensive plan via a referendum has so far resulted in a lawsuits. The most recent cases surround opponents claiming that ballot language was unclear.

What's to stop a developer, then, from suing the city should its proposal fail via the Amendment 4 process by claiming the ballot language was deceptive?

Blackner said she hopes a neutral group -- maybe the state's Department of Community2 Affairs -- would write ballot language to help combat potential lawsuits from unhappy developers.

But, ""I fully expect there will be fights over ballot titles and summaries,"" she admits. ""Developers are the most litigious people I've ever seen. I'm sure there will be lawsuits over this.""

Houck also notes that pro-Amendment 4 organizers previously referenced St. Pete Beach as a symbol in their cause. In 2006, Ross Burnaman, vice president of Hometown Democracy, said St. Pete Beach is emblematic of ""the broader purpose behind Hometown Democracy that people have at least some control over the long-term land use of their community.""

Then, there's the position of St. Pete Beach City Manager Mike Bonfield, who believes Amendment 4 is more far-reaching than what St. Pete Beach voters approved. St. Pete Beach's rules exempt some smaller land use changes from voter approval.

""When they (proponents) say that Hometown Democracy is different than St. Pete Beach, in a very slight element it is,"" Bonfield said. ""But overall the issue of voting on comprehensive plan amendments and our experience in voting on comprehensive plan amendments is the same, except in Hometown Democracy it's going to happen more often.

""So it's not exactly identical,"" Bonfield said. ""It's worse.""

Our ruling

In trying to capsulize what is a complex issue, we read dozens of stories generated by the development brouhaha in St. Pete Beach, watched city commission meetings and spoke with people representing all sides.

We unequivocally come to one conclusion: The situation in St. Pete Beach is a mess.

After that, the analysis becomes less cut and dried. Here's how we see it. A group of St. Pete Beach residents, unhappy with the direction of their city government, successfully wrestled certain land use decisions out of the hands of elected leaders. The movement produced a backlash from both the government and pro-development forces, who then mounted their own political campaign to wrestle power back.

The power struggle has continued for close to four years.

That's a different storyline than what is envisioned under Amendment 4, where voters would act as a check on the decisions of local government. The amendment itself isn't designed to go around government the way the situation in St. Pete Beach played out. And it has nothing to do with citizens proposing amendments to the local comprehensive plan, like what has happened in St. Pete Beach.

Now, are the same lawsuits and political maneuvering possible? Absolutely. And maybe that's enough to make the analogy valid.

But voters should be wary in blindly believing that St. Pete Beach's experiences would be duplicated statewide should Amendment 4 pass. Opponents say St. Pete Beach's experience is a ""fair example"" of what could happen should Amendment 4 pass. We rate that claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809709DF80>],/factchecks/2010/mar/19/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/st-pete-beach-amendment-4-hometown-democracy/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'John Yarmuth']","
Yarmuth: 40 percent of health care reform opponents say bill doesn't go far enough
","Republicans have repeatedly made the case that the public believes the Democratic health care bill goes too far in restructuring the American health system. But on March 16, 2010, Rep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat from Kentucky, sought to remind the public that a lot of Americans don't think the bill goes far enough.""Madam Speaker,"" Yarmuth said in a House floor speech, ""every time I hear a Republican talking about health care reform, they say the American people don’t want it. They say it so much that I think they’re beginning to try to convince themselves that it’s true. But there’s a national poll that shows what the real story is. They asked, of all the people who are opposed to health care or say they are, how many are opposed to it because they don’t think it goes far enough. Forty percent. Almost 40 percent said that was the reason. They will not be unhappy when we pass health care reform.""Given a steady stream of polls showing a plurality or even a majority of Americans saying the bill goes too far, Yarmuth's number struck us as surprisingly high. So we decided to look into it.We asked Yarmuth's office which poll they were referring to. They said it was a poll conducted for McClatchy newspapers by Ipsos Public Affairs -- a credible firm that works with a variety of media outlets -- between Feb. 26 and Feb. 28, 2010. The poll asked 1,076 voters a series of questions about health care and other issues and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points.Specifically, it asked the following: ""You said you are opposed to the health care reform proposals presently being discussed. Is that because you favor health care reform overall but think the current proposals don't go far enough to reform health care, or you oppose health care reform overall and think the current proposals go too far in reforming health care?""All told, 37 percent of voters said that the current proposals ""don't go far enough to reform health care"" -- close enough, in our view, to make Yarmuth's ""almost 40 percent"" reference accurate.On the strategic level, Yarmuth may have a point that the invisibility of the doesn't-go-far-enough crowd in the public opinion wars may have hampered the proreform camp's cause.""There is reasonable evidence that the current bill looks weaker in public opinion polls because some 10 percent to 20 percent of the public say 'opposed' when they mean that they want more progressive, further-reaching reform,"" said Charles Franklin, a polling expert at the University of Wisconsin. Given the intense media focus on how well the Democratic plan polls, Franklin said, ""the irony is that progressives have made health care reform less likely to pass by [telling pollsters] they oppose this bill.""But while Yarmuth, in his basic analysis, got his facts right, it's also worth making a few cautionary points.• Even at nearly 40 percent, it's still a minority view among those who oppose the bill. The February Ipsos poll found that 54 percent -- a clear majority -- of those opposed to the health care bill said the bill went too far. (Another 10 percent said they opposed the bill but couldn't explain why.)• An earlier survey by the same pollster showed softer support for ""doesn't go far enough."" Ipsos asked the same question during a survey taken for McClatchy between Nov. 19 and Nov. 22, 2009. In that poll, 25 percent said they opposed the bill because it doesn't go far enough -- quite a bit lower than the 37 percent who said so three months later. In the earlier poll, 66 percent said they opposed it because it went too far, and 9 percent couldn't explain why they were opposed.• Most importantly, it's not necessarily clear what voters mean when they say the bill ""doesn't go far enough."" It could mean that the respondent prefers that the bill include the public option -- a more liberal idea that didn't make its way into the final measure -- or it could mean they think it doesn't go far enough in advancing conservative ideas like health savings accounts or medical malpractice reform.As Megan McArdle, a blogger for TheAtlantic.com, wrote in December, ""I could go down to [the libertarian Cato Institute] right now and poll 65 percent support for the proposition that the health care reform doesn't go far enough -- in the direction of taking away the employer health care tax exemption, means testing Medicare, and other ideas that no one would call 'left.' ""These variations became evident in a CBS News poll taken between Jan. 6-10, 2010. On three distinct issues, poll-takers asked all respondents whether the bill ""goes too far,"" ""doesn't go far enough,"" or is ""about right.""On how the bill handled providing health insurance ""to as many Americans as possible"" -- a factor of special interest to liberals -- ""doesn't go far enough"" edged ""goes too far"" by a slim 35 percent-32 percent margin. On how the bill handled controlling costs -- an issue favored by fiscal conservatives -- ""doesn't go far enough"" outpaced ""goes too far"" by a 39 percent-24 percent margin. And on regulating the health insurance industry, ""doesn't go far enough"" walloped ""goes too far"" by a 43 percent-27 percent margin.Trying to meld all these divergent strains into a single, reliable polling question is virtually impossible. Indeed, a look at the data makes clear a bedrock belief of pollsters -- that the framing and the precise wording of a question can make a huge difference in the results.Back to Yarmuth's claim. To his credit, he accurately cited a result from a legitimate poll. However, due to variations in wording and the complexity of polling this issue, there's quite a bit of uncertainty about what that result actually means. It does not conclusively demonstrate that, as Yarmuth put it, nearly 40 percent of voters ""will not be unhappy when we pass health care reform."" Some of those voters likely believe that the bill should have gone further in a conservative direction, not a liberal one, and they are unlikely to be happy if a Democratic bill passes. So we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AF6EC0>],/factchecks/2010/mar/19/john-yarmuth/yarmuth-40-percent-health-care-bill-opponents-say-/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Pelosi: CBO says health reform bill would cut deficits by $1.2 trillion in second decade
","Shortly after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its highly anticipated analysis of the economic impact of the health insurance reform legislation, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a press release listing several ""key points you need to know about the CBO score.""No. 1 on that list is, ""Based on a preliminary analysis from CBO, the legislation ... cuts the deficit."" More specifically, the release says the CBO report shows that the legislation cuts the deficit by $138 billion in the first ten years (2010-2019) and ""cuts the deficit by $1.2 trillion in the second 10 years.""There's no debate about the first 10 years: The CBO analysis clearly states that the health care bill passed by the Senate, together with the reconciliation proposal, ""would produce a net reduction in federal deficits of $138 billion over the 2010-2019 period as result of changes in direct spending and revenue.""The projection for the next decade is murkier.We've dealt with this issue of the second decade before, most recently when President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address that the Senate bill would ""bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades."" But these are new numbers from the CBO, taking into account the reconciliation bill, and since the deficit reduction in the second decade has clearly become a major talking point for Democratic leaders, we thought the issue was worth revisiting.First, the preliminary estimate released by the CBO on March 18, 2010, does not say the legislation will cut the deficit by $1.2 trillion in the second 10 years. Rather, it projects that in the second 10 years, the legislation would reduce deficits ""in a broad range around one-half percent of GDP.""In order to arrive at the $1.2 trillion figure, Pelosi -- and other Democratic leaders who have cited it -- had to extrapolate that number based on a forecast of where the gross domestic product will be 10 to 20 years from now (which the CBO doesn't do).Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, thinks Pelosi's estimate is actually a little conservative.Horney looked at the last year for which CBO projects the GDP, 2020. That year, CBO estimated GDP at just over $22.5 trillion, up 4 percent from the year before. If you project that GDP will continue to rise an average of 4 percent a year for each of the next 10 years after that, then the CBO's projection that the deficit will be reduced by half a percent of GDP translates to $1.4 trillion between 2010 and 2020.""So I don't think $1.2 trillion is an overstatement,"" Horney said.When you talk to the public, it doesn't do any good to talk in terms of percentages of GDP, he said. You've got to translate that into dollars.""It's perfectly reasonable to put that into terms people can understand,"" Horney said.But putting dollar figures on economic forecasts 10 to 20 years into the future is highly speculative stuff.In a letter accompanying the CBO's preliminary analysis, director Douglas W. Elmendorf noted that ""CBO does not generally provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period,"" but they made an exception because ""certain congressional rules require some information about the budgetary impact of legislation in subsequent decades,"" and because a number of legislators asked them to.In addition to presenting deficit cuts from the legislation as a percentage of GDP, rather than as a dollar figure, Elmendorf couched the figure with cautionary words, calling it a ""rough outlook"" with an ""even greater degree of uncertainty"" than the 10-year budget estimates. When it analyzed the Senate bill, the CBO said this: ""A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great. Among other factors, a wide range of changes could occur — in people’s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care (such as advances in medical research, technological developments, and changes in physicians’ practice patterns) — that are likely to be significant but are very difficult to predict, both under current law and under any proposal.""Elmendorf said the projection is also based on ""assuming that all of its provisions would continue to be fully implemented.""That's a big assumption.On Dec. 10, 2009, the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a report that concluded, for example, that the plan to reduce payment updates to health care providers through Medicare ""are unlikely to be sustainable on an annual basis"" and that further reductions in Medicare growth rates through the Independent Medicare Advisory Board ""may be difficult to achieve in practice.""Robert Book, a health economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Pelosi's deficit reduction number -- extrapolated from a forecast of the GDP -- is highly speculative.""GDP estimates are extremely uncertain,"" Book said. ""Ten years ago, who would have predicted we'd have a recession last year? Nobody could possibly have known that.""And besides, he said, if the plan reduces deficits ""it just means it raises taxes a lot.""""So the number is probably not right, and even if it were, it's meaningless,"" Book said.Bottom line, the CBO report says the health care bill -- with the proposed reconciliation -- would continue to improve the deficit situation in the second 10 years. But Pelosi's press release suggests the CBO came up with that $1.2 trillion number. It did not. In fact, the CBO has said a year-by-year projection of the bill's budget effect beyond the first 10 years would ""not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great."" It's natural to want to translate the CBO's GDP projection into actual dollars (Who can get their head around a half a percent of GDP 10 to 20 years from now?). And the GDP projections used to extrapolate the $1.2 trillion figure may be perfectly reasonable, if highly speculative. But Pelosi puts a firm number on a projection that CBO so carefully tried to hedge. And so we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B701C0>],/factchecks/2010/mar/18/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-cbo-says-health-reform-bill-would-cut-defic/

J.D. Hayworth claims Massachusetts ruling opens the door for man-horse marriage
","J.D. Hayworth, the former congressman running against Sen. John McCain in the Arizona Republican primary, was known for making provocative points as a conservative radio talk show host. He's proving every bit as provocative on the campaign trail. In an interview on radio station WORL in Orlando on March 14, 2010, Hayworth was talking about same-sex marriage. He's very much against it. But it was his comments about the prospect of someone walking down the aisle in Massachusetts with a horse that landed Hayworth in the national political news cycle. Let's get the full quote straight from the horse's mouth: ""You see, the Massachusetts Supreme Court, when it started this move toward same-sex marriage, actually defined marriage -- now get this -- it defined marriage as simply, quote, the establishment of intimacy,"" Hayworth said. ""Now how dangerous is that? I mean, I don't mean to be absurd about it, but I guess I can make the point of absurdity with an absurd point -- I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse, I guess you could marry your horse. It's just the wrong way to go, and the only way to protect the institution of marriage is with that federal marriage amendment that I support."" Whoa there. Really? Hayworth is talking about a landmark 2003 case in which the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled, 4-3, that gay couples have the right to marry under the state's Constitution. We took a long look at the 45-page decision in the case, Goodridge vs. the Department of Public Health. Since Hayworth suggested that he was quoting the phrase ""the establishment of intimacy,"" we searched for that first. It's not there. The word ""intimacy"" appears five times in the 45-page decision (actually six times, but one is a duplicate), but never in the context of being the sole definition of marriage. Here they are: * One section talks about how the Supreme Court has affirmed that ""the core concept of common human dignity protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution precludes government intrusion into the deeply personal realms of consensual adult expressions of intimacy and one's choice of an intimate partner."" * ""Marriage also bestows enormous private and social advantages on those who choose to marry. Civil marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family."" * ""Whether and whom to marry, how to express sexual intimacy, and whether and how to establish a family -- these are among the most basic of every individual's liberty and due process rights."" * ""Our laws of civil marriage do not privilege procreative heterosexual intercourse between married people above every other form of adult intimacy and every other means of creating a family."" * ""Similarly, the Supreme Court has called for increased due process protection when individual privacy and intimacy are threatened by unnecessary government imposition."" We're not sure how Hayworth gets from any of these to the court defining marriage as simply the establishment of intimacy. Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall of the state's Supreme Judicial Court began the ruling with these words: ""Marriage is a vital social institution. The exclusive commitment of two individuals to each other nurtures love and mutual support; it brings stability to our society. For those who choose to marry, and for their children, marriage provides an abundance of legal, financial, and social benefits. In return it imposes weighty legal, financial, and social obligations. The question before us is whether, consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution, the Commonwealth may deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry. We conclude that it may not. ""We are mindful that our decision marks a change in the history of our marriage law,"" Marshall wrote. ""Many people hold deep-seated religious, moral, and ethical convictions that marriage should be limited to the union of one man and one woman, and that homosexual conduct is immoral. Many hold equally strong religious, moral, and ethical convictions that same-sex couples are entitled to be married, and that homosexual persons should be treated no differently than their heterosexual neighbors. Neither view answers the question before us. Our concern is with the Massachusetts Constitution as a charter of governance for every person properly within its reach."" We italicized ""person"" to make a point. Justice John Greaney, who concurred, wrote in the ruling, ""We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others."" Again the word ""persons."" Moreover, Greaney noted that the ruling was strictly about whether people of the same sex could marry and ""it leaves intact the Legislature's broad discretion to regulate marriage."" Take a look at Massachusetts laws regarding who can marry (which includes age and residency requirements and prohibitions on marrying relatives) and you'll see the word ""persons"" over and over. Seems pretty straightforward to us, but we checked with a few legal experts in Massachusetts to get their take. ""The word 'establishment' doesn't occur in the opinion, and the six appearances of the word 'intimacy' aren't free-standing, so that the statement that the SJC 'defined' marriage 'simply' as 'the establishment of intimacy' is false,"" said Mark Tushnet a law professor at Harvard Law School. ""That's not to say that one couldn't extend the underlying principles articulated in Goodridge to other forms of intimacy, including, I suppose, bestiality, but there's nothing in Goodridge itself saying that the principles extend that far. And of course one need not extend the principles if there's some reason not to do so, as there surely would be in the case of bestiality."" Carissa Cunningham, director of public affairs for Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, which handled the Goodridge case, called Hayworth's comment ""silly."" ""It's so far off base,"" Cunningham said. The ruling, she said, ""didn't change anything there about the marriage law in Massachusetts,"" which very clearly spells out that marriage is only for people. We might have chalked this one up to a one-time misstatement, a bit of hyperbole on the long campaign trail, and simply rated it False. But then Hayworth went on The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC on March 15, 2010, and doubled down. Here's how that went: Maddow: ""Where does the establishment of intimacy thing come from? Where in Massachusetts law or in the Supreme Court ruling does it say the establishment of intimacy?"" Maddow said she had spent the afternoon looking for it, but couldn't find it anywhere. Hayworth: ""As we went back and reviewed that document back when the argument was made, the high court in Massachusetts defined marriage in a rather amorphous fashion, simply as quote, the establishment of intimacy. Now I think we all agree there's much more to marriage than that."" Maddow: ""Sir, I'm sorry, it didn't."" Hayworth: ""Okay, you and I have a disagreement."" Maddow then cited several uses of the word ""intimacy"" in the Supreme Court ruling. Maddow: ""The establishment of intimacy as the definition of marriage, it's just not there, let alone the horse thing. What you said about the establishment of intimacy being the definition of marriage in Massachusetts, I don't think it's true, sir."" Hayworth: ""Well, that's fine. You and I can have a disagreement about that."" Maddow: ""Well, it either is true or it isn't, it’s empirical."" Hayworth: ""I appreciate the fact that we have a disagreement on that."" We're with Maddow here. This isn't a matter of legal interpretation. The Massachusetts Supreme Court did not define marriage ""simply as quote, the establishment of intimacy.""

"['Florida', 'Alex Sink']","
Sink claims she refunded $1.2 million from an insurance fraud scam
","CFO Alex Sink, a Democrat running for governor, is appealing to Florida’s elderly by putting the spotlight on a two-year crackdown on an investment scam and refund to a Delray Beach woman. Sink wrote about the episode in a fundraising e-mail to supporters. ""As Florida’s CFO, I shut down [Larry] Krakow's scam and refunded more than $1.2 million to Josephine [Passinissi] and other victims of this con man,'' she said in an e-mail addressed to ""Dear Friend."" It said: ""Please contribute $25, or whatever you can, right now to help me keep fighting for Floridians like Josephine."" Sink’s e-mail contains several claims, but we're focusing on two: Whether the CFO's office shut down the investment ""scam"" and whether it returned $1.2 million to Passinissi and the others.Sink has been claiming credit for the crackdown and using it to promote her Safeguard Our Seniors Task Force since her office put out a release on Sept. 28, 2009, under the headline ""CFO Sink Returns $1.2 Million to Delray Beach Seniors Scammed out of Life Savings.""The Miami Herald wrote a brief item about the episode at the time that called it insurance fraud and likewise characterized it as Sink returning $1.2 million to four Delray Beach seniors ""after they were allegedly misled into buying equity indexed deferred annuities."" It said Larry Yale Krakow, who sold the investment products to them, was suspended from selling insurance and was ordered to pay a $25,000 fine.A deferred annuity is an investment product packaged with an insurance policy, in which an insurance company guarantees an income stream to the investor starting at a specified future date in return for a lump sum or series of payments. But the products are usually considered inappropriate for seniors because they tie up needed income.The Herald noted that annuities scams involving seniors have been a growing problem in Florida. And that the Department of Financial Services launched 267 senior annuity investigations in the fiscal year ending June 30.Kevin Cate, Sink's press secretary at the Florida Department of Financial Services, provided us with links to the Florida statutes that illustrate the CFO's authority on the topic. The law also notes the rights of victims not to be identified. He faxed us the 2008 and 2009 settlement agreements that resolved four citizens' complaints against the Allianz insurance company, which Krakow purportedly represented, brought by the Florida Department of Insurance Division of Legal Services. Each had the seniors' identities redacted, but a summary page showed the range in reimbursements. The smallest was $19,319.27, while the largest was for one investor with nine annuities valued at $932,837.09.His summary page also noted that, with subsequent settlements, the figure was more than $1.5 million, which was slightly higher than Sink had said. Sink’s office handled the case through its Division of Insurance Fraud, which is part of the Department of Financial Services.Reached by telephone, Passinissi confirmed the refund. She said her share of it was $270,000. A former owner of a private employment agency, Passinissi, 74, said she tried to get her money out of the annuity in 2008 by contacting the insurance firm itself -- to no avail. She mentioned her plight to a banker she knew, who sent her to Sink. Passinissi said she called and then wrote Sink directly -- and enclosed documents to illustrate the problem.Passinissi is happy to see Sink take credit.""She wrote to me way, way back and I remember I was very impressed. She said, 'Don’t worry we’ll get to the bottom of it.' After that she sent a person to get a deposition from me, to get the facts,"" Passinissi said.As CFO, Sink oversees the Department of Financial Services, which investigated the complaints and arranged for people such as Passinissi to recoup their money. Sink's claim actually understates the amount that was recouped (she said $1.2 million when it ultimately totaled $1.5 million), but we find she can rightly claim credit for the department's work.So we rate Sink’s claim to be True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809797B540>],/factchecks/2010/mar/18/alex-sink/sink-claims-she-refunded-12-million-insurance-frau/

Stearns says House Democrats trample procedures in health care vote
","Ever heard of ""deem and pass""?It may sound like a football play, but it's actually House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's favored procedural maneuver to pass health care reform in the lower chamber.Such legislative gymnastics have Republicans up in arms, including Florida Rep. Cliff Stearns, who lamented the tactic on the House floor.""There is no precedent for what the Democrats are doing with this deception,"" he said on March 15, 2010. ""We have never written a reconciliation bill to amend a law that does not exist.""Stearns is talking about a series of procedural tools that House and Senate Democrats plan to use to pass their health care overhaul. He and his fellow Republicans say the unprecedented move flouts congressional rules and may even be unconstitutional. We'll leave questions of unconstitutionality to the lawyers. For this fact-check, we're going to look at whether Stearns is correct that there is no precedent for the Democrats' efforts and that Congress has ""never written a reconciliation bill to amend a law that does not exist.""But before we can decide if he's correct, here are some essentials for understanding the arcane world of congressional procedure. Listen up, because you're going to be hearing these terms thrown around a lot as Congress gears up for a showdown on the health care overhaul. Reconciliation: Bills considered under this procedure cannot be filibustered; they only need a simple majority to pass. Reconciliation was created as part of the 1974 Congressional Budget Act in an effort to make it easier to bring revenues and spending in line with caps set by the annual budget resolution. While the founders of the procedure did not envision it as a way to fast-track policy legislation, Congress has nevertheless used it to pass non-budget-related measures, including welfare reform in 1996 and changes to Medicare and Medicaid. ""Deem and Pass:"" This phrase refers to a House tactic that allows it to pass a bill without actually having a roll call vote on the legislation; it is technically known as a ""self-executing rule."" Here's how it works: The House Rules Committee is in charge of writing rules -- a playbook of sorts -- for floor debate. The rule dictates what amendments can be offered to a given bill and how long the bill will be debated, for example. A self-executing rule is essentially a two-for-one special; when the House votes to adopt a self-executing rule, it simultaneously adopts a separate bill or amendment, which is specified in the rule itself. In short, the House ""deems"" another bill to be passed as soon as it adopts the rule. The House and Senate have both passed versions of the health care bill. There are big differences between the two, so typically the two chambers would pick a handful of lawmakers to hash out those discrepancies in something called a conference committee. Then, the House and Senate would vote once again on the final product, called a conference report. But Senate Democrats lost their 60-vote, filibuster-proof majority in January 2010, when Republican Sen. Scott Brown won a special election in Massachusetts. That means Senate Republicans could effectively block a conference report. Complicating the process is the fact that a number of House Democrats don't like the Senate bill. Among other things, they oppose a tax on Cadillac insurance plans and a special Medicare perk for Nebraska.So, where does that leave the Democrats? With one seriously complicated strategy to pass health care reform. Here's how the whole thing could go down: The Rules Committee will cobble together a self-executing rule for the House to consider the package of reconciliation fixes to the Senate bill -- for example, the elimination of special Medicaid subsidies for patients in Nebraska and other states -- but that also includes language that ""deems"" the Senate bill passed once the House adopts the rule. Meanwhile, the Senate parliamentarian has said that the Senate bill must be signed by the president before any of the House changes can be made. So, presumably, President Barack Obama will put his stamp of approval on the bill as soon as the House deems it passed. Then, the Senate will debate the package of reconciliation fixes already passed by the House. The package of fixes will only need a simple majority to pass, but there's still plenty that could derail the package. The tactic serves two purposes: It prevents House Democrats who don't like the Senate bill from ever having to vote on it, and it potentially solves the problem of making changes to the Senate bill without needing 60 votes to pass them. Republicans are calling foul. They say the Democratic strategy is unfair and potentially unconstitutional.""What's really remarkable about this whole business is that not only the American people rejected this plan but Democrats are so desperate to pass it that they're willing to trample on the traditional rules of the House and Senate and even trample on the Constitution of the United States to get it done,"" said Indiana Republican Mike Pence. But is it unprecedented as Stearns claims? In fact, self-executing rules are relatively common in the House. For instance, the chamber employed the procedure on Feb. 3, 2010, to adopt a Senate amendment to a resolution concerning increasing the statutory limit on federal debt. The procedure was used 36 times by the House Republican leadership between 2005 and 2006 and 49 times by the Democratic leadership between 2007 and 2008, according to Brookings Institution congressional scholar Thomas Mann, writing for Politico. Furthermore, the reconciliation process has been used over and over again for policy-related measures. For instance, in 1996 Congress used reconciliation to make big changes to welfare, including separating it from Medicaid. Norm Ornstein, another leading congressional scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, pointed out that the Republicans used a very similar tactic to what the Democrats are now proposing in 2006. At the time, they used a self-executing rule to pass $38.8 billion in budget cuts without having to vote on an immigration measure.So, there's a whole lot of precedent for the individual tactics Democrats are proposing to use, though the specific combination of a self-executing rule and reconciliation is a bit unusual, said Jim Horney, a budget expert at the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. ""There's nothing about [the process] that's dramatically at odds with the way things get done,"" Horney said. ""With almost every bill, you can find some way in which the circumstances are a little different. But to imply that it's somehow a big departure from the way things are done could be wrong.""Donald Wolfensberger served on the House Rules Committee for more than a decade, and was around when reconciliation was first used. He continues to follow Congress closely as director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and agrees with Horney and the other congressional experts we spoke with that there's precedent, but not for this specific tack.The 2006 instance mentioned by Ornstein is ""the closest analogy"" to what the Democrats are now proposing. ""It would be pretty similar,"" he said. Wolfensberger also said it's the first time he's seen Congress write a ""a reconciliation bill to amend a law that does not exist,"" as Stearns said. On that point, Stearns is correct, he said; the president will not have signed the Senate bill before the House passes the package of fixes. So, that brings us back to Stearns' original claim. While the combination of a self-executing rule and reconciliation is a relatively novel combination of procedural tools, all the congressional experts we spoke with agreed that there are plenty of similar examples of what the Democrats are proposing to do, nor is the party flouting procedures that are already on the books. As a result, the first part of Stearns's claim is somewhat misleading. However, Stearns is correct that this is the first time Congress has ever written a reconciliation bill to amend a law that does not exist. As a result, we find Stearns' claim to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979D5880>],/factchecks/2010/mar/17/cliff-stearns/stearns-says-house-democrats-trample-procedures-he/

Voter control over land use issues has cost St. Pete Beach 'hundreds of thousands' in legal bills, group claims
","
Putting land use decisions directly in voters' hands will lead to an avalanche of lawsuits that is costly for taxpayers, says a group opposing a ballot initiative that would give voters more authority over those decisions.

Amendment 4, which will appear on ballots in November, essentially would give citizens veto power over major development proposals and land use changes.

Opponents to the amendment point to big legal bills in the 10,000-person town of St. Pete Beach as an example of the consequences of the measure. St. Pete Beach adopted a similar citizens' initiative process in 2006.

Since 2006, ""the taxpayers of St. Pete Beach have had to pay hundreds of thousands in legal bills,"" says the group Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, an offshoot of Floridians for Smarter Growth. The groups are being funded by business interests, including the Florida Chamber of Commerce, Publix and statewide homebuilders.

As we mentioned in our earlier item on Amendment 4, there is a debate between supporters and opponents whether St. Pete Beach's experiences are analogous to the statewide ballot proposal. And while we plan to explore that analogy in a future Truth-O-Meter item, we still are examining the individual claims in the ad.

St. Pete Beach certainly has had its share of legal issues since voters narrowly adopted City Charter changes in 2006 that require voter approval on amendments to the city's road map for growth, the Comprehensive Plan. Some lawsuits were brought by the city, others were brought by the groups proposing the citizen approvals, others came from developers.

In September 2009, city commissioners noted that they were party to five different lawsuits related to the development approval process. At the end of November, the total was six.

Most of the lawsuits relate to the city's development approval process.

The most contentious suit is about a series of comprehensive plan amendments approved in 2008 that were believed to be friendly to developers. A group opposed to those amendments -- the same group that originally petitioned to create the voter approval process -- claims that the ballot questions were not worded properly.

What's the cost to taxpayers for all this litigation?

Ryan Houck, executive director of Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, told PolitiFact Florida that the total is nearly $700,000. That's out of the city's $20.4 million annual budget.

The city itself previously has provided differing estimates.

In January, the St. Petersburg Times reported that legal fees associated with the development lawsuits have cost the city more than $300,000, with the costs spread out over four years. That figure was based on statements made by St. Pete Beach City Manager Mike Bonfield.

But on Feb. 23, 2010, City Attorney Susan Churuti (the former Pinellas County attorney) told city commissioners the legal fees associated with development lawsuits were ""something in the range of $200,000.""

Churuti, who works for the Tampa firm Bryant Miller Olive, said that was an unusually large amount of legal work for a town the size of St. Pete Beach.

""For the size of your jurisdiction, you got a lot going on,"" Churuti told commissioners. ""It's not normal.""

Churuti said that because of scheduled hearings, and other court actions, the total legal bill is sure to rise.

Because the numbers were so different, we went to the city's finance director, Elaine Edmunds, for an explanation. She referred us to Collette Graston, Bonfield's executive assistant. Graston has been asked to keep track of all the legal expenses related to the comprehensive plan lawsuits.

Including bills paid in March 2010, the city has spent a total of $734,000 on the development lawsuits, Graston said. The difference between the other city figures are most likely because they are old figures, or were in reference to only one particular case.

""You're not the first person to ask,"" Graston said. ""And you won't be the last.""

No matter the dollar figure, attorney's fees clearly have been a central discussion point at City Commission meetings. City Manager Mike Bonfield said the city has exceeded its legal budget several years in a row, almost entirely because of development related lawsuits. And one city commissioner last year proposed raising the tax rate slightly to add $50,000 to the city's legal budget. The reason? Primarily to fight the development lawsuits.

That's the point Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy is trying to make in its Internet ad. The group says the ""the taxpayers of St. Pete Beach have had to pay hundreds of thousands in legal bills"" fighting lawsuits related to contentious development approvals. The person tasked with keeping count says the bill is now $734,000. So we rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979ECAC0>],/factchecks/2010/mar/17/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/voter-control-over-land-use-issues-has-cost-st-pet/

Axelrod says Supreme Court ruling enables lobbyists to threaten lawmakers
","In his 2010 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama blasted a landmark 5-4 Supreme Court decision that lifted restrictions on campaign spending by corporations. Television cameras in the House chamber showed that Justice Samuel Alito was visibly irked by the president's criticism, prompting a flurry of media coverage. Chief Justice John Roberts gave the controversy new life when he publicly questioned whether Supreme Court justices should attend the address, which Roberts said had ""degenerated into a political pep rally."" But the controversy seems to have only emboldened the White House to keep up its criticism of the high court's decision. On the March 14, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, David Axelrod, a top White House confidante to the president, took aim once again at the decision. ""Under the ruling of the Supreme Court, any lobbyist could go into any legislator and say, 'If you don't vote our way on this bill, we're going to run a million-dollar campaign against you in your district,' "" Axelrod said. ""And that is a threat to our democracy. It's going to further reduce the voice of the American people, and it's something we have to push back vigorously on."" We checked with a variety of legal experts about whether Axelrod was right. Most agreed that his comments were technically accurate but misleading. First, let's review what the Supreme Court said in the case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. The majority of justices overturned previous decisions that prohibited, in the court's words, ""corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an ‘electioneering communication' or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate."" While corporations are still barred from giving directly to candidates, they are no longer forced to create political action committees, or PACs, in order to spend money on direct electioneering. A corporation, the justices held, may simply spend funds from its own accounts for that purpose. Here are the main concerns we heard from our experts: • What Axelrod said is correct, but it could have happened even before the Citizens United ruling.  It's true, as the White House argues, that the Citizens United decision makes it easier for corporations to make the kinds of threats that Axelrod mentions. Now, rather than having to establish a PAC -- which must abide by stringent rules on soliciting donations from employees -- corporations may spend money directly from their own coffers on direct electioneering. That way, they avoid the regulatory hoops required of using a PAC. Also, because of the ruling, corporations may now run ads that ""expressly advocate"" the election or defeat of candidates. Before Citizens United, they had to word their corporate-funded ads carefully in order to address issues instead of directly urging viewers to ""vote for"" or ""vote against"" a particular candidate. And restrictions on the timing of ads are now out the window. However, the specific scenario Axelrod cited – that ""any lobbyist could go into any legislator and say, if you don't vote our way on this bill, we're going to run a million-dollar campaign against you in your district"" – could have happened before Citizens United, as well. First, several legal experts said they don't believe the Axelrod scenario would have been prohibited by congressional ethics rules or corruption statutes. Second, any corporation with enough resources in its PAC could have threatened to run, and run, ""a million-dollar campaign"" against a lawmaker in his or her district. It's true that it would have been more complicated to have raised those million dollars using a PAC, but it would have been feasible for a corporation that was big enough and determined enough to do it. Third, lobbyists aren't the only ones who could have made such a threat before (or after) Citizens United. ""The Democratic National Committee can say, ‘If you don't vote with us on this bill, we'll support a primary challenge with $1 million in independent expenditures,' "" said Bradley A. Smith, a former Federal Election Commission member who now teaches law at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio. And fourth, privately owned companies – essentially, a wealthy individual – could already run million-dollar campaigns against candidates under existing rules, especially so-called 527 groups (that is, lightly regulated groups named for the section of the tax code they are organized under). It's true that Citizens United further loosens the restrictions on such groups, but they had already been able to run issue advertising campaigns of unlimited size for years. Axelrod's formulation ""really misses the point, because it raises concerns that existed before Citizens United,"" said Rob Kelner, who chairs the election and political law practice group at the law firm Covington and Burling. • There are practical constraints that would make the Axelrod scenario unlikely to happen. ""Could that happen?"" asks Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in ethics and lobbying law at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Arent Fox. ""Yes, and I could win a gold medal in the next Olympic marathon. Would either of those things happen in reality? No. Any lobbyist who was stupid enough to make such a threat would become persona non grata on Capitol Hill in, oh, about an hour after the threat was made."" Kappel added that large, publicly traded companies aren't likely to do the kind of advertising newly permissible under Citizens United, since getting directly involved in partisan politics ""runs the risk of alienating half of a company's customers and shareholders, not to mention the possibility of consumer boycotts of the company's goods and services."" We ran these arguments by the White House, and spokeswoman Katherine Bedingfield said that the White House stands by Axelrod's portrayal. ""The Citizens United decision opened the floodgates for special interests and corporations to make unlimited expenditures to influence American elections,"" she said. ""As a result, corporations have significantly more leeway to run ads prior to an election, and they can now target elected officials in ways that were not possible before. They also have vastly more money to spend, with far fewer restrictions on how they spend it, as a result of the decision. That's why the president has called for bipartisan support for legislation to repair the damage done by this unprecedented and troubling decision."" The merits of the Citizens United decision are a legitimate topic for debate. But here, we'll stick to the narrower question of whether Axelrod correctly described the law's impact on his scenario. Based on our discussions with experts, we'd characterize the Citizens United decision as something that opens the door to Axelrod's scenario wider than it had been, not a decision that makes the scenario possible for the first time. Axelrod is correct that under Citizens United, making that kind of threat to a lawmaker is possible -- but by implying that Citizens United is what made it possible, his comment is somewhat misleading. We found broad expert agreement that lobbyists had been legally able to make such threats even before the Citizens United ruling was handed down. As a result, we'd argue that Axelrod's example loses some of its relevance and urgency. So we rate Axelrod's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D46800>],/factchecks/2010/mar/17/david-axelrod/axelrod-says-supreme-court-ruling-enables-lobbyist/

Rush Limbaugh says because of Obama, people can't go fishing anymore
","Since President Barack Obama took office, he's been accused of overturning a number of all-American traditions, including Christmas trees at the White House and gun rights.Now, Obama apparently wants to ban a popular American pastime: fishing.On his March 9, 2010, talk show, Rush Limbaugh claimed that, ""fishing is on the verge becoming a privilege controlled by Barack Obama."" He went on to say that he's only had a few experiences with the sport, but that, ""I know a lot of people, former professional athletes, who go into shock after hearing they can't go fishing anymore because of Obama.""Like so many claims we check at PolitiFact, this one was messy. It started, of all places, with a story from ESPNOutdoors.com, was picked up by conservative bloggers, and then made its way to Limbaugh's radio show and other outlets including Glenn Beck's evening program on Fox News. In the process, the story changed.So, we'll do our best to sort through the rhetorical rubble.To support his claim, Limbaugh points to an article that appeared on ESPNOutdoors.com on March 9, 2010. The article, written by Robert Montgomery, reported that, ""The Obama administration will accept no more public input for a federal strategy that could prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing the nation's oceans, coastal areas, Great Lakes, and even inland waters."" This quote was pulled from the Web site of left-wing media watchdog Media Matters. Montgomery later changed his column, so the original language is no longer on the ESPNOutdoors site. But more about that later.Montgomery was writing about Obama's Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force, a 24-member group headed by the chair of Obama's Council on Environmental Quality. In June 2009, Obama created the task force to develop a national policy to protect, maintain and restore oceans, coasts and the Great Lakes. He asked the group recommend a framework for improved stewardship and effective coastal and marine spatial planning; the group released a draft of its recommendations in December 2009. Among other things, it recommends creating nine regional planning areas to carry out the framework. In plain English, the Obama administration is drafting new plans for waterway conservation. ""Spatial planning"" is jargon for making sure that waterways are being used in the most economically and environmentally friendly way, explained Beth Lowell, federal policy director for ocean conservation group Oceana. If a body of water has no biological value, perhaps it's best used for a wind farm, she gave as an example. Or if there's a vulnerable coral reef in the area, the framework will help sort out what kinds of fishing can be done on the surface so as not to disturb the ecosystem below.So, the framework may mean changes in fishing practices in some areas, depending on the location, the local economy and specific ecological problems. Indeed, the draft framework states that plans ""are expected to vary from region to region according to the specific needs, capacity, and issues particular to each region."" Almost instantaneously, conservative bloggers picked up on Montgomery's story. Michelle Malkin wrote, ""Sacrificing jobs for the green agenda. Conducting Kabuki theater on public input. Business as usual for the Obama White House.""And from Gateway Pundit: ""Obama’s latest assault on your rights– He wants to ban sport fishing. Barack Obama has a message for America’s 60,000,000 anglers – We don't need you."" The meme found its way to the desks of Limbaugh and of Beck, who implied on his March 10, 2010, show that Obama was banning fishing by executive order.""Obama will no longer listen to the public as he tries to prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing on some of the nation's oceans, coastal areas and Great Lakes and even some inland waters,"" he said. ""No more fishing. . . . Some environmentalists want to save the fish. Forget about the frickin' fish! People are losing their rights.""(We should point out that Obama has not banned fishing through executive order, so Beck is wrong on that point.)The firestorm prompted ESPNOutdoors executive editor Steve Bowman to issue a statement on the story. He wrote that the news organization should have made it clear that the story was an opinion column in a series of stories on the implications of Obama's new task force. ""While our series overall has examined several sides of the topic, this particular column was not properly balanced and failed to represent contrary points of view,"" Bowman wrote. ""We have reached out to people on every side of the issue and reported their points of view -- if they chose to respond -- throughout the series, but failed to do so in this specific column.""Media Matters also noted that the first paragraph of Montgomery's story now reads that the administration's plan ""could prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing some of the nation's oceans, coastal areas, Great Lakes, and even inland waters."" (The emphasis is ours to show the difference between Montgomery's first and second iteration of the column.)The column still fails to mention that the administration has made no final decisions on the recommendations. And while the framework could change some fishing practices as Lowell points out, the draft proposals do not say anything about banning recreational fishing as the column implies. Here's what Christine Glunz, spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, had to say about the issue: ""The draft reports issued by the Ocean Policy Task Force have involved extensive stakeholder input and public participation as they were being prepared, which has included the interests of conservationists and the recreational fishing community. These draft reports are not map-drawing exercises, they do not contain a zoning plan, and they do not establish any restrictions on recreational fishing or on public access, nor make any judgments about whether one ocean activity or use is better than another.''And Eric Schwaab, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's assistant administrator for fisheries, simply stated in a March 10, 2010, statement that ""the Ocean Policy Task Force has not recommended a ban on recreational fishing."" Like many things we check at PolitiFact, this claim is like sausage: It went in the meat processor that is the Internet as one thing and came out quite different. An opinion piece that argued Obama's effort could ban some fishing was chopped up, reprocessed and put back together as a claim that Obama wants to ban all fishing. In fact, the draft framework says nothing about banning fishing. Limbaugh has taken an early discussion about the use of waterways and twisted it to make it sound like Obama is outlawing a popular pastime. While the panel's recommendation could change fishing practices in some areas, the framework is still in draft form; the administration has not made any final decisions on what the framework will look like. But Limbaugh is grossly distorting the truth. Pants on Fire! ",[<zip object at 0x00000280979FAA00>],/factchecks/2010/mar/17/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-because-obama-people-cant-go-fi/

Gov. Rick Perry says his border security efforts led to 60-percent drop in crime along Texas-Mexico border
","At a time when violence along the U.S.-Mexico border is again in the news, Texas Gov. Rick Perry makes an eye-catching claim on his campaign Web site: ""Governor Perry's border security efforts have led to a 60 percent decrease in border crime."" We had lots of questions about that, so we went looking for answers. In 2005, saying the federal government had not done enough to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, Perry announced he was investing in state border security efforts. His plans included helping local law enforcement agencies hire additional officers, buying the agencies equipment, assigning Texas Department of Public Safety personnel to the border and installing surveillance cameras. According to Perry's office, the governor spent about $30 million from his office's budget on the operations in fiscal years 2006-07. The Legislature allocated $110 million for border efforts in 2008-09 and more than $110 million for 2010-11, for a total of $250 million to date. And what was the impact of the efforts? Perry's campaign pointed us to a report from the Texas Border Security Council, whose members were appointed by Perry. According to a chart in the report, ""serious"" crime in the border counties dropped 65 percent in the two-year period between the third quarter of 2005 — when Texas funding for border operations started — and the third quarter of 2007. We learned that backup for the chart came from the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Reporting program, which tracks the incidences of seven ""index"" crimes: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft. However, the chart (dubbed ""Texas Border Counties Crime Index"") is only that: a jagged line on a page, rising and falling between 2004 and 2007. It doesn't detail specific crime data from border localities, making it impossible to tell exactly where crime dropped, by how much and in which categories.Seeking more detail, we talked to the Texas Department of Public Safety, which reports the state's crime numbers to the FBI. We then learned that the chart was drawn from data that omitted significant facts.The Border Security Council report only counted crimes from unincorporated areas of counties along the border which, it states, accounts for 93 percent of the 1,254 miles of the Texas-Mexico border. By taking that approach, the report excludes all the border region's towns and cities including major population centers such as El Paso, Laredo, Brownsville, McAllen and Harlingen. By our analysis, more than 75 percent of the population in the border counties lived in incorporated areas in 2007, the last year covered in the chart. What's wrong with leaving out the urban areas? More crimes usually occur where more people live. Consider El Paso County. According to DPS data, the sheriff's department there reported 1,350 ""index"" crimes in the county's unincorporated areas in 2005. Adding in offenses reported by the city's police department and other law enforcement agencies in the county causes the ""index"" crimes to total 25,134. Data provided by DPS to support the chart shows that crimes in unincorporated border areas dropped 65 percent between the third quarter of 2005 and the third quarter of 2007. But that only compares two different quarters. When we looked at crime over all three years of data — 2005 through 2007 -- the decline amounted to less than 1 percent. We also considered the data for both urban and rural areas of all the border counties during those years. The total number of ""index"" or serious crimes rose from 103,884 in 2005 to 103,986 in 2007. The ""index"" crime data omits crimes that may occur at higher rates in border regions, including drug offenses and human trafficking. Without those numbers, the border crime story is incomplete. We asked for that data. The DPS says it doesn't collect it but plans to in the future. Separately, the U.S. Border Control offered information on only two enforcement actions that the agency tracks: the number of foreign nationals caught for being in the United States illegally — what it calls ""apprehensions"" — and the amount of drugs seized. Apprehensions in the Border Patrol sectors that include Texas dropped 58 percent from fiscal 2005 through 2009. The amount of drugs seized — measured in pounds of marijuana, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and others — more than doubled. Border Patrol spokesman Mark L. Qualia and Tony Payan, an expert on the U.S.-Mexico border and political science professor at the University of Texas-El Paso, agreed that some crimes happen more often in border areas because of the large numbers of people passing through. Qualia cited trespassing and shoplifting as examples of such ""transient"" crimes. Such caveats undermine Perry's claim -- and build a case that border crime is a complicated subject. As for not counting crimes in cities and towns to assess changes in the border region, Payan said: ""This strikes me as sheer manipulation of geographical areas and numbers in order to make the governor look good."" When we asked the governor's office for an explanation of the report's methodology, we were referred to the DPS, whose spokeswoman Tela Mange said: ""We were focusing on the unincorporated areas ... because that is where much of the illegal activity involving human and contraband smuggling occurs."" That may be, though neither the state of Texas nor the Border Patrol gave us data on that activity. Don Reay, executive director of the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, said that members of his group still believe that crime has gone down and that Perry deserves credit for improving the situation on the border -- though not all the credit. ""Crime has gone down based on cooperation between counties, between the state and between the federal government,"" Reay said. Since 2006, Washington has spent more than $3.7 billion on border security, although Qualia said he could not say exactly how much of the money went to the southwestern or Texas border. Some of the major initiatives have been to hire more Border Patrol agents and build hundreds of miles of fencing. Payan also said that outside factors could have caused border crime to decline. He cited the war raging between drug cartels in Mexico, which he says has limited the cartels' ability to do business across the Rio Grande. Perry's claims about reducing border crime have come under scrutiny before. In 2006, the El Paso Times investigated his statements touting the impact of Operation Rio Grande, which shifted DPS officers and other state resources to border areas. That October, Perry's office trumpeted in a press release: ""Crime down 60 percent across the border."" The Times questioned the statistic, noting it was based on average crime reductions in ""several"" counties -- not the entire border region -- where the state participated in ""surge"" operations over a four-month period. The operations beefed up federal, state and local law enforcement personnel in selected rural areas; urban areas weren't included in the statistics. That's relatively old news. What about more recently? We checked the latest available UCR crime data in both urban and non-incorporated areas along the Texas border in 2008, as reported by the DPS. Overall, serious crime went up 1.6 percent from 2007. Summing up: Perry's claim that his border security efforts have led to a 60 percent drop in crime doesn't hold water. The calculation he touts doesn't consider crimes committed in cities and towns where most border residents live. It also compared two calendar quarters rather than weighing years' worth of data. Crime may have temporarily subsided in some rural areas of the border region. However, it's not clear how much of any decline can be traced to the state's investment in security. We rate Perry's sweeping statement based on an unreasonable manipulation of crime statistics -- the second instance of his administration touting questionable border crime numbers -- as Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2FFCC0>],/factchecks/2010/mar/16/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-his-border-security-efforts-le/

Referendums over growth issues forced city to raise taxes, group claims
","
In its campaign to discredit a ballot initiative giving voters more authority over land use, a statewide political action committee says voters only need to look at tiny St. Pete Beach and its problems since adopting a similar policy.

Amendment 4, which will appear on ballots in November, essentially would give citizens veto power over major development proposals and land use changes. Opponents say a similar citizen initiative on growth and planning in St. Pete Beach has resulted in government run amok.

""The seemingly endless lawsuits (as a result of the changes) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate. Now this idea threatens every town in Florida,"" a narrator states during a 2 minute, 15 second Web ad produced by a group called Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy. The group is an offshoot of Floridians for Smarter Growth, which is funded by developers, home builders, U.S. Sugar, and other business groups.

We'll begin by noting that there is considerable debate between supporters and opponents of Amendment 4 if St. Pete Beach's experiences are truly analogous to the statewide ballot proposal. We plan to examine the analogy in a future Truth-O-Meter item. But because the advertisement is now on the Web, we'll still examine the individual claims.

For this item, we need to go way back in time, back to the day that developers actually were interested in building condo high rises, back when developers wanted to cram as many units as they could onto a property, back when people actually could flip condos for substantial profits. Yep, way back to 2005.

Back then, St. Pete Beach's five-member City Commission was considering changing the town's road map for growth, the Comprehensive Plan. The commission considered incentives to lure additional hotels that could increase the density of a development and change the allowed uses.

The talk of change didn't sit well with many residents, who formed a group called Citizens for Responsible Growth. They collected enough petitions to get a proposal on the ballot that would require voter approval for height increases and other changes to land use plans.

It got contentious. The city sued to stop the vote, and appeared to have won, but then lost on appeal. A developer also sued saying the petition process was costing him money.

Voters narrowly approved most of the changes to the City Charter in November 2006, making St. Pete Beach the first town in Florida where residents directly controlled development decisions. Voters also elected two members of Citizens for Responsible Growth to the City Commission, giving them a majority.

That prompted a pro-developer group -- Save Our Little Village -- to start its own petition drive to amend the city's comprehensive plan. The city's elected officials -- who had gone from being largely pro-development to anti-development -- tried to stop them.

It got even more contentious. Save Our Little Village sued. The city's attorney resigned under pressure from the commission.

Then, another election, another change of power and eventually, another referendum. This time, the pro-development side won. By December 2009, the city was involved in six different lawsuits prompted by the policy.

Now there's another lawsuit and talk of another petition drive. Whew.

Again, we're not ready to address the question of the similarity between the beach policy and Amendment 4. We're here to examine the policy's impact on the city's tax rate.

And yes, in 2009, the city did increase its tax rate .107 mills (or $0.107 for every $1,000 of taxable value). The tax rate increase raised about $255,000 citywide, according to the city budget.

During the Sept. 21, 2009, meeting where the tax rate increase was approved, there were two main reasons cited:
  

Parent said he was worried that after the city overshot its legal budget in 2008-2009 by about $100,000, that it would do so again.

""Without additional budgeted funds, it could force us to reduce some other things,"" said Parent, who suggested the city's Fourth of July fireworks display could be impacted. But after discussion, and after consultation with City Attorney Michael Davis, commissioners decided to to leave the legal budget the same.

After reviewing the discussion and interviewing Bonfield, we conclude that declining property values appeared to be the most significant factor, although the cost of legal fees was also discussed.

""I guess you could attribute the extra legal fees as a reason why we needed to raise millage,"" Bonfield said. ""But nobody said we need to raise this millage to put it in a fund for legal. I wouldn't say there's a direct correlation.""

In its ad, the group Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy says St. Pete Beach's local version of Amendment 4 resulted in ""seemingly endless lawsuits (that) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate."" 
Yes, there were lawsuits, but they weren't the only costs mentioned for the city legal department. Yes, the city slightly raised its rate in 2009 -- although the net result still was a decrease on most homeowners because of sharply falling property values.

But the discussion at a town meeting indicates that the decision was motivated by several factors, most notably the decline in property values, as well as legal fees. So we find the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979C6480>],/factchecks/2010/mar/16/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/referendums-over-growth-issues-forced-city-raise-t/

Ad claims if health reform bill passes, government panel could make laws that limit preventive services like mammograms
","A new TV ad from Americans for Prosperity, a group opposing the health reform bill, suggests that screening mammograms for women under 50 would be in jeopardy if the bill passes. The ad, running in 18 key congressional districts through March 18, 2010, features an appeal from breast cancer survivor Tracy Walsh of North Augusta, S.C. ""I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 43,"" Walsh begins. ""My mother died of cancer. But early detection saved my life. Now a government panel, that didn't include cancer specialists, says women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50. That saves money, but could cost your life. If I had followed the new government guidelines on mammograms, my cancer would have spread undetected, and my chances of survival would have been reduced. If government takes over health care, recommendations like these could become the law for all kinds of diseases."" There's an awful lot of misinformation and distortion packed into to these few sentences, and we'll have to take them one at a time. But first, some background. In November 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued controversial recommendations regarding breast cancer screenings, including one that challenged the long-standing convention that women between the ages of 40 and 50 should get routine mammograms. Specifically, the task force dropped the need for regular mammography screenings for women between 40 and 50 from a Grade B to a Grade C. Grade B means there is ""high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial"" and therefore the screening is recommended. Grade C, however, means that there is ""at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small."" As a result, the task force recommended against routinely providing the screening unless ""other considerations support the offering or providing the service in an individual patient."" Enter the Senate version of the health care bill (which is largely the working bill for now). It would create a health care exchange for people who do not get their insurance through their employer. Among other intended benefits, it would allow people in the so-called individual market to get group rates. Private health insurance companies that wish to compete for business in the exchange would have to offer a minimum package of coverage described in the bill. And among those minimum standards, they'd have to cover the entire cost of ""evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of 'A' or 'B' in the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force."" That's the underpinning of the argument from Americans for Prosperity. Now, to unravel some of the distortion. First and foremost, the task force did not say women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50. Diana Petitti, former vice chair of the task force, said the report has been wildly misrepresented on this point. ""The report says that when you hit 40, you should start having conversations with your physician about whether you want to have a mammogram,"" she said. ""There is no reason they shouldn't get a mammogram if they decide to get a mammogram. There is nothing in it that attempts to deny or affect the coverage for mammograms for women aged 40 to 49."" The report found there was insufficient backing to support the idea that routine mammograms should be automatic for all women 40 to 50, but it noted that there were many women for whom they would be appropriate, and that ""the decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take patient context into account, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms."" Among those who should get routine mammograms under 50? Women with a history of cancer in their family, like Walsh, Petitti said. Dr. Petitti also takes umbrage at Walsh's claim that the panel didn't include cancer specialists. She is the former vice chair of the Institute of Medicine National Cancer Policy Board and vice chair of an Institute of Medicine committee that issued a report, ""Beyond Mammography."" Dr. Allen Dietrich is director of Population Sciences at an NCI-designated Cancer Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock medical center. And Dr. Sanford Schwartz has also published on the topic of mammography, she noted. In addition, she said, the recommendations were reviewed by oncologists, including a preventive oncologist, and by radiologists. The task force was established to provide an ""independent voice"" and ""sound, evidence-based recommendations for preventive services,"" said Alina Salganicoff, vice president and director of women's health policy at the independent Kaiser Family Foundation. As for Walsh's comment that not providing mammograms ""saves money, but could cost your life,"" we note that cost-effectiveness was not one of the criteria considered by the task force. It only analyzed the benefits -- early detection of cancer -- against the potential downsides of screening -- mainly stress caused from false-positive test results and the risk of exposure to radiation -- regardless of cost. In short, the panel concluded that based on the evidence, ""For biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years, there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is small."" Walsh calls the task force recommendation ""new government guidelines on mammograms."" That's also wrong. The task force is an independent panel convened by the government's Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. But their recommendations carry an important disclaimer: ""Recommendations made by the USPSTF are independent of the U.S. government. They should not be construed as an official position of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."" In fact, when the task force released its recommendations, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius promptly issued a press release stating, ""There is no question that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations have caused a great deal of confusion and worry among women and their families across this country. I want to address that confusion head on. The U.S. Preventive Task Force is an outside independent panel of doctors and scientists who make recommendations. They do not set federal policy and they don't determine what services are covered by the federal government. ""There has been debate in this country for years about the age at which routine screening mammograms should begin, and how often they should be given. The Task Force has presented some new evidence for consideration, but our policies remain unchanged. Indeed, I would be very surprised if any private insurance company changed its mammography coverage decisions as a result of this action."" Health and Human Services guidelines regarding mammograms did not change. Medicaid still covers the full cost of mammograms for women over 40. And Sebelius was correct that it did not affect private insurance companies' policies regarding mammography coverage. ""Our providers continue to provide coverage (of breast cancer screenings) when that is a decision reached between the doctor and patient (even when they are under 50),"" said Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans. She said she ""doesn't have any reason to believe the health bill is going to change"" their policy. ""Quite the opposite,"" Pisano said, ""we even do outreach to encourage women to do screenings. We will continue to focus on screenings and prevention. That's something we very much believe in."" But back to the Senate bill. There are a few other reasons that Walsh's claims about its limits of mammography are misleading. For one, the bill talks about minimum requirements for policies offered on the exchange. ""That's the floor in terms of preventive benefits,"" said Salganicoff, of Kaiser. ""Furthermore, there is nothing that stops anyone from covering diagnostic mammograms for women of any age."" The Senate bill makes it clear that plans may offer services well beyond the minimum requirements, including mammograms or any other services. ""Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a plan or issuer from providing coverage for services in addition to those recommended by United States Preventive Services Task Force or to deny coverage for services that are not recommended by such Task Force,"" the bill states. And if all that weren't enough, legislators went out of their way to ensure that mammograms for women aged 40 to 50 would be covered. Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., added an amendment that requires, when it comes to no-cost preventive services offered to women on the exchange, in addition to the services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, they also must include services ""provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration."" And those HHS guidelines say you've got to cover mammograms for women over 40. Asked in an interview with National Public Radio whether task-force studies like the breast cancer recommendations would be the basis for restricting coverage on the health care exchange, Sebelius said it is the secretary of health and human services — not the advisory panels — who would be have final say on what must be covered. According to NPR, ""Asked whether she would be willing to pledge that as long as she remains secretary of health and human services, she will make sure that every plan offered on the exchange will give coverage for annual mammograms for women over 40, Sebelius responded: 'Well, yes. I think that is an important service. It's a determination that we've made.'"" Sen. David Vitter, R-La., offered an amendment (which passed) that made it even clearer. ""For the purposes of this Act, and for the purposes of any other provision of law, the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breast cancer screening, mammography, and prevention shall be considered the most current other than those issued in or around November 2009."" In other words, ignore the November task force ruling altogether. Phil Kerpen, vice president of policy at Americans for Prosperity (which spent $750,000 on the ad) called that a ""temporary fix"" and said ""if the task force upholds that again in its next recommendations (as expected) that will no longer be operative."" How worried is the American Cancer Society that Kerpen's scenario might lead to insurers not covering mammograms for women under 50? Not at all. ""We're comfortable with the final language and that women 40 and above will continue to have access to mammograms as appropriate,"" said Stephen Finan, senior director of policy at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. The HHS guidelines include mammograms for women over 40, he noted, so ""as of now, if everything in the plan today was law, women over 40 would continue to be covered by their insurance."" In addition, he noted, 49 states have laws that require mammograms to be covered. The rules vary from state to state, but most require private insurers to pay 100 percent of the cost of mammograms for women over 40. ""The fact is, most group plans today provide it anyway as essential, good preventive service,"" Finan said. The number of plans that don't cover it is very small, he said, and is relegated to ""junk plans."" One last point: Without any context provided, Walsh's comments leave the impression this issue applies to all Americans. It doesn't. As Kerpen confirmed, she's talking only about people who participate in the health insurance exchange, not people who get their insurance through their employer. The independent Congressional Budget Office estimated that if the health bill passes, four out of five people would continue to get their insurance through their employer. Walsh was covered through her husband's employer, so this whole issue doesn't even apply to her. To review: The task force did not say women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50. The task force did include experts on cancer screening. It did not factor in cost. The recommendations are not the new government guidelines (in fact, the government guidelines remained the same). In short, this is a bogus issue. If the bill passes, preventive services recommended by the task force would become the bare minimum insurance companies in the exchange would be required to cover. And with regard to mammograms, specifically, they would be covered for women over 40. Americans for Prosperity got the wrong messenger. With a mother who died of cancer, Walsh is practically a poster child for the kind of person who the task force believes ought to get a mammogram before 50. And she gets her insurance through her husband's insurance. Nothing in the health care bill would change how she (or the four out of five Americans like her) would have received care through employer insurance. More importantly, Americans for Prosperity seized on an issue -- free mammograms for women between 40 and 50 -- that was specifically taken care of with not one, but two, Senate amendments. We rule this claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809720C380>],/factchecks/2010/mar/16/americans-prosperity/ad-claims-if-health-reform-bill-passes-government-/

Crist says Rubio has said he would have accepted stimulus money
","It's a move straight out of the campaign playbook: If your opponent criticizes you for something, accuse him of doing the same thing.That's what Charlie Crist's campaign for U.S. Senate is trying to do to opponent Marco Rubio about supporting the $862 billion economic stimulus package. Rubio has repeatedly criticized Gov. Crist for supporting the plan, which used tax cuts and federal spending to try to jump-start the economy. Rubio has said that Crist ""breathed air into the sails of the failed Democrat plan, while deflating Republican efforts to rally behind an alternative.""To turn the tables, Crist's campaign issued a satirical news release written as a speech that Rubio supposedly would give to the Conservative Political Action Conference. In it, Rubio would acknowledge that he had said in a recent interview that ""I would have accepted the stimulus money."" The news release was satire, but the point was serious -- that Rubio said he would have accepted stimulus money. We were surprised by that because Rubio has been so critical of the stimulus, so we decided to see what he had actually said. The Crist campaign is referring to a Rubio interview by Keith Cate of WFLA-TV in Tampa on Dec. 9, 2009. Asked whether ""he would not have accepted the stimulus money,"" Rubio said that ""ultimately I would have accepted those portions of the money that would not have put Florida in a worse position off in the future than it is right now.""That's not exactly a hearty endorsement, but Rubio is definitely saying that he would take at least some of the money.When the statement set off blog frenzy, the Rubio campaign tried to explain. Alex Burgos, Rubio's spokesman, told  Politico that ""There’s a big different (sic) between what Charlie Crist did by accepting the Obama stimulus as the best that Congress could do, actively promoting it, advocating for it among his fellow Republicans ... and what other governors ultimately did — governors like Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, Sarah Palin, Haley Barbor — by reluctantly accepting federal funds after the fact."" Rubio told National Journal's  Hotline on Call that ""advocating for the stimulus plan and accepting those dollars are not the same. The stimulus was a disaster and I would have fought it in every way possible.""As far as we can tell, Rubio has been consistent with his position that there is a distinction between accepting money and actually endorsing the stimulus. Speaking with The Weekly Standard in May 2009, Rubio said that ""It's one thing to say you'll accept the funds from the federal government ... it's another to actively advocate those policies, which I think are disastrous for America.""And indeed, even in the aforementioned interview, when asked whether he would have attended the presidential visit from Barack Obama -- referring to a February 2009 town hall meeting in Fort Myers, which Crist attended -- Rubio said he would have avoided it ""because that rally was in support of a specific plan.""To recap: Crist's campaign claimed that Rubio admitted that he would have accepted the stimulus money. And indeed, in the WFLA interview, Rubio said he ""would have accepted those portions of the money that would not have put Florida in a worse position off in the future than it is right now.""We rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AE2AC0>],/factchecks/2010/mar/16/charlie-crist/crist-says-rubio-has-said-he-would-have-accepted-s/

Foxx blames recession on Democratic Congressional takeover
","With the United States mired in its deepest recession in decades, Democrats and Republicans have sparred over which party bears the lion's share of blame. In a March 9, 2010, House floor speech, North Carolina Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx made clear which party she thinks is most at fault. Foxx spoke after the conclusion of a speech by Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat. Connolly said Americans had lost $17.5 trillion in net worth from December 2007 through March 2009. From that point, Connolly said, Americans began to recover. ""We are not out of the woods just yet,"" Connolly said. ""Households lost value every month for the longest recession since World War II. But we have turned the corner, and Americans today have $5 trillion more in net worth because of our actions."" After hearing Connolly's remarks, Foxx held off beginning her prepared statement on health care reform so that she could respond to what Connolly said. ""Madam Speaker, I came to talk about health reform, but would first note that the gentleman from Virginia fails to mention that the economy began its nose dive when Democrats took control of Congress in January 2007. For 54 months before that, with a Republican president and Republican control of Congress, the economy was doing very well and growing."" We decided to see if the data supported Foxx's claims. We turned to GDP figures because she specifically referred to the economy ""growing."" Foxx's second argument is a bit easier to verify, so we'll get that out of the way. Foxx said that for 54 months under Republican control of the presidency and Congress, ""the economy was doing very well and growing."" We aren't sure why she picked 54 months -- that takes us to July 2002, which was neither the start of George W. Bush's presidency (January 2001) nor the end of the Democrats' brief majority in the Senate (January 2003) -- but the key statistics don't differ much, so we'll stick to her timeline. During the 54-month period Foxx cited, growth in gross domestic product -- the basic measure of economic expansion for the nation as a whole -- remained in positive territory for every single quarter. During that period, the average of the quarterly annualized GDP growth rates was 2.8 percent -- not earth-shattering, but steady growth. And if you instead date the statistics back to the official start of the economic expansion -- that is, back to the fourth quarter of 2001 -- then the average growth rate was roughly the same, 2.7 percent.  So we conclude that Foxx is right to say that the economy experienced growth during that entire period (although, contrary to what she suggested, the Democrats controlled the Senate for six months out of the 54).  Now let's look at the notion that ""the economy began its nose dive when Democrats took control of Congress in January 2007."" For the first four quarters of the newly Democratic Congress -- the four quarters of 2007 -- the annualized GDP growth rates were, in order, 1.2 percent, 3.2 percent, 3.6 percent and 2.1 percent. Each quarter showed positive growth, and the average for those four quarterly figures was 2.5 percent -- not much lower than the average growth during the previous 54 months. Officially, the recession started in December 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, GDP fell by seven-tenths of 1 percent. It rebounded briefly to 1.5 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008, then got really rocky in the third quarter of 2008. During that quarter and the following two, GDP fell by 2.7 percent, 5.4 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively. If you date the ""nose dive"" to the first quarter of 2008 -- the earliest quarter with negative growth -- that was a full year after the Democratic takeover. And if you compare each quarter of 2006 (the last under GOP control) to the equivalent quarter of 2007 (the first under Democratic control), the pattern does not always favor the GOP. In both the first and fourth quarters, the 2006 level of growth under the GOP exceeded the 2007 level of growth under the Democrats. But in the second and third quarters, the Democrats did better in 2007 than the GOP did in 2006. We asked an ideological cross-section of economists what they thought of Foxx's claim. Karen Campbell, a macroeconomics policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that in her view, ""no statistical causation between political party in power and economic growth was established"" by Foxx's statement. Measured by economic growth, ""the economy did not technically begin a nose dive when the Democrats took over.""  Economist Gary Burtless of the liberal Brookings Institution wonders what Foxx would say if the shoe were on the other foot. ""The longest post-World-War-II business expansion ended in March 2001, one and a half months after a Republican Administration took office,"" Burtless said. ""That new Republican administration also had the good fortune to have a House of Representatives and, at first, a Senate that was controlled by the same party. According to Rep. Foxx’s reasoning, the recession that began after March 2001 must have been 'caused' by the political change-over in control of the White House. Of course, I think this reasoning is specious, but it is equally ludicrous to claim that the recession which began in January 2008 was 'caused' by a change in political control of Congress that took place in January 2007."" Most of the economists we spoke to agreed that the recession was caused most directly by long-term trends, especially a bust in housing prices and high energy prices, rather than by political factors.  ""The Democrats can be blamed for setting the economy on a bubble-driven path in the 1990s, but the Republicans cannot escape blame for continuing this path and allowing an even larger and more dangerous bubble to develop in the first decade of the 21st century,"" said Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""Is Rep. Foxx claiming that if we just left the Republicans in control, the housing bubble would still be growing so that we would have an even greater disaster to look forward to at the point when it finally collapsed?"" Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that it's conceivable that fear of the Democratic takeover could have spooked the financial markets and pushed the economy into a recession by depressing household wealth, bank capital and the ability of firms to raise funds in equity markets. In reality, though, the Dow Jones Industrial average actually rose from about 12,100 just before Election Day 2006 -- when the Democrats took back the House and Senate -- to a high of 13,930 in October 2007, which was 10 months after the Democrats took control of Congress. (The Dow then fell precipitously until early 2009.)  ""Anyone who tries to link the ups and downs in business to something happening in D.C. is obligated to explain what it is that happened,"" Reynolds said. ""Otherwise, it's likely random luck. Politicians are not as important as they like to think they are."" We agree. The evidence shows that the economy did not ""nose dive"" for at least a year after the Democrats took control of Congress, and experts of various ideological backgrounds agree that long-term trends in the housing and energy markets played a bigger role in directly causing the recession. While what happens in Washington can certainly influence the economy, it is only one of many factors. We believe it is the height of partisan wishful thinking to imply that one party's accession to power in Congress is to blame for a major recession.

Texas GOP says Speaker Nancy Pelosi said people will know contents of terrible health-care plan after it passes
","The Republican Party of Texas marveled — not in a good way — at an admission of sorts by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the long-stalled health care overhaul before Congress. According to an e-mail the GOP sent Friday, Pelosi said “the Democrats have to pass their terrible health care bill so that the American people can actually find out what's in it.” Talk about a banana-peel moment. Did Pelosi improbably denigrate her party’s promised legislation and say people can find out what’s in it after it passes? GOP spokesman Bryan Preston pointed us to the text of Pelosi’s March 9 speech in Washington to the National Association of Counties. We learned, for starters, that while the Texas GOP thinks the legislation is terrible, Pelosi clearly doesn't. Instead, Pelosi's remarks celebrate aspects such as a ban on denying health coverage because of a pre-existing conditions, “robust support for public health infrastructure,” more spending on community health centers and reductions in uncompensated care by hospitals. Pelosi also says in the speech that the plan won't require anyone to pay a deductible for preventive health care doctor visits. She summarizes: “It’s going to be very, very exciting.” Yet there’s heft to the GOP's claim that Pelosi said the legislation has to pass so people can find out what’s in it. Pelosi adds: “But we have to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of controversy.” Pelosi's words stirred critics from the right including Marguerite Higgins, a senior editorial services associate at The Heritage Foundation. In a blog, Higgins named the moment the video of the week and called Pelosi’s statement a “stunning demonstration of political condescension.” Separately, Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly offered this interpretation of Pelosi's comment: ""She meant there was so much talk about process (in Congress) that people have lost sight of what’s actually in the bill. Once it’s passed, we can remind them of all the good things that are in it."" Capital fusses aside, we wondered if Pelosi spoke accurately; will the plan need to pass before people know what's in it? We called the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which has posted side-by-side comparisons online of health care plans approved by the House and Senate. Its spokesman, Craig Palosky, reminded us that Congress posts the entire legislation online. Of course, that's not to say the final deal is settled — or, it stands to reason, open to public view. Palosky declined to comment precisely on Pelosi's forecast, saying her comment seemed more about politics than policy. ""It’s not our role to police such comments,"" he said. ""If you want to know what members of Congress are doing, you have to speak to members of Congress.” His nudge led us to call U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Lewisville, among a handful of physicians in Congress and an opponent to the Democrats' proposal. Burgess told us it's often true that the ins and outs of legislation aren't widely known until after a measure passes into law; that held true, for instance, for the Republican-steered measure providing government aid toward prescription drugs for seniors. Pelosi's ""right,"" Burgess said, though ""I don’t think that’s a good strategy (to declare as much). I wouldn’t recommend anyone actually broadcasting that."" So how does the GOP's statement shake out? The party's e-mail errs when it makes it sound as if Pelosi thinks the health-care measure is terrible. It's very much the opposite. But it accurately quotes Pelosi as saying people will find out what's in the plan after it passes. We rate the statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809694A0C0>],/factchecks/2010/mar/15/republican-party-texas/texas-gop-says-speaker-nancy-pelosi-said-people-wi/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Patriotism', 'Terrorism', 'Mitt Romney']","
Obama's remarks never a true 'apology'
","Mitt Romney's new book is called No Apology. The first chapter makes it clear who he thinks is apologizing: President Barack Obama.

""Never before in American history has its president gone before so many foreign audiences to apologize for so many American misdeeds, both real and imagined,"" Romney writes. ""It is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them.""

Obama might give compliments to America here and there, Romney adds. ""But what makes his speeches jump out at his audience are the steady stream of criticisms, put-downs, and jabs directed at the nation he was elected to represent and defend.

""In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations, and for feeding anti-Mulism sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy.""

As we did our research, we noticed that the idea that Obama has traveled the world apologizing is popular among some conservative Web sites. The Heritage Foundation, for example, published an analysis in June 2009 called ""Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies."" Similar compilations are available elsewhere, and radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has mentioned Obama apologizing several times.

But as we looked over Obama's remarks, we noticed that he never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: ""sorry."" Merriam-Webster defines an apology as ""an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret."" If someone is apologizing, it seems that is a discrete act that can be verified and fact-checked. We set out to discover how accurate Romney was in describing Obama as constantly apologizing.

What Obama said

We read the seven Obama speeches and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. Because of their length, we've compiled those passages into a separate document with links to the full remarks, and we encourage you to click over and read those remarks now.

To summarize them here, the remarks include major speeches, press conferences, and remarks at a town hall meeting. At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he is tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together. At a town hall meeting in France, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States ""has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive."" But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a ""casual"" and ""insidious"" anti-Americanism. ""On both sides of the Atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common. They are not wise. They do not represent the truth. They threaten to widen the divide across the Atlantic and leave us both more isolated,"" Obama concluded. And at a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, ""I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust.  Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country.  Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.""

At other times, Obama doesn't seem so much to be criticizing the United States as he is criticizing the foreign policy stances of the Bush administration. In England, a reporter said that during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said that the power and authority of the United States had diminished in recent years. Obama was quick to turn the question toward the Bush team. ""Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable,"" Obama said. ""I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.... I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world.""

At a speech in Cairo on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply ""move forward."" Here are his exact remarks: ""In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government.  Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians.  This history is well known.  Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.""

Looking at all the remarks Romney cited, we noticed that Obama is most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama mentioned this in four separate instances that Romney cited in the fact we're checking. Typically, Obama would say that the U.S. must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama ""unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year."" (He has not been successful with his order of closing Guantanamo; it remains open as of this writing.)

Obama's most pointed remarks on Guantanamo were  at the National Archives, in a major speech on fighting terrorism. Obama said that after 9/11, ""our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions."" He also said that the Guantanamo prison ""likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. So the record is clear: Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security. It is a rallying cry for our enemies.""

Did Obama apologize?

We sent Obama's remarks to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing.

• Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama is definitely apologizing, and it's not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, ""Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower.""

""Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies,"" Gardiner said. ""It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advanage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership.""

He noted that Obama tends to be most apologetic about how the U.S. has fought terrorism and its approach to the Iraq war. ""There is a very strong partisan element to his apologies, but the biggest driving factor is Obama's personal belief that the U.S. is not an exceptional, uniquely great nation,"" he said.

• John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing.

""It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,"" Murphy said. ""Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think  that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret.""

Romney's criticisms of Obama are part of a conservative tradition that emphasizes steadfastness in foreign policy, particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War. ""There's long been a strain of conservative rhetoric that argues that what matters most for the United States in the world is our will,"" Murphy said. ""The difficulty with that was shown in the second Bush administration, when will power is not quite enough. In Iraq, for example, you have to have a battle plan that makes sense and understand the situation you're going into'' and have enough resources to do that.

• Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it.

She said Obama's words fall short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words ""sorry"" or ""regret."" ""I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there,"" Bloom said.

Obama's remarks are really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy.

""Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal,"" Bloom said. ""For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable.""

• Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the Web site Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery.

""To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent,"" Howard-Hassman said. ""A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it.""

Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said.

""Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect,"" she said. ""But a gesture of respect is not an apology.""

Other presidential apologies

Short of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, we decided to narrow our focus and look at Obama's two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.

Several sources we reviewed discussed Clinton's remarks about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and described them as an apology. But Clinton did not explicitly apologize, and he assigned responsibility to the international community, not just the United States. ""The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well,"" Clinton said in Rwanda in 1998. ""We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope.""

Clinton did apologize, forcefully, to the survivors and families of the experiments conducted in Tuskegee, Ala., in which government doctors left sick men untreated as part of a research study on syphilis. ""The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong,"" Clinton said at a formal ceremony in 1997. ""To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry.""

Bush made remarks in 2002 about American slavery, which some people construed as an apology, at Goree Island, Senegal. But Bush did not formally apologize or express regret, instead opting to praise the Americans in history who worked to end slavery. ""My nation's journey toward justice has not been easy and it is not over,"" he said. ""The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and justice for all.""

Bush did, however, specifically apologize to King Abdullah of Jordan for the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The 2004 apology took place privately, but Bush and Abdullah spoke soon after at a Rose Garden press conference. ""We also talked about what has been on the TV screens recently, not only in our own country, but overseas -- the images of cruelty and humiliation. I told His Majesty as plainly as I could that the wrongdoers will be brought to justice, and that the actions of those folks in Iraq do not represent the values of the United States of America,"" Bush said. ""I told him I was sorry for the humiliation suffered by the Iraqi prisoners, and the humiliation suffered by their families. I told him I was equally sorry that people who have been seeing those pictures didn't understand the true nature and heart of America.""

Obama's praise and motivations

While Obama has admitted mistakes, he has also praised America. Romney acknowledges as much when he writes that Obama ""always the skillful politician, will throw in compliments about America here and there.""

In Cairo, Obama called the United States ""one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world."" At the Langley speech, Obama told the CIA staff, ""What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy; even when we are afraid and under threat, not just when it's expedient to do so. That's what makes us different. So, yes, you've got a harder job. And so do I. And that's okay, because that's why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans. And over the long term, that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies, because we're on the better side of history."" And at his speech accepting the Nobel Prize, Obama said: ""Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity.""

We reviewed several analyses of what Obama's foreign policy goals are in traveling the world and readily admitting to America's mistakes. One of the most interesting essays we read was written by historian Walter Russell Mead for the journal Foreign Policy.

Obama's foreign policy follows in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson and more recently of Jimmy Carter, Mead writes. Obama's goal is to reduce America's costs and risks overseas.

In Obama's view, Mead writes, ""Large military budgets divert resources from pressing domestic needs; close association with corrupt and tyrannical foreign regimes involves the United States in dirty and cynical alliances; the swelling national-security state threatens civil liberties and leads to powerful pro-war, pro-engagement lobbies among corporations nourished on grossly swollen federal defense budgets. ... ""Obama seeks a quiet world in order to focus his efforts on domestic reform -- and to create conditions that would allow him to dismantle some of the national-security state inherited from the Cold War and given new life and vigor after 9/11. Preferring disarmament agreements to military buildups and hoping to substitute regional balance-of-power arrangements for massive unilateral U.S. force commitments all over the globe, the president wishes ultimately for an orderly world in which burdens are shared and the military power of the United States is a less prominent feature on the international scene.""  Our ruling In reviewing Romney's book, we couldn't help but notice that Romney's diagnosis of the problems America faces are very similar to the themes Obama often repeats: The U.S. needs to educate its children better to remain competitive in the global marketplace. We spend too much money on health care. The fiscal future is ultimately unsustainable. It is in the matter of foreign policy that Romney lays out the most aggressive case against Obama, warning that the United States needs to maintain its military dominance in the world, particularly in the face of threats from China, Russia and Islamic jihadists. Obama, Romney writes, needs to ""proudly defend her rather than continually apologize for her.""

Here, we're checking Romney's statement that Obama ""has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision"" and a host of other reasons. If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney's criticisms. We set out to discover whether Obama really had apologized in his speeches, and what he was apologizing for. But in our review of his words, we came up short. Yes, there is criticism in some of his speeches, but it's typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and often he mentions other countries and how they have erred as well. There's not a full-throated, sincere apology in the bunch. And so we rate Romney's statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e94d364b-9df6-4b93-93f7-05cc58722c8e",[<zip object at 0x000002809C20F8C0>],/factchecks/2010/mar/15/mitt-romney/obama-remarks-never-true-apology/
