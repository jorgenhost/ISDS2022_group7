Michigan Republican Senate candidate now says she would have supported the auto bailout
","The federal government bailout of the auto industry was a contentious and frequent debate topic in the 2012 presidential election. But in the 2014 midterms, the issue has largely gone away — except in Michigan, the heart of the American automobile industry, where there’s a heated race for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat. Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich., has repeatedly trumpeted to voters his support of the 2009 bailout plan for General Motors and Chrysler. Late last month, the Peters campaign claimed to catch their opponent, former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land, flip-flopping on her bailout position. ""Yesterday, Land tried to rewrite history and claim she supports the auto rescue, but that’s a tough feat when news reports have chronicled her opposition,"" Peters spokeswoman Haley Morris said in a press release. The flip in question? On Sept. 25, responding to Peters’ comment on the campaign trail that Land opposed the bailout, Land spokeswoman Heather Swift said, ""Once again Gary Peters has it wrong: Terri would have supported the auto rescue."" Who is right? We decided to review the evidence. First, a quick refresher on the auto bailout: In 2008 during the economic crisis, President George W. Bush announced plans to bail out the auto industry. General Motors and Chrysler Group received $13.4 million in short-term relief in the final days of the Bush administration to keep them afloat until President Barack Obama’s new team could develop a long-term plan. The Ford Motor Company declined government assistance. In 2009, Obama said if Chrysler and GM wanted more federal money, they had to go through bankruptcy. They quickly agreed. GM received $30 million to restructure the company while Chrysler was sold to Italy’s Fiat. In all, the two companies received about $80 billion in loans, according to a 2010 Treasury report. Today, both companies are relatively healthy and touted as success stories, especially compared to where they were in 2008. We didn’t find many comments from Land about the bailout in 2009. The only statement we came across was from February 2009, when Land, then secretary of state, was exploring a gubernatorial bid. ""We will have to work with (GM and Chrysler) and see how we can get them back to sustainability,"" Land said, according to the Grand Rapid Press. She didn’t say how nor whether she supported government financing to do so. Her campaign did not provide any other comments she made at the time. At the Republican National Convention in 2012, Land spoke with the Washington Times, a conservative news outlet, and was asked whether Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney could compete in Michigan despite the fact he ""came out hard against the GM bailout"" or whether that statement turned out to be a positive for him in Motor City. A video of the conversation was provided to PolitiFact by the Peters campaign. Here’s how Land responded: I’m with (Romney) on that. Because, actually Bill Ford — we live with the autos. Michigan is a very unique state. No state has one industry that’s so prominent and that’s global. It’s not a Michigan industry, it’s global. And what basically happened is Bill Ford went and got a loan. I mean, he did it that way. And so people know that that could have been done. GM has become, they call it General Government basically, it’s become this huge operation with really nobody that has the commitment like Bill Ford has with his family and his legacy of making sure that company is successful. And that’s what it’s kind of become. They call it Government Motors. That’s what they call it. That’s the reality of it. I think that was the position to have and, you know, Ford is doing great. Fast forward to this year: After a candidate forum in May, Land shirked multiple questions about whether she supported the bailout. A local Fox reporter, though, tracked her down and asked her how she would have voted if she was in Congress, and she said, ""If I had been there as a U.S. senator, I would have worked to negotiate a deal that looked more like what Ford Company did."" Land repeated that idea on a Detroit radio station the next day, saying, ""I would have worked with the other senators to come up with a plan that would protect the taxpayers, make sure that jobs were kept here in Michigan, and did a plan more along the lines what Ford did."" There’s several takeaways from this all that underscore a distinct change in position on Land's part. First, she says ""I’m with (Romney) on that."" ""That,"" according to the question, is Romney’s position to come out ""hard against the GM bailout."" His actual position was a little more nuanced than that (though Land didn’t disagree with the questioner’s characterization). Romney in 2008 penned an op-ed for the New York Times about the state of the auto industry controversially titled (by the Times, not him) ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."" He called for a managed bankruptcy of the auto companies and called for the federal government to ""provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk,"" and he continued to argue those positions during the 2012 campaign. While GM and Chrysler did go through bankruptcies, they came out of it because of taxpayer financing. Romney’s plan would have required massive amounts of private capital that would have been tough to find during a financial crisis. Swift, the spokeswoman for Land’s campaign, said Land ""did not call GM ‘Government Motors,’ she was describing the situation and telling the panel what she heard from others call it."" The most literal of readings would find that accurate, but she didn’t dispute it and went on to describe the company negatively as ""this huge operation with really nobody that has the commitment like Bill Ford has."" This year, she said she would have supported a plan that would  ""protect the taxpayers"" and ""more along the lines what Ford did."" Both the Romney plan and the Ford model are vastly different than what ultimately made its way through Congress. Ford's plan didn't even require government intervention. Swift also said the ""comment (Land) made in 2012 was referring to the process"" of deciding which course of action would be best, and was not opposing the bailout; rather, ""she favored a different approach in the beginning."" We asked for clarification by what Swift meant by ""process"" but didn’t hear back. It’s a confusing assertion to make since the remark came three years after the bailout took place. The process of deciding the plan of action was already complete, so we don’t understand why she would have been talking about the process. Our ruling Did Land change positions on a rescue package for the auto industry? If there’s any evidence Land supported the bailout until recently, we didn’t find it, and Land’s campaign didn’t provide it. On the campaign trail so far, she has mostly avoided a direct answer to the question. Her campaign recently said she supported it. In 2012, she said she supported Romney’s plan, which would have required private financing — not government money — to get the auto companies out of bankruptcy, and held up Ford, which rejected any government money, as a model. Her comments, read in full, are critical of how things played out. Earlier this year, she said she would have pushed for something ""more along the lines what Ford did,"" which is even further from the auto bailout than what Romney supported. But on Sept. 25, her campaign said she ""would have supported the auto rescue."" That’s a distinct change of position, so we rate it Full Flop.",/factchecks/2014/oct/06/terri-lynn-land/michigan-republican-senate-candidate-now-says-she-/

Barack Obama says deficit fell from 10 percent of GDP to 3 percent on his watch
","During a speech at Northwestern University on Oct. 2, 2014, President Barack Obama offered a rosy -- if cautious -- view on the state of the economy. One of the statistics he touted was this one: ""When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy. Today, it's approaching 3 percent."" We wondered if he was correct. We looked at data from the Office of Management and Budget that tracks the federal deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. Calculating it this way shows not the absolute level of the deficit but rather how big it is in relation to the size of the broader economy. The data shows that for fiscal year 2009, the deficit as a percentage of GDP was 9.8 percent, while the projected percentage for fiscal year 2014 is 3.7 percent. But the timing of the Office of Management and Budget figures don’t coincide with Obama taking office. The 9.8 percent figure covers fiscal year 2009 -- which runs from Oct. 1, 2008, to Sept. 31, 2009. In other words, it covers a little less than four months of President George W. Bush’s second term, and nearly eight months of Obama’s first term. In other words, the figure looks at an entire year that covers two presidencies -- not a snapshot on the day Obama took office, Jan. 20, 2009. That casts some doubt about the accuracy of how Obama framed the issue. Obama said, ""When I took office,"" which suggests that he inherited his predecessor’s deficit at nearly 10 percent of GDP and should get the credit for reducing it. The reality is that if Obama is going to claim some credit for reducing the deficit, he should also take some responsibility for pushing the deficit up to nearly 10 percent of GDP in his first fiscal year in office. Part of the reason the deficit was relatively high was because of the recession-fighting stimulus bill, which Obama championed. The deficit-to-GDP percentage for the fiscal year prior, 2008, was 3.1 percent. This gives a sense of what Obama inherited -- but it’s not a perfectly useful number, either, because it stops almost four months before Obama took office. During those four months, the economy was worsening rapidly, and spending on the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- which aimed to stabilize the financial sector -- had begun adding to the deficit. So if one could figure out a percentage for the day Obama was inaugurated -- which actually can’t be done -- it would likely be somewhere between 3.1 percent and 9.8 percent. There’s another wrinkle in comparing deficits to the economy overall and then trying to take credit for improvements. While it’s relatively easy to assign credit or blame for government spending, which helps shape the size of the country’s deficit, it is not nearly as easy to credit or blame Obama for the overall state of the economy as measured by GDP. ""The impact of a president on the economy is tough to measure,"" said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. ""So taking credit for a normalizing economy and the associated normalizing of the budget deficit is generally pushing it in my book."" The transition from Bush to Obama is especially tough to parse, as these past PolitiFact articles show. The White House argued to PolitiFact that the deficit projected at the beginning of his first term, once you factor out the pricetag for the stimulus and related debt service, was 9.2 percent for fiscal year 2009. Looking at it this way has merit, but for a retrospective claim like this, we think it’s worth giving credence to hard numbers over initial projections. And we’d reiterate that some of the spending that took place before he was inaugurated, such as TARP, had the support of then-President-Elect Obama. ""It would have been better for him to say, ‘In my first year in office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of GDP,’ "" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Our ruling Obama said, ""When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy. Today, it's approaching 3 percent."" Actually, the deficit reached 10 percent of the economy several months after Obama took office, not on his first day. Obama is laying the blame for the high deficit-to-GDP ratio entirely on Bush, when the figure covers time in office for both presidents. In reality, the numbers are more nuanced than he lets on, and his formulation oversimplifies the factors that played into these trends, some of which he had control over and some of which he didn’t. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-deficit-fell-10-percent-gdp-3-pe/

NRA says Warner backed restrictions on veteran gun rights
","Editor’s note: A version of this Truth-O-Meter that appeared in the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Sunday, Oct. 5, was posted with the wrong rating. The National Rifle Association says U.S. Sen. Mark Warner is soft on two issues dear to many Virginians -- guns and veterans. ""Mark Warner has supported restrictions on veterans’ second amendment rights,"" the NRA wrote in a flyer that hit mailboxes in September.   We wondered if the NRA is on target. The statement is based on the Senate’s consideration of the Safe Schools, Safe Communities Act of 2013, introduced in the wake of shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 children and six adults. The legislation, backed by President Barack Obama, sought to greatly expand background checks on potential gun buyers and put new limits on assault rifles and high capacity magazines. The bill failed to overcome a filibuster. The NRA’s claim zeroes in on an unsuccessful amendment that would have changed the method for putting veterans on a federal list of people banned from buying firearms because of mental health.  Warner and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., voted against the measure. The amendment was fashioned after a bill introduced two years earlier by Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and then-Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., to end what they called ""the arbitrary process through which the government strips veterans and other Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) beneficiaries of their Second Amendment rights."" Federal law bans the purchase of firearms by people who have been ruled by a judge to be mentally defective or involuntarily committed to a mental institution or incompetent to handle his own affairs. Some states, including Virginia, share the rulings with the FBI and the individual’s name is listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).    Veterans, however, are subject to additional scrutiny. They can be found mentally incompetent to own guns either by the courts or a VA examiner. Since the 1968 Gun Control Act, the VA has equated mental capacity to manage finances with mental stability to own and purchase firearms. The NICS was created in 1998. If a VA examiner determines a veteran cannot manage his finances – take the VA benefit check and make necessary payments – the VA appoints a fiduciary. It could be a spouse or family member. But once a veteran is so judged, the VA submits the veteran’s name to the FBI for inclusion on the national list of people banned from buying arms. Burr said veterans were being held to a different standard than others. His amendment would have stripped the VA of its role and put determination of a veteran’s mental stability solely in the hands of judges. During debate, Burr said 129,000 veterans have been deemed mentally incompetent by the VA. ""Let me suggest that the current process is arbitrary,"" he said. ""It doesn't look at whether they represent a danger to themselves or to others. It is in no way relevant to whether the individual should have access to firearms."" The same standard for other Americans should be applied to veterans, he said. ""Clearly, after an appropriate determination, if a veteran, or any other American, is found to be a harm to themselves or has a mental disability, we would all agree that person should be disqualified from gun ownership,"" Burr said. Burr’s measure was among six amendments offered to the gun control bill. Some, like Burr’s, were narrow in scope. Others sought to overhaul the entire bill. Warner’s campaign spokesman, David Turner, told us his boss voted against Burr’s measure because he favored an overhaul amendment offered by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa.  The measure, which beefed up criminal backgrounds checks and offered grants to encourage states to participate in the national data base, was introduced as a compromise on gun control. The legislation Warner backed also sought a middle ground on veterans. It required the VA to send a letter to veterans deemed mentally incompetent explaining the impact the ruling has on their gun rights and their options for contesting it. The amendment would have set up an appeals process through courts or an independent board.   As things stand, veterans have no opportunity to appeal a decision requiring a fiduciary outside of the VA. Senators said during the 2013 debate that fewer than 200 veterans have had their incompetency rulings reversed by the VA. Our ruling The NRA says Warner ""has supported restrictions on veterans’ second amendment rights."" As proof, it cites the senator’s 2013 vote against an amendment that would have ended a VA policy of submitting the names of veterans it deems mentally unstable to the the FBI for inclusion on a national list of people barred from buying guns. People who didn’t serve in the military, by contrast, can only be declared mentally unfit to buy a gun by a judge. So there’s a basis for the NRA’s claim: Warner voted against abolishing a restriction on buying guns that only affects veterans. What the NRA ignores is that Warner voted for a different amendment that would have opened a appeals route for veterans outside of the VA -- to judges or an independent board.  While Warner did not back the change desired by the NRA, he did support a policy change. The NRA’s statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/06/national-rifle-association/nra-says-warner-backed-restrictions-veteran-gun-ri/

Does Rick Scott hold the record on education funding, as Republicans say?
","Florida Republicans have tapped Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera of Miami to speak directly to Hispanic voters in a recent Spanish language TV ad. The ad touts Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s accomplishments. Here is part of the English translation: ""He cut taxes 40 times, reformed Medicaid for the neediest and secured unprecedented funding for education."" The text on the screen states, ""Historic $20 billion in funds for education."" We’ve already rated Half True the claim that Scott cut taxes 40 times for families; the statement about reforming Medicaid refers to the state getting a federal waiver to expand privatization in an attempt to save money, but this leaves out that the Legislature has rejected expanding Medicaid for poor adults. But what about the claim on education spending? It’s one of many in a tug-of-war between Scott and his Democratic challenger, former Gov. Charlie Crist. Both candidates have claimed that they hold the state record for most K-12 funding -- and, oddly enough, they both have plausible cases to make. Scott holds the record for total dollars spent, while Crist spent the most on record per pupil. In the recent Spanish-language ad, Scott’s claim about education spending is partially accurate but contains some key omissions. Here’s the rundown. The Republicans’ ad doesn’t specify what type of education funding it is referring to or which year. The ad provides a hint that it is about young children because it shows a video of two young girls wearing shirts that say ""intergenerational child care."" So we’ll look at K-12 spending. We asked officials at the Florida Department of Education for documentation showing the most recent figure for total K-12 funding for 2014-15. A September 2014 slideshow by the education department shows that total funding for the Florida Education Finance Program -- the main pot of money for K-12 -- was about $18.9 billion, including both state and local dollars. (The state dictates the local government contribution amount, so we have no quarrel with the Republicans adding the state and local dollar amounts together.) The state also receives about $1.5 billion in federal grants for K-12, so if we add up state, local and federal dollars, we end up at around $20.4 billion. So it’s reasonable for the Republicans to cite that $20 billion figure -- though it’s worth remembering that they are zeroing in on one year of Scott’s tenure while omitting any discussion of his other three budgets, including in 2011, when he signed off on a cut of $1.3 billion. After facing criticism for that cut, Scott has since supported increases in K-12 spending. As for the ""historic"" label, that depends on how you slice the numbers. The supporting information released by the GOP cites a June 2014 Tampa Bay Times story about Scott signing a $77 billion state budget, including money for K-12. ""The bottom-line number for K-12 schools of $20.7 billion is the largest in history,"" the article stated. However, the article, unlike the ad, went on to say that this amount fell short of the per-pupil spending record under Crist. News articles in other publications also cited the same figure. Similarly, when Scott released his budget proposal in January 2014, it included $18.8 billion for K-12 education. While he touted that as that the ""highest in Florida history,"" we rated that claim Half True because he focused on total spending while ignoring the fact that per-pupil spending was higher under Crist. Per-pupil spending is a crucial measurement because it shows how much is spent on each student at a time when the number of students is rising. So how do those numbers look? We have rated Mostly True a Crist claim that Scott’s per-pupil education spending is ""about $200 less"" than the $7,126 his own administration spent per pupil during the recession. We found that this number is correct, though the record refers to the budget Crist signed in 2007, before the recession hit. In August 2014, Scott proposed a budget for next year that would include $7,176 in per-pupil spending to match Crist’s record. But if Scott wins and gets his wish on that dollar figure, Crist would still hold the record if you factor in inflation. It’s also important to point out that overall student enrollment has grown during Scott’s tenure, so it’s not a surprise that the total budget would grow, too. The schools’ full-time-equivalent student body grew by about 68,000 between 2011-12 and 2014-15. Our ruling The Republican Party’s ad says that under Rick Scott, Florida has had a ""historic $20 billion in funds for education."" The statement is accurate if we look at total K-12 spending for Scott’s fourth year in office. But this claim leaves out some important context -- that Crist still holds the per-pupil record and that Scott significantly reduced K-12 spending during his first year. We rate the statement in the ad Half True. Editor's note: This item has been updated to clarify that in August 2014 Scott proposed a budget of $7,176 in per-pupil spending.",/factchecks/2014/oct/06/republican-party-florida/rick-scott-holds-record-education-funding-republic/
"['Rhode Island', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Public Safety', 'Jorge Elorza']","
Jorge Elorza: In Cianci’s last years as mayor, crime in Providence rose but fell in R.I., U.S.
","During the Sept. 30, 2014, Providence mayoral debate, when Democrat Jorge Elorza was asked why he has said he’s embarrassed by independent Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr. running for office again, he said he would rather look forward and focus on his vision for the city. ""Let’s leave behind all of the corruption and what led the ex-mayor to go to jail,"" Elorza said of his rival. Elorza, however, couldn’t leave quite all that behind and immediately criticized Cianci whose last stint in office ended in 2002 with a federal conviction for racketeering conspiracy. ""In the last six years of Cianci’s administration, violent crime was down in the United States,"" Elorza said. ""It was down in the region. It was down in Rhode Island. But it was up in Providence."" Elorza made the same claim in a news release on Friday, so we were curious -- did Providence really buck national and regional trends when it came to violent crime in the late 1990s and early 2000s? We went straight to the website for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which collects data on crime from across the country as part of its Uniform Crime Reporting program (UCR). Under the program, four offenses are classified as violent crimes: murder and nonnegligent homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. The FBI tallies the total numbers of violent crimes in widening geographic areas: cities and towns, states, regions and the nation as a whole. The agency also calculates rates for given areas by working out the number of violent crimes for every 100,000 people. For our analysis, we used the period from 1997 to 2002, the last six years of Cianci’s most recent time in office. Nationally, the violent crime rate fell from 611 crimes per 100,000 people in 1997 to 494.4 in 2002, according to the UCR data. It also fell for the Northeast region, from 536.4 in 1997 to 416.5 in 2002, and for the smaller New England region, from 441.1 in 1997 to 346.9 in 2002. And for Rhode Island, it also went down, from 333.5 in 1997 to 285.6 in 2002. So what about Providence? The violent crime rate did indeed go up, from 674.8 in 1997 to 734.9 in 2002. It wasn’t a steady progression for those six years. The rate actually rose and fell a couple times over that period. If you graph those numbers, it would look a little like a rollercoaster. But the end result was a number in 2002 that was 8.9 percent higher than it was in 1997. We also looked at other major metropolitan centers in New England to see how they fared between 1997 and 2002. Of the nine other cities that round out the top 10 in the region by population (a list that includes Boston, Hartford and New Haven), only Waterbury, Conn. also experienced an increase, a slight one, in the violent crime rate for that period. Elsewhere in the country, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. saw a drop in the rate. Houston and Philadelphia experienced increases. Politifact Rhode Island has explored crime trends in past items, attributing the drop in crime rates nationally in the 1990s and 2000s to an aging population, community policing, the crackdown on guns and other factors. Providence police officials blamed the increase in the city’s violent crime rate over the same period to more people and more traffic in the downtown, according to Journal stories from the time. It’s worth noting that Elorza chose only a portion of Cianci’s time in office to make his point rather than the entire period of his opponent’s second stint in office, which started in 1991. Could it be because the crime rate cumulatively fell over those 12 years in office -- and did so quite dramatically? Despite the increase at the end, Providence saw a net drop -- and a very large one -- from 1,274 violent crimes per 100,000 people to 734.9. In fact, the 42 percent drop in Providence’s violent crime rate between 1991 and 2002 trumped the 35 percent drop in the national rate for those same years and the 38 percent drop in the Rhode Island rate. However, David Ortiz, a spokesman for Elorza, said that the upward trend at the end of Cianci’s time in office was significant because it ran counter to what was going on elsewhere. Our ruling Jorge Elorza said that the violent crime rate was up in the final years of Cianci’s second period as mayor while similar rates for the state, the region and the nation were all down. While Elorza carefully picked a time period between 1997 and 2002 to illustrate a point, that doesn’t mean the point isn’t valid. The rate of murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults went up for those years, even though -- and this is what makes the claim notable -- it was falling elsewhere. But Elorza’s claim does ignore the larger context, which is that the increase didn’t erase the gains seen in the earlier years of Cianci’s second stint as mayor. If Elorza had chosen the entire 12 years Cianci was in office the second time around, he couldn’t have made the same claim. If he had chosen eight years, he couldn’t have either. Because the statement needs clarification, we rule it Mostly True.

Va. Democrats say hospital layoffs are ""direct result"" of GOP inaction on Medicaid
","The state Democratic Party is continuing to assail the Republican-controlled General Assembly’s refusal to expand Virginia’s Medicaid program. In a recent news release, the Democrats said ""hospitals have already begun layoffs, a direct result of Republican inaction."" We looked into the claim, made at the start of a special legislative session in mid-September at which Republicans refused to expand Medicaid eligibility to as many as 400,000 additional low-income and disabled Virginians. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act -- also called Obamacare -- Uncle Sam would pay the entire expansion cost for two years and never less than 90 percent in the future. GOP lawmakers, who control the House and Senate, said they don’t trust the federal government will pay its promised share. Democrats have strongly supported the expansion, arguing, in part, that it would ease losses hospitals suffer from treating indigent patients. We asked Morgan Finkelstein, spokeswoman for state Democratic Party, for proof of the party’s claim that hospital layoffs have begun as a ""direct result"" of the GOP’s opposition to expansion. She sent us a number of articles and announcements of hospital layoffs and closings in Virginia during the last few years. Here’s the list of layoffs at 13 Virginia hospitals: 50 at three Wellmont Health Systems hospitals in Southwest Virginia in June 2013 140 through the closure of Wellmont’s Lee Regional Medical Center in Southwest Virginia in October 2013 116 at Mountain States Health Alliance, which has hospitals in Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, in January 33 at Valley Health, mainly at Winchester Medical Center, in January 66 at Mary Washington Healthcare in Fredericksburg at the beginning of September The news releases and articles cite the rejection of Medicaid expansion as one reason for the layoffs. But it wasn’t the only reason.   The hospitals -- mostly in rural areas --  also blamed declining patient populations and lower Medicare payments.   The ACA reduces reimbursements to hospitals for treating Medicare patients -- mostly people 65 and older. Obamacare supporters originally thought hospitals would recoup most of the money through the expansion of Medicaid. But the equation changed in 2012 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could not be compelled to broaden their Medicaid programs. That left an opening that’s allowed Virginia and 22 other states to resist expansion. Several of the Virginia hospitals that had layoffs reported Medicare populations as high as 60 percent. So they’ve been disproportionately hurt by the lowered Medicare reimbursements while, at the same time, unable to tap into extra Medicaid money. For example, Mountain States Health Alliance told the Kingsport Times-News in Tennessee in January that Medicaid expansion would help the system recover $20 million of its expected loss of $30 million every year. Mary Washington Healthcare told The Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg that it’s expecting to lose $31 million in Medicare reimbursements and that the expansion of Medicaid would have compensated for $14 million of the loss. In a news release about closing Lee Regional Medical Center, Wellmont attributed the cause to ""reimbursement cuts associated with the Affordable Care Act, extremely low community use of the hospital and a lack of consistent physician coverage."" It should be noted that rural hospitals across the country were in financial trouble long before Obamacare became part of our lexicon, facing shrinking patient populations and under pressure to shorten hospital stays. The Office of the Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found in a 2003 report that 208 rural hospitals closed from 1990 to 2000. The report has not been updated. Eight of the 13 Virginia hospitals cited by the Democratic Party have operated in the red during every fiscal year since 2009, according to records from Virginia Health Information. Our ruling The Democratic Party of Virginia says that hospital layoffs have begun as a ""direct result"" of Republican legislators’ refusal to expand the state’s Medicaid program. The Democrats point to news releases from four hospital systems -- mostly in rural areas -- that have announced staff cuts since June 2013. The systems cited the state’s resistance to Medicaid expansion as one of several reasons for the layoffs. Of greater impact, however, was a reduction in Medicare reimbursements under Obamacare. Several hospital officials said the expansion of Medicaid would have allowed them to offset some -- but not nearly all -- of the loss. It also should be noted that most of the individual hospitals where the layoffs occurred had been in the red since at least since 2009 -- some of them all but losing their patient base. The GOP’s refusal to expand Medicaid came at a tough time for the hospital systems and certainly added to their woes.

Lindsey Graham: Army is smallest since 1940, Navy smallest since 1915
","The United States has upped its operations in Iraq and Syria, but Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says the military is shrinking. On CNN’s State of the Union Sunday morning, Graham criticized President Barack Obama for what he said are ""half-measures"" in thwarting terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. While Obama has focused on avoiding sending in combat troops to the Middle East, Graham said up to 4,000 troops may be necessary. The issue of military size resurfaced when host Candy Crowley asked Graham what his plans are if Republicans take control of the Senate in November. He said replacing sequestration-style budgets is priority No. 1. ""You just heard a segment about the spread of Ebola throughout Africa,"" he said. ""We're cutting the CDC's budget, the NIH budget. We're taking the military budget under sequestration cuts down to the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915. We're destroying the Intelligence Committee."" There’s a lot in there, but the idea that the U.S. military -- by far the largest in the world in terms of spending -- is as small as it was nearly a century ago caught our attention. We found that Graham has accurate numbers regarding the Army and Navy. However, comparing today’s military to that of decades ago is comparing apples to oranges because of massive growth in technology and overall capabilities. The numbers Graham was referring to the number of ground forces and the number of ships, which is the traditional way of measuring the size of the Army and Navy, respectively, said Alex Roland, a professor of military history at Duke University. Graham’s staff pointed us to a letter written by former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2011. Graham and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- both supporters of robust funding for the Defense Department -- requested the letter amid Congress’ budget talks in fall 2011 that led to sequestration legislation. In the letter, Panetta said, ""Facing such large reductions, we would have to reduce the size of the military sharply. Rough estimates suggest after 10 years of these cuts, we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915, and the smallest Air Force in its history."" As far as we can tell, Panetta’s assessment is accurate. The Army already is reducing the number of soldiers to 440,000-450,000 -- down from its recent war-time high of 570,000, according to the Defense Department’s 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review. (Those reductions are the result of the ending of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, not mandated budget cuts as part of the sequestration.) Going forward, if sequestration-style cuts go into effect for fiscal year 2016, the number of soldiers will likely have to drop to 420,000. This is the lowest number of soldiers since 1940. Before the draft went into effect later that year, there were about 264,000 troops in the Army. Turning to the Navy, there are currently 289 deployable battle force ships. According to the quadrennial review, there will be an estimated fleet of 234 ships in Fiscal Year 2019. That is the lowest number of ships since 1915 -- two years before the United States got involved in World War I.  That year, the Navy had 231 deployable ships. In 2016, it jumped up to 245 ships. To summarize: Army 1940 2019 (est.) Number of troops 264,000 440,000 Navy 1915 2019 (est.) Number of ships 231 234 Still, Graham was trying to make the point that the budget cuts have weakened the military to points not seen in decades. However, we learned from experts that comparing the number of troops and ships doesn’t say much about military might. The context We took Graham’s claim to several experts, who told us that comparing the American military of 2014 to that of the early 20th century is irrelevant. Because of technological advances, the ships and troops of today’s military have greater capabilities than they did in the world wars. ""One of the reasons for the decrease in size -- both Army and Navy -- is that we now rely far more on technology than on sheer numbers,"" said Roland, the military history expert from Duke. ""The question is not how we compare to our Army in 1940 or our Navy in 1915, but how we compare with our potential enemies in 2014. We are head and shoulders above them."" For example, the Navy did not have any aircraft carriers in 1915, but now it has an active fleet of 10. David E. Johnson, a political scientist at the Rand Corporation, estimated that just four modern aircraft carriers would have capabilities equal to that of the entire Navy before World War I. At that time, the military also did not have radar, satellites, computers, virtually undetectable ballistic missile submarines, drones and other advanced technology that allow the military to do more with fewer soldiers. Also, in terms of military spending relative to other countries, the United States accounts for 37 percent of the world’s total military spending. China follows, at 11 percent of the world’s spending, as of 2013, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. (Put another way, the United States spends as much on its military as the next 8-12 biggest defense-spending countries combined.) Warfare also has changed, Johnson said. It’s been decades since the United States has been involved in a war, like the world wars, where the country lost numerous ships and hundreds of thousands of soldiers. While the military should continue have a robust number of ships and soldiers, it does not necessarily need as many as it did in previous conflicts. That being said, Johnson said sequestration has hindered military capabilities -- particularly in light of recent developments in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon has had to make cuts to its day-to-day operations, while carrying out missions in the Middle East that were not budgeted for. Our ruling Graham said that under sequestration, the military was cut ""down to the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915."" Graham was counting the number of ground troops in the Army and the number of ships in the Navy. He’s got the numbers right, but it’s not a fair comparison because technology and capabilities have grown so much in the past century. The Army and Navy of today are much more capable than they were decades ago, even with fewer soldiers and ships. A better comparison is to look at how the U.S. military stands up relative to other nations. Graham’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/05/lindsey-graham/lindsey-graham-army-smallest-1940-navy-smallest-19/

George Will: America hasn't had sustained confidence in government since Ronald Reagan
","As the midterm elections get closer, Republicans are questioning the competence and trustworthiness of President Barack Obama. This is a theme that came into sharp focus during the immigration debate when House Republicans said they wouldn’t move forward because they didn’t trust the president to enforce the law. The botched launch of the Obamacare website did the president no favors. Now, Republicans are pouring concerns over Ebola and the Secret Service into the same mold. The pundits lobbed their opposing views at each other on Fox News Sunday. Brit Hume said the level of people saying the government is incompetent is higher than ever. Juan Williams shot back that the public always thinks the government is incompetent. George Will entered the fray to note that the country has most to fear from ""excessive faith in government."" Will skewered Republicans for engaging in nation building overseas and Democrats for their efforts to cure social ills at home. Then Will made an interesting historical observation. ""The last time there was a sustained surge of confidence in government's competence was under (President) Ronald Reagan,"" Will said. Will is correct that public trust in government rose and then held steady under Reagan. But he errs in ignoring Bill Clinton’s two terms in office, when the public’s trust in government also rose sharply. In the following chart, the Pew Research Center averaged the results of a number of surveys since 1958 that probed the public’s trust in government. (The political scientists we reached said the words ""confidence"" and ""trust"" are largely synonymous in this context.)  Source: Pew Research Center, Public trust in government: 1958-2013 Trust in government fluctuated during both the Reagan and Clinton presidencies, but under Reagan, trust rose by 11 percentage points -- from 33 percent to 44 percent. In the Clinton years, trust rose over 20 percentage points -- from 21 percent to 44 percent, according to data from American National Election Studies. As for Will’s use of the word ""surge,"" gains in trust were steeper during Clinton’s two terms, but he started from a much lower point than Reagan. What lies behind the numbers The consensus among the political scientists we contacted is that trust in government tracks closely with the economy. ""The growth in trust we observe under Reagan and Clinton coincides with economic expansions,"" said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. In his forthcoming book, Why Washington Won’t Work: Polarization, Political Trust, and the Governing Crisis, Vanderbilt University political scientist Marc Hetherington analyzed how party affiliation changes the survey results for trust in government. ""Republicans in the electorate only seem to trust the government when Republicans are in office,"" Hetherington said. ""Democrats trust government about the same amount over time. Republicans fluctuate a lot."" Hetherington sent us this chart that tracks party affiliation and trust in government by who was president.  Theda Skocpol, a political scientist at Harvard University, is skeptical about how much these polls actually reveal about American attitudes. Skocpol said these general opinions mask considerable nuances. ""Americans express opposition or doubt when asked about government overall,"" Skocpol said. ""But they usually like all the specifics (of programs) by wide margins."" Skocpol gave the example of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the current Ebola scare might have taken a toll on the agency’s ranking, last year it stood at the top of the public’s list. According to Gallup, 60 percent of the people said the CDC was doing an excellent or good job. Our ruling George Will said the last time there was a ""sustained surge"" in confidence in government was under Reagan. While trust did rise and generally hold level in the Reagan years, it also had a steady and larger increase under Clinton.  However you slice the numbers, it is clear that the American public had a ""sustained surge of confidence"" during Clinton's presidency. And Clinton, obviously, was president more recently than Reagan. We rate Will’s claim False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/05/george-will/george-will-america-hasnt-had-sustained-confidence/

Jorge Elorza says Providence is paying $17,000 a month tax free to one pension recipient
","If you're looking for reasons why Providence is in financial trouble, Democratic mayoral candidate Jorge Elorza says a good place to start is the city's pension costs. During a Sept. 30, 2014, mayoral debate, he was asked about the city's huge pension debt. Elorza blamed one of his opponents, Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr., an independent, for signing a consent decree when he was mayor that provided for 5- and 6-percent cost of living allowances for retirees. ""Now we have a retiree that is collecting a $17,000 paycheck a month . . . tax free,"" Elorza said. ""How many families in Providence don't make $17,000 a year."" ""You can thank the court for that,"" Cianci retorted. We were curious about whether that $17,000 monthly paycheck -- equivalent to $204,000 in annual tax-free income -- is real. Providence officials sent us the 2014 list of the 49 people receiving the largest pension payments. Thirty seven retirees are receiving checks totaling over $100,000 per year, or at least $8,333 each month. All but eight were firefighters. The rest were police officers. At least 28 of those 37 are tax-free disability pensions. Four others may be disability pensions but it's not clear from the list because the money is going to a surviving spouse.    At the top of the list: Gilbert McLaughlin of Warwick, who retired in October 1991 with an accidental disability pension. He served as chief for 15 months before retiring, citing health problems stemming from a job-related injury to his neck and shoulders. His annual payment from the city as of May 2014: $196,813. That's $16,401 per month, or $599 shy of the $17,000 cited by Elorza. McLaughlin retired as the city's fire chief at the age of 55. At retirement, his base salary was $63,537 per year plus $6,959 in longevity pay for his 36 years, six months and eleven days of service. Total: $70,496. He received 83.7 percent of that as his pension, or $59,001 a year, according to Lawrence J. Mancini, the city's acting director of administration and finance. His payment grew so large because he received an annual 5-percent compounding cost of living adjustment that was increased to 6 percent in 1996, Mancini said. (Cianci's second stint as Providence mayor ran from 1991 through most of 2002.) All of this was part of a long-running legal war over pensions in the city. The stage was set around 1977, near the beginning of Cianci's first stint as mayor, when the General Assembly gave the city's unions a controlling number of seats on the city's Retirement Board. A 1983 City Charter change, when Cianci was still in office, gave the board extra power to make pension decisions. In 1989, with Joseph Paolino as mayor, the board granted compounded cost-of-living adjustments of 5 and 6 percent for all present and future public safety retirees and 3 percent for non-uniformed workers. In 1991, in the midst of a court battle over pensions, Cianci was back in office and he signed a consent decree that locked in some of the benefits, a decree that he would come to regret. In 2012, in an agreement Mayor Angel Taveras negotiated with the police and fire unions, the city ended the big compounded cost of living adjustments, so his annual pension remains frozen at $196,813. To put this in context, the salary of the current fire chief, Clarence Cunha, is $164,736 a year, including longevity pay. If McLaughlin's initial pension had risen with inflation, and not at 5 or 6 percent, it would be worth $103,036 today, or just under $8,586 a month. Our ruling Jorge Elorza said, ""We have a retiree that is collecting a $17,000 paycheck a month . . . tax free."" The city's biggest retirement check goes to a retired fire chief who is getting $16,401. Although Elorza overstated the amount a bit, its close enough to rate his statement True.

Gabby Giffords' group says people in NH want to raise minimum wage and Marilinda Garcia opposes it
","A gun reform group founded by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, has turned its focus to New Hampshire, running a TV ad that criticizes Republican congressional candidate Marilinda Garcia not only on gun ownership, which is the group’s main focus, but also on the minimum wage and equal pay for women. In a 30-second spot titled ""Strange Ideas,"" Giffords’ group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, asserts that Garcia holds views different from a majority of New Hampshire residents. ""Marilinda Garcia has some strange ideas. Most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage. Garcia opposes it. Most people support guaranteeing women get equal pay for equal work. Garcia’s against that, too. Garcia even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check. Granite Staters deserve commonsense leadership, not Marilinda Garcia."" PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check the record on those claims. In this item, we’ll check Garcia’s stance on a minimum wage increase. Garcia, a state representative, is challenging incumbent U.S. Rep. Ann McLane Kuster, a Democrat, for the 2nd Congressional District seat. The Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC unveiled the advertisement in September, just as it stopped airing a controversial TV ad that accused a congressional candidate in Arizona of opposing legislation that aims to prevent convicted stalkers from buying guns. On-screen, the New Hampshire ad cites a WMUR-TV poll from February that found three-quarters of New Hampshire residents supported raising the state minimum wage to $9 an hour. That provides support for the ad’s claim, though it’s worth noting that a federal proposal supported by President Barack Obama and other Democrats would push it higher, to $10.10 an hour. At the time the poll was conducted, the New Hampshire Legislature was considering a bill (HB1403) to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.25 in 2015, and then to $9 in 2016. The poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, found that 59 percent of residents strongly supported the increase and another 17 percent somewhat supported it. Eight percent strongly opposed it and 5 percent somewhat opposed it. Another 11 percent were neutral or don't know enough to say, according to WMUR. New Hampshire is the only state among its neighbors without a higher wage than the federal floor of $7.25, and it has the lowest minimum wage of any New England state. The minimum wage is $8.73 an hour in Vermont, $8 in Massachusetts and $7.50 in Maine. All told, it is one of 18 states have the same minimum wage as the federal minimum of $7.25, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. About a month after the poll, the New Hampshire House of Representatives voted to increase the state’s minimum wage by a vote of 173-118. Legislators voted mostly along party lines, with five Democrats voting against it and four Republicans voting for it. We checked the roll call to see how Garcia voted, but on three successive votes on March 12, 2014, related to the minimum wage bill, Garcia did not cast a vote. Later, in May, the Republican-controlled State Senate killed the bill, with all 13 Republicans voting against it and 11 Democrats voting in favor of it, a process in which Garcia played no official role.   An earlier legislative battle over the minimum wage in New Hampshire also sheds light on Garcia’s record. In 2011, the New Hampshire legislature, with a majority of Republicans in the House and Senate, passed a bill that deleted the state’s minimum wage, meaning that the state’s lowest wage would be the federal minimum. At the time, New Hampshire’s minimum wage was $7.25 an hour, the same as the federal amount, but critics said the bill was intended to keep the state’s minimum wage as low as possible. In the House, Garcia was one of 236 legislators to vote in favor of that bill, HB133. After passing the state Senate, Gov. John Lynch vetoed the measure. Both the House and Senate overrode Lynch’s veto, and Garcia was one of 261 members of the House to vote in favor of overriding the governor.   So, while Garcia has no voting record on the 2014 minimum wage increase in New Hampshire, she did take a clear stand on the 2011 law tying the state’s minimum wage to the federal one. As further evidence of Garcia’s opposition to increasing the minimum wage,  the ad cites an article from The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, which reported that Garcia opposes a minimum wage hike. That article, published June 9, introduced Garcia -- then considered an underdog in the Republican primary against state Sen. Gary Lambert -- to a national audience. The article reviews her record as a state legislator and points to how some GOP establishment figures had feared Garcia would be viewed as too conservative in a general election race. The article quotes Garcia saying in a March interview that while increasing the minimum wage superficially seemed like ""a good idea,"" it wouldn’t ""actually help anybody much more"" and could in fact hurt. ""It actually has negative outcomes in many areas. One would be, if we’re trying to encourage people to educate themselves further so they don’t have to stay in a minimum-wage job anymore, raising [the minimum wage] lowers the incentive to do that,"" she said. Garcia’s stance hasn’t changed since then. In an email message to PolitiFact New Hampshire, Kenny Cunningham, the Garcia campaign’s political and communications director, reinforced the position. ""A one-size-fits-all minimum wage from Washington, D.C., is counter-productive. Economists agree it would increase unemployment, particularly amongst teenagers,"" Cunningham said. ""Instead, Marilinda wants to reduce America’s highest-in-the-world corporate tax rates and rein in job-killing regulations."" Our ruling An ad from the liberal Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC says most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage, but Marilinda Garcia opposes it. Polls from when the New Hampshire Legislature was considering raising the state’s minimum wage showed that a majority of residents surveyed supported increasing the wage from the federal minimum of $7.25 to $8.25 and eventually to $9 an hour. And Garcia has gone on the record criticizing attempts to raise the minimum wage, saying it’s effects could be ""counter-productive"" and could lead to ""negative outcomes."" She also cast several votes in 2011 that effectively kept the state minimum wage the lowest in the region. The claim needs a slight clarification. As backup for the assertion that ""most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage,"" the poll cited a poll that asked residents about a $9 minimum wage. It’s not clear whether residents would support a hike to the higher level of $10.10, as the president and congressional Democrats are seeking. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2014/oct/03/americans-responsible-solutions/gabby-giffords-group-says-people-nh-want-raise-min/

Gun reform group says GOP candidate for Congress Marilinda Garcia is against closing gun loopholes
","The liberal group Americans for Responsible Solutions asserts that New Hampshire Republican Marilinda Garcia holds views different from most of the state’s residents. In a 30-second spot titled ""Strange Ideas,"" Americans for Responsible Solutions -- founded by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly -- says Garcia opposes raising the minimum wage, giving women the same pay as men for the same jobs, and gun ownership restrictions. Giffords is a former Democratic U.S. Representative from a district in Arizona. She was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in Tucson, Ariz., on Jan. 8, 2011, and has since become a leading advocate for preventing gun violence. ""Marilinda Garcia has some strange ideas,"" the ad says. ""Most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage. Garcia opposes it.

Garcia even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check. Granite Staters deserve commonsense leadership, not Marilinda Garcia."" PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check the record on those claims. In this article, we’ll take a look at whether Garcia ""opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check."" About halfway through the ad, an image is shown of a smiling Garcia holding a pink rifle in front of racks of other guns. The printed message says, ""Garcia’s against closing gun loopholes."" Lower on the screen, what looks like a newspaper clipping has the headline: ""Online ads are the latest way gun buyers can avoid background checks."" Another common loophole for people to buy firearms without a background check is at gun shows. As evidence for its claim, the ad cites an article from The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, titled, ""Influential Hispanic Republicans rally around underdog Garcia in NH"" published on June 9. When contacted, a spokesman for Americans for Responsible Solutions, pointed to the article in The Hill and said that ensuring background checks for all gun sales has widespread support.    The March interview cited by The Hill does not directly address gun show loopholes. Instead, Garcia is quoted as saying that lawmakers are ""too reactionary sometimes,"" and pointed to the push for new restrictions on gun rights in the New Hampshire House, according to the article. ""Clearly most of those were connected to mental-health issues, so why don’t we first identify what the real problem is before we end up sort of really infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens, because that’s what seems to be happening?"" There’s some clearer evidence from Garcia’s tenure as a legislator. In February 2014, the New Hampshire House killed a bill, HB 1589, that would have required background checks for almost all gun sales. The intention of the law was to ""protect public safety by helping to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill,"" according to the text of the bill, which was introduced by eight Democrats. There was never a roll call vote on the measure, but when it came time to debate the issue in the House, Second Amendment advocate J.R. Hoell proposed changing the law to ""study the correlation between current New Hampshire law and the low violent crime rate in this state."" Such a change would have vastly changed its original aim of requiring background checks for virtually all gun sales. Garcia voted in favor of the amendment to change the measure, and it passed by two votes. Eventually the bill was scrapped by a vote of 242-118, with individual votes not recorded. More recently, in an email to PolitiFact, Cunningham didn’t offer a specific response to Garcia’s position on the issue but instead said, ""Decreasing gun violence and maintaining the safety of every American is a top priority, but Marilinda knows that achieving this task does not generally involve imposing federal regulations on the 2nd amendment."" So Garcia hasn’t really supported keeping the ""gun show loophole"" -- but nor has she clearly advocated getting rid of it. It’s also worth noting that the ad’s assertion that ""dangerous criminals"" get their guns through loopholes in the law is somewhat exaggerated. All kinds of people buy weapons at these shows, and that doesn’t make them ""dangerous criminals."" Indeed, experts says the most common ways criminals obtain guns is to get them through straw buyers, through less-than scrupulous online dealers, or by stealing them, according to a Frontline report, titled ""how criminals get guns."" Our ruling The ad claims that Garcia ""even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check."" Her comments on gun control, both past and present, are too vague to draw any real conclusion, but her vote to effectively water down a background-checks bill while serving in the state House does provide some support for the ad’s claim.

Unsupported: Greg Abbott says he helped prosecute terrorist ISIS member
","Republican Greg Abbott let fly a statement of seeming international significance in the Sept. 19, 2014, gubernatorial debate in the Rio Grande Valley. Abbott, the state attorney general, defended his decision not to ease public knowledge of where explosive fuels are stored before saying: ""We’ve seen the rise of terrorism. I’ve been involved in prosecuting a terrorist member of ISIS."" Democrat Wendy Davis didn’t challenge his prosecutorial claim. But we wondered. The Islamic State group, believed to have tens of thousands of fighters, wants to see the Middle East cleaned of Western influence and put under ultra-conservative religious law. Since June 2014, it’s beheaded hostages (including journalists) on camera, conducted mass executions, captured American weapons caches, demolished ancient shrines and laid deadly siege to ethnic communities. Our look into Abbott’s actions led us through his state office to a federal indictment, news stories and an interview of the wife of the Austin-area suspect at issue. Ultimately, Abbott’s statement struck us as lacking in factual footing -- including whether the cited individual can reasonably be judged a terrorist. In July 2013, PolitiFact identified no ironclad agreed-upon definition of terrorism, which has been defined differently across think tanks and federal agencies. That story noted Bruce Hoffman, Georgetown University expert, wrote in 2006 that terrorism is ""the deliberate creation and exploitation of fear through violence or the threat of violence in the pursuit of political change."" His logic was that ""all terrorist acts involve violence or the threat of violence. Terrorism is specifically designed to have far-reaching psychological effects beyond the immediate victim or objects of the terrorist attack. It is meant to instill fear within, and thereby intimidate, a wider ‘target audience’ that might include a rival ethnic or religious group, an entire country, a national government or political party, or public opinion in general."" Abbott’s backup information By email, Abbott’s state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, told us Abbott was referring to 23-year-old Michael Todd Wolfe of Round Rock, who was arrested at a Houston airport on June 17, 2014, as he boarded a flight to Toronto, Canada. Ten days later, Wolfe pleaded guilty to charges he’d concealed a plot to provide resources to terrorists. According to a June 27, 2014, FBI press release, Wolfe had admitted in court ""he planned to travel to the Middle East to provide his services to a foreign terrorist organization, namely, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham/Syria (ISIS)."" As of early October 2014, he was imprisoned and awaiting sentencing. According to a June 18, 2014, FBI press release, Wolfe’s arrest resulted from a Central Texas Joint Terrorism Task Force investigation conducted by the FBI in cooperation with 11 other public entities including the Office of the Texas Attorney General and extending to local police agencies and even the state department that regulates liquor sales. According to the release, the FBI investigated ""together with the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, United States Army Intelligence, Austin Police Department, Round Rock Police Department, Killeen Police Department, University of Texas Police Department, Travis County Sheriff’s Office, Texas Department of Public Safety, Office of the Texas Attorney General and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission."" Mindful the attorney general’s office doesn’t typically focus on criminal prosecutions, we asked Strickland to specify how Abbott and his office pitched in, fielding no reply to repeated inquiries. We also asked how Abbott concluded Wolfe was an Islamic State terrorist. By email, Strickland pointed out mentions of ""jihad"" and ""battle"" in the criminal complaint against Wolfe, which was signed by an FBI agent. Federal complaint According to the indictment, Wolfe violated a law (Title 18, United States Code §2339A) written in the PATRIOT Act of 2001. The law states anyone who ""conceals or disguises the nature, location, source, or ownership"" of ""material support or resources"" that are intended to prepare for or carry out acts of murder, kidnapping or maiming can be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. Also on file in U.S. District Court in Austin: A 12-page sworn complaint against Wolfe signed by Blake Crow, an FBI agent who wrote that he was relying on testimony from agents whose identities couldn't be revealed. In the complaint, Crow describes multiple conversations with Wolfe touched off by Wolfe’s wife, Jordan Furr of Austin, when she spoke to an undercover agent about Wolfe’s desire to fight with ""his brothers"" in Syria, saying Wolfe ""just wants to hop into Syria. He’s ready to die for his deen. He’s ready to die for someone, for something,"" the complaint said. Deen is an Arabic word meaning religion. Here’s our summary of key portions of the complaint: A different agent met Wolfe almost three months later, on October 26, 2013, and they discussed ""violent jihad overseas."" Five days later, the agent offered to help Wolfe organize a trip to the Middle East. Subsequently, agents met with Wolfe or his wife at least 15 times. On at least six occasions, between April and June 2014, agents phoned Wolfe to develop a travel plan. In one phone call the complaint describes, Wolfe expressed reluctance to go to Syria.  When an agent called Wolfe on May 19, 2014, ""Wolfe utilized coded language as he expressed concerns about traveling to join Jabhat al-Nusra based on information he’d learned about the group’s recent activities. Wolfe indicated he was more in line with another group."" In a footnote, Crow, said he ""believes the other group referred to by Wolfe is the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria (ISIS)."" The agent called again on May 23, 2014, and told Wolfe that a man who would join them, another agent introduced to Wolfe as an experienced jihadist, ""already had the respect of the brothers because he had referrals and recommendations."" Wolfe, using coded language, ""explained that, given the demographics of their group, it would make sense to go to the other ‘performance."" In a footnote, Crow said he ""believes that Wolfe’s discussion of the other ""performance"" was a reference to the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria (ISIS)."" At the end of the phone call, ""Wolfe indicated he had struggled with whether to stay or go, and stated, ‘...but now...I’m back to going, so I’m kinda like scrambling...’ with respect to financial issues."" There were two more conversations between Wolfe and the agent in which Wolfe agreed to meet the agent in Denmark before they ventured together to Turkey. Crow said he ""believes that Wolfe intended to ultimately intended to travel to Syria through Turkey, and engage in violent jihad."" Another view  Furr, in her first interview on this matter, gave a conflicting interpretation of the described events. The man who turned out to be an FBI agent, she said, encouraged her husband to go to Syria, via Turkey. Furr said Wolfe wouldn’t have agreed to do so without the agent’s pushing. Wolfe also didn’t plan to enter combat, she said, and didn’t agree to join the Islamic State group. Asked if Wolfe was a member of the Islamic State group, Furr said, ""No, no, laughingly no. He doesn’t know anybody over there."" But Wolfe pleaded guilty to the charges he planned to join the group, Furr said, because the FBI had insinuated the government would prosecute his friends and family if he didn’t. Membership in the Islamic State Weeks after Wolfe’s arrest, the Austin American-Statesman spoke with experts about homegrown terrorists. National ""security experts cautioned against hyping up a terrorist threat in the United States, saying most defendants who have faced similar charges nationwide have been unorganized amateurs with little to contribute to armed conflicts abroad,"" the July 2, 2014, news story said. It’s not necessarily easy to tell if someone is a member of the Islamic State group, experts agreed.  By phone, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Washington D.C.-based think tank Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called the Islamic State group ""an open network."" ""In part whether you’re a member ...depends on whether you call yourself a member,"" he said. However, he said, the Islamic State group ""has a central command"" based in Syria and Iraq that directs the group. ""It’s not clear if someone is arrested as an"" Islamic State group ""member in Texas if they were acting on orders of central command or if central command is even aware of them,"" he said. By email, Henri Barkey, professor of International Relations and a Near East expert at Lehigh University, said he didn’t know at what point an individual could be considered a ""member of ISIS."" Barkley suggested we ask the person in question. We spoke briefly by phone with Wolfe’s court-appointed attorney, Horatio Aldredge, who declined to talk about Wolfe. Our ruling Abbott said he helped prosecute ""a terrorist member of ISIS."" Given Abbott’s silence on what exactly he or state lawyers did in connection with this case, we have no evidence to back up his declaration aside from a press release crediting a range of agencies including the attorney general and extending to the Killeen Police Department and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. That release doesn’t say any of the agencies prosecuted Wolfe. Abbott’s statement also relied on a broad definition of ""terrorist"" and ""ISIS member."" The federal complaint suggests that Wolfe may have sought to be those things but does not offer evidence that he had become either a terrorist or ISIS member. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

State GOP tries to equate Judithanne McLauchlan with a state income tax
","While Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes ran virtually unopposed for the redrawn 22nd district stretching across Tampa Bay in 2012, he’s facing a scrappy challenger in Democrat Judithanne McLauchlan this year. The Republican Party of Florida, acting on Brandes’ behalf, is attacking McLauchlan, a University of South Florida-St. Petersburg political science professor, on an issue where constituents are liable to pay most attention -- their wallets. In a TV commercial that began running in the Tampa Bay market on Sept. 22, 2014, Brandes implied that McLauchlan wants to break with Florida orthodoxy by supporting a state income tax. A similar claim has been made by fliers being mailed to voters' homes. The ad -- which features actors pretending to be students being quizzed by a teacher -- says, ""McLauchlan was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on Floridians."" It goes on to say, ""McLauchlan: Personal bankruptcy and a new state income tax."" Accusing an opponent of wanting to raise taxes is Political Campaigning 101, but did McLauchlan really associate with people who wanted to tax Floridians at a state level? Regressive facts McLauchlan responded to the commercial the day after it appeared, issuing a press release that called it a ""repulsive attack"" that used ""unsubstantiated falsehoods."" ""I oppose, will always oppose, and have always opposed a state income tax,"" she declared. The ad also mentions her personal bankruptcy, which McLauchlan has blamed on paying for high health insurance premiums and a surgery while she was a graduate student in the 1990s. She said the debt was too much, even after she became employed, so she filed for bankruptcy 16 years ago. She says she has since repaired her credit and is debt-free. So where did Brandes and the state GOP get the notion about a state income tax? If you look at the fine print, it reads that McLauchlan ""served on Board of Directors of League of Women Voters."" The ad uses her campaign site as the source. The League of Women Voters bills itself as a nonpartisan political organization focused on developing informed policy positions and voter participation. It does not endorse candidates, and members from any political party may join.  McLauchlan’s spokesman clarified that she is currently a member and was on the board of the St. Petersburg chapter from 2009-11, mostly working on voter registration initiatives. She also moderated candidate forums between 2011 and 2013. The Florida chapter of the group stated where it stood on the issue in its most recent guide to public policy positions: ""The LWVF supports the adoption of a state personal income tax as one part of a balanced and equitable tax structure."" The booklet notes that the position was revisited most recently in 1991, although as far back as a 1966-67 study it argued that a statewide funding source that ""would both be equitable and produce sufficient revenue was a personal income tax."" There also is a reference in the guide that says League representatives in 2007 spoke at seven statewide Taxation and Budget Reform Commission public hearings in favor of ""an equitable tax system based upon ability to pay, which suggests a state income tax."" Saying the group ""supports imposing"" the tax isn't accurate, however, because while the League researched the issue and found an income tax a sound alternative, it doesn't lobby for the change or push it as part of a legislative agenda. They give opinions on policy issues, but don't propose processes to change laws. We asked the Brandes campaign to clarify their argument. They pointed to a couple member requirements on the St. Pete chapter’s website: First, that members of a local chapter are also part of the state and national organizations, and that the group is ""open to anyone who subscribes to the mission, principles, and policies of the League of Women Voters."" Second, the site says that members can’t contradict the group. ""Once League (local, state or national) takes a position on an issue, members may not identify themselves as League members in publicly expressing an opinion that is in opposition to a League position,"" the site reads. League of Women Voters of Florida President Deirdre Macnab said that doesn’t mean members can’t disagree, just that they can’t contradict the League’s positions as a spokesperson for the organization, such as while serving as a board member. If a board member of any chapter decides to run for political office, that person must resign from the board, although they may stay in the League. ""There is no requirement that members must subscribe to every position the League takes,"" Macnab said, suggesting the Brandes campaign is misreading the guidelines they cited. ""We do have local League presidents who speak on behalf of the League, but we encourage our members to think what they want to think."" Macnab said the tax hasn’t been studied since the 1990s. She said she felt most economists would agree a statewide income tax is much more fair than the policies the state has now, relying disproportionately on sales taxes, which are regressive, and property taxes. (One-time gubernatorial hopeful Nan Rich claimed earlier this year that Florida had the third-most regressive tax structure in the country, a claim we rated Mostly True.) The issue isn’t on the table either way, Macnab said, because the state Constitution has provisions preventing the institution of an income tax. Doris Weatherford, an author, women’s historian and League member who met McLauchlan through her campaign, says the group doesn’t actively support a state income tax. The League has only taken an informed stance on a policy position, as it does with countless other issues. ""In the case of the income tax, the position is that this is the fairest way, but we haven’t worked to make it happen,"" Weatherford said. ""It’s been 25 years since that was part of the platform, but even then, it didn’t say we would work for it, and still doesn’t.""   Our ruling The state GOP said McLauchlan ""was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on Floridians."" That’s a stretch. The group was the League of Women Voters of Florida, which concluded -- about a quarter century ago -- that a state income tax would be a fairer way to collect revenue for state programs. The group hasn’t lobbied for that goal (or even revisited its stance in years) and McLauchlan, as a member of the group, isn’t forced to espouse a position on that issue. She denies that she supports it. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/03/republican-party-florida/state-gop-tries-equate-judithanne-mclauchlan-state/

Chuck Norris says schools and the federal government are mandating Arabic classes for Texas students
","Walker, Texas Ranger, is taking on a twist in Texas education. In an opinion column posted Feb. 14 on the conservative website World Net Daily, actor Chuck Norris laments that just ""this past week, some of our state's educational administrators joined the feds in seeking to mandate Arabic classes for Texas children. No joke!""

Risking a roundhouse kick, we decided to check.

We couldn’t reach Norris, but his column claims that an ""Arabic studies program, funded by a five-year, $1.3 million Foreign Language Assistance Program federal grant, was to begin this semester at Cross Timbers Intermediate School in Mansfield School District"" and be expanded later at neighboring schools in the district, about 20 miles southeast of Fort Worth.

According to a Feb. 8 post on the Mansfield schools’ website, the U.S. Department of Education recently gave the district a five-year, $1.3 million Foreign Language Assistance Program (FLAP) grant to incorporate Arabic into the curriculum. Mansfield was one of five U.S. school districts — and the only Texas one — to receive that grant, according to the district website and a July U.S. Department of Education chart.

The federal education department didn’t respond to our queries, but we found a description of the program on the agency’s website that says it gives grants to local education agencies ""to establish, improve or expand innovative foreign language programs for elementary and secondary school students."" A 2007 agency brochure says: ""Consistent with the principle of local flexibility under No Child Left Behind, FLAP permits schools and states to choose instructional approaches that best meet local needs.""

According to the brochure, President George W. Bush established the National Security Language Initiative in 2006 to ""dramatically increase the number of Americans learning critical foreign languages through new and expanded programs."" A 9/11 Commission report issued in 2004 says that the government’s counter-terrorism plan had failed, in part, because ""the FBI did not dedicate sufficient resources to the surveillance and translation needs of counter-terrorism agents. The agency lacked sufficient translators proficient in Arabic and other key languages.""

""The district applied for this grant because the Arabic language is listed by the federal government as a critical language,"" according to the district’s website. ""This means that our country has a shortage of Arabic speakers and there is a need for people who are not only proficient in the Arabic language, but also possess knowledge about its cultures and traditions.""

In bold type, the web entry says: ""There are no ‘mandatory Arabic classes,’ as being falsely reported in the media.""

Richie Escovedo, a Mansfield district spokesman, called Norris’ claim ""highly misleading."" He told us that after the district informed the school board about the grant in December, it backed off its plans to implement the program after parents, among others, raised concerns about the curriculum.

Republican state Rep. Dan Flynn, for example, said in a Feb. 14 op-ed criticizing the school district’s plans that ""the ‘culture’ of the Arab world is inseparable from the religious component because it does not respect secular government and never has. … So, if schools want to teach Islam as a ‘culture’ then I want my constituents to be able to teach Christianity as a culture since the United States was founded on Judeo-Christian principles.""

And the Johnson County Republican Party passed a resolution condemning the district’s plans, according to a Feb. 13 news article in the Cleburne Times-Review. In it, party chairman Henry Teich is quoted as saying: ""The purpose in passing this resolution is that there is a decided effort to suppress the history of our own country. Now, we’re teaching everything but English.""

Before the district backed off its plans, elements of Arabic would be incorporated into other elementary and middle school classes the state requires, like English, math and social studies, Escovedo said. If students were studying fractions, for example, they might learn that ""the early ages of algebra came from the Arabic culture,"" he said. ""But they still go on with the mathematics lesson of the day."" High school and middle school students will be able to take Arabic language classes as an elective, he said.

According to a Frequently Asked Questions page we found on the school district’s website about the Arabic-language studies planned for Cross Timbers Intermediate School, all students ""would receive an average of 20 minutes per day of Arabic language and culture through social studies classes, advisory once a week and intermittently in electives such as technology applications, art and P.E.""

Escovedo said ""none of the curriculum was set"" when the district decided Feb. 7 to delay the program’s implementation. On Feb. 18, the school district issued a press release announcing that all Arabic instruction would be optional. Starting next school year, T.A. Howard Middle School will offer Arabic as an elective foreign-language class for seventh-graders and an Arabic language class for high-school credit for eighth-graders.

At least one other Texas district has plans to offer Arabic. According to a Feb. 20 Fort Worth Star-Telegram news article, the Hurst-Euless-Bedford district will offer language classes this fall. According to the Texas Education Agency, less than one-half percent were enrolled in Arabic classes last year, the article says.

So, a district is planning to implement an Arabic language program using federal funds — and before it backed off its plan, the district was going to introduce elements of Arabic into everyday curriculum.

We found no evidence, though, that any students in any district was going to be required to take Arabic classes. Nor does there appear to be proof that federal and school district officials are teaming up to impose that mandate on students in general.

Still, Norris’ statement contains an element of truth. We rate the statement Barely True.     Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.    ",/factchecks/2011/feb/28/chuck-norris/chuck-norris-says-school-districts-and-federal-gov/

Lawmaker says illegal immigrant students takes class space away from legal residents
","
This legislative session, many state lawmakers have Illegal immigrants on the brain.

Bills under consideration at the Gold Dome aim to chase illegal immigrants from the state’s work force, prevent cities from offering them safe haven, and in the case of House Bill 59, block them from admission to Georgia’s public colleges.

They’re taking up classroom space that could go to students who are legal residents, argued state Sen. Don Balfour.

During a Feb. 15 committee hearing, the Snellville Republican told the story of two freshmen he said had trouble registering for classes at Gainesville State College and Georgia Gwinnett College because they were full. Both were legal residents.

""If there’s one student that’s at Georgia Gwinnett College that’s not here legally, that student [the legal resident] is losing his position to someone who’s not here legally,"" Balfour said.

Really? We thought the Board of Regents, which oversees the University System of Georgia, changed its policy in October to prevent this from happening.

Starting this fall, no illegal immigrant will be allowed admission in any public school in the state that turns away qualified applicants, such as the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech. That means no legal resident will be denied admission because an illegal immigrant has already filled his slot.

House Bill 59, which Balfour backs, would bar illegal immigrants from enrolling in any public, postsecondary education institution in Georgia.

Right now, Georgia’s public colleges may admit illegal immigrants, so long as the students pay full tuition instead of the much lower in-state resident rate.

But not for long. In March 2010, Kennesaw State University student Jessica Colotl, an illegal immigrant, was arrested on a traffic charge. School officials realized she was being charged in-state tuition.  

Her arrest prompted the Board of Regents to ban illegal immigrants from the state’s five most selective schools starting in fall 2011: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State, Georgia College & State University, and Georgia Health Sciences University.

Gainesville State and Georgia Gwinnett grant admission to every student who meets basic admission requirements. Since every qualified person can enroll, none of them, legal or illegal, can be shut out. Getting into the classes students want to take, though, can be another story.

PolitiFact Georgia talked to Balfour, who gave us more information about the freshmen who could not get into classes they wanted. He did not identify them.

The Gainesville State student registered early for classes and went off to Army basic training, Balfour said. While he was away, a notice came in the mail saying he needed to pay an additional charge to complete registration. By the time the soldier returned, he had been dropped from his courses and had to sign up again. Class times he wanted were full.

In the Georgia Gwinnett case, a student decided one month before the beginning of the term that he wanted to go to college and found most classes were already full, Balfour said.  

Balfour said he was not aware of specific cases where an illegal immigrant took the spot of a legal resident, but said that Colotl likely did so.

That’s a sensible assumption. One month before the Colotl’s arrest, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that campuses were running low on courses and faculty. Kennesaw State students said they had to delay graduation because they could not get into all the courses they needed.

Yet we found no specific evidence in that article or elsewhere of illegal immigrants keeping legal residents out of classes.  

Representatives from both schools mentioned by Balfour said that typically, a slot is open that term for the same course but at another time. Still, popular courses do fill up.

After Colotl’s arrest, regents determined the number of what they call ""undocumented"" students in the University System.

Of the University System’s more than 310,000 students, 501 were ""undocumented,"" their data showed. That’s less than 0.2 percent. Fifty-two were Gainesville State students. Two attended Georgia Gwinnett. Some 8,800 students are enrolled at Gainesville State. Georgia Gwinnett’s enrollment is about 5,300.

In 2010, leaders at several public colleges told the AJC that students can’t get into classes they want because the schools don’t have enough money to hold more classes. During the past 10 years, University System enrollment spiked by about 34 percent, according to state data, but the state Legislature increased funding by only about 12 percent.

Balfour acknowledged to PolitiFact Georgia that in most cases, students are likely crowded out of classes because there isn’t enough space. Still, lawmakers shouldn’t overlook the potential problem posed by illegal immigrants, he said.

Strictly speaking, Balfour’s initial statement is correct. If a single illegal immigrant snags a spot in a popular course that fills up, legal residents can miss out.

However, Balfour’s statement does not acknowledge the fundamental problem, which is tight resources. Given the small number of ""undocumented"" students, it’s safe to say that most of the time, legal residents are taking the slots away from one another.  

Balfour’s statement is accurate but could have used clarification. Therefore it meets the Truth-O-Meter’s definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/28/don-balfour/lawmaker-says-illegal-immigrant-students-takes-cla/

State Rep. Leo Berman says Hawaii governor can't find anything that says Obama was born in Hawaii
","
CORRECTION, 9:38 a.m.  Feb. 27, 2011: Our initial posted article had an incorrect first reference to the fact-checking entity that reviewed the birth certificate aired by Barack Obama's campaign. That research was done by FactCheck.org. The text is correct below. 
State Rep. Leo Berman says that his proposed bill to require presidential candidates to show their birth certificates to the Texas secretary of state reflects doubts about President Barack Obama’s birthplace. 
""We don’t think the president was vetted, and it’s just that simple,"" Berman, R-Tyler, is quoted as saying in a Feb. 14 Politico article about similar proposals pending in some other states. ""I read different things that say he was born in Hawaii, and then I read the governor (of Hawaii) can’t find anything that says he was born in Hawaii."" 
A subset of Obama critics, dubbed ""birthers,"" doubt that he is a natural-born U.S. citizen, a requirement to serve as president, and question the validity of his Hawaii birth document. That’s an old claim, shot down by PolitiFact National and FactCheck.org, which concluded that that a document aired by Obama's campaign is authentic. We won’t revisit that question. 
Still, Berman’s claim that Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie couldn’t vouch for Obama’s birth in the Aloha State was a new one to us. 
When we asked Berman about it, he replied: ""I just listen to the news, I don’t write it down. It’s been on several news stations that he (Abercrombie) said he was going to resolve this once and for all and when he tried to ... he couldn’t find anything."" 
Berman’s public comments have previously put him in ""birther"" company. 
In a Nov. 17 Lubbock Avalanche-Journal news article, Berman said his proposal was necessary ""because we have a president whom the American people don’t know whether he was born in Kenya or some other place."" It’s undisputed, as posted on the White House website, that Obama’s late father was born in Kenya. 
But back to Hawaii: In 2008, in response to questions about Obama’s birthplace, his campaign released a copy of his ""Certification of Live Birth"" from Hawaii and posted it online. The document states that Barack Hussein Obama II was born on at 7:24 p.m. Aug. 4, 1961, in Honolulu to parents Stanley Ann Dunham and Barack Hussein Obama. 
Birthers, though, said the posted document was a shortened version of a birth certificate, questioning why the original, ""long form"" documentation of birth was not released. 
According to a Dec. 24 New York Times news article, Abercrombie, who was elected Hawaii’s governor in November, was angered by the persistent skepticism that Obama was born in the United States and planned to seek ways to release additional proof that his birthplace was Hawaii. ""It’s an insult to his mother and to his father, and I knew his mother and father; they were my friends, and I have an emotional interest in that,"" Abercrombie told the Times. 
Next, we searched for the reports that Berman mentioned. Online, we found numerous Web pages with the headline ""Hawaii Governor Can’t Find Obama’s Birth Certificate."" Many linked to a Jan. 18 article by the conservative WorldNetDaily.com, a locomotive on the birther train, that was based on comments that Abercrombie made to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. 
The WorldNetDaily story begins: ""Abercrombie suggested in an interview published today that a long-form, hospital-generated birth certificate for Barack Obama may not exist within the vital records maintained by the Hawaii Department of Health."" 
The story continues: ""Abercrombie did not report to the newspaper that he or the Hawaii Department of Health had found Obama's long-form, hospital-generated birth certificate. The governor only suggested his investigations to date had identified an unspecified listing or notation of Obama's birth that someone had made in the state archives."" 
In the Star-Advertiser’s Jan. 18 published interview with Abercrombie, the governor was asked about his plan to release more information regarding Obama's birth certificate. He responded that he wants to use information from the state archives about Obama’s birth. ""This is what our investigation is showing, it actually exists in the archives, written down,"" Abercrombie said. 
We called and e-mailed Abercrombie’s office about this and did not hear back. 
Meanwhile, we found another report that Abercrombie couldn’t find proof that Obama was born in Hawaii. On Minnesota’s KQRS-FM radio Jan. 20, Hollywood reporter Mike Evans, claiming to be a longtime friend of Abercrombie’s, said the governor had told him that he had searched ""everywhere"" at Hawaii hospitals and that ""there is no Barack Obama birth certificate in Hawaii. Absolutely no proof at all that he was born in Hawaii."" 
The same day, Evans made the claim on Austin’s KLBJ-AM. 
Six days later, though, FoxNews.com quoted Evans as saying that he had misspoken. According to FoxNews.com, Evans said that he called Abercrombie’s office after reading online reports that the governor couldn’t find Obama’s birth certificate but that Abercrombie did not return his call. ""I haven’t talked to Neil since he’s been governor,"" Evans said. 
Meanwhile, The Associated Press reported that Abercrombie’s office had ended its effort to make public more information about Obama’s birth. The story does not say that Abercrombie had failed to find evidence of Obama’s birthplace, but that the state’s attorney general had told the governor that he can't disclose birth documentation without the person's consent. ""There is nothing more that Gov. Abercrombie can do within the law to produce a document,"" Abercrombie spokeswoman Donalyn Dela Cruz said. 
We wondered whether Abercrombie sought Obama’s permission to obtain more proof of his birth. The White House wouldn’t comment, but Abercrombie told CNN on Dec. 27 that ""we haven’t had any of those discussions."" 
Per the authenticity of the document posted online by Obama, our colleagues at PolitiFact National pointed out July 1, 2009, that FactCheck.org, a respected fact-checking unit at the University of Pennsylvania, had traveled to Chicago to examine the document and concluded that it’s legitimate. 
Janice Okubo, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of Health, told our colleagues that too much was being made of the difference between the so-called ""long"" and ""short"" forms. ""When you request a birth certificate, the one you get looks exactly like the one posted on his site,"" she said. ""That's the birth certificate."" 
According to a Nov. 1, 2008, FactCheck.org article, the ""long"" form is created by the hospital while the ""short"" form is printed by the state and draws from a database with less information. FactCheck.org also noted that the state’s birth record request form does not have an option for requesting a long-form birth certificate. 
The Hawaii Health Department maintains a Web page devoted to questions about Obama’s ""vital records."" It says that copies of vital records — which pertain to birth, death, marriage, etc. — can only be obtained by someone with a ""direct and tangible interest"" in the record. However, the public can view  ""index data"" based on those records in a department office in Honolulu or request it by mail. 
The page says that ""the index data regarding President Obama is: Birth Index // Obama II, Barack Hussein // Male."" 
Rewind: Berman didn’t pinpoint where he heard or read that Hawaii’s governor couldn’t find proof of Obama’s birthplace. We combed published reports, finding no proof Abercrombie said that. We rate Berman’s statement False.",/factchecks/2011/feb/27/leo-berman/state-rep-leo-berman-says-hawaii-governor-cant-fin/

Raimondo says law has not established whether Rhode Island public employees have property rights to their pensions
","
As states and municipalities across the country struggle with huge budget deficits, many have taken aim at public employee pay and benefits -- especially pension benefits.

Lawmakers in 18 states made changes in public employee pension plans last year, according to a report by the Pew Center on the States. More states, including Rhode Island, are weighing changes this year, provoking protests and legal challenges from public employee unions.

State General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, who has been sounding the alarm about Rhode Island’s $5 billion unfunded pension liability, was questioned about the issue Feb. 18 on WRNI’s ""Political Roundtable"" show. One exchange caught our attention:

Do state employees have a ""property right"" to their pensions? she was asked.

""I don’t believe so,"" Raimondo said. ""That hasn’t been established in law and I don’t believe they do.""

Raimondo reiterated her position Feb. 25 on Channel 12 ""Newsmakers."" Asked about property rights for state pensions, she said, ""this is an unsettled area of law. So in Rhode Island, our pension benefits are put out in statute, they’re not put out in a contract, as they are in some states. They’re not put out in the Constitution. It’s put out in statute. So it’s still an unsettled area of law.""

The point Raimondo was making is critical. In the radio interview she said that in 10 years  Rhode Island will need $1 billion to cover its pension obligations and the state won’t be able to afford that. The entire pension system has to change, she said.

Any ruling that public employees have property rights to their pensions could make it much more difficult to change the system, because both the federal and state Constitutions prohibit the taking of private property for public uses without compensation.

So was Raimondo right when she said that workers’ ""property rights"" to their pensions hadn’t been established in law? We decided to check.

There is a lawsuit pending against the state, filed by state employee unions to reverse cutbacks in their pensions that were made in 2009 and 2010 by the General Assembly. That lawsuit contends that the pension changes violated their contracts and also constituted a ""takings"" of the employees’ property without ""just compensation.""

The 2009 and 2010 pension cutbacks included increasing the minimum retirement age, reducing the percentage of pay on which pensions are based, and limits on cost of living increases. They are expected to save taxpayers $59.4 million in the current fiscal year.

Key people on both sides of the lawsuit were reluctant to discuss the property-rights issue last week. Ken DeLorenzo, executive director of the union, would say only: ""We believe the government can’t take away your life or your property.""

Attorney Lynette Labinger, the unions’ lead lawyer, said that the case is still in its early stages and a long way from settled.

Attorney John Tarantino, who is representing the state in the case, also declined to say much about the litigation, but added, ""I can say this, we intend to dispute the union’s allegations"" concerning property rights over worker pensions.

We asked Raimondo’s spokeswoman, Joy Fox, what Raimondo based her statement on. She  said that Raimondo, a lawyer,  was referring to ""case law,"" specifically an April 13, 2010, decision by U.S. District Court Judge William E. Smith.

Smith’s ruling came in a lawsuit filed in Providence by Council 94, the state’s largest public employee union, to block changes the legislature made to health benefits for some of its members.

Smith rejected all of the union arguments, including one that the reduction in health benefits violated state and federal ""takings clauses’’ that forbid the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. While he cited other cases involving pension benefits, Smith’s ruling was specifically about health-care benefits.

So we sought other guidance. We contacted attorney Daniel K. Kinder, a labor lawyer with 30 years of experience, mostly representing management. Kinder was one of two lawyers who testified in 2008 before a special Rhode Island House commission studying the state’s pension system.

He said he’s certain that Raimondo’s statement is correct. No court, he said, has established property rights to Rhode Island state employee pensions.

(The other lawyer who testified, Gerard Cobleigh, who often represents the state employee unions, couldn’t be reached.)

In their 2008 testimony, Kinder and Cobleigh said state employees pensions are protected by contracts and by statutes. They described a sliding scale of legal risk to the state if it makes changes to  the pension benefits, with the least risk for new employees to the most risk for those retired.

Finally, we reached out to Roger Williams University School of Law, where we talked to Professor Bruce Kogan. He said property rights to public-sector pensions could be determined by statute or judicial decision, but he was unaware of either happening in Rhode Island.

That opinion was seconded by Michael Yelnosky, a professor of labor and employment law at Roger Williams. He said he has not seen any case in state or local federal courts that establishes property rights for pensions.

So where are we?

* Raimondo’s spokeswoman cited a federal court ruling to back up her claim that public workers don’t have an established property right to their pensions. That ruling provides some support to her statement; a separate state case that raises the issue is unresolved.

* A prominent labor lawyer and two law professors agree that, as Raimondo suggests, the issue has yet to be resolved in Rhode Island.

So until a court rules otherwise, Raimondo’s statement is True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/27/gina-raimondo/raimondo-says-law-has-not-established-whether-rhod/
"['Bush Administration', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Labor', 'Virginia', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine says jobs increased 1 percent under George Bush while population grew 10 percent
","
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine may not have given the crowd at the Feb. 19 Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Richmond the scoop on whether he’s running for the U.S. Senate, but he made no secret of his disdain for former President George W. Bush’s record on job creation.

Kaine said in a speech that during the Bush administration ""while the population in that period grew by 10 percent, the number of jobs in the nation grew by 1 percent.""

We wondered if that was really the case. Alec Gerlach, a DNC spokesman, couldn’t identify the source on which the former Virginia governor based his claim. So we tried to find it on our own, comparing census records from January 2001 - the month Bush was sworn in - to January 2009, when Bush left office.

That can be a bit tricky because the U.S. Census Bureau only does actual counts at the start of each decade, and that doesn’t exactly line up with Bush’s term, which ran from Jan. 20, 2001 to Jan. 20, 2009. Between each census, however, the bureau provides monthly estimates on the number of people in the country.

The figures show that on Jan. 1, 2001, the U.S. population was 283.7 million. By Jan.1, 2009, that number had risen to 305.8 million.

Those estimates show the population increasing by about 7.8 percent, below Kaine’s claim that the population jumped by 10 percent under Bush.

What about the second half of Kaine’s claim that the number of jobs only grew by 1 percent under Bush’s tenure?

We turned to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show that in the month that the former president took office, there were about 132.5 million non-farm employees in the U.S.

In January 2008, the month after the official start of the Great Recession, the total number of non-farm workers peaked at 138 million.

But as the economic downturn took hold, that number declined, and by the time Bush left office in January 2009 there were 133.6 million non-farm employees.

So over the course of Bush Administration, the number of non-farm workers rose by about 1.1 million, or .83 percent. That’s just shy of Kaine’s claim that the number of jobs rose by 1 percent under Bush.

While Kaine’s numbers are a little off on employment and census, he’s right in suggesting that that U.S. population grew 10 times faster that jobs during George W. Bush’s presidency.

Even so, several economists told us comparing raw population growth and job numbers is not a preferred way to examine job creation versus demand. That’s because not all of the new people -- such as babies born during the Bush administration -- need jobs.

We were told a more meaningful measure is labor force participation: the percentage of the population between 16 and 64 that is either employed or looking for work. According to BLS, participation was at 67.2 percent when Bush took office and 65.7 percent when he left.

Here’s another thing to keep in mind: Economists have told us time and again -- on this claim and others -- that the policies of presidents and governors have only minor impact on economic cycles and job creation. ""They get too much credit and too much blame,"" said Sylvia A. Allegretto, economist at the Institute for Research on Labor & Employment at the University of California, Berkeley.

Kaine’s comment didn’t address job growth in Virginia during the Bush administration. But it you’re curious, Virginia did better than the nation on Kaine’s scale.

The number of nonfarm employees in the Virginia rose from 3.53 million in January 2001 to 3.7 million in January 2009 -- an increase of 4.8 percent.

The U.S. Census estimate for Virginia that was closest to the start of Bush’s term was a July 1, 2001,  figure showing the state had 7.19 million.  A July 1, 2009, estimate shows the state’s population had grown to 7.88 million -- a 9.6 percent increase.

To summarize, Kaine said that during former President George W. Bush’s administration, the U.S. population increased by 10 percent while the number of jobs went up only 1 percent.

Estimates from the U.S. Census and the BLS show that during the Bush years, the population increased by 7.8 percent while the number of jobs rose by .83 percent.

Kaine’s numbers are a little off his and spokesman doesn’t know where they came from. Even so, his suggestion that population growth outpaced job growth by a ratio of 10 to 1 is pretty much on the mark, so we rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/26/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-jobs-increased-1-percent-under-geor/

State Sen. Jeff Wentworth says Texas universities don't have bars on campus because it's against the law
","
State Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, played hardball with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews last week, when the pair scuffled over whether suds are allowed on college campuses.

Wentworth, discussing his legislation that would allow concealed handguns on college campuses, balked when Matthews wondered whether ""booze and guns"" are a healthy combination.

""We don’t have bars on campus in Texas,"" Wentworth said on the Feb. 22 segment.

Matthews: ""You don’t?""

Wentworth: ""It’s against the law in Texas. That’s exactly right.""

Matthews: ""It is?""

Wentworth: ""Yes, sir. No alcohol allowed.""

Wentworth went on to clarify that he was limiting his characterization to public colleges and universities. When Matthews said he knew a lot of colleges that have campus bars, Wentworth said: ""They don’t in Texas. We’re talking about Texas.""

We decided to check whether bars and alcohol are allowed on college campuses in Texas.

When we asked Wentworth for backup, he pointed us to a section in the state’s Alcoholic Beverage Code about alcohol sales near schools. According to the code, a county commissioners court or the governing body of an incorporated city or town can prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within 300 of a private or public school or within 1,000 feet of a public school at the school district’s request.

Carolyn Beck, a spokeswoman for the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, told us that the code doesn’t specifically define ""public school"" so ""there are some cities that interpret schools to include colleges and universities.""

The Alcoholic Beverage Code also cites a section of the Education Code, which requires a school district’s board of trustees to prohibit alcoholic beverages at ""school-related or school-sanctioned activity on or off private property.""

Yet Andy Kesling, a spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, told us that the words ""school district"" in the Education Code indicate that the provision is limited to public schools through high school. Debbie Ratcliffe, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, later agreed that the law does not apply to higher education.

Next, we contacted some Texas universities to gauge whether they have campus bars.

Rhonda Weldon, a spokeswoman for the University of Texas at Austin, told us the university’s Texas Union building houses both the Cactus Cafe, which has a liquor license, and the Underground, which is licensed to serve beer and wine. She said other campus venues where alcohol can be served, such as the Frank Erwin Center and the AT&T Executive and Education Conference Center, are run by contractors who are licensed to sell alcohol.

Wentworth called UT-Austin an exception. He said too that alcohol was prohibited on campus when he attended the Texas Tech University School of Law. Wentworth earned his law degree there in 1971.

Texas Tech spokesman Chris Cook confirmed that students aren’t allowed to have alcohol on campus and no campus establishments serve alcohol. But, Cook said, alcohol is sold in suites and club areas where university donors often sit in the football stadium and basketball arena, and is available during special events, such as receptions.

Next we tried Wentworth’s undergraduate alma mater, Texas A&M University. Spokesman Jason Cook said: ""We don’t have bars on campus, in the common term, but alcohol is allowed on campus and is served on campus under special circumstances."" The University Club, a campus dining facility, hosts a happy hour; the 21-and-older crowd can enjoy a $2 scotch or $3 sangria, among drink specials, from 4-7 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, according to A&M’s web page about the club.

Cook said too that the Zone Club, an exclusive seating area in the football stadium, serves alcohol. According to A&M’s athletic department’s website, the Club includes a full-service bar.

In San Marcos,Texas State University spokesman Jayme Blaschke told us that George’s, in the student center, serves beer. When we asked whether George’s is a bar, he said it’s ""an establishment that serves alcohol"" that isn’t a full-service restaurant.

Next, we looked north, learning that The Pub on the University of Texas at Dallas campus serves wine and beer during certain hours Monday through Friday — with a limit of two drinks per person, according to the university’s website.

John Walls, a UT-Dallas spokesman, said the university doesn’t consider The Pub to be a bar because it has a full food menu.

Lastly, we looked for a legal definition of a bar. Beck told us that as far as she knows, none exists in state law.

For what it’s worth, the online Merriam-Webster dictionary slaps the ""bar"" label on ""a counter at which food or especially alcoholic beverages are served.""

Time to close our tab. We found two Texas universities that have bars on campus while other schools we contacted routinely serve alcohol in campus facilities.

Wentworth’s claim appears to have no legal or on-the-town grounding. It’s not just wrong — it’s Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/feb/26/jeff-wentworth/state-sen-jeff-wentworth-says-texas-universities-d/

Mark Hass says plastic bags made up 12 percent of debris collected during recent cleanup
","
The pitched battle over Oregon’s proposed plastic bag  ban -- and accompanying 5-cent charge on paper bags -- is ripe for misused and invented facts, figures and claims. Already, we’ve knocked down one assertion that the ban would install a tax on paper bags.

Well, during a Feb. 8 hearing, Beaverton Democrat Sen. Mark Hass -- one of the biggest cheerleaders for the ban -- made a few of his own assertions that had us doing double-takes. One of them was that ""12 percent of the garbage collected in those SOLV cleanups, by volume, is plastic bags.""

SOLV, for the uninitiated, is a statewide conservation nonprofit. In addition to other efforts, the group organizes river and beach cleanups throughout the year.

We went to SOLV’s website to see what we could dig up. We couldn’t find much in the way of overall numbers, but we did find a breakdown of the sort of trash the group’s volunteers had collected during their Fall Beach and Riverside Clean-up.

Among the detritus were cigarette filters, plastic bottles, caps, cans, food wrappers, rope, straws and -- yes -- plastic bags. All told, 5,851 pieces of litter were found at the group’s 19 beach and two river cleanup sites.

How much, then, did plastic bags account for? The breakdown didn’t give any sense of relative volume, though, so we could check only by percentage. By our math, 4 percent, given 245 bags were collected. That’s quite a ways away from Sen. Hass’ 12 percent figure.

Next, we called SOLV and spoke with Rachel Pecore, a program coordinator there, and we asked if there were any more-comprehensive numbers about the debris SOLV has found over the years -- a number that included more than just the previous fall’s cleanup. She said she wasn’t aware of any, but she cautioned us about putting too much stock in the composition breakdown on the group’s website.

As it turns out, some 7,000 volunteers participated in the fall cleanup, but only 232 of those volunteers actually participated in filling out data cards on the debris they collected. ""Volunteers have an option of completing a data card of what they picked up,"" Pecore said. ""It is not a scientifically rigorous process. They’re estimates.""

Pecore then pointed us in the direction of the Ocean Conservancy, a far-reaching conservation group that keeps better numbers. In fact, she said, SOLV gets the data cards from the group and reports its findings back.

We looked at Ocean Conservancy’s 2010 study of marine debris, ""Trash Travels."" According to that report, about a half-million volunteers participated in a worldwide cleanup that covered 108 countries and 45 states. All told, volunteers reported some 10,240,000 pieces of debris, of which 1,126,774 piece were plastic bags -- roughly 11 percent.

As for Oregon specifically, the group found that of the 6,881 pieces of debris collected in the state, 890 bits were plastic bags. That’s about 13 percent.

We’d yet to find the 12 percent figure Hass had referred to at the hearing, so we gave his office a call. The senator told us a SOLV program coordinator had given him the 12 percent figure. He said he’d follow up in an e-mail, and, true to his word, he did.

Hass forwarded us -- along with a few other bits and pieces -- an e-mail he received from Diana Bartlett, a SOLV program coordinator. In the e-mail she notes that the Ocean Conservancy’s 2009 marine debris report shows that 12 percent of the trash collected by volunteers was made up of plastic bags. We checked the report and she’s right.

Hass also noted that the 2009 report offers a state-by-state breakdown that says cleaners found 13.4 percent of their sample in Oregon was plastic bags (172 of the 1,281 pieces collected).

Hass ended his e-mail with this: ""I’m happy to defend anything I’ve said on this issue -- and take my lumps if it’s out of context or outdated.""

So, are there any lumps to give? In the Feb. 8 committee hearing Hass said. ""Twelve percent of the garbage collected in those SOLV cleanups, by volume, is plastic bags.""

None of the sources gave a sense of relative volume. One discarded sofa (yes, SOLV volunteers found a brown plaid sofa on the beach one year) is more volume than 172 plastic bags.

And Hass wasn’t exactly right. He cited SOLV’s cleanups but the organization doesn’t gather reliable numbers. Ocean Conservancy, the group that actually produced the figure Hass used, did report that plastic bags made up 12 percent of its marine debris collection in 2008 and 11 percent in 2009. That percentage jumped to 13.4 percent in 2008 and 13 percent in 2009 when Oregon was considered alone, according to Ocean Conservancy reports.

It seems to us that Hass attributed his 12 percent figure to the wrong source. That said, the 12 percent figure seems to jibe with the general range the two most recent reports offer.

With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.

"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Ed Garvey']","
Activist Ed Garvey says Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said “It is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets.”
","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker insists that the purpose of his budget-repair bill, which has become the focus of national debate, is to erase state budget deficits that are projected to exceed $3 billion by 2013.

But some of his critics seem certain that what Walker and other Republican leaders really want is to get rid of public employee unions entirely.

State Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee) went so far as to say, like Hitler, the governor was abolishing unions. We ruled that claim Pants on Fire.

But what if one of the GOP leaders actually did say that the true aim is to get rid of unions?

Just such a bombshell was dropped Feb. 21, 2011 by Madison lawyer Ed Garvey, a former Democratic nominee for governor and U.S. Senate in Wisconsin.

In a Capital Times opinion column about Walker’s bill, Garvey attributed this quote to one of the state’s top Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald:

""It is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets.""

Garvey’s column, which was republished the next day on FightingBob.com, an opinion website run by Garvey, reported the statement as a direct quote from the Juneau lawmaker.

If the quote is accurate, it would be a potentially explosive development in the stalemate over Walker’s budget-repair bill.

Before we go further, let’s be clear about the Walker bill in terms of how it would affect public employee unions. We’ll rely on a breakdown we provided in a previous PolitiFact item.

The bill eliminates all collective bargaining rights for thousands of public employees.

For a much larger group -- including schoolteachers, local government workers and about half of 76,000 state workers -- collective bargaining could be done only for pay (and negotiated raises would be limited to inflation).

Only state troopers and local police and fire employees would be exempted. The bill, of course, does not affect private-sector unions.

Walker has argued the collective bargaining changes are needed not just for the short-term budget, but for future budgets at the state and local level -- to give local units of government flexibility in cutting costs. Union leaders say they are an unwarranted attack on public employees.

We’re not trying to settle that debate.

We’re looking at the quote Garvey attributes to Fitzgerald, that ""it is necessary to eliminate unions"" to balance future budgets.

We called and e-mailed Garvey on Feb. 24 and 25, 2011, asking for the source of the quote he attributed to Fitzgerald. He did not reply.

Since he did not reply, we turned elsewhere.

Searches of Google and the Nexis database also turned up no such Fitzgerald quote.

We put the purported quote directly to Fitzgerald, who said: ""I have never said that.""

So, how does this all shake out?

In an opinion column, Garvey attributed this quote to Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald: ""It is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets."" It was a quote that, if accurate, would have gained much public notice.

Garvey did not respond to requests for proof that Fitzgerald made the statement; we couldn’t find any; and Fitzgerald denied making such a statement.

We rate Garvey’s claim as False. 
(Editor’s note: Garvey returned our call on Feb. 28, 2011, after this item was posted. He could not cite a source for the purported quotation. He said he heard Fitzgerald make it, perhaps on a cable television talk show.

Garvey added: ""In any event,"" he said of the quotation, ""it's totally consistent with his position, as I see it."")",/factchecks/2011/feb/26/ed-garvey/activist-ed-garvey-says-wisconsin-senate-majority-/

Gov. Scott Walker says if public employees don’t start paying more for benefits by April 1, “the equivalent” is 1,500 layoffs now and 10,000 to 12,000 in next budget
","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker warned during a Feb. 22, 2011 ""fireside chat"" that if his controversial budget-repair bill does not pass, 1,500 public employees will be laid off before June 30, 2011 and up to 12,000 after that.

His threat applied not only to state employees, but also local government and public school workers, over whom he has no direct control.

That made us wonder:

Are some of Walker’s deficit-reduction goals so high that they are the equivalent of laying off that many public employees?

We established in a previous PolitiFact Wisconsin item that, despite some cries to the contrary, the state does have a budget deficit. The shortfall is projected at $137 million for the budget that ends June 30 and $3.6 billion for the next two-year budget, which starts July 1.

Walker’s bill led tens of thousands of people to protest and 14 Democratic senators to leave the state in order to prevent a vote on the bill. The opposition focuses on the bill’s elimination and curtailment of public workers’ collective bargaining rights. The public worker unions have said they would accept paying more for pensions and other benefits.

The bill would cut the deficits through various means, including increasing what public employees pay for pensions and health insurance. Those are key parts of an employee’s overall compensation package, so workers would end up with less money in their pocket.

That would generate $30 million in the budget year ending June 30 and $300 million for the two-year budget that starts July 1, according to Walker.

At a Feb. 21 news conference, Walker framed the impact of the higher benefit payments in terms of the ""equivalent"" cost of public workers:

""That $30 million -- if we don’t get it by starting our (higher) health care and pension contributions by April 1 -- translates in this budget, which means June 30, to the equivalent of 1,500 state government employees being laid off.""

He added:

""The equivalent at the state level for the next (two-year) budget would be 5,000 to 6,000 state government employees being laid off and 5,000 to 6,000 local government employees. That’s teachers and city workers and county workers and others out there.""

Added together, Walker is talking about a total of 10,000 to 12,000 layoffs at the state and local levels.

We can’t rule on Walker’s threat of layoffs -- he has said initial layoff notices could be sent as soon as Feb. 28, 2011 -- since it is a prediction of future action.

But we can assess his claim about the money that would be raised from higher employee benefit contributions as compared to the ""equivalent"" savings that would be gained from layoffs. That’s a mathematical comparison.

Asked to back up Walker’s claim, his spokesman, Cullen Werwie, provided a three-paragraph memo from a member of the governor’s administration, state budget director Brian Hayes.

In doing the math, the memo relies on total compensation (not just wages) for the average state employee: $76,500 per year.

The memo echoes what Walker said -- the benefit changes for employees would bring in $30 million in the budget year that ends June 30. In his news conference, Walker said that savings is based on the employees paying more for their benefits starting April 1.

Using the average employee’s total compensation, we found that $30 million is the equivalent of 1,568 employees. That essentially matches Walker’s claim of 1,500 state worker layoffs by June 30.

To look at the long-term budget effects, it helps to have a slightly different vantage point.

The budget director’s memo says that to reach Walker’s deficit-reduction target for the two-year budget that starts July 1, there would need to be 5,532 state employee layoffs. That’s right in the middle of Walker’s claim of 5,000 to 6,000 state layoffs.

Such a layoff would generate savings of $420 million per year, according to the memo. That’s more than the $300 million in savings over two years that was stated by Walker, so we asked the governor’s spokesman to explain.

Werwie said the $420 million is an ""all funds"" savings and that the amount of general state revenue -- which could be used to lower the deficit -- would be only $300 million over two years. One reason is that a portion of the salary of some state employees is paid from federal revenue or other sources, he said.

So, the budget director’s memo provides a basis for Walker’s layoff claims in terms of state employee layoffs.

But what about the layoffs of 5,000 to 6,000 local government employees that Walker claimed?

The memo makes no mention of them, so we went back to Werwie.

He said municipalities and school districts would have to lay off 5,000 to 6,000 employees to offset likely reductions in state aid that would be made in Walker’s budget for the two-year period that starts July 1, 2011.  

In other words, the amount of state money that local governments would lose would be the equivalent of what they could save by laying off 5,000 to 6,000 employees.

Werwie did not provide any figures, however, to show how that layoff estimate was reached. And Walker isn’t scheduled to submit his budget, which would include the reductions in state aid, until March 1.

So, with regard to local government layoffs, we don’t know what math Walker is using to back up his claim.

But Dan Thompson, executive director of the Wisconsin League of Municipalities, and John Reinemann, legislative director of the Wisconsin Counties Association, both said it would be relatively easy for Walker to come up with the estimate of local government layoffs.

They said Walker could use data from the state pension system to estimate the average total compensation for local government workers. And assuming Walker knows roughly how much in state aid to local governments he plans to cut, he would divide that amount by the average compensation figure, they said.

That would reveal the number of local government layoffs that are the equivalent of the amount of reductions in state aid.

So, we still don’t have Walker’s formula for his claim of local government layoffs, but there is reason to believe that figure could be estimated.

Let’s return to the governor’s statement.

Walker said the higher benefit contributions from public employees that he is seeking in his budget-repair bill are the equivalent of laying off certain numbers of state employees. He provided a basis for those claims.

Walker also said cited layoffs of local government employees. He didn’t spell out that estimate, but it appears he would have the figures needed to make it.

If more details emerge, we’ll revisit this item. For now, we rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/25/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-if-public-employees-dont-sta/

Gov. Rick Scott compares state pension problems to Social Security
","
Give him credit: Though Florida Gov. Rick Scott wants to eliminate about 10 percent of the state workforce over two years, and make those who remain pay more toward their retirement and health care, the new governor is at least taking the time in his first few months in office to meet with state employees and answer their questions.

Scott has visited close to 10 state agencies and departments, explaining his style of governing, praising government employees as hard-working, and defending his tough choices to reduce the government payroll.

The events have been interesting to watch because state employees have become more and more willing to ask Scott tough questions about his plans for state workers.

One of the more remarkable exchanges came on Feb. 23, 2011, during a short meet-and-greet with employees at the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which assists Florida businesses and workers. During his opening remarks, Scott praised the department for its work before opening up the floor to questions.

That's when a worker dissected Scott's plan to make workers contribute 5 percent of their salary to their retirement, framing it as punitive.

""Do you fully realize the gross unfairness of that proposal?"" the worker asked Scott.

Scott said a change was needed and that, ""You never know exactly what's fair.""

Then he compared the defined pension system to the federal Social Security program to illustrate the need for reform.

""Everybody here wants a plan they can rely on. Right now, your plan is underfunded, whether anyone wants to acknowledge it or not,"" Scott said. ""Pension plans all across this country, including Florida, are underfunded. So whoever the youngest is, everyone else should thank them because there might not be a pension plan, just like we're worried about Social Security.""

We were struck by Scott's comparison of the state pension plan and the federal Social Security program and thought it merited analysis.

Pension proposals

Scott has proposed massive reforms to the state's retirement plan. Among them, he wants to close the state defined pension program to employees hired after July 1, 2011, and force them into a 401(k)-style plan where participants make their own investments. He also wants employees to contribute 5 percent of their gross salary to help fund their retirement benefits, and proposes reducing the benefit calculation for members of the state's special risk group (police and fire), elected officers and senior management classes of employees.

Currently, the state retirement system has more than 655,000 active working members. Nearly half of the participants work in K-12 schools, and another 28 percent work in city and county government. Only about 18 percent of the system is made up of state workers. Of current members, 85 percent participate in a defined pension program, and 15 percent participate in a 401(k)-style plan. (Scott's proposals would affect all members of the retirement system in both plans).

The pension system generally has been well-funded through required state and local employer contributions, according to state Department of Management Services annual actuarial studies. The study measures the value of the pension's assets against liabilities it is required to pay as people retire and new workers are hired. The work is hugely complex but tries to answer a basic question: Is there enough money coming in currently to pay the benefits going out?

The answer in Florida, until 2009, was yes, according to actuarial studies. But when the investment markets collapsed as part of the recession, Florida's pension assets went with them. The state pension system reported nearly a $17.5 billion unfunded liability in 2009 ($118.9 billion in assets versus $136.4 billion in liabilities) and nearly an $18.8 billion unfunded liability in 2010 ($120.9 billion in assets versus $139.7 billion in liabilities).

As a percentage, that means the pension fund can currently cover about 87 percent of its obligations.

The underfunding problem is not confined to just Florida's plan. Joshua Rauh, a Northwestern University economist and one of the leading critics of state-run pension plans, argued in a controversial paper that many state plans were on a path to running out of money. The 2010 paper said that without reform, state retirement plans would start running out of money in 2018. Only five states would never run out of money, Rauh estimated, including Florida.

To some, the underfunding of Florida's pension system sounds worse than it is. The size of the pension fund fluctuates based on the result of the investments the state makes with the money through the State Board of Administration. And the money will be paid out over a long period of time as employees retire and start collecting benefits. That means the state has 20 to 30 years or more to fill that gap.

Industry experts say that a government pension plan is considered well-funded if it can meet 80 percent of its obligations, and Florida has been considered one of the best funded government pension programs in the nation. But some economists disagree with the 80 percent funding level, noting that government plan funding levels are measured expecting an 8 percent annual return on investments, and that isn't always possible. Florida bases its projections on an assumed 7.75 percent return.

Still, the Pew Center on States studied state government pension plans in 2010 and said that Florida had one of the top five funded pension programs in the country. The Pew study called Florida's pension a ""model for success.""

Social Security woes

That's not how people generally describe the federal Social Security program.

The federal entitlement program is now paying out more money than it is taking in through payroll taxes. The government is able to continue paying full benefits because of the Social Security Trust Fund, but those funds are expected to be exhausted by 2037. After that, Social Security is only expected to have enough money to pay out 78 percent of benefits.

A 2010 report from the Social Security trustees shows that over the next 75 years, Social Security has an unfunded liability of $7.9 trillion, meaning the program will have to pay out $7.9 trillion more in benefits than it will receive in tax revenues. The $7.9 trillion includes $2.5 trillion to repay special issue bonds in the Social Security Trust Fund and $5.4 trillion to pay benefits after the trust funds are emptied in 2037.

""The longer you wait, the harder it is to fix,"" said David John, with the conservative Heritage Foundation.

So anecdotally, Social Security sounds in far worse shape than Florida's pension system. But we wanted to try to compare the two with data. So we asked John, who is an expert on retirement programs, if there was an appropriate way to measure the two against each other. We suggested maybe comparing the unfunded liability of each program against the size of the federal and state budget. But John said that using budgets as a comparison would give weight to how governments philosophically spend their money. Also, the federal government funds national defense -- not the state, John said.

A better but not perfect comparison, he suggested, would be to measure the unfunded liability of each program in relation to the size of the national or state economy -- the gross domestic product.

According to the Social Security Administration, the unfunded obligations of Social Security over the next 75 years represent 1.2 percent of national GDP.

According to Moody's Investors Service, Florida's pension liabilities represent 2.37 percent of state GDP. Florida's liabilities are measured over 30 years.

So the data seems to fly in the face of the accolades Florida usually receives.

Our ruling

Where does this leave us?

Scott said that without changes, ""there might not be a pension plan, just like we're worried about Social Security."" There's no real suggestion that Florida's pension plan faces a major crisis, even from Rauh, a pension critic who believes most government plans are doomed. 
That said, Florida's plan -- like most government programs -- is underfunded and needs either reform or better investment returns over the long run. In that way it's not that unlike Social Security, a federal program that must be reformed in the coming years to avoid benefit cuts.

Wisconsin state Rep. Mark Pocan says Gov. Scott Walker’s estimate of a $3.6 billion state budget deficit is a ‘bogus figure’
","

Democrats trying to stop Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s move to sharply curtail public employee collective bargaining rights attack the plan itself, but also challenge Walker’s depiction of a crisis that he says demands such sweeping changes.

In a Feb. 16 blog post headlined, ""Walker’s Trojan Horse,"" Democratic state Rep. Mark Pocan of Madison scoffs at Walker’s estimate of a $3.6 billion shortfall facing the governor as he prepares the two-year state budget he’s set to introduce March 1, 2011.

""Governor Scott Walker’s manufactured $3.6 billion state budget deficit in the next biennium is rapidly unraveling as a bogus figure,"" Pocan wrote. ""The only way you can slip a bunch of bad public policy into law in Wisconsin is to disguise it as something else. Create a crisis, claim you are the sole path to resolving that crisis needing to enact whatever measures are necessary and he a hero to the people. Right.""

The $3.6 billion figure -- for the two-year budget starting July 1, 2011 -- has not received much scrutiny in the media. Given its importance in the debate, and reader requests to test it, we decided to dig in.

An important note: The number shouldn’t be confused with the $137 million deficit for current budget year ending June 30, 2011. Walker’s ""repair bill"" for that budget is the focus of the massive protests in Madison over the collective bargaining restrictions in the bill.

But that provision would affect the two-year budget, too, because Walker wants local governments to use the limits on union power to offset the cuts in state aid he will propose.

First we turned to Pocan, who was co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee when Democrats controlled the action in the last session, under then-Gov. Jim Doyle, also a Democrat.

Pocan acknowledges the state has serious fiscal concerns that must be addressed in the next budget. But he thinks a more realistic figure for the shortfall is somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, in part because legislators will likely limit state agencies close to a spending freeze.

So, is Walker puffing up the projected shortfall by more than 100 percent?

In short, is the number -- as Pocan claims -- ""bogus""?

Before we dive into the question, a bit of background.

A projected budget shortfalls is just that, a projection. It’s an educated guess about future tax collections and demands for services.

The process has some inherently political overtones.

As we have noted in the past, incoming governors often seek to make the problem large so they can come off as budget-cutting heroes when they submit their plan. Governors leaving office have an incentive to downplay shortfalls to burnish their reputations for fiscal responsibility.

In terms of size, the shortfall that Walker projects is nothing unusual over the last decade. For instance, Doyle estimated a $3.2 billion deficit heading into 2003-2005, and at least $5.4 billion heading into 2009-2011.

The shortfalls are owing in large part to changes in how much money comes in through income and sales tax collections -- which are dependent on the economy among other factors.

Walker’s timing is good on the revenue front: Tax revenue is expected to rise $1.5 billion in the biennium compared to this year, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

On the spending side, another factor that explains the biennial budget squeeze is beefed-up state commitments to school aid, prisons and health care for the needy that date to the 1990s.

When determining the shortfall, one of the few statutory rules of the game is that the shortfall report comes out before the governor makes his recommendations and ultimately presents a budget.

In a November item, we reviewed the Doyle administration’s estimate of a $1.5 billion to $2.2 million deficit. In rating it False we said found Doyle’s report made an ""$800 million assumption -- it counts as continued savings cuts that are really decisions for the new governor.""

Doyle, we reported, assumed in his estimate that Walker would continue several cost-saving measures Doyle had used to balance the current two-year budget. Those measures included furloughs, a roll-back of a 2 percent pay raise and across-the-board spending cuts.

Walker, of course, may end up using some of those methods to balance the budget, but Doyle’s assumption dramatically reduced  the size of the challenge Walker inherits.

We also faulted the November report from Doyle for counting on $528 million in additional federal Medicaid payments, which the report said was iffy.

Another $200 million debt hanging over the state’s head was not accounted for at all -- the repayment of a transfer from the state’s patient compensation fund that was invalidated by the courts. And Doyle’s version counted on $300 million from unspecified cuts in the Department of Health Services.

When you add those items in, the deficit figure was more like $3.3 billion.

Fast forward to 2011.

Walker’s new team revised Doyle’s report in February, estimating the shortfall at $3.6 billion for the biennium.

How did they arrive at that? Was it just a matter of reversing some of Doyle’s assumptions?

Not entirely.

Walker’s package of tax cuts for business and people with health savings accounts, added another $140 million to the projected shortfall -- that’s lost revenue to the state treasury. The cuts were approved in January shortly after he took office.

And the administration added back $1.2 billion in social service spending based on what they say is need that can’t be ignored in the Medicaid entitlement program. That was included in a memo from Budget Director Brian Hayes to the secretary of the Department of Administration, his boss.

The Walker estimate also scrapped the $800 million that Doyle’s aides had included for prospective cuts.

While in office, Doyle asked many agencies -- but not nearly all -- to freeze their budget requests at this year’s level. Those were submitted by his appointees. Under the adjustments by Walker’s appointees, those requests add up to a much larger number.

State budget officials did not return calls for this item.

We turned UW-Madison economist Andrew Reschovsky to opine on Walker’s numbers.

Reschovsky, who teaches at the La Follette School of Public Affairs, estimates the state deficit at close to Walker’s figure of $3.6 billion. He said the agency spending numbers were realistic, and that Doyle’s figure obscured the scope of the problem.

""People who suggest the problem isn’t real, I don’t think they are right,"" he said.

Reschovsky uses his own formula for the calculations, but was familiar with the February memo from Hayes laying out the administration’s numbers.

In contrast, Pocan -- whose claim the figure is ""bogus"" is the one we are evaluating -- said he had not seen the Hayes memo and was not familiar with its assumptions.

Pocan argues that agency increases over two years will never stand -- either in Walker’s budget proposal or during the Legislature’s review.

But that steers the discussion off point: Those requests, which largely reflect a continuation of current programs, are what creates the gap. It is in cutting them that revenues and spending are balanced.

Pocan gets some backing from Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research organization.

""The statutory practice of including agency requests in initial budget numbers is very misleading and confusing for the public,"" Berry said. ""They are wishes, not reality.""

But Berry argues that the state’s use of budget gimmicks dating back into the 1990s has created a rolling ""structural deficit"" that puts the state in a deep hole even as it starts its budget process.

Partly as a result of that, he thinks the two-year deficit is easily over $3 billion, even if some of the agency requests are inflated.

Let’s wrap this up.

Democratic state Rep. Mark Pocan accused Walker of manufacturing a crisis for his own ends. Pocan says the deficit problem is about half what Walker claims. Walker will surely knock down the spending increases requested by state agencies, to bring costs in line with revenue.

But Walker is following the rules and traditions of the shortfall-prediction game, and outside experts say his figure is realistic as a measure of the challenge he faces. And Pocan hurts his cause by not having read the latest shortfall estimate report by Walker’s top aides.

"['Labor', 'Virginia', 'Christopher Peace']","
Del. Chris Peace says Tim Kaine is trying to stop ‘right to work’ laws in Wisconsin
","
The Wisconsin labor fight between public sector unions and Gov. Scott Walker is sending tremors to Virginia’s capitol.

After The Washington Post reported that Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine made a Valentine’s Day trip to Madison to meet with Wisconsin union leaders, Del. Chris Peace, R-Hanover, attacked the former Virginia governor.

""Rumored VA Senate candidate Kaine [is] in lock-step with Obama to thwart pro-business, job creating right-to-work reform measures in Midwest battleground states,"" Peace wrote Feb. 18 on his Facebook page.

While there is no question Kaine made a trip to Wisconsin and met privately with union leaders, we wondered if he really is an opponent of ""right to work"" laws like Peace claims.

First, let’s define what it means to live in a right-to-work state such as Virginia.

The National Labor Relations Act, passed by Congress in the 1930s, says unions and companies can strike deals that require every employee covered under a collective bargaining agreement to either join the union or pay dues and fees. But the law contained an exception, saying states could ban this practice.

Virginia and 21 other states have done so. This means a person cannot be fired from a job for declining to join a union or not paying union fees. In states without these laws, bargaining contracts can require certain workers to join the union or pay dues.

Virginia law says ""no employer shall require any person, as a condition of employment or continuation of employment, to pay any dues, fees or other charges of any kind to any labor union or labor organization.""

We asked Peace to back up his statement. In an e-mail, he said The Post’s article about Kaine’s visit ""suggests that the [White House] political operation got involved at the state level Monday after Kaine spoke to union leaders. The causal connection seems present and begs the question that since the President and the DNC chair agree on this issue that resources would be deployed.""

Peace also said he thinks the proposed Wisconsin law would make the Midwestern state more like Virginia, at least in terms of labor regulations.

Kaine’s most prominent run-in with right-to-work supporters came in the weeks after he became governor in January 2006. The Democrat nominated Daniel LeBlanc, a former state director at the AFL-CIO, to be his secretary of the commonwealth, a post that oversees patronage appointments on the state’s boards and commissions.

But Republicans in the House of Delegates, citing LeBlanc’s long opposition to right-to-work laws, scuttled the nomination in a party-line vote.

Kaine was furious.

""Never before has the Legislature - regardless of which party is in the majority, and regardless of which party controls the Governor's office - ever denied a Governor his prerogative to make Cabinet-level appointments,"" he said in a March 2006 press release. ""The Secretary of the Commonwealth has no - I repeat, no - role in the enforcement of Virginia's right-to-work law, a law I strongly support.""

The statement supporting ""right to work"" earned Kaine the ire of liberal bloggers at sites such as Working Life and Daily Kos.

When Kaine was considered a possible vice presidential candidate in 2008, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation noted his support for right-to-work laws and said ""Kaine’s nomination might not sit well with big city unions, who are strong Democratic Party supporters.""

But there’s a major problem with Peace’s claim: The bill being proposed by Wisconsin’s Gov. Walker does not contain ""right to work"" provisions. It is solely aimed at removing collective bargaining rights from public-sector unions on all non-salary issues. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin and the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel confirmed that there are currently no Republicans making a prominent push in the state for rules similar to those in Virginia.

We called the National Right to Work Foundation, a group that opposes mandatory unionization.

Patrick Semmens, a spokesman for the organization, said Kaine’s nomination of LeBlanc and the campaign support he received from unions made him suspect in the group’s eyes. Semmens also shared the foundation’s December 2005 newsletter with us, which included an article on Kaine’s election headlined, ""Union bosses’ man wins Virginia governorship.""

But the story said, ""Kaine pledged to oppose any changes in Virginia's right-to-work law."" Semmens argued that was a strategic move, not one borne out of conviction.

""The political climate and large support in the state for right-to-work probably account for Kaine's occasional pro-right to work statements,"" Semmens told us in an e-mail. ""Recognizing the reality that Virginia's right to work is too popular to repeal is not the same as real support. After he got in office, I don’t think he gave us that much trouble, but I expect that was because [Virginia]’s political climate didn’t allow him to do so.""

We asked DNC spokesman Alec Gerlach if Kaine’s position on right-to-work laws has changed. Gerlach declined to comment.

Let’s review. Peace claimed Kaine is seeking to scuttle ""right-to-work reform measures"" in Wisconsin and other Midwestern states.

Kaine did meet with union leaders in Madison. But he supported Virginia’s right-to-work laws during his gubernatorial campaign and his four years in office. Even the group that seeks to expand these laws concedes Kaine did few things that troubled them.

Peace provided no evidence that Kaine’s visit to Madison marks opposition to right-to-work laws. He has no information on what Kaine said during his visit. The Wisconsin bill under debate is not even aimed at establishing ""right to work"" provisions. Instead it is focused on collective bargaining rules.",/factchecks/2011/feb/25/christopher-peace/del-chris-peace-says-tim-kaine-lock-step-obama-opp/

Michael Quinn Sullivan says that the debt weighs more than 136 aircraft carriers
","
Trivia time: How many aircraft carriers does it take to balance the national debt on a scale? Conservative activist Michael Quinn Sullivan offered the answer in a Feb. 18 e-mail blast: ""If you printed a $1 bill for the entirety of the $14.1 trillion national debt, the resulting pile of money would weigh more than 136 aircraft carriers,"" said the president of the free-market group Empower Texans. 
Sullivan pointed us to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which prints billions of dollars each year for the Federal Reserve. According to frequently-asked-questions page on the bureau's website, a U.S. note worth any amount — from $1 to a Benjamin — weighs one gram. About 454 grams equals a pound. 
According to the Treasury Department’s Bureau of Public Debt, the total outstanding public debt as of Feb. 18 was about $14.1 trillion. So,14.1 trillion dollar bills weigh 14.1 trillion grams, or about 31 billion pounds. 
At Sullivan’s suggestion, we checked the weight of the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier. According to the military’s Naval Vessel Register, there are a couple of ways to put the carrier on the scale. At its full displacement, including crew, cargo and ammunition, the USS Reagan weighs 98,235 long tons. That’s 220,046,400 pounds. 
And 136 USS Reagans? About 30 billion pounds. 
When the ship is ready for service but missing its crew and ammunition, among other variables, the Reagan weighs 77,607 long tons, or 173,839,680 pounds. Multiply by 136 and you’ve got nearly 24 billion pounds of empty aircraft carrier. 
But what’s the point of an empty ship? We found that other aircraft carriers, fully loaded, weighed about the same. The USS George H. W. Bush weighs in the same as the Reagan, while the USS George Washington weighs 104,017 long tons at its full displacement. That’s 232,998,080 pounds. 
That means 136 Washingtons weigh about 31.5 billion pounds — 500 million pounds more than the national debt. And the USS Harry S. Truman? They’re a svelte 101,378 long tons at full displacement, so it takes more than 136 of them to equal the the national debt. 
Weighing in: The national debt in dollars totals more than 136 fully loaded USS Reagan, Bush and Truman aircraft carriers. Other carrier weights differ, but they’re in the ballpark.

"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Rob Woodall']","
Congressman offers students math lesson on federal spending
","
U.S. Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Lawrenceville, recently offered some high school students a lesson in Washington math.

The freshman House member held a town hall meeting with students from Duluth High School in Gwinnett County. The Republican is not fond of the way the federal government is managing its finances, particularly how much it is borrowing to pay its bills and who it is borrowing from.

""Woodall said every nickel that came in during the last two years went to pay interest on the national debt, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,"" the Gwinnett Daily Post reported on Feb. 2. ""And every other nickel spent went for things like the environment, parks, homeland security and defense and was borrowed from a foreign land.""

A couple of loyal PolitiFact Georgia readers wondered whether what Woodall told the kids was true. His spokeswoman, Jennifer Drogus, told us the Post accurately reported what he said and offered a detailed explanation.

""For the amount of money the federal government receives in tax revenue, at current levels, we can only fund mandatory spending projects [including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.] and the net interest,"" Drogus wrote us in an e-mail. ""Right now, our nation’s tax revenue can only cover mandatory spending projects. Therefore, remaining money to cover discretionary spending projects must be borrowed.""

The budget deficit and national debt are big issues in Washington, with talk of a government shutdown as Democrats and Republicans debate how to best cut spending. Woodall wants to slow borrowing.

""There’s not a problem in in this nation that can be solved by borrowing more money,"" Woodall said, according to the Post.

We reached out to a few experts to see whether Woodall’s comments about federal spending were correct or was he sharing fuzzy math with those students.

First, let’s look at how the federal budget works.

The federal budget year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. In fiscal year 2009, which ended Sept. 30, 2009, the U.S. government spent slightly more than $3.5 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A year later, the government spent just under $3.5 trillion. The government is projected to spend about $3.7 trillion this fiscal year.

The federal government separates its budget into two categories, mandatory spending and discretionary spending. Mandatory spending primarily goes toward entitlement programs including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Uncle Sam spends about $2 trillion a year on these programs, according to CBO data.

Discretionary spending accounts for about $1.3 trillion a year. About half of that money goes to the Defense Department. The remainder is spent on homeland security, NASA, the FBI, agriculture, the Census Bureau and hundreds of other federal programs. The rest of federal spending, about $200 billion, is interest paid on the federal debt.

So where does the money come from to pay the bills in Washington? About two-thirds of it comes from you. CBO data show slightly more than $2 trillion a year comes from individual and corporate income taxes and social insurance taxes. The government borrows the rest of the money, about $1.5 trillion during each of the past three fiscal years, by selling securities in its capital markets to make up the difference. That debt is bought by buyers in the U.S. and foreign investors. We’ll talk more about those investors shortly.

Woodall told the students that about half of federal spending goes to those entitlement programs and interest on the debt. The CBO’s numbers show he’s right.

So what about this ""borrowed from a foreign land"" part?

The CBO says domestic investors own 53 percent (the Federal Reserve owns the largest share) of the federal debt. The remaining 47 percent is owned by investors overseas. China and Japan are neck and neck in terms of which foreign investors have the largest share of that 47 percent, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.

Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst for the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based group that started in 1981, said the congressman was ""roughly in line"" regarding his statement that ""every nickle"" goes toward entitlement programs such as Medicare. The CBO’s numbers show it’s closer to 60 percent.

""That’s a simplification, but it’s fairly correct,"" Peuquet said.

Peuquet disagreed with the congressman about foreign spending.

""I would say [Woodall] is somewhat off the mark because not all of what we’re borrowing is abroad,"" Peuquet said.

Craig Jennings, federal fiscal policy director of OMB Watch, a research and advocacy group founded in 1983, agreed.

""If he is implying that all of it comes from a foreign land, that is wrong,"" Jennings said.

Woodall said in a telephone interview Thursday that he recognized that the majority of the federal debt is held domestically, adding that he owns some Treasury bonds himself. Woodall said his conversation with the Duluth students didn’t go into that kind of detail, just his larger point that much of the debt is owned by foreign countries.

""Don’t think that I’m trying to persuade anyone we’re not buying American bonds,"" Woodall said.

We conclude that the congressman was essentially correct on how federal money is spent. He said about 50 percent of federal funds are spent on mandatory programs such as Social Security. The CBO’s data show a slightly higher percentage is spent on these programs, but we figure that’s close enough.

As for the congressman’s other point, federal data and the fiscal watchdogs we talked to said Woodall’s comments could leave the wrong impression about the federal debt.

Putting it all together, we rate his statement to the students as Half True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/25/rob-woodall/congressman-offers-students-math-lesson-federal-sp/

Gov. John Kasich says Barack Obama came to Ohio 12 times to campaign against him
","
Shortly after he defeated Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland in the November election, Republican Gov. John Kasich repeatedly expressed his displeasure about Strickland’s negative campaign. Kasich complained that he had to fight an unprecedented effort to soil his good name.

PolitiFact Ohio checked one such statement Kasich made to a group of lobbyists on Nov. 4: ""I had 12 visits by a president, somewhere between $45 (million) and $50 million (spent against him,) 500 paid volunteers in here calling me every name in the book, former presidents, first ladies and God-knows-who-else.""

After examining the four main assertions in that statement, the Truth-O-Meter landed on Half True.

Lately, Kasich has recycled one of the more questionable assertions within that statement, namely, that President Barack Obama visited Ohio a dozen times to campaign against him.
Kasich said it in two separate interviews on CNN on Feb. 21 and Feb. 22, the week Obama visited Cleveland for a small-business forum.

Kasich told CNN’s Jessica Yellin on Feb. 21 that he would be there to meet Obama the next day when the president arrived in Cleveland, despite their political differences.

""Well, I am there to greet him,"" Kasich said. ""I mean, President Obama came to Ohio 12 times to try to defeat me and guess what? He didn't win.""

The governor went on to explain: ""I think it is my job to be there to welcome him to Ohio on his first visit since he is president and I'm the governor.""

Since Kasich thinks his statement about the 12 Obama visits bears repeating, PolitiFact Ohio thought it was worth revisiting our research.

Obama indeed visited Ohio 12 times from the time he took office in January 2009 until last year’s election. But a review of Obama’s travel schedule and the text of all the speeches he made here show that only a small part of his time in Ohio was devoted to campaigning against Kasich.

Obama, for instance, visited Ohio on March 3, 2009, a full two months before Kasich even announced his candidacy.

And of Obama’s 12 trips, nine were made under the guise of official White House business during which he pushed specific policies – mainly health care reform and the economic stimulus bill.

Two trips last year, Oct. 17 and Oct. 31,  were made specifically to campaign for Strickland and the Democratic ticket. And on a trip made Aug. 18, Obama hosted a fund-raiser for Strickland and in a separate event pushed his economic polices.

Transcripts from Obama’s non-campaign visits show he referred to Republicans in Washington many times in arguing that his policies are better than GOP plans. But Obama never mentioned the governor’s race or Kasich.

Obama never mentioned Kasich at an Oct. 17 campaign rally before 35,000 people in Columbus, either. He named Kasich twice at his Oct. 31 rally in Cleveland.

Kasich’s claim does contain some elements of truth. Obama did make 12 visits to Ohio as president before election day last November. And on three of those visits he did specifically campaign for Strickland. But to say that Obama campaigned against him 12 times, Kasich is overstating the case.  

While Kasich deserves a little leeway given that any presidential visit provides cover to office holders of the same party, it’s a stretch to imply that the president was here solely to bash the Republican on the other nine visits. That’s a critical fact that would give the listener a different impression.

Even though Kasich likes to repeat it, on the Truth-O-Meter the statement is Barely True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Income', 'Taxes', 'Sheldon Whitehouse']","
Whitehouse says richest 400 taxpayers are taxed at a lower rate than a $29,000-a-year worker
","
Are the rich undertaxed?

The answer often depends on who is speaking and how they choose to look at it.

Those who argue that the rich are actually overtaxed may say, for example, that the people whose incomes are in the top 1 percent pay roughly 23 percent of all federal taxes. (Others who have this opinion argue that the burden on the rich is even higher. PolitiFact.com examined those claims in 2010.)

At a Feb. 13 community dinner at the Pilgrim Senior Center, in Warwick, Sen Sheldon Whitehouse offered a different perspective to argue that the richest aren't overtaxed at all.

""The IRS recently reported that the 400 biggest income earners in the country were making $334 million each, and were paying 16.6 percent in taxes,"" he said.

According to an account of the meeting in The Warwick Beacon, Whitehouse went on to say that, most people wouldn’t have a tax rate that low unless their income was $28,100 or below.

""A hospital orderly making $29,000 a year is therefore paying a higher rate of taxes on their income than someone making $344 million,"" the Beacon quoted Whitehouse as saying.

We decided to check elements of both statements -- the rate the rich paid and the lower income level that would trigger a similar rate.

When we asked Whitehouse's staff for the source of the 16.6 percent figure, they sent us to an IRS website that has statistics on the tax returns of the 400 individual taxpayers with the highest adjusted gross incomes.  The most recent tax year available is 2007.

(According to a transcript provided to us by the Whitehouse staff, the senator actually said he thought the report was from 2009.)

One other clarification is important. The IRS is reporting on the top 400 individual tax returns, which could include a couple filing jointly.

The IRS report says that, in 2007, the average adjusted gross income for the top 400 returns was $344 million. The average income tax paid per return was $57 million -- an average of 16.6 percent, as Whitehouse said. So on that point, he was right.

Out of curiosity, members of PolitiFact Rhode Island checked our returns for 2007. We found that our tax rates were even lower than 16.6 percent, and we make a lot more than Whitehouse's hypothetical $29,000-a-year hospital orderly.

So we checked Whitehouse's example, using tax rates, standard deductions and personal exemptions for both 2007 and 2010.

We discovered that Whitehouse was off -- way off.

That unmarried orderly filing a simple single return would be taxed at a rate of 9.1 percent in 2007 and 8.7 percent in 2010, not more than 16.6.

Then, using IRS tax tables and schedules, we did some math to determine how much income a single person filing the simplest tax return would need before his tax rate exceeded that of the richest Americans.

To hit a tax rate of 16.6 percent, that orderly would need to have made about $68,750 in 2007 and $73,500 in 2010, we calculated.

When we showed our numbers to Whitehouse's staff, they said our results were misleading because we failed to include taxes for Medicare (1.45 percent) and Social Security (6.2 percent on the first $106,000 of income).

""The vast majority of the income of the 400 wealthiest Americans is not subject to payroll taxes, whereas a worker with annual income around $29,000 would have to pay payroll taxes on all of their income,"" a statement from Whitehouse’s office said. 
""Leaving this data out of any comparison will paint a very uneven picture of the total taxes paid by working-class Americans.""

Although IRS spokeswoman Peggy Riley said those taxes are not factored into the IRS analysis, we understand the point of including them because the Social Security tax, in particular, has a significant impact on low- and middle-income people.

According to calculations by Whitehouse’s office -- which match our own -- when you include Social Security and Medicare taxes, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 Americans would have been 16.72 percent in 2007; the tax rate for a worker earning $29,000 a year would have been 16.79 percent.

In short, Whitehouse accurately reported the IRS's most recent summary of its top 400 tax filers, even if he incorrectly cited the year of the report.

When we audited his suggestion that the super-rich pay a lower rate than someone making just $29,000, we concluded he's right if you include all payroll taxes, but off by about $40,000 if you only consider income tax, as the IRS report does.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says his remarks during a prank phone call were “the things I’ve said publicly all along” about his budget-repair bill
","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker faced the Madison press corps after an audio recording revealed his conversation with a prankster he thought was billionaire business executive David Koch, the conservative activist and Walker supporter.

One reporter asked how state residents could trust Walker given that he told the Koch impersonator he’d ""thought about"" bringing in agitators to disrupt protests over his budget -- and planned a ruse to get AWOL Senate Democrats back to Madison.

Walker downplayed his conversation as routine.

""I take phone calls all the time,"" he said. ""I took phone calls from small business owners earlier, from this individual … I actually talked to one of the Senate Democrats over the weekend, hoping they might be interested in finding a way to come back. I’ve talked to individual taxpayers across the state.""

He added about his conversation with the Koch fake: ""But the bottom line is, the things I said are the things I’ve said publicly all along.""

That caught our ear.

In executing the prank, Ian Murphy, the Buffalo, N.Y., blogger posing as Koch, got what sounded like an insider’s-view briefing from Walker during the 20-minute chat.

To be sure, in the call Walker covered a lot of ground familiar to anyone following the budget showdown.

Walker press secretary Cullen Werwie told us the same thing.

The governor ""has consistently talked about getting Democrats to come back to Wisconsin and do their job, which he did in the call as well,"" Werwie wrote in an e-mail. ""He has consistently talked about need for civil discourse. He has consistently talked about the need to make long term, historic decisions that will effect future generations.""

Let’s take a look.

Walker told the caller about his threat of laying off state workers, one he made publicly on multiple occasions earlier in the week, and of a plan to block the Senate Democrats getting paychecks through automatic deposit, also discussed publicly.

He had also has made clear in recent days that he would not negotiate or budge from his plan to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for state employees. He told the fake Koch the same thing.

But several other items in the Walker-blogger conversation stood out. We asked Werwie if he could show that the governor had previously talked publicly about these topics Walker covered during the phone call:

-- Ronald Reagan:  Walker recounted how, as he prepared to release his plan, he took inspiration from Reagan, who fired air-traffic controllers after an illegal strike. Walker said his budget plan could ""change the course of history"" in Wisconsin just as Reagan’s stance -- in Walker’s view -- had branded the president as tough and led to the fall of communism.

-- Planting troublemakers at protests: The fake Koch told Walker he was thinking about ""planting troublemakers"" at the pro-union rallies. Walker said ""we thought about that"" but rejected it because it might backfire if ""there’s a ruckus caused that would scare the public into thinking maybe the governor has to settle to avoid all these problems.""

-- Dealing with the Democrats: Walker said during the call he would agree to speak with Democratic legislative leaders if all 14 senators return to Madison. He said he believes if Democrats return to the Capitol, the Senate would have a quorum and could approve the budget-repair bill - even if Democrats again left before the vote was called.

-- Asking ""Koch"" for help: Walker asks for support of the ""guys"" -- an apparent reference to GOP lawmakers from political swing districts who are worried about how the union vote will play at home. The message needs to get out ""over and over"" in those districts, Walker said.

It’s not clear if Walker means TV ads.

Walker told reporters he was not referring to political campaign messages. Koch is the chief backer of Americans for Prosperity, which on Feb. 23, 2011, announced it was spending $342,200 on advertising to persuade Wisconsin residents to back Walker's plan.

Werwie took issue with any portrayal of Walker as agreeing to the ruse involving Democrats, or any suggestion that Walker was coordinating political campaign messages with the man he thought was Koch.

Regarding Walker’s talk of making history like Reagan, Werwie said Walker ""has consistently talked about the need to make long term, historic decisions that will effect future generations.""

But Werwie did not provide any evidence that Walker had spoken publicly about President Reagan and the air traffic controllers union, the specific plan to lure senators back, the consideration of planting agitators at protests or discussions about outside ""message"" help for GOP lawmakers.

We did our own search of news archives.

George Will, the conservative commentator for the Washington Post, drew the Walker-Reagan comparison in regard to the air traffic controllers strike in 1981. He interviewed Walker for a column that ran Feb. 21. He does not quote Walker making the comparison; it is written as Will’s observation. We tried but couldn’t reach Will or Werwie as to whether Walker mentioned he was inspired by Reagan’s actions in the controllers strike.

In a New York Times profile on Feb. 20, Walker said he drew inspiration from Reagan because Reagan ""didn’t flinch."" The story does not indicate the context of that quote.

As for the plan to get Democrats to return from self-imposed exile in Illinois, we could find no new accounts about Walker and the GOP considering the ruse he discusses on the audio of the phone call.

On the issue of outside ""troublemakers,"" we could find no news accounts of Wisconsin Republicans considering this tactic.

Walker, in his Feb. 22 fireside chat, had pointed at the other side, expressing concern that protesters ""pouring in"" from other states would affect the civility of the debate.

Let’s wind this down.

Walker sought to downplay the news value in his phone conversation with the blogger by saying, in essence, there was nothing new. While some of the discussion was old news, the chat did produce some revelations about strategy, tactics and Walker’s view of his actions. So, is Walker right that what was said privately matches what he has consistently said publicly?

That rates a False on the Truth-O-Meter.",/factchecks/2011/feb/24/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-his-remarks-during/
