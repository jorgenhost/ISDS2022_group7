Ferguson, Mo., has 50 white police officers, three black officers, NBC's Mitchell claims
","Sunday show talking heads brought up a staggering statistic to explain racial division and outrage in Ferguson, Mo., surrounding the killing of an unarmed black teen by a white police officer. Viewers of the Sunday shows heard variations of the same claim: The majority of Ferguson’s residents are black, but black police officers make up just a sliver of city law enforcement. The point was made on ABC's This Week by Cedric Alexander, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, and on NBC’s Meet the Press by U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell. ""You've got three black officers and 50 white officers with a town that is 67 percent African-American,"" said Mitchell, who hosted the Aug. 17 show in place of ousted moderator David Gregory. (Gregory’s full-time replacement is Chuck Todd, who starts Sept. 7.) PunditFact confirmed her claim is largely accurate. The racial makeup of the police force emerged as a widely reported story line after the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by white officer Darren Wilson, 28. Mitchell’s statistic about Ferguson’s black population checks out through the city’s QuickFacts profile from the U.S. Census Bureau. As of 2010, 67.4 percent of the city’s 21,000 residents are black, and 29.3 percent are white. The state of Missouri, by comparison, is 83 percent white and 11 percent black. Ferguson’s black population was almost nonexistent four decades ago, when 99 percent of the population in 1970 was white, Census data show. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who is white, said the police department has 53 officers, three of whom are black, according to the Los Angeles Times and the Associated Press. He also said that the other 50 officers are white, according to newspaper reports. Put another way, Ferguson police officers are 94 percent white and 5.6 percent black. Timothy Zoll, a spokesman for the Ferguson Police Department, said Sunday that there actually are four African-American officers among the 53-person officer corps. ""The discrepancy may have been that we really don't see black or white among our colleagues,"" Zoll said. So there is some question whether the number is three or four, but there is no question that an imbalance exists. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles, who is also white, has addressed the lack of diversity in the police department. According to an Aug. 12 report by St. Louis-based TV station KSDK, Knowles told reporters that young African-Americans aren’t interested in police jobs. Knowles said: ""We hire everyone that we can get. There's also the problem that a lot of young African-American people don't want to go into law enforcement. They already have this disconnect with law enforcement, so if we find people who want to go into law enforcement who are African-American we're all over it because we want them to help us bridge the gap."" The lack of racial diversity on the police force compared with the city population is not unique to Ferguson. It’s actually comparable to other cities its size around the country. A 2007 Department of Justice survey of local police departments found the national average for all local police was 75 percent white. The average for an agency serving a city around Ferguson’s population was 87.5 percent white. Missouri law requires the state’s attorney general to issue an annual Vehicle Stops Report detailing demographic information for people pulled over by officers in each city. In 2013, the attorney general’s office reported that black drivers in Ferguson were about twice as likely to be arrested after police stops than whites. Blacks made up 93 percent of 2013 arrests after car stops. Our ruling Mitchell said Ferguson has ""three black officers and 50 white officers with a town that is 67 percent African-American."" This claim has emerged as a central talking point in the fallout from Brown’s shooting. Her numbers are backed up by news reports quoting the city's police chief and Census data. The only caveat is that a police spokesman now says that the department has four African-Americans, while the chief previously has said three. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/17/andrea-mitchell/ferguson-police-department-has-50-white-officers-t/

Ted Cruz bribed by Kochs? Strike a match
","Ted Cruz took a bribe? So said a July 11, 2014, Facebook post by Occupy Democrats depicting the second-year Republican senator from Texas as the group’s ""Sellout Politician of the Day."" Its message, brought to our attention by a reader, said: ""This is Sen. Ted Cruz, a Koch puppet. He was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would gift or sell them and their allies America’s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging.""    Democratic Party forces, including the Senate majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, often assail the billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, pro-Republican Kansas industrialists who have plowed millions of dollars into influencing elections and government. PolitiFact in April 2014 rated Mostly True a statement by Reid that the Koch brothers together are the richest people in the world. The same month, PunditFact rated Half True a claim the brothers spent three times what the top 10 labor unions expended in the 2012 elections. An apples-to-apples comparison was undoable, but an independent analysis of trackable federal data found organizations tied to the Kochs spent three and a half times what unions did that year. Earlier in April, PolitiFact rated False a claim by Charles Koch, CEO of the privately held Koch Industries, Inc., that it was only in the past decade he realized the need to ""engage in the political process."" Records showed him giving tens of thousands to candidates and political committees prior to 2004 while collectively, his brother and their company’s PAC had donated $7 million to candidates and political committees. In Cruz’s Senate office, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier confirmed Cruz this summer offered a proposal, which wasn’t acted on, for the federal government to shed excess lands, but she said in an email the Occupy Democrats statement ""looks like nothing more than politically charged rhetoric with no facts to back it up."" Group lacks evidence of bribe Occupy Democrats didn’t offer evidence of Cruz getting money or another benefit to introduce his proposal. But Omar Rivero, the group’s founder and a 2014 Democratic nominee for the Florida House, said by email the Texan elected in 2012 had fielded campaign contributions from groups fueled by the Kochs, including the Club for Growth, which describes itself as the nation’s ""leading free-enterprise advocacy group."" The group has been Cruz’s top donor, giving more than $705,000 of his $18.1 million in contributions, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Government, which says Koch employees and the company’s PAC have contributed $25,750 to Cruz, placing Koch 26th among the senator’s most-generous givers. Rivero told us Occupy Democrats analyzed Cruz’s amendment via a July 10, 2014, web post on the pro-Democratic ThinkProgress.org website stating Cruz sought to force the government to hand prized lands in the West to home states that would be forced to burden state taxpayers with the costs of managing the lands or, more likely, sell or give away the lands for mining, drilling and logging. ""We consider it bribery,"" Rivero said, ""when a shadowy, wide-reaching corporate interest political machine like the Kochs’ bankrolls a U.S. senator’s political operation and then that same senator turns around and supports a major piece of legislation desired by those corporate interests."" What Cruz proposed We looked over the amendment, contacted a Koch spokesman and asked advocates familiar with Cruz’s proposal about this claim. In July 2014, Cruz offered his amendment as a change to legislation authored by Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., the Bipartisan Sportsmen’s Act of 2014; neither survived. Cruz’s proposal said land under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Interior and Agriculture departments in any state shouldn’t exceed half the state’s land area. In states where those agencies do control more than half the land, Cruz proposed, the government should sell the ""excess"" land at auction or transfer it to the state. His amendment called for auctions or transfers to take place by 2020. Frazier of Cruz’s office said he offered the amendment, as he had once before, because ""he believes in principles of small government and like many conservatives, feels that federal ownership of land in the states should be limited so that the federal government does not own more than half of the land in any state."" Asked the precise origin of the idea, Frazier said: ""It came from him. He thinks the federal government should get out of the landlord business."" Koch role? Like many companies, Koch Industries lobbies in Washington, according to summaries of federal records by the CRP, and it spent $5.4 million lobbying there from January through June 2014, just before Cruz offered his proposal. Koch lobbyists reported interests in nearly 50 topics including appropriations to the Interior and Agriculture departments, according to the center, though the company did not report any lobbying related to Hagan’s proposal. To our inquiry, Rob Tappan, a Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for Koch Public Sector, part of Koch Industries, said by email the Kochs had no position on Cruz’s amendment nor, he said, did it lobby the issue or contact Cruz’s office to discuss it. Shrinking federal lands not a new idea Experts familiar with Cruz’s idea said they were unaware of information confirming the Occupy Democrats’ claim. Each also said it's not a novel idea to reduce the amount of federally owned land. Broadly, Jessica Goad of the Colorado-based Center for Western Priorities, which says it ""promotes responsible policies and practices, and ensures accountability at all levels to protect land, water, and communities in the American West,"" told us it’s not novel for legislators or members of Congress to advocate the sale or transfer of federal lands. Cruz’s amendment, she said by phone, ""is in line with the anti-government, anti-establishment tone of that side of the (Republican) party."" Curiously, Goad said, Cruz’s proposal would limit the transfer or sale of ""excess"" lands to the states of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada and Utah, the only states where more than half the land is federally controlled. She emailed us a Nov. 14, 2008, Heritage Foundation map of the U.S., drawing on federal data, showing the share of federally owned acreage by state. (Uncle Sam owns 2 percent of the land in Texas, the map indicates.) And how did the federal government end up with so much land in some of the states? Goad pointed out a center illustration showing that as a condition of joining the U.S., western states agreed to give up any stake in otherwise unclaimed lands in their respective boundaries.  Goad said the concept of transferring or selling off federal lands has been promoted by right-leaning groups. By email, she pointed out a ""model resolution"" for state legislatures from the American Legislative Exchange Council, urging Congress to convey title of federal public lands to the states. An ALEC summary says: ""Currently, huge swaths (over 50 percent) of the land in our nation’s western states are controlled by the federal government making it impossible for states to tax this land to fund education, grow state economies and generate high-paying jobs. Further, federal control prevents the states from accessing the abundant natural resources contained on these lands."" By phone, Alan Rowsome of the Wilderness Society, which describes itself as the ""leading American conservation organization working to protect our nation’s shared wildlands,"" said he had no information on the Kochs touching off Cruz’s proposal, which Rowsome described as a ""blunt instrument"" to shift lands to states or auctions instead of leaving decisions to designated federal agencies. He said, too, there’s no certainty under Cruz’s amendment that the trims of federal lands would lead to drilling for oil and gas or to forests being cleared. ""It is not a mandate of the legislation,"" he said. Brian Mullis, a Cato Institute spokesman, put us in touch with Shawn Regan of the Montana-based Property & Environmental Research Center, a think tank which says its scholars have ""documented how government regulation and bureaucracy often led to environmental degradation."" By email, Regan said Cruz’s proposal reflected ""a sentiment in many western states that local control of public lands is more desirable than management by distant federal bureaucracies."" Of note, Regan said, three states affected by Cruz’s proposal -- Idaho, Nevada and Oregon -- are not oil-and-gas rich. He noted too that under the proposal, the secretaries of Agriculture and Interior would be responsible for identifying acreage to be auctioned off or transferred. Regan speculated: ""These almost certainly would not be national parks, wilderness areas, or other ‘pristine’ federal lands, but would likely be lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service—many of which are already managed for logging, grazing, and energy development."" Our ruling Occupy Democrats said Cruz ""was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would give them and their allies America’s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging."" If excess federal lands were put up for auction, as possible under Cruz’s amendment, anyone including the Kochs could perhaps purchase the lands and then, as the owners, possibly chop down trees, drill for oil and the like. All this said, this group failed to provide (nor did we find) evidence of a bribe or any Koch-linked inducement causing Cruz to present his proposal nor did we find confirmation his proposal came about so pristine federal lands could be exploited. Campaign contributions aren’t bribes and suspicions aren’t facts.

Police Chief Edward Flynn says Milwaukee has seized nearly as many firearms as New York City
","In the wake of a shooting that wounded two children, ages 10 and 11, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn held a news conference and denounced the shooters as cowards. ""We have remorseless, reckless criminals in possession of high-quality firearms shooting at each other, and they don't care who they hit,"" Flynn said of the July 23, 2014 shooting in the 2800 block of N. 37th St. As of that date, there had been 13 kids wounded in such shootings in 2014. One of those, Sierra Guyton, who was wounded in a playground shooting, later died. Flynn said getting firearms off the streets is a focus of his department’s efforts and then offered a statement that you don’t hear often when it comes to crime -- how efforts in Milwaukee compare favorably to New York City. ""As of July 6th, the New York City Police Department had confiscated approximately 1,350 firearms from the streets of a city of 9 million,"" the chief said. ""So far this year, the Milwaukee Police Department in a city of 600,000 -- 15 times smaller than New York -- has seized 1,340 firearms from the streets of this city."" Are Milwaukee cops keeping pace with the NYPD when it comes to gun seizures? Let’s take a closer look. A visit from NYC brass When Flynn made the claim, New York’s numbers were top-of-mind. ""Several NYPD executive level commanders were sent to Milwaukee by Commissioner (William) Bratton to study a variety of topics, including our methods of crime control, community relations, and accountability systems,"" said Lt. Mark Stanmeyer, Milwaukee Police Department spokesman. Indeed, the visit coincided with the day of the shooting and Flynn’s next-day news conference. When the topic of gun seizures was discussed at the get-together, New York officials said they had seized 1,350 firearms as of July 6, 2014, according to Stanmeyer. MPD officials saw that figure nearly matched theirs -- 1,347 seizures as of July 24, 2014. To be sure, the MIlwaukee figure included an extra two-plus weeks. But Flynn had a talking point. When we asked New York Police Department officials about guns seized, they were not able to provide the number for July 6, 2014 that was used by Flynn. But their data tracked with the figure Flynn used  -- 1,289 firearms had been seized as of June 8, 2014 and 1,881 had been seized as of Aug. 10, 2014, according to department spokeswoman Sophia Mason. To get the comparison on the same time frame, the Milwaukee figure was 1,460 as of Aug. 10, 2014. In 2013, the department seized 1,921 guns. ""I don’t believe the point the Chief was making about the population/gun recovery ratio is lost,"" Stanmeyer said in an email. ""Even using the August 10 data, they only have 421 more guns with 7.7 million more people."" He also noted that the Milwaukee figure does not include 353 firearms turned in during a  gun buyback program last spring that was led by faith leaders. So what’s the explanation for the similar numbers? First, in New York the number of guns seized is down compared with last year. Bratton said in a June 10, 2014 report on Capitalnewyork.com that the number ""in some respects is reflective of the fact that crime is continuing to go down."" The numbers of murders, rapes and robberies also are lower than a year ago. ""We’ve had an increase, a temporary increase, in shootings. ... Crime goes up, it goes down,"" Bratton said in the article. ""It’s always going to go up at some point in time. We’ll always have the ability to push it down."" Another factor could be at work in New York. New Mayor Bill de Blasio promised to reform the department’s long-standing and controversial stop-and-frisk policy where cops can detain, question and search people suspected of crimes. Even before de Blasio took office in January 2014, the number of stop and frisk stops had dropped sharply in the past two years. Law enforcement officials told the New York Post that such stops can be effective in obtaining illegal firearms. Our rating Flynn said his department’s gun seizures, through a mid-year point, were about to those of  much-larger New York City. New York’s numbers may be down a bit this year, so other factors may be at work. But Flynn’s claim didn’t get into the reasons why. It was a straightforward numerical claim. We rate it True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/17/edward-flynn/edward-flynn-says-milwaukee-had-seized-many-firear/

Mark Zaccaria says Sen. Jack Reed cast the deciding vote for Obamacare
","The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, remains part of the great divide that separates most Republicans and Democrats. So it's not surprising that Mark Zaccaria, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, would raise the issue during his Aug. 3 interview on WJAR-TV's ""10 News Conference."" He put the blame for the law's passage squarely on the shoulders of incumbent Democrat Jack Reed. ""Let's talk about the Affordable Care Act,"" Zaccaria said. ""Mr. Reed cast the deciding vote in the Senate for the Affordable Care Act and what we are seeing is that more people today associate that with the ineptitude in management that we've seen in the Veterans Administration than in any kind of a private health insurance plan that they may have had prior to this time."" We know Reed voted for the ACA, as did all of the Rhode Island delegation at the time. But was Reed really the deciding vote? PolitiFact has been down this road before. A quick search of PolitiFact rulings shows that Democratic Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Bill Nelson of Florida, Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Sherrod Brown of Ohio have been blamed by various Republicans and conservative groups for casting the deciding vote on Obamacare. In each case, PolitiFact has ruled the claims Mostly False or False, depending on their wording and context. The reason: A deciding vote is typically the one vote -- sometimes cast at the last minute -- that puts a proposal over the top. To use a sports analogy, the deciding goal in a 3-2 soccer match is never the first two goals, even though all three are crucial to the win. The key Senate vote in the Obamacare debate -- actually the Senate's vote to close debate that paved the way for passage -- needed no fewer than 60 Senators supporting the proposal. That's all it got. Some senators withheld their support until the end, looking for last-minute modifications; Reed did not. He was the 45th ""aye"" vote during the roll-call. When we emailed Zaccaria's campaign to ask what made Reed's vote the deciding vote, the candidate noted that the vote to end debate got the bare-minimum of 60 votes, including Reed's. ""Without Mr. Reed’s vote to end debate, the Senate could have filibustered longer or even changed or defeated the measure,"" Zaccaria said. ""My point is that Sen. Reed had personal control over the passage of the ACA and, knowing the impact it would have, voted Yes,"" he said. ""I don’t believe my point regarding Mr. Reed is diminished simply because every other Democrat Senator also had that same power."" Our ruling Mark Zaccaria said that Sen. Jack Reed ""cast the deciding vote in the Senate for the Affordable Care Act."" Zaccaria's position is that because every ""yea"" vote in the motion to end debate on the act was crucial to passage, each of those votes -- 60 in all -- was the deciding vote. Reed's vote was crucial. Zaccaria could have called it ""a"" deciding vote (of which there can be many) but there is no evidence that his was ""the"" deciding vote (of which there is one). Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts -- in this case, the 59 other yes votes, including the 15 ""ayes"" that came after his -- that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

Did Sen. Jeff Merkley vote 'six times for more debt'?
","Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley and his Republican challenger, newcomer Monica Wehby, are trading barbs as they head toward their November showdown. Wehby is now the beneficiary of a new television advertising campaign mounted by a group called Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce -- a political arm of conservative billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch. The claim: A new 30-second advertising spot just launched this month as part of an estimated $3.6 million effort on Wehby’s behalf takes Merkley to task on spending issues. Merkley, according to the narrator ""voted six times to raise the debt limit."" While the narrator is speaking, though, red letters appear next to a screen shot of Oregon’s junior senator, proclaiming: ""VOTED 6 TIMES FOR MORE DEBT."" Did Merkley, as the screen words assert, vote half a dozen times ""for more debt?"" PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: Wehby has said she welcomes the ad campaign but made it clear she didn’t work with the group. Doing so would violate federal election law. So we emailed Freedom Partners and received a reply from spokesman Bill Riggs. ""The argument we’re making is that Sen. Merkley has repeatedly cleared the path for more debt and more spending, and it hasn’t helped Oregon,"" Riggs wrote. ""And while there’s no question that his votes to raise the debt ceiling allowed Congress to add more to the debt, the ad should be viewed in full context."" While the words on the screen say Merkley voted six times ""for more debt,"" Riggs noted the narrator’s words: ""Senator Merkley voted six times to raise the debt limit."" Merkley’s office agreed the latter is accurate. In previous interviews, Merkley said the votes were necessary for Congress to pay bills it had already run up. Andrew Zucker, his deputy campaign manager, reiterated that: ""In a nutshell, the Koch brothers are blatantly misleading Oregonians by attacking Jeff for voting to reopen the government after the Republican government shutdown, and preventing the government from defaulting on our obligation for the first time in history."" So were Merkley’s votes to raise the debt ceiling also votes ""for more debt?"" According to the U.S. Treasury Department’s website, the debt limit is the ""total amount of money that the United States government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations."" Those include Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on the national debt, tax refunds and other payments. ""The debt limit does not authorize new spending commitments,"" the site says. ""It simply allows the government to finance existing legal obligations that Congresses and presidents of both parties have made in the past."" We turned to a PolitiFact National piece that checked the question, ""Does raising the debt ceiling ‘increase our debt’?"" The story, published Oct. 14, 2013, said President Barack Obama was on solid ground when he asserted that a vote to raise the debt ceiling is not commensurate with a vote to ""increase our debt.’"" The ruling: An ad campaign supporting candidate Monica Wehby, includes words on the screen saying that Sen. Jeff Merkley voted six times ""for more debt."" However, the U.S. Treasury, and a prior PolitiFact check, note that a vote to raise the debt ceiling does not, by itself, authorize new spending. All it does is authorize the federal government to borrow sufficient funds to pay for debt that has already been incurred. Merkley’s six votes to raise the debt ceiling were not, in other words, votes ""for more debt.""

Florida GOP says Charlie Crist 'made it easier for Duke to take your money'
","Failed nuclear projects by utility provider Duke Energy have suddenly electrified both sides of this year’s gubernatorial campaign. After environmentalist PAC NextGen Climate ran an ad accusing Gov. Rick Scott of not doing anything to stop the North Carolina company from fleecing consumers, the Republican Party of Florida responded with its own commercial pointing fingers at former Gov. Charlie Crist. ""Crist made it easier for Duke to take your money,"" the narrator of the Aug. 12, 2014, ad says. ""Crist signed a law helping Duke get billions, while Rick Scott put a stop to the Crist giveaway."" PolitiFact Florida already reviewed whether Scott allowed Duke to take ratepayers’ money; we found the claim Half True largely because Scott didn’t say much of anything about the issue. But did Crist have anything to do with the company taking money for doomed nuclear power plant plans? We’ll check this bill line by line. Power play The accusation is based on the twists and turns surrounding the Crystal River nuclear plant and a planned nuclear plant in Levy County that was never built. Duke Energy (which merged with Progress Energy in 2012) had botched required repairs to the existing Crystal River facility and never moved the Levy project out of the planning stage. Thanks to SB 888, which the Legislature passed overwhelmingly in 2006, both companies had been able to charge the state’s 1.7 million Duke customers an ""advance fee"" to pay for those plants. That bill was signed by Gov. Jeb Bush, though. (Crist was elected in 2006 but didn't take office until 2007.) After it became apparent neither project was going anywhere even while costing Floridians millions, the state amended the law in 2012 with SB 1472, which put a 10-year time limit on the utility companies to start their projects. The state GOP said that’s how Scott stopped ""the Crist giveaway,"" but the measure actually doesn’t affect past collections. Duke decided in 2013 to shut down the Crystal River plant rather than fix it. The total cost of the Crystal River project grew to about $1.7 billion from repair work and other expenses. The company also canceled the Levy County project after spending $1.5 billion on it. And yet Duke continued to clamor for more advance fee cash. The Florida Public Service Commission decided in October 2013 to settle with Duke Energy for the two doomed projects. Customers would shoulder $3.2 billion in expenses, insurance would pay $835 million and shareholders would pay the rest. Customers will have to pay monthly charges of $3.45 per 1,000 kilowatt hours for Levy through the early part of 2016 and $2.17 for Crystal River through at least 2017 -- all for two projects that never produced any electricity in exchange for the money paid. The RPOF claim The state GOP told PolitiFact Florida the response ad’s claim was based on then-Gov. Crist signing HB 7135, a 2008 amendment to the original law allowing the advance fee. The portion of the law to which the Republican Party pointed, Section 366.93, was amended to allow the advance fee to be applied to transmission lines to move electricity from power plants to consumers. But as mentioned, Bush signed the original bill, not Crist. Furthermore, Duke Energy didn’t benefit from what Crist approved. ""The problem with that argument is that, to the best of our knowledge, Duke never recovered any money related to transmission lines,"" said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit advocate for sustainable energy policy. ""Even though Gov. Crist signed the omnibus energy bill, the provision Scott refers to never played a role in the costs now being borne by Duke Energy customers."" Glickman added that one utility company will probably benefit from the inclusion of transmission line planning in the 2008 amendment: Juno Beach-based Florida Power & Light Co., which has 4.4 million customers in the state. Scott and his Cabinet in May approved FPL plans to erect 88 miles of transmission lines for two new reactors in Miami-Dade, despite vocal protests from residents and local officials. The planned lines would include poles that could reach up to 15 stories high and be about 5 feet wide, according to CBS Miami. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said, ""Crist made it easier for Duke to take your money."" The accusation is about a 2008 amendment to a law that allowed electric providers to charge an advance fee to customers to build or upgrade facilities. The change Crist signed added the planning of transmission lines to the list of approved uses to the fee. There are two big problems with the attack: Jeb Bush signed the original 2006 law, not Crist; and it doesn’t appear Duke Energy ever collected advance fee money to plan transmission lines from its two nuclear projects. Crystal River was an existing plant that didn’t need more, and the Levy County project never made it far enough to consider power lines. If anything, Scott is the one who has allowed a utility company to potentially profit off the change Crist allowed.

GOP challenger Gary Lambert says rival Marilinda Garcia supports $140 billion in new taxes
","With New Hampshire voters gearing up for a primary election, Republican candidate for Congress Gary Lambert tried to cast himself as the true fiscal conservative in the race when he distributed a campaign mailer this August. The former state senator from Nashua pledged sound leadership for New Hampshire’s economy if he’s elected to represent the 2nd Congressional District. Lambert also criticized his major opponent in the GOP primary, state Rep. Marilinda Garcia, asserting that Garcia supports ""$150 billion in new taxes."" Lambert said the move would result in massive job losses, and his campaign flyer pictured Garcia’s face on the side of a building, underneath a sign that reads ""Going out of business."" With both candidates courting the Republican base, any move to increase taxes could be a turn-off for voters. But is Garcia really pushing for a tax hike, and one that could be measured in billions of dollars? Her campaign quickly denied the charge, and Lambert’s flyer didn’t provide much information to back it up. To get to the bottom of it, PolitiFact New Hampshire asked Lambert’s campaign for an explanation of where the $150 billion figure came from. Campaign manager Josh Davidson pointed us to an April 2014 event at which Garcia said she supports closing some types of tax loopholes. Her remarks were filmed and posted to YouTube by the conservative blog Granite Grok. Garcia said that small businesses are at a disadvantage because, unlike large corporations, they can’t hire lawyers and accountants who are able to ""find those loopholes that could reduce your tax rate from 35 (percent) to 20 (percent) like the big companies do."" ""So that’s a big problem,"" she continued. ""We need to close those types of loopholes."" Lambert argues that by calling for Congress to close ""those types of loopholes,"" Garcia was calling for the elimination of the entire system of tax credits, exemptions and other mechanisms that allow companies to lower their taxes. Those mechanisms are collectively known as ""tax expenditures,"" a term the federal government uses to describe revenue lost because of tax deferrals, preferential tax rates, exclusions, exemptions or deductions. Combined, the federal government will provide corporate tax expenditures worth an estimated $148 billion in fiscal 2014, according to numbers crunched by the White House Office of Management and Budget. That’s close to the $150 billion figure cited by Lambert’s campaign. However, there are several caveats to consider. To begin with, it’s hard to know exactly how much new revenue the country would receive if any tax expenditures were eliminated. It wouldn’t necessarily be $148 billion. As the White House’s Office of Management and Budget notes, eliminating one type of tax break may alter economic behavior, or provide an incentive for companies to chase another type of tax break. Also, the system of tax breaks is interdependent -- eliminating one could lower the amount of taxable revenue in another, or move a company into an entirely different tax bracket. There’s also the question of whether the reforms would apply solely to corporations, or if tax breaks for both corporations and individuals would be eliminated. Many are available to both types of taxpayers. In fact, a study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office determined that more than two-thirds of the tax expenditures used by corporations in 2011 were also used by individual taxpayers. That means tax breaks used exclusively by businesses -- the segment Garcia was referencing in her comments -- account for only a portion of the $148 billion worth of corporate tax expenditures. It’s also worth noting that eliminating a loophole isn’t the same thing as instituting a new tax, as Lambert suggests. Any new revenue would simply come from existing taxes. Garcia also disputes the notion that she would support any net increase in taxes. Her communications director, Kenny Cunningham, wrote that Garcia hopes to lower the overall corporate tax rate by eliminating special interest-backed tax loopholes. ""Marilinda has pledged multiple times not to support any new increases in the tax burden and has a long voting record in the NH Legislature to prove her commitment to action on this issue, not just words,"" Cunningham wrote. Our ruling Lambert claimed that Garcia supports $150 billion in new taxes. His statement was based on a remark Garcia made about closing tax loopholes that help big corporations. The Office of Management and Budget estimates in fiscal year 2014, companies will receive about $148 billion in tax expenditures. That’s close to the figure Lambert offered, but overall, the statement is inaccurate for several reasons. Even if one accepts the premise that Garcia wants to end all tax breaks for corporations, the expenditures she’s referring to would probably be valued at less than $150 billion, unless Garcia also supported ending tax breaks that are available to both companies and individuals. According to her campaign manager, Garcia would not support any increase in the tax burden. Instead, she seeks to eliminate loopholes that benefit special interests while working to lower the overall corporate tax rate. Not only is Lambert’s campaign mailer inaccurate, but it offers such an astronomically high figure that the claim is far-fetched. For these reasons, Lambert’s claim earns a rating of Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/aug/15/gary-lambert/gop-challenger-gary-lambert-says-rival-marilinda-g/

Rick Perry incorrect Congress on five-week vacation; it's a legally mandated and working recess
","Gov. Rick Perry roused a national conservative confab in Fort Worth this month by touting his decision to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border and ladling in a jab at Congress. According to a news story placed online by the Dallas Morning News Aug. 8, 2014, the Republican governor that day reminded the Red State Gathering he’s proud of how Texas has fared on his watch. The story said he got a standing ovation after saying: ""If Washington won’t act to secure the border with Mexico, then as governor of Texas, I will."" In bringing up his executive action, the story said, Perry ""took the opportunity to contrast it to a federal government — including senators — that he said literally has vacated its responsibilities. ‘Congress shouldn’t be on a five-week vacation,’ Perry said. ‘I can assure you that drug cartels and gangs are not on vacation.’"" Is Congress on a 35-day vacation? Perry's office didn't immediately engage on this claim. A 1970 law mandates annual recess What we know, though, is Congress started a five-week summer recess late on Aug. 1, 2014, according to a Time magazine news story.   The annual August break is required by law, according to an Aug. 6, 2014, Wall Street Journal blog post by Linda Killian, a senior scholar at the Wilson Center, a think tank. Killian said the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 directs the House and Senate to recess for the month of August, until after Labor Day. The act says that unless Congress provides otherwise, the House and Senate shall adjourn no later than July 31 of each year or so and, it looks to us, remain adjourned to the second day after Labor Day, though it also says the mandate shall not be applicable in any year there’s a state of war on July 31 as declared by Congress. A post on the U.S. Senate website references the 1970 law and says: ""Today, the August recess continues to be a regular feature of the Senate schedule, a chance for senators to spend time with family"" and ""meet with constituents in their home states."" A web link there led us to a Senate article providing perspective. According to the article, as Congress stayed in session for more of each year into the 1960s, Sen. Gale McGee, D-Wyo., began calling for a summer recess. Each time, according to the article,  the idea split the Senate along generational lines: ""Older senators preferred the traditional system of doing business--come to Washington in January, complete business by summer, and go home. No need for weekend trips or state work periods. Senators had plenty of time to deal with home-state business and reelection campaigns. ""But younger senators, facing the realities of the modern Senate, wanted a designated six-week summer recess to allow them to plan family vacations and reconnect with their constituency,"" the article said. ""By 1969, McGee had gained enough support for a test run. The Senate recessed from Aug. 13 to Sept. 3."" On Aug. 6, 1971, as mandated by the new law, the Senate began its first mandated August recess, the article said. Is the recess a vacation? It’s one thing not to be in session, but is that the same as taking a vacation? First, there’s the Merriam-Webster dictionary defininition of vacation: a ""period of time that a person spends away from home, school, or business usually in order to relax or travel."" The Time story said that just because it’s called a recess doesn’t mean congressional leaders are taking a break. ""Business still goes on,"" the story quoted Senate Historian Don Ritchie as saying. ""There’s just no action on the floor."" Scant business goes on, we suspect, though an official House calendar listed a few hearings scheduled during the 2014 recess — an Aug. 6 hearing of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs on health care access in rural America, hosted by panel Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Fla.; an Aug. 7 hearing of the House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations about combating the Ebola threat; and an Aug. 14 hearing, also by the veterans affairs panel, on rural health care and infrastructure needs. Time’s story said: ""Especially because this is an election year, many members will be campaigning, visiting offices and town halls in their home states and holding town meetings. Offices will stay open to receive mail and calls from constituents. Members who aren’t up for reelection might enjoy family time or a vacation,"" the story said. Texans during the recess Spokespeople for Central Texas House members did not respond to our email inquiries about whether their elected boss was taking the month off, nor did we draw responses about Perry’s vacation claim from Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Neither senator vanished from view after the recess began. Cruz (like Perry) appeared at the Aug. 8 Red State Gathering, according the News’ story. Each Texan also spoke at the Saturday Aug. 9 Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, the state that’s home to first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses next year. Cornyn, stopping in Midland, talked up his immigration legislation in West Texas on Aug. 6, 2014, according to a news story published the next day by the Midland Reporter-Telegram. Another tack: By scrolling a Twitter list created by journalist Rick Dunham, we looked at what members of the Texas delegation volunteered about their activities in the first week of the 2014 recess, encompassing the period preceding Perry’s ""vacation"" statement. Not every member specified personal activities. Some excerpts: Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, said she hosted constituents at a Houston gathering Aug. 2; Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, participated in an Aug. 3 NBC-TV ""Meet the Press"" roundtable; the same day, Rep. Al Green, D-Houston, spoke at a youth recognition luncheon and Rep. John Culberson, R-Houston, addressed a pro-Israel gathering also attended by Lee and Rep. Ted Poe, R-Houston, per tweets. The same week, Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Denton, urged followers not to forget his Aug. 4 town hall in Little Elm and Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Lubbock, announced six district town halls through Aug. 14. On Aug. 4, Cornyn was named Mr. South Texas in Laredo; Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-El Paso, invited constituents to his Aug. 6 town hall and Rep. Mark Veasey, D-Dallas, promoted a town hall scheduled Aug. 20. On Aug. 7, the day before Perry spoke of Congress on vacation, Neugebauer tweeted about visiting the editorial board of the Abilene Reporter-News and Burgess did the same about the board for the Denton Record-Chronicle. That day, O’Rourke said he’d joined Miller, the Florida member, at a medical center in Beaumont, Texas. The same day, Castro posted a photo of his visit with residents to thank them for signing up people for insurance in accord with the Obamacare law; Rep. Bill Flores noted that he’d appeared on a local TV news show; and Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, shared a photo showing he fielded a community health advocate award. Analyses by Ornstein, Perry Next, we asked the American Enterprise Institute’s Norman Ornstein, a longtime congressional observer, for his analysis. Ornstein replied by email that during the recess, most senators and House members ""use this time to travel to trouble spots or to go back and campaign or do meetings in their home districts or states. They are not laying back in the sun, but working. I would prefer more time in Washington legislating, and less time back in the district. But calling this a five-week vacation is a distortion."" We circled back to Perry’s office where gubernatorial spokesman Travis Considine noted by email that while the annual recess may be stipulated by law, nothing in law keeps Congress from coming back early if the House and Senate agree to do so. Citing an Aug. 5, 2014, news story in The Hill, a Capitol newspaper, Considine also pointed out the Senate managed to recess by July 31 only 11 times in the past 40 years. Our ruling Perry said Congress is taking a five-week vacation. Actually, Congress is a couple weeks into its annual August recess, in keeping with the 1970 law, though Perry has a point in that members aren’t debating matters on the floor of the House or Senate. Our sense is that even if members take some dog days off, the recess isn’t a no-work vacation. Members continue to attend to their districts by holding town halls and other meetings; many also campaign. We rate Perry’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

NextGen ad says Rick Scott takes money from a company that pollutes
","California billionaire Tom Steyer’s NextGen Climate group unleashed an ad that accuses Gov. Rick Scott of being cozy with a polluter. ""A dangerous new type of oil drilling near the Everglades threatened drinking water for 7 million Floridians,"" states part of the ad. ""But one Floridian is benefitting. Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution."" The text on the screen states: ""Rick Scott $200,000 from oil interests."" Scott’s side refuted the ad and the Republican Party of Florida counter-punched with its own TV ad: ""Crist’s team says Gov. Scott took contributions from this polluter. It’s total fiction. Scott didn’t take a nickel. Scott held the polluter accountable. Shut down their wells...."" Did Scott, who is facing re-election, take campaign cash from a ""company that profited off pollution"" and receive $200,000 from oil interests? We decided to drill down to sort out the facts. Controversial drilling project led state to sue When we dug into the ad, we found a very complicated backstory. The ad’s makers told us the contributions refer to Collier Resources Co., but the story really begins with a separate company: Dan A. Hughes Co. In June 2012, Collier leased about 120,000 acres of mineral rights to Hughes. A few months later Hughes received a state permit to construct its first exploratory well. The public outcry began when Hughes sought additional permits the next year. Residents received a letter in April 2013 from a Hughes subcontractor asking for information needed to draw up an evacuation plan in case of an explosion. Despite residents’ protests, in September 2013, DEP granted Hughes a permit to inject acid deep underground to fracture the limestone. The process is similar to hydraulic fracking, which has been the subject of heated debate across the country, although the industry term for it is ""acid stimulation."" Hughes also wanted to try something never before allowed in Florida. After injecting the acid, Hughes workers injected a mix of sand and chemical gel under pressure to prop open the new fractures and let the oil flow out. That's known as using a ""proppant,"" and it was not covered by the DEP permit, the Tampa Bay Times reported. In December 2013, Hughes told DEP that it intended to start that operation in a few days. The DEP sought a short delay to review the plan, but then Hughes did it anyway. That led DEP to fine Hughes $25,000 in April and order Hughes to hire an expert to monitor groundwater for contamination. After months of wrangling, the state said Hughes failed to meet the terms of the consent order, yanked the company’s permits and filed a lawsuit. Collier and Hughes agreed to terminate the lease, and Hughes announced that it was pulling out of Florida. DEP conducted groundwater sampling and found no contamination, but environmentalists say more extensive testing is needed. ""Hughes is not a ‘polluter’ nor has it turned a profit on the well, which the company unilaterally shut-in due to the controversy,"" Hughes spokesman David Blackmon said. There was, however, an entity that ""profited"" -- though we can’t say they ""profited from pollution"": the Collier Resources Co. that leased the land to Hughes. Blackmon told PolitiFact Florida that Hughes will not be reimbursed for the terminated lease.  Campaign contributions The ad doesn’t identify the campaign donors or company when it states that ""Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution."" For those following the controversy, it would be easy to wrongly assume the ad referred to donations from Hughes. But Hughes ""has not contributed to the Crist or Scott campaigns and does not intend to,"" Blackmon said. Instead, NextGen is referring to four members of the Collier family -- Barron, Miles, Parker and Thomas -- who each gave $50,000 to Scott’s Let’s Get to Work Committee in January 2013. PolitiFact Florida verified those donations on the state elections website. We asked a Collier representative why the individuals donated to Scott, but the answer didn’t shed much light. ""Certain individual owners have personally supported the Governor in the past, but those decisions are made individually and without any input from Collier Resources Company,"" said Priscylla M. Oliva, executive assistant to Barron Collier Companies, in an email to PolitiFact Florida. The Collier family has donated to multiple state and federal candidates and causes -- mostly Republicans and conservative groups. In terms of state donations, the donation to Scott stands out. We found one state donation that was larger than the ones to Scott’s committee: Parker Collier gave $525,000 to the Republican Party of Florida in 2010. In 2010, Parker and Miles Collier were ranked seventh in the country among top individuals funding outside spending groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Our ruling NextGen’s ad states that ""Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution"" and received $200,000 from oil interests. Scott’s campaign received $50,000 from four different members of the Collier family. The Collier Resources Co. leased mineral rights on its land to Hughes for drilling, so it’s fair to refer to those donations as being from ""oil interests.""  However, there are two key elements of the claim that are misleading. The ad doesn’t name the company or campaign donor, so it’s possible for viewers who are knowledgeable about the controversy to mistakenly assume that the donations were by Hughes.  The other problematic part is that there isn’t proof that pollution occurred. The state’s preliminary tests indicated there was no contamination. Though environmentalists say additional testing is needed, we rate claims based on information available at the time.

Charlie Crist used jet owned by 'serial polluter,' RPOF says
","Gov. Rick Scott’s campaign has focused on painting the Republican incumbent as a friend of the environment, which means attempting to show Democratic challenger Charlie Crist isn’t. A Republican Party of Florida commercial released Aug. 7, 2014, lambasts Crist for taking a supporter’s personal aircraft to a press event. ""On his way to an event about -- get this -- green issues, Crist cruised in on a private jet,"" the narrator says. ""That’s rich. What’s richer? The jet belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water."" That certainly sounded like fodder for headlines, but was it true? PolitiFact Florida attempted to pull the permits on this one and find out what happened. Campaign development The state GOP told PolitiFact the commercial stemmed from a plane ride Crist took from Gainesville to Tallahassee on July 25. While Scott uses his personal jet to attend events and has been criticized for a lack of transparency surrounding its use, Crist has often used private planes to help him get to events around the state. This time the Scott campaign took a photo of the 2005 Cessna 560XL’s tail number and traced its ownership. The owner turned out to be James Finch, a Lynn Haven contractor who owns Phoenix Construction Services Inc., a company previously fined for environmental infractions. That was especially problematic for the flight in question, since Crist was attending a climate change lecture by Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton. Finch, a former NASCAR team owner, has a long history of political donations, giving tens of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party of Florida and John McCain’s presidential campaign. He also has a history of facing fines from the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. While neither agency responded to PolitiFact Florida’s requests for documentation of Finch’s penalties, we were able to do a little digging on our own. On two occasions, in 1984 and 1996, he was cited for backfilling the bayou at his home. No action was taken on the first instance, but he was forced to pay a penalty and do restoration work on the second. A 1998 complaint about destruction of seagrass and another notice about a potential sewage spill at a Millville wastewater treatment plant were withdrawn for lack of evidence. His company Phoenix Construction Services was fined $23,000 by the EPA after filling in wetlands at a Panama Beach park against the terms of the project’s U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit in 1999. Fill dirt is considered by law to be a pollutant in ""navigable wetlands."" The Army Corps of Engineers issued a noncompliance notice after the company installed a portion of a sewage pipeline across St. Andrew Bay above ground against permitting guidelines. Finch’s company was cleared when the work was corrected per DEP guidelines by 2005. The truly epic saga, however, was Phoenix’s botched work at the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, which opened north of Panama City in 2010. Crist in 2007 called the airport ""a national model for economic transformation and environmental preservation."" Environmental groups had complained in 2009 that because of poor construction methods, the site was resulting in ""pollution in Burnt Mill Creek, Crooked Creek, West Bay and the surrounding wetlands."" Later that year, Phoenix was fined $1.7 million by the DEP for environmental permit violations. The agency concluded the contractor did not follow stormwater runoff plans or erosion stabilization methods, allowing improperly filtered water to flow into nearby wetlands. As costs wildly overran, Phoenix and the airport authority first sued each other, then banded together to sue other parties working on the project before settling in 2012. Phoenix did not return PolitiFact Florida’s request for comment. Phoenix continued to do work for the local government, though. The Bay County Commission in 2013 gave Phoenix a $25 million contract to build the county a water pumping station. The Crist campaign said the former governor didn’t know about the environmental fines against Finch. They said Crist hasn't used the plane since July 27. The Scott campaign shouldn't be too quick to point fingers at Finch for pollution fines, however. Finch worked on the airport with Charles W. ""Chuck"" Roberts III, a Panhandle paving contractor whose company was accused of improperly building a parking lot in that project. The airport authority was eventually blamed for not securing the proper permit. C.W. Roberts Inc. plants in several counties have been cited for leaking or improperly storing chemicals or being in disrepair. Many of the company’s infractions did not result in penalties. What is Roberts doing now? In 2011, Gov. Scott appointed him to a seat on the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said Crist rode on a jet that ""belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water."" The plane’s owner, Bay County contractor James Finch, has been fined in the past for filling in wetlands or allowing unfiltered runoff to flow into waterways, in violation of environmental permits. That’s a legitimate definition of polluting, and there’s no doubt Finch has been fined almost $2 million over the years. It’s hypocritical of the state GOP to call out Finch when one of his subcontractors has benefited from a relationship with Gov. Scott. But that doesn’t change the facts.

Carlson: Guns don't kill people, bathtubs do
","Gun safety advocates are pushing laws to make it harder for children to play with guns kept at home. A bill in the New York Legislature, for instance, would require gun owners to secure their weapons by either keeping them locked up or installing a trigger lock. Failing to do so could warrant fines, loss of a firearms license or potentially jail. Behind the New York proposal lies the tragic story of a 12-year-old boy who was accidentally killed by his friend when he went over to the friend’s house. Fox News discussed the New York story on Fox and Friends Weekend on Aug. 9, 2014. Tucker Carlson, show co-host and editor of the Daily Caller, a conservative news website, challenged the basic premise behind the bill. While the death of a child is ""the worst tragedy imaginable,"" Carlson said there’s a deeper truth. ""Far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns,"" Carlson said. ""I’d like to see a package on ‘Do you have a bathtub at home because I want to know before I let my child go over to your house.’ A little perspective might be helpful."" We reached out to Carlson to learn the source of his claim about deaths in bathtubs and deaths from guns. We didn’t hear back. We went to the federal government’s Center for Health Statistics to get some of that perspective that Carlson recommended. The data we found undercuts Carlson’s assertion. As the following table shows, total deaths for children 17 and under due to drowning in a bathtub were 95 in 2011, the latest year the numbers are available. Total deaths from accidental gun shots were 102. The one age range where Carlson might be able to make a case is for children 0 to 4 years old. For that group, 73 died in a bathtub and 29 were killed by guns. But in every other age group, guns are more deadly than bathtubs. Age Drowned in a bathtub Accidental gunfire 15-17 years 7 28 10-14 years 12 29 5-9 years 3 16 0-4 years 71 29 Total 93 102   Carlson didn’t say what age children he had in mind, but in the context of the story he was responding to — and his rhetorical question about something ""I want to know before I let my child go over to your house"" — this is not about children under 4 years old. Parents don't let toddlers ""go over"" to a friend’s house. For that age range, Carlson’s comparison is off by a factor of three. Bathtubs caused 22 deaths for kids 5 and older and guns caused 73 deaths. The Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a 2012 report on bathtub drownings. From 2006 to 2010, total deaths were 434 for an average of 87 per year. The bulk of those deaths, 348, involved children under 4 years old. Most of the time, 62 percent, the immediate cause was a parent or other caretaker leaving the room. Our ruling Carlson said far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns. First, there is no data for last year. The most recent data is from 2011. What that shows is that children 17 and under are more likely to die from accidental gunfire than from drowning in a bathtub, although the difference is small. However, for children 5 years old and up, government data show that guns are three times more deadly than bathtubs. Carlson was not just wrong, but with his phrase, ""far more children died,"" he was emphatically wrong.

Cynics beware: Promises appear on track
","Everyone knows those folks who want to get elected will make promises they later shrug off with the same speed as they hand off squirming toddlers during campaign season. So imagine the cynical overload when the AJC’s Truth-O-Meter read this absolute in a recent press release from Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed: ""He’s kept every promise he made as a candidate, including re-opening the city’s recreation centers, reforming the city’s pension plan, standing up a force of 2,000 police officers and not raising property taxes,"" the release claimed. Reed’s press office couldn’t provide a list of his campaign promises. But those headline-grabbing pledges have been kept: ""The mayor does give credit to the council for getting a lot of his ideas done and passed,"" said Reed spokeswoman Anne Torres. ""He realized in order to get the city in the right direction, and fulfill his promises, he really had to get Atlanta on proper financial footing."" We could nitpick since Atlanta had just 1,971 officers on the force this week, as it struggles with the same churn other local law enforcement agencies face. But PolitiFact Georgia wants to be more skeptical than cynical. So we dug into press coverage during Reed’s 2009 campaign and found smaller promises that need some explaining: City records show Atlanta spent $12.8 million for outside counsel in the fiscal year 2014, which ended in June. That’s about 9 percent less than 2009’s $14 million bill. The fire station remains closed. But a 2013 press release announced Reed’s plans to renovate the city’s oldest station. The city has spent $2.5 million so far on design work for the station, built in 1910. Torres said the fire department is preparing bids for the full renovation, expected to take a year once the city selects a contractor. Employee overtime cost the city $12 million in OT in 2014, an 88 percent increase from overtime bill in 2009, the last year before Reed took office. Torres notes, though, that 2009 was a year of furloughs and layoffs because of the city’s financial woes. Reed’s promise was based on the 2008 tab, of nearly $18 million, she said. Looking at it that way, Reed cut OT by 39 percent. The city budget shows a 13 percent increase in IT spending: $25,242,270 in 2009 and 28,544,187 for the fiscal year that began July 1. Hans Utz, the city’s deputy chief operating officer, said Atlanta had long put individual departments’ IT costs in those department budgets – not the overall information technology budget. That artificially inflated department budgets, Utz said. Starting in 2013, the city began shifting all IT costs to that department and saving by buying in bulk. The move increased the IT budget by $3.3 million but decreased other department budgets by $5.6 million – a $2.3 million net reduction, budget records show. So, would accepting those explanations mean giving Reed too much leeway to keep his promises? Not necessarily. Politicians tend to keep promises more than you might think, said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. Blame – sigh – the media for implying candidates don’t at least try, according to Thomas Patterson’s 1993 book, ""Out of Order,"" Swint said. It cites four studies of seven presidential campaigns and found once elected, presidents keep the promises they made as candidates. ""In general, politicians try to keep their promises because it’s in their best interest to do so,"" Swint said. """"From their point of view, they can’t wave a magic wand and make things happen. There is a process, and that can seem like foot-dragging to critics."" Or, we concede, to cynics. So while there is a window for promises we may not know Reed made when he ran for office, the pledges big and small appear at least in process, if not done.

Chain email says former Czech president called American people a 'confederacy of fools'
","We recently came across a chain email that seems to have been floating around the Internet since President Barack Obama’s first months in office and is still making the rounds, five years later. Without providing any context, the email quotes Vaclav Klaus, former president of the Czech Republic, as saying the American people must be a ""confederacy of fools"" to have elected Obama. ""The danger to America is not Barack Obama, but a citizenry capable of entrusting a man like him with the presidency. It will be far easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president. The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America. Blaming the prince of the fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince. The republic can survive a Barack Obama, who is, after all, merely a fool. It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools, such as those who made him their president."" Those are pretty harsh words to come from a head-of-state, particularly one with whom Obama seems to have a decent relationship. But after scouring the Internet, we found zero evidence that Klaus ever said this. Some context: Klaus was president of the Czech Republic from 2003 to 2013, when he was impeached on treason charges. The charges were later dropped, but he did not resume his post. He is now a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. Some others, including Snopes.com, have tried to debunk the attribution years ago. The quote has been floating around on blogs, email chains and comment boards since at least early 2009 and has had many attributions. We’ll go through a few. The earliest sighting we found was from April 30, 2009 -- just under five months after Obama took office -- on a personal, right-wing blog. That post said the quote came from ""Prager Zeitungon, a Czech newspaper."" This appears to be a misspelling of the weekly Prager Zeitung. However, there is no online record of this quote ever having been published in the newspaper, and as of today the search engine only pulls up 13 articles with the word ""Obama"" in them -- all written since 2012. A similar but unattributed quote (with some additions) was posted in December 2009, on another personal blog that no longer exists. We also found the quote unattributed in a 2010 self-published e-book called We the People: A Christian Nation (page 47) by Richard McKenzie. It even appeared in print, as a May 2010 letter-to-the-editor in The Salisbury Post, a newspaper in North Carolina. Funnily enough, this quote has gone global. People in several other countries have swapped out ""Obama"" and ""America"" for their own leaders and countries. Possibly the most often-occurring version after the American one is from South Africa. It replaces Obama’s name with Jacob Zuma, their president, elected in 2009. Many people posting that version have attributed it to a Czech economics professor named Ken Peters. We can’t find an economics professor by that name -- Czech or otherwise -- associated with anything other than that quote. The quote has also been adapted for politicians in other countries. It's appeared in posts and comments in New Zealand, Australia, the Northern Mariana Islands, Nigeria,  Lesotho and Zambia. Our ruling A chain email said the former president of the Czech Republic said the American people were a ""confederacy of fools"" for electing Obama.  This quote has had various attributions since it first appeared on the Internet more than five years ago. The quote’s true origins may be forever buried far down in the depths of the Internet, but we’re sure it didn’t come from Klaus.

Sessions says $4 billion a year in tax credits go mostly to Mexicans
","Attorney General Jeff Sessions is optimistic that funds for President Donald Trump’s border wall will come through. One way could be with savings from money that’s inappropriately going to immigrants, he said. Sessions talked about paying for the wall on ABC’s This Week after host George Stephanopoulos asked if Mexico would pay for the wall, as Trump has promised. ""Well, we're going to get paid for it one way or the other. I know there's $4 billion a year in excess payments, according to the Department of the Treasury's own inspector general several years ago, that are going to payments to people -- tax credits that they shouldn't get,"" Sessions said April 23. ""These are mostly Mexicans. And those kind of things add up -- $4 billion a year for 10 years is $40 billion. There are a lot of ways we can find money to help pay for this."" Sessions left us wondering if $4 billion a year in tax credits are going to people who are not supposed to get them, and if they are mostly Mexicans. There’s some truth to Sessions’ claim, but it also leaves out some critical details. Treasury Department report Anyone who earns an income in the United States is required to pay taxes, whether they live here legally or illegally. Generally, people who are authorized to work in the United States use a Social Security Number to report income and pay taxes on them. Individuals who don’t have employment authorization can file their taxes using a nine-digit Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). Experts say the majority of ITIN filers likely are individuals who are living in the country illegally, but an ITIN can also be issued to people here legally, such as foreign workers. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration issued an audit in 2011 that said $4.2 billion in refundable credits were paid to individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States. These funds were claimed in the 2010 tax processing year by a total 2.3 million ITIN filers. $4.2 billion tax credits The Treasury audit focused on refunds through the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), available to individuals who owed less in taxes than deductions for the Child Tax Credit (up to $1,000 per child). A child must be a U.S. citizen or resident in order for a parent to claim the credit. A law passed in 1996 denied another credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), to individuals who file taxes without a Social Security Number that authorizes employment. ITIN filers are also not eligible for Social Security benefits. But as we’ve reported in a similar claim, Congress has not written a provision barring ITIN filers from claiming the ACTC. The audit cited by Sessions said ""clarification to the law is needed to address whether or not refundable tax credits such as the ACTC may be paid to those who are not authorized to work in the United States."" In response to a draft of the audit, the Internal Revenue Service said: ""The law does not require the taxpayer or eligible child to have a Social Security number in order to receive the (Child Tax Credit) or the ACTC. The IRS is administering the law accordingly. Legislative changes would be required to deny many of the claims discussed in the report."" Regarding the $4.2 billion for processing year 2010, a Congressional Research Service report in 2016 noted that the figure did not necessarily represent the annual revenue losses, since about 11 percent of claimants in 2010 filed tax returns for multiple years.  The audit said the returns filed for multiple years resulted in claims of more than $1 billion, but not all claims were refunded due to statute of limitations. Point being, the report doesn't show the availability of $4 billion a year, as Sessions said. And while parents may not be working legally in the United States, in some cases their children are U.S. citizens. ""Under what Mr. Sessions is suggesting, it wouldn’t be Mexico that pays for the border wall, but rather low-income children — most of them U.S. citizens and part of the future U.S. workforce — and their families,"" said Bob Greenstein, president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ‘Mostly Mexicans’? The 2011 audit did not list nationalities of ITIN filers claiming the credit. Sessions’ office referred us to a Department of Homeland Security report on the estimates of the unauthorized population as of January 2012, around the time of the audit’s analysis. The DHS report said that of the estimated 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants, 6.7 million were from Mexico. While the majority of ITIN filers are likely illegally in the country, Greenstein told us there is no data to precisely determine how many Mexican ITIN filers are claiming the ACTC. Though a report from the IRS’ Taxpayer Advocate office found that about half of people applying for ITINs in 2014 were Mexican. That report also found that in 2015, 4.4 million ITIN filers paid more than $5.5 billion in payroll and Medicare taxes and $23.6 billion in total taxes. Our ruling Sessions said, the Treasury Department's inspector general found ""there's $4 billion a year in excess payments"" going to people that shouldn’t get them. ""These are mostly Mexicans."" An audit did find $4.2 billion in refundable credits for child care were paid to individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States. Those $4.2 billion were claimed in tax processing year 2010, but about 11 percent of claimants in 2010 filed tax returns for multiple years, meaning that amount wouldn't necessarily be available annually. Sessions says these people ""shouldn’t"" get the tax credit. That may be his opinion, but there’s nothing in the law now saying they can’t claim the credits. The audit didn’t have anything to say about the nationality of those who claimed the credits, though other evidence suggests it’s likely that about half could be Mexican. Sessions’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/27/jeff-sessions/sessions-says-4-billion-tax-credits-go-mostly-mexi/

Mostly True: Texas House can bypass 1973 state law permitting anyone to record a government meeting
","State troopers arrested a Texas woman after she persisted in shooting video of a legislative hearing in keeping with a decades-old state law. That law says: ""A person in attendance may record all or any part of an open meeting of a governmental body,"" including legislative panels. Amy Hedtke, a 2017 Waxahachie school board candidate and self-described anarchist, streamed on Facebook Live a portion of the March 22, 2017, hearing of the House State Affairs Committee in a building on the Capitol grounds. Hedtke transmitted the live video, we confirmed, despite the panel’s chairman, Rep. Byron Cook, announcing at the hearing’s outset that anyone making a recording who lacked media credentials would be asked to leave. According to a March 22, 2017, Texas Department of Public Safety statement provided by the agency at our inquiry, Hedtke, 42, was removed ""after she ignored repeated requests by the House Sergeant-at-Arms to stop recording/live video streaming during the meeting. Signs posted in the meeting room prohibit such action without proper media credentials."" Anthony Holm of Austin, who brought Hedtke's removal to our attention, noted an April 2017 news report about Hedtke by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas. Hedtke’s removal was reported earlier by the Waxahachie Daily Light. Holm asked that we look into whether officials had the authority to act against someone simply taping a hearing as the open-meetings law permits. Our initial inquiries led us to the House's legal explanation in a letter from a House leader, Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, to the TV station that essentially said House rules in keeping with a state constitutional provision let members rule their proceedings regardless of conflicting laws. And is that accurate? A House chairman's explanation Hedtke’s video plus video shot by another person show her refusing requests that she stop taping and being carried by troopers to a DPS sedan. By phone, Hedtke later told us that she was then taken to the Travis County Jail where she was charged with criminal trespass for failing to depart when asked; a court hearing, she said, is scheduled for May 2017. Hedtke’s video from the hearing shows Hedtke telling an unidentified House aide: ""State law says that open meetings, you cannot prohibit attendees from recording."" The aide replies: ""The rules of the House have precedence over that — the Constitution, as well."" Geren, chairman of the powerful House Administration Committee, said the same in his April 11, 2017, letter to the TV station, which we fielded by email after asking Jason Embry, a spokesman for House Speaker Joe Straus, why Hedtke was stopped from recording and carried out. Geren's letter  says the station’s news account mistakenly indicated the law allowing individuals to record government meetings prevails over House rules giving members control of its proceedings. Constitutional provision and House rules Article III, section 11 of the Texas Constitution, Geren wrote, ""authorizes each house of the legislature to determine the rules of its own proceedings."" In its entirety, the section says: ""Each House may determine the rules of its own proceedings, punish members for disorderly conduct, and, with the consent of two-thirds, expel a member, but not a second time for the same offense."" Geren, chairman of the House Administration Committee, further wrote that the House’s 2017 rules deem those rules to be ""the only requirements binding"" on the 150-member body. Correct: House rules adopted by members at the start of the 2017 legislative session open: ""Pursuant to and under the authority of Section 11, Article III, Texas Constitution, and notwithstanding any provision of statute, the House of Representatives adopts the following rules to govern its operations and procedures. The provisions of these rules shall be deemed the only requirements binding on the House of Representatives under Section 11, Article III, Texas Constitution, notwithstanding any other requirements expressed in statute."" We asked Geren if he wished to elaborate on his letter, which WFAA-TV subsequently excerpted in a note preceding a web version of its story; he did not. In the latest House rules themselves, meantime, we didn’t spot any provision that a House member can obviate the open-meetings law including its provision that people can record meetings. Otherwise, the rules require the House to post video of public meetings and specify that permission to make live or recorded television, radio, or Internet broadcasts in or from the House chamber when the House is in session may be granted only by the administration committee. Murky? Section 551.023 of Texas’s government code, part of the open-meetings law that came to be in 1973, says: ""A person in attendance may record all or any part of an open meeting of a governmental body by means of a recorder, video camera or other means of aural or visual reproduction."" But, the law says, a governmental body ""may adopt reasonable rules to maintain order at a meeting, including"" rules relating to the location of recording equipment and how the recording is made. The law also says those rules ""may not prevent or unreasonably impair a person from"" recording during a meeting. So, what gives? Angling to sort this out, and with help from Kelley Shannon of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, we queried Austin attorneys steeped in Texas open government laws. Each one agreed that no court has ruled on the ability of the House or Senate to invoke the constitutional provision about the bodies setting internal rules to bypass the permission spelled out in the Texas Open Meetings Act for people to record meetings. Likewise, we found no sign of any such court interpretation when we reviewed materials available at the Texas State Law Library. The lawyers diverged, though, on whether Geren’s explanation holds up. ""It gets murky,"" said David Donaldson of Austin, a retired lawyer whose past clients include the Austin American-Statesman, one of the newspapers that sponsors PolitiFact Texas. By phone, Donaldson added: ""The answer may be that we don’t know the answer yet."" Over the course of a couple days, Donaldson told us, he was swayed by conflicting arguments both for and against a person being able to record a legislative meeting. Bob Heath, who has advised lawmakers in the past, and Buck Wood, who helped write the open-meetings law, each said the constitution’s language supports what Geren told the station. To his chagrin, Wood said by phone, House members reinforced such a stance by adopting the provision leading its rules stating the body’s rules shall be deemed the ""only"" requirements binding on the House, regardless of state laws. In contrast, attorneys Bill Aleshire and Jennifer Riggs each suggested a portion of the open-meetings law signals an overarching legislative commitment to complying with the open-meetings law. Section 551.003 of the state’s Government Code states: ""In this chapter, the legislature is exercising its powers to adopt rules to prohibit secret meetings of the legislature, committees of the legislature, and other bodies associated with the legislature, except as specifically permitted in the constitution."" By email, Aleshire maintained that the section protects the open-meetings law from being preempted by lawmakers any which way. He noted also that the Constitution doesn’t say the Legislature has the power to outlaw recordings. Another hearing, another approach While checking this claim, we noticed that days after troopers carried Hedtke out, a different House chairman, Rep. Phil King, R-Weatherford, let people at a hearing, including Hedtke, take pictures and shoot video. According to House-posted video, just after the start of the March 28, 2017, meeting of the Homeland Security & Public Safety panel, King said: ""We want to talk a little bit about cameras and things like that. I’m going to be a little flexible there."" King directed anyone taking photos to do so from the back of the Capitol hearing room. ""The rule of the day,"" he said, ""is don’t disturb other people when you do it."" Hedtke told us, and King confirmed, that she later got King’s permission to move her camera closer to the front of the room; intermittent noise from the hallway was marring her recording from the back. King, asked why he laid out guidelines for people to record the meeting, told us he recognized before the hearing that people following issues before the panel wanted to record or livestream. By phone, King said he’s aware of the law that says anyone can record a government meeting. Yet, he said, his decision to let people take photos or video was based on his discretion under House rules to run the hearing as the committee’s chairman. King said it’s the duty of any chair ""to make sure the meeting is smooth, efficient and not disrupted."" How did the permission to record affect the hearing? ""It was fine,"" King told us. ""Everybody behaved themselves."" Our ruling Geren wrote that House rules authorized by the Texas Constitution supersede the state law permitting anyone to record an open government meeting. We find that a constitutional provision plus sweeping House-adopted language that arguably lets the body operate without regard to any law support the chairman's statement. But it's also worth clarifying that the rub with the 1973 law allowing anyone to record a government meeting has yet to be dissected by a court. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 12:20 p.m. May 25, 2017: On May 25, 2017, a Travis County state district judge sided with Hedtke, issuing a temporary order requiring Cook to let Hedtke take photographs and video-record hearings that Cook chairs. See the Austin American-Statesman's news story on the ruling here. This action wouldn't bear on our past rating of Geren's statement in that the judge acted after Geren made his claim.",/factchecks/2017/apr/27/charlie-geren/mostly-true-texas-house-can-supersede-state-law-pe/

Checking Jon Ossoff on $16 billion in government waste
","Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate making a strong run in a historically Republican House district, recently aired an ad in which he sought to burnish his credentials as an opponent of unnecessary government spending. Speaking directly to the camera, Ossoff, a former congressional aide, said in part, ""Both parties in Washington waste too much of your money. When I worked there I helped  expose waste and abuse by government contractors. We need stricter oversight and tougher penalties. They need to be held accountable. And there’s $16 billion in duplicate programs. That can be cut."" We wondered where that $16 billion figure came from, so we did some due diligence. When we contacted the Ossoff campaign, they sent us to a report published every year since 2011 by the Government Accountability Office, the respected, nonpartisan, investigative arm of Congress. The report, which is mandated by law, is designed to point out programs, offices and practices in government that could be eliminated or changed because they duplicate other government functions or fail to provide value for the taxpayer. Ossoff’s campaign said the $16 billion figure came from several line items in the GAO report that the candidate has reviewed and believes can be eliminated in short order and without significant harm. Here’s a list. (For readers who want the full, in-the-weeds description of these programs, you can refer to the GAO report.) • Consolidate federal data centers: Save $5.4 billion. • Use ""strategic sourcing"" at the Defense Department: Save $4 billion. • Expand joint basing at the Defense Department: Save $2.3 billion. • Improve ""demonstrative spending"" at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services: Save at least $2 billion. • Improve management of oil and gas resources on federal lands: Save $1.7 billion. • Consolidate mobile communications: Save $388 million. • Improve oversight of state spending under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services: Save at least $200 million. These seven items add up to almost exactly $16 billion. That said, it’s worth noting that only some, not all, are duplicative in the strictest sense; with some of these recommendations, the GAO is calling for improved oversight or management. Also, the $16 billion figure doesn’t include all recommendations in the GAO report -- or even all of those that stem specifically from programs or efforts that GAO deemed duplicative. We found at least two recommendations from the report that suggested savings from duplicative programs: • Prevent individuals from collecting both full disability insurance benefits and unemployment insurance benefits that cover the same period: Save $1.9 billion from 2016 to 2025. • Terminate the U.S. Family Health Plan and have other DOD health care contractors take over its duties: Save $189 million over fiscal years 2017 to 2022. Meanwhile, the report includes a wide range of other recommendations that Ossoff has not explicitly said he supports. (We excluded recommendations where GAO was unable to provide a specific dollar figure.) They include: • Conduct timely children’s disability reviews to ensure that only eligible children receive Supplemental Security Income benefits: Save $3.1 billion over five years • Obtain better data to better enforce offsets and ensure benefit fairness in Social Security. Save $2.4 billion to $7.9 billion over 10 years. • Limit the subsidy for crop insurance premiums for individual farmers: Save $2 billion annually • Permanently rescind the U.S. Enrichment Corp. Fund: Save $1.6 billion • Market the Energy Department’s excess uranium: Secure $1 billion in additional revenue. • Modify how Medicare pays certain cancer hospitals: Save $500 million annually. • Broaden the Internal Revenue Service’s authority to correct simple tax return errors in order to avoid audits: Secure $274 million in additional revenue over fiscal years 2018 to 2026. • Achieve greater cost efficiencies with checked baggage inspection: Save $234 million in 2015 to 2027. • Adjust the air passenger immigration inspection user fee to fully recover the cost of inspection activities: Save almost $175 million. So when Ossoff says ""there’s $16 billion in duplicate programs"" that can be cut, he’s actually undercounting. GAO found at least $13 billion in additional specified savings that Ossoff did not allude to in the ad, plus even more when savings of unspecified amounts are included. (The campaign told PolitiFact that there ""a lot of additional areas for cutting wasteful government spending that he thinks are worth examining as well."") A final note: $16 billion is real money, but it’s still a fairly small fraction of overall federal spending. Total federal spending is about $4 trillion for fiscal year 2017, and even if you exclude mandatory spending on such programs as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and interest on the accumulated debt, the government still spends more than $1 trillion a year on ""discretionary"" programs. Our ruling Ossoff said that in the federal government, ""there’s $16 billion in duplicate programs"" that can be cut. There are indeed $16 billion in cuts recommended by a credible study published by a nonpartisan arm of Congress, though not all are examples of duplication. The actual universe of cuts offered by GAO is even higher -- somewhere north of an additional $13 billion. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/27/jon-ossoff/checking-jon-ossoff-16-billion-government-waste/

Trump has signed more bills in 100 days than any president since Truman, Spicer says
","Counting the number of laws he’s signed, President Donald Trump has been more productive in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman, according to press secretary Sean Spicer. ""Despite the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats, he's worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman, and these bills deliver on some of his most significant promises to the American people,"" Spicer said at the White House daily press briefing April 25. This is a new assessment of Trump’s output so far from the White House; Trump previously, wrongly, said no administration had accomplished as much as he did, period. Trump has signed 28 bills so far. Spicer’s correct that this is more than every president going back about 70 years. However, this isn’t a perfect measure — primarily because not all bills are created equal. None of the bills Trump has signed into law are particularly significant. The numbers Truman signed 55 bills in his first 100 days after his 1948 election. (Truman first became president in 1945, when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in office. So we’re starting with the first 100 days of Truman’s first full term.) No president since Truman has signed as many bills in his first 100 days, according to data from GovTrack and research by political scientists John Frendreis, Raymond Tatalovich and Jon Schaff. The next highest after Trump, who has signed 28 bills, was John F. Kennedy, who signed 26. The lowest was George W. Bush, who signed seven. No president comes close to Roosevelt, who began the tradition of marking the first 100 days. He signed 76. Note on the chart: For presidents Jimmy Carter through Trump, we did our own count using GovTrack. For earlier presidents, we used data confirmed by Frendreis, a political science professor at Loyola University Chicago. For Lyndon Johnson and Truman, who both came into office to replace a president midterm, we used the first 100 days after their re-election. We left out Gerald Ford because he did not serve a full term. Of the post-Truman presidents, Trump is ""fairly typical"" in terms of the number of bills signed so far, Frendreis said. The bills Spicer says that Trump has shepherded these bills through Congress. However, the 28 bills aren’t very significant and don’t appear to have required vote whipping from the White House. For example, three bills appoint individuals to the Smithsonian Institution board, two name buildings, and one designates a location for a National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial. The most notable bills Trump has signed are a set of 13 that reverse Obama-era regulations on a range of issues including on internet privacy and gun control. While that was a goal for Republican lawmakers, it’s important to note these bills made it to Trump’s desk through a process made possible by the Congressional Review Act, which became law in 1996. The act gives Congress a narrow window to reverse regulations, so these 13 bills had to get through Congress within Trump’s first 100 days. Notably missing from the list of 28 bills that have reached his desk: A bill repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, along with several other laws Trump said he would try to usher through Congress within his first 100 days. Compare this to President Barack Obama, who signed 14 laws, but those laws included the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the $800 billion stimulus package. Or Roosevelt, who within 100 days signed 15 major bills including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed bills that legalized the manufacture and sale of beer and wine and established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority. This doesn’t necessarily reflect badly on Trump. Generally speaking, it’s rare for a president to sign major legislation in his first 100 days, Frendreis said. ""Outsider"" presidents like Trump, in particular, need time to learn how to navigate the lawmaking process in Washington, and major legislation doesn’t move through Congress quickly. The first 100 days is ""not necessarily an accurate reflection of how effective a president is going to be in leading Congress,"" he said. Our ruling Spicer said Trump has ""worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman."" In the first 100 days of his first full term, Truman signed 55 bills. The president with the highest count since then is Trump with 28. None of the bills Trump has signed so far are major pieces of legislation, so it doesn’t indicate that Trump has been particularly skilled at getting his agenda through Congress so far. We rate Spicer’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/27/sean-spicer/trump-has-signed-more-bills-100-days-any-president/

Bernie Sanders lost to Hillary Clinton. So, can he be America's most popular politician?
","Discussing the 2016 presidential race on April 19, 2017, a liberal talk radio show host in Milwaukee argued that Bernie Sanders would have ""won a landslide victory"" over Donald Trump. Then Mike Crute, who co-hosts ""The Devil’s Advocates,"" exclaimed that Sanders ""is the most popular politician in America today."" Crute, whose show used to be based in Madison, didn’t say how he knew. So, we thought we’d check out his claim. Two recent polls Sanders finished as runner-up to Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination. So the Vermont senator, an Independent, never faced Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump, of course, defeated Clinton, the former secretary of state, in the general election. The latest national survey on this question was the Harvard-Harris Poll, which is done by Harvard University’s Center for American Political Studies and Harris Insights and Analytics. Conducted online April 14 to 17, 2017 with registered voters, the poll listed the names of 16 political figures, without the titles of their governmental positions. Respondents were asked whether they had a favorable or unfavorable view of each, or had never heard of them. The 16 included prominent figures, such Sanders, Trump and Clinton, and the Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, but also lesser-known Trump appointees. Pollster.com co-founder Charles Franklin, director of polling at the Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, said it is common in non-election years for the president, vice president, congressional leaders and perhaps a prominent senator or two to be included in such polls. But including presidential staff members ""is dubious, as they are not known to a lot of voters,"" he told us. Sanders had the best showing in the Harvard-Harris survey, with 57 percent saying they had a favorable opinion of him. In fact, he was the only one of the 16 to get a majority favorable rating. Here are the ratings for the nine political figures who are not Trump appointees: Name Favorability rating Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. 57% Vice President Mike Pence 44% President Donald Trump 44% Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 42% Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. 38% House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. 34% House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 31% Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. 27% Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. 23% Sanders also had the best showing among eight elected officials in a Fox News Poll of registered voters conducted by telephone about a month earlier, from March 12 to 14, 2017. Sanders got a favorable rating from 61 percent of respondents. Pence was second among the politicians, at 47 percent, and Trump was third, at 44 percent. The others: Warren, 39 percent; Ryan, 37 percent; Pelosi, 33 percent; Schumer, 26 percent; and McConnell, 20 percent. Franklin also provided us HuffPost Pollster data on polls done since Jan. 1, 2017.  Former President Barack Obama is included in those polls. Obama’s average favorability rating was highest, at 61 percent, with Sanders coming in second at 56 percent. But like Clinton, Obama is no longer an elected official. None of the other politicians in polls tracked by HuffPost Pollster had a favorability rating higher than 46 percent. Our rating Crute said Sanders ""is the most popular politician in America today."" The polls don’t specifically ask respondents for their favorite politician -- they provide a limited list of political figures and ask respondents whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of each one. But based on that measure of popularity, Sanders finished comfortably on top among some major political figures in the latest national poll. And in an averaging of polls on favorability done in 2017, his rating was exceeded only by Obama, who perhaps could still be called a politician, though not an active one.   For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/27/mike-crute/despite-losing-nomination-hillary-clinton-bernie-s/

Trump wants to send Native Americans to India, fake news story says
","A fake news story contended that President Donald Trump conflated Native Americans with people actually from India, and wanted to deport them to the South Asian subcontinent. ""Trump wants to deport American Indians to India,"" read the headline on an April 25, 2017, post on ILoveNativeAmericans.us. The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake news from users’ feeds. ILoveNativeAmericans.us ostensibly is a site filled with stories about or of interest to Native Americans. But there’s evidence it’s a fake news outlet however, not the least of which is that the site insisted to a commenter questioning the story that ""this is real, it was on TV."" We received no response when we tried to contact the administrator via the Gmail address the site provided. The site is registered to someone in Kosovo. The story falsely quoted Trump in a bogus Fox News interview as saying, ""I’ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can’t trust these Indians."" Also included are two images of tweets, allegedly from Feb. 13. The tweets are actually fakes. As all devoted PolitiFacters know, it’s quite easy to fake a tweet from any account, and Trump is a popular target. There’s no record of Trump actually tweeting such things about Native Americans. Moreover, the story itself came from a parody site called The-Postillon.com, which first posted the article on Feb. 13. The-Postillon.com calls itself ""honest news"" on its banner, but its FAQ section notes that ""everything you can read here is satire and therefore all made-up.""

Has Donald Trump overseen a gain of 500,000 jobs so far?
","On April 25, the White House launched a web page to promote President Donald Trump’s achievements in his first 100 days. Featured prominently near the top was a graphic that touted job gains on Trump’s watch. The graphic said, ""Over 500,000 new jobs -- with a surge in female employment last month."" Is that accurate? Not exactly.  'Over 500,000 new jobs' The number of new jobs does exceed 500,000 if you include the monthly job reports from January, February, and March -- the most recent three months for which data has been released. The net gain in jobs over that period was 533,000. However, there’s a problem with Trump claiming credit for all 533,000 jobs -- namely, the January report isn’t based on job gains that occurred on his watch. ""The jobs report is a snapshot reflecting conditions in the calendar week or pay period that includes the 12th of the month,"" said Jed Kolko, chief economist with the jobs site Indeed. Since Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, ""the information in the January report preceded President Trump's first 100 days,"" Kolko said. Using just the two months on his watch -- February and March -- the U.S. economy created 317,000 jobs, not 500,000. A fair approximation, Kolko said, would be to include job growth reported in the February, March, and April reports. But the April jobs report hasn’t been released, so we don’t know the final number yet. For the sake of comparison, overall job creation under Trump actually hasn’t been turbo-charged yet. The average monthly gain for February and March -- the two months for which we currently have data for Trump -- was 158,500. By contrast, the average monthly gain for Obama’s final full year -- January 2016 to December 2016 -- was 187,000. Here’s a chart showing monthly job gains since January 2016. ""Job gains so far this year are not exceptional by the standards of job growth in the recent past,"" said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. ""My assessment is that not much has happened so far in the job market, in either a favorable or unfavorable direction, since the start of the year."" We’ll also add our usual caveat that that no president deserves full credit or full blame for economic performance on their watch, since no president is powerful enough to singlehandedly shape the economy. Other forces, from technological advances to developments overseas, can have significant effects. 'A surge in female employment last month' As for the ""surge"" in female employment, there is evidence in the statistics, but it’s not clear how significant or durable the increase is. The number of employed women rose by 475,000 between February 2017 and March 2017. That’s bigger than all but one month-over-month increase in 2016, when Obama was in office, and it followed a January-to-February increase of 319,000. There’s uncertainty, however, about what, if anything this means. For starters, most economists warn that it’s vastly preferable to draw conclusions from more than one month. One month’s statistics could be thrown off balance by random quirks; this shortcoming would dissipate if you looked at a longer run of months. In addition, the month-to-month data for men’s and women’s employment tends to bounce around -- a lot. During the final full year of Obama’s presidency, the monthly change in women’s employment ranged from a decline of 179,000 to an increase of 487,000, and the monthly change in men’s employment ranged from a decline of 94,000 to an increase of 402,000. This is part of why economists favor a different Bureau of Labor Statistics measurement for month-to-month changes in employment -- a survey of company payroll records, rather than of households. The payroll-survey data did not vary as widely under Obama in 2016 -- it ranged from a gain of 43,000 to a gain of 291,000. Indeed, the payroll data showed a gain of 98,000 jobs in March, which doesn’t align at all with the supposed 475,000-job increase for women seen in the household survey. It’s also worth noting that the March gain for women was partially offset by a loss of 5,000 jobs for men. ""We’ll have to wait a while longer before knowing whether the big March employment gains for women are significant or sustainable,"" Burtless said. ""Most informed observers agree that the month-to-month and even two-month employment changes recorded in the household survey seem awfully variable compared with the numbers in the employer survey."" Our ruling Trump said he created ""over 500,000 new jobs -- with a surge in female employment last month."" Actually, he can stake a claim for a boost of 317,000 jobs at most, not 500,000 -- and that comes with the usual caveats about how much credit presidents deserve for job growth during their tenure. Meanwhile, the data does show a two-month surge in female employment, but it’s too soon to know whether this is a lasting achievement or just statistical noise.

Does the Ninth Circuit have an overturn record 'close to 80%'?
","President Donald Trump, upset by a district judge’s decision to temporarily block one of his immigration orders, went on Twitter to criticize the court. ""First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court! First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!

Out of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the ""ban"" case and now the ""sanctuary"" case is brought in ... ...the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this ‘judge shopping!’ Messy system."" ...the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this ""judge shopping!"" Messy system. District judges within the 9th Circuit have halted two versions of executive orders signed by Trump seeking to temporarily halt the U.S. entry of refugees and nationals from several countries in the Middle East and Africa. On April 25, another judge within the 9th Circuit granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against a different Trump order, one aiming to cut federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities. Given Trump’s record in the 9th Circuit, we wondered if his tweet was accurate – does the circuit have an overturn rate close to 80 percent? There are at least two ways to calculate that record, and by one metric the answer is yes. By another, it’s far less than 1 percent. The 9th Circuit Broadly speaking, the 9th Circuit includes the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and district and bankruptcy courts in 15 federal judicial districts (among them Hawaii, and districts in Washington, California). It was a district judge in Hawaii who on March 15 blocked Trump’s revised travel ban. On Feb. 3, a district judge in Seattle granted a nationwide temporary restraining order on the first version of Trump's travel ban. Trump’s Justice Department filed a motion appealing that district court's decision – the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the motion but asked for more information. On Feb. 9, in a 3-0 decision the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Seattle judge's decision. An overturned record is a reflection of cases in which the Supreme Court ruled contrary to a lower court. The 80 percent Trump tweeted about was in reference to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals’ record, and does not exactly apply to the district courts. The Supreme Court typically only hears 100 to 150 of the estimated 7,000 cases it’s asked to review per year. At least four of the nine Supreme Court judges must agree to hear a case, which come from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts. The cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there’s a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court’s decision was wrong. We previously looked at the 9th Circuit’s record when Fox News’ Sean Hannity falsely claimed it was the most overturned in the country. Here’s what we found then, using data from SCOTUSBlog’s Supreme Court statistics archive on circuit scorecards. The Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent. The 9th Circuit’s reversal rate is higher than average, but it’s not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15. The 9th Circuit placed third. 6th Circuit - 87 percent; 11th Circuit - 85 percent; 9th Circuit - 79 percent; 3rd Circuit - 78 percent; 2nd Circuit and Federal Circuit - 68 percent; 8th Circuit - 67 percent; 5th Circuit - 66 percent; 7th Circuit - 48 percent; DC Circuit - 45 percent; 1st Circuit and 4th Circuit - 43 percent; 10th Circuit - 42 percent. The 9th Circuit overturned rate is similar to the findings of a 2010 analysis by Roy E. Hofer, a former president of the Federal Circuit Bar Association and the Chicago Bar Association. Hofer found that from 1999 to 2008, the Supreme Court reversed or vacated (ruled null or void) 80 percent of the cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit. But he pointed out that the percentage of reversed or vacated cases for each circuit would be significantly lower if calculated in a different way. ""Reversal rates for each court of appeals would be very small, in the range of a tenth of a percent, if calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of appeals terminated by that court,"" Hofer wrote in his article published by the American Bar Association. ""Conversely, if the reversal rate is calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of cases reviewed by the Supreme Court, the ratio increases dramatically."" In comparing courts’ ""performance,"" it makes more sense to compare reversal rate in terms of the ratio of cases reversed over cases reviewed by the Supreme Court, Hofer said. Over the 10-year period analyzed by Hofer, the 9th Circuit terminated 114,199 cases, in comparison, the 1st Circuit had 16,620, he found. It’s possible that the sheer size of the 9th Circuit, as well as some of its procedures, cause it to produce more ""outlier decisions,"" which are cases the Supreme Court always reverses, than other circuits — leading to a higher reversal rate, University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt previously told us. Our ruling Trump tweeted, the 9th Circuit has an overturned record ""close to 80%."" An overturned record can be calculated in at least two ways. By one measure, Trump’s tweet is correct if examining only cases reviewed by the Supreme Court. But by factoring in cases reversed over the total number of cases ruled by the circuit court, then the percentage is significantly smaller, far less than 1 percent.

Is Trump's Cabinet more white and male than any first cabinet since Reagan?
","As President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office come to a close, many people are using the marker as an opportunity to recap Trump’s efforts. While Trump himself views his first chapter as a success, other groups see it differently. The Center for American Progress, a progressive policy advocacy group, took to Twitter on April 25 to air its list of grievances with Trump’s administration. The thread comprised of approximately 100 tweets, with each tweet representing one way that the Trump administration has harmed women and families. If you've got a few minutes, will you join us as we take a look at the ways the Trump admin is harming women and families? #trump100days Most tweets criticized Trump’s policies, but some took aim at the administration itself. Like No. 57. .@splcenter @usedgov @PPFA @ndvh @CAIRNational 57. Trump's Cabinet is more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan’s https://t.co/0ridDiuOB5 ""Trump's Cabinet is more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan’s,"" reads the tweet. This made us wonder. Is that true? Long story short, this claim is accurate when you compare the percentage of nonwhite males and women combined to the percentage of white males in each cabinet. However, if you look at each factor separately, Trump's cabinet remains the most white, but not the most male.   The president’s first cabinets As evidence of this claim, the Center for American Progress’ tweet linked to a New York Times article that reached a similar conclusion about Trump’s first cabinet. The New York Times story was updated on March 10, 2017, and compares Trump’s first cabinet to the first cabinets of former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and of course Ronald Reagan. The analysis was first written when Trump’s cabinet wasn’t fully assembled, so, it assumes Trump’s remaining nominees would be confirmed. The New York Times included R. Alexander Acosta, Trump’s second nominee for labor secretary, and to the best of our knowledge Trump’s cabinet has remained unchanged since this time. It’s worth pointing out that the New York Times analysis included traditional cabinet positions as well as ""cabinet-level"" positions. Cabinet-level positions have changed over time. (Trump has 24 cabinet members, whereas George H.W. Bush only had 17). ""Some positions, such as the United Nations ambassador and the Office of Management and Budget director, are given cabinet-level rank by individual presidents but are not traditionally considered part of the cabinet,"" the article says. Furthermore, some traditional cabinet positions were created since Reagan took office. For example, the Department of Homeland Security didn’t get created until 2003 and the Department of Veterans Affairs did not exist in its current form until George H.W. Bush’s presidency. For these reasons, the total number of people in each president’s first cabinet varies. So, with those factors in mind, how white and male is Trump’s cabinet? According to the New York Times, 18 of Trump's 24 cabinet members are white males.  The only minorities and women in Trump’s cabinet are: • Elaine L. Chao, transportation secretary; • Betsy DeVos, education secretary; • Nikki R. Haley, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; • Linda McMahon, administrator of the Small Business Administration; • Ben Carson, housing and urban development secretary; and, • R. Alexander Acosta, labor secretary. That means 75 percent of Trump’s first cabinet is white males.  A smaller percentage of white males were in Obama’s, W. Bush’s and Clinton’s first cabinets based on the same analysis. The only other president who challenges Trump’s standing is George H.W. Bush, whose first cabinet was 71 percent white male. But Bush had fewer cabinet members, according to the New York Times' article. So, the percentage of nonwhite and women cabinet members combined in his cabinet is higher than Trump’s cabinet. But looking at each demographic individually — white and male — changes the picture. Trump's cabinet has a higer percentage of white males out of any first cabinet since Reagan, but he does not have the highest percentage of males.  That distinction belongs to George H.W. Bush whose cabinet was 89 percent male. Females makes up a little more than 16 percent of Trump’s cabinet, but only made up 11 percent of George H.W. Bush’s. You have to go back to Reagan to find a more white and more male cabinet. White males comprised 90 percent of his first cabinet. (It's worth noting Reagan had 17 white males to Trump's 18. Reagan's cabinet is considered less diverse, though, because he had even less people in his cabinet.) The idea that Trump’s cabinet lacks diversity has been widely reported on, especially when confirmation hearings and appointments were being made. During that time, a CNN report noted that Trump's four most influential departments are led by white males, which is a first since George H.W. Bush. Those include former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson (secretary of state), retired Marine Gen. James Mattis (secretary of defense), Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions (attorney general), and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Steve Mnuchin (secretary of the treasury). Our ruling In a tweet, American Progress said, ""Trump's Cabinet is more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan’s."" That claim is based on a credible New York Times analysis that found that Trump’s first cabinet had a smaller percentage of women and nonwhites combined than any president since Reagan. When you look at each demographic separately, however, George H.W. Bush has the most male cabinet.

Ivanka Trump wrongly says child care single largest expense for half of households
","Correction: This report originally misquoted Trump’s comments based on reporting at the event as saying, ""The single largest expense in American households is child care."" According to video of the event, Trump said, ""The single largest expense in over half of American households is child care."" We have corrected the fact-check as such and changed the the rating from False to Mostly False. At a meeting in Berlin focused on empowering women entrepreneurs, first daughter and presidential adviser Ivanka Trump said her father stood completely behind women in the workplace. ""He's been a tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive,"" Trump said. She said the thousands of women who have worked for her father know this to be true and that her father would prove it with his policies. ""The single largest expense in over half of American households is childcare, even exceeding the cost of housing,"" Trump said April 25. ""So it’s an enormous problem and it's one my father is committed to tackling"" The high cost of child care has been well documented. Child Care Aware, a trade and advocacy group, found that it cost on average over $17,000 a year for infant day care in Massachusetts. The question is, does paying for child care top all the other expenses that half of the households have to cover, such as housing and food? Government data suggests it does not. For most families, the No. 1 cost is housing. The latest data on child care comes from a 2011 survey by the U.S. Census Bureau. It found that for all families with children under 15-years-old, child care costs 7 percent of their monthly income. The fraction was highest for families making less than $1,500 a month. They represented about 10 percent of the sample and paid nearly 40% of their income for child care. (However, the margin of error was quite large.) So then we looked at what Americans spend on their other needs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that in 2015, the average married couple with children spent about 31 percent on housing, followed by about 18 percent on transportation. For single parents, housing ate up about 37 percent of their budget, and transportation, about 17 percent. Health care was the only category that took up a lower fraction than child care (which this expenditure report did not highlight). Married couples with children spent about 6.8 percent and single parents about 5.2 percent on health care. We found two bits of information that add a bit of support for Trump’s assertion. The New America Foundation, a center-left think tank in Washington, reported in 2016 that in a handful of states, including West Virginia, Mississippi, New York and Nevada, costs can rise above 30 percent of the state’s median income. But the underlying calculation used an expected cost of child care, not actual spending. A 2015 article in Forbes reported, ""For many parents the cost (of child care) is greater than housing, transportation or utilities."" However, the source behind that was a survey from the Child Care Aware organization. That group’s latest report is more restrained. It said the price tag in every state ""rivals families’ annual expenditures on housing, transportation and the cost of tuition at a four-year, public university."" It went on to say ""in 38 states, the cost of infant care exceeds 10 percent of the state’s median income for a two-parent family."" But neither statistic puts the cost of child care above all other expenses for half of all households. We reached out to the White House and as of publication, were still waiting for numbers. Our ruling Trump said that child care is the single largest expense faced by half of American families. We could find no data to support that. The number we did find suggests it isn’t the case. A government survey in 2011 found that the average family spends about 7 percent of its monthly income on child care. For the poorest households, the number rises to nearly 40 percent. Meanwhile, the government’s consumer expenditure survey found households with children spend at least 30 percent of their money on housing and at least 17 percent on transportation. The two data sets are not perfectly comparable, but they don’t suggest that child care tops the list of expenses for half of all families. Child care is a staggering burden for lower income households.

Has Treasurer John Chiang saved California taxpayers more than $5 billion?
","California Treasurer John Chiang is known as a fiscal watchdog. But has he saved state taxpayers more than $5 billion? Chiang made that claim on March 23, 2017 at a Sacramento forum for candidates in the 2018 California governor’s race. Here’s his full statement: ""Today, as your state treasurer, I am your banker. And so, in the first two years and a couple months (as treasurer), I have saved taxpayers and ratepayers over $5.2 billion."" Chiang’s office made a similar statement in a March 9, 2017 press release. It said a recent ""refunding of existing bonds at a lower interest rate"" had pushed the ""total savings to the general public, including taxpayers, from bond refunding (to) approximately $5 billion since Treasurer Chiang took office in January 2015."" That’s a lot of money, even in California where the state budget is nearly $180 billion. We wondered if Chiang’s claim at the forum was right, and whether there was more to this fiscal story? We set out on a fact check. Governor’s race Chiang is among several prominent Democrats vying to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include Antonio Villaraigosa, former Los Angeles mayor; Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state’s current lieutenant governor.

Email us at [email protected], tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook.  Our research At the forum, Chiang did not explain his claim or offer evidence that he’s saved taxpayers $5 billion. So, we asked his office. Deputy Treasurer Tim Schaefer told us that large figure represents future savings from refinanced state debt, not an existing pot of $5 billion. The total savings won’t materialize immediately, but rather will add up over decades as bonds are paid off at lower rates. Still, he said, Chiang ""has been very aggressive since he was sworn into office in January 2015 to take advantage of a very favorable interest rate environment."" The treasurer’s office also produced the chart below adding up the future savings, which it puts at $5.5 billion, based on action taken through mid April 2017.  SOURCE: California Treasurer's Office Schaefer compared the treasurer’s efforts to homeowners refinancing a mortgage. ""The fact that it’s over time doesn’t make it any less real,"" Schaefer continued. ""The $5.5 billion that’s not being spent on interest costs and debt service to investors and to big Wall Street firms is $5.5 billion that will be available over time to Californians to provide the services and facilities and programs that they’ve said they need."" Experts weigh in We spoke with several finance experts who said Chiang’s number is realistic, though his refinancing efforts aren’t unique.  ""Given the scale of California's financings and the continued low interest rate environment, it seems plausible that the state saved over $5 billion gross over many years into the future,"" Darien Shanske, a UC Davis law professor who has worked as a finance consultant to local governments, said by email. Jon Coupal, president of the fiscally-conservative Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, also said Chiang’s numbers are realistic, though he could not independently verify them. ""Through refinancing, you can save substantial amounts of money just like when you’re refinancing your home mortgage,"" Coupal said, adding that Chiang has been ""a good steward"" of California’s tax dollars. At the same time, he said Chiang’s actions are no different from what any responsible treasurer would do. ""It’s not out-of-the-box thinking,"" Coupal said. Bill Lockyer, who served as state treasurer from January 2007 through January 2015, also refinanced state debt resulting in 2.7 billion in future savings. Schaefer, the deputy treasurer, said Lockyer faced different financial conditions, including a spike in interest rates during the Great Recession that prevented additional refinancing. Our ruling California Treasurer John Chiang, a 2018 candidate for governor, recently claimed: ""I have saved taxpayers and ratepayers over $5.2 billion,"" since being sworn into office in January 2015. Chiang’s eye-popping figure represents future savings from refinanced state bonds. And while experts say his number looks right, his timeline isn’t. He’s taken action that will pile up savings over future decades, a worthy accomplishment. Over time, that will free up money for other uses. Chiang is right about the total, but wrong to imply this huge amount of taxpayer money is already in the bank. We rate Chiang’s statement Half True.

Yes, we are experiencing a net outflow of illegal, undocumented workers from America back to Mexico
","Candidate Donald Trump pledged to build a wall on the Mexican border, and he has taken steps to make that a reality as president. The push implies droves of outsiders are clamoring to make their way to America, but one Wisconsin congressman says a basic assumption behind that effort is wrong. ""We're experiencing a net outflow of illegal, undocumented workers from America back to Mexico,"" U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-La Crosse, said Feb. 16, 2017 on Wisconsin Public Radio. ""To build a wall now would be locking them in this country."" Are there really more illegal Mexican immigrants going than coming? Research backs up claim There are no perfect statistics when it comes to illegal immigration — it’s inherently impossible to track accurately. But U.S. and Mexican government data analyzed by the Pew Research Center shows the immigration trend reversed in the last decade. The estimated number of Mexicans in the United States illegally rose steadily for many years, from 2.9 million in 1995 to a peak of 6.9 million in 2007. But the number began dropping in 2008 and has fallen more since, reaching 5.8 million in 2014, the latest year for which Pew analyzed data. If the number is falling, that means more illegal Mexican immigrants are leaving the United States than entering it. The numbers include both immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally and those who overstayed their visas. According to Pew, key factors in the decline are the Great Recession, which meant U.S. job losses in construction and other sectors where Mexican immigrants are likely to work; a rising number of deportations; and increasing numbers of U.S. Border Patrol agents. Immigration experts from a variety of think tanks said Pew’s research on illegal immigration is well respected and saw no reason to doubt its methodology. The change in migration patterns is also reflected in the number of apprehensions on the Mexican border by the U.S. Border Patrol. About 191,000 Mexicans were apprehended along the southern border in the 2016 fiscal year. At the peak of Mexican immigration in 2007, the Border Patrol apprehended 809,000 Mexicans. Overall, illegal immigration was largely static from 2009 to 2014, as the drop in Mexican immigration was mostly offset by an increase from other areas, such as Central America and Asia. (In 2014 the two regions combined for an estimated 3.2 million illegal immigrants, just over half the total from Mexico.) The overall number of illegal immigrants in the United States — from all countries of origin — held steady from 2009 to 2014 at around 11 million, Pew estimates. In 2014, the Border Patrol apprehended more non-Mexicans than Mexicans for the first time in at least 60 years, Pew reported. Mexicans still accounted for about 52% of illegal immigration in 2014, though.

Did terrorism not exist before NATO was created, as Donald Trump said?
","President Donald Trump has needled NATO, the 68-year-old military alliance, as an anachronistic vestige of the Cold War with a low-energy approach to fighting terrorism. ""Back when they did NATO, there was no such thing as terrorism,"" Trump said in a wide-ranging interview with the Associated Press which published an interview transcript April 24. We previously rated False Trump’s suggestion that he’d caused NATO to take a sharper focus on terrorism. This claim is a bit different, but it’s still problematic. We found that while Trump’s claim isn’t literally true, it implies important questions about how NATO has adapted to new threats. While defining terrorism can be a bedeviling task -- as we’ve previously pointed out -- the concept of terrorism certainly existed before NATO’s founding in 1949, said Theodore R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. ""Acts that we would today define as terrorism began as early as the anarchist offenses of the late 19th century and the campaign against the Russian czars of the mid to late 19th century,"" he said. And the 20th century saw several ""overwhelming examples that indicate the extent of President Trump's error,"" said Mary Ellen O’Connell, a University of Notre Dame law professor. Transnational terrorism arguably started World War I when an unlawful Serbian independence organization known as Black Hand assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, she said. ""Indeed, the problem was so bad that the League of Nations worked for many number of years on a comprehensive treaty against terrorism but did not succeed prior to World War II,"" she added. World War II saw terror tactics used widely, O’Connell said, prompting the explicit prohibition on the use of terror as a weapon under the the Geneva Conventions in 1949 -- the same year NATO was founded. Directly rebutting Trump’s claim is the fact of widespread terrorism in 1949 when the alliance was born, according to Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla. ""Terrorism goes back centuries, and in 1949 was raging in many places around the world,"" Janda said, ""from Algeria to Palestine, and from India and Pakistan to Malaya, to name just a few."" So Trump is wrong when his statement is taken literally. But Bromund said Trump’s broader point that NATO is an aging alliance has merit. ""NATO was not founded to combat terrorism, was not created in a world where it was even a minor concern, and was not structured to oppose it in any way at all,"" he said. ""Even when terrorism did become a concern in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, NATO remained dedicated to deterring, and preparing to fight if deterrence failed, state-on-state war."" Given NATO’s original mission of deterring a Soviet invasion of Western Europe, it’s ironic that the terrorist attacks of 9/11 -- and not a traditional interstate conflict -- is the only event in history to trigger the alliance’s collective security obligation, said military historian Janda. ""9/11 is the only time the alliance has invoked Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which calls on member states to defend other alliance countries after an attack on any one of them,"" Janda said. ""Ironically, it saw the alliance come to help the United States, rather than seeing the Americans sally forth to fight for Europe, as was generally assumed would be the case in the event of war."" Also worth noting is the nature, targets and instruments of terrorism have evolved dramatically since NATO’s birth in 1949, said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. Ratner described non-state terrorism as having evolved in two distinct waves since NATO’s founding, with the first beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s with the rise of violent radical-left movements like the Red Army Faction and pro-Palestinian groups like Black September. The second wave began with the post-9/11 groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS. Recent developments under these latter groups include suicide bombings, the expanded use of transportation targeting, and the internet as a means of communication and recruiting, Ratner said. ""Both of those waves were different from anything done before because of their brazen willingness to attack civilian targets and the sophistication of their operations,"" Ratner said. Our ruling Trump said, ""Back when they did NATO, there was no such thing as terrorism."" In the most literal sense, Trump is wrong -- terrorism had existed in one form or another long before the creation of NATO. But it's worth noting that the tactics and the potential reach and scale of terrorism has expanded in the years since NATO was founded, and the alliance has had to shift its focus somewhat in recent years toward terrorism rather than state-on-state conflict.

Is illegal immigration the lowest in 17 years, as Trump said?
","President Donald Trump hasn’t been decisive on whether he’d sign a spending bill that did not include funding for his promised border wall. But he raised a related topic in an interview with the Associated Press: declining illegal immigration. ""People want the border wall … They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they're 73 percent down. ... That's a tremendous achievement. ... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it's going lower,"" Trump said in the April 21 interview, which we fact-checked. Trump’s wording did not specify what was the lowest in 17 years, but similar comments made by others in his administration indicate he was referring to apprehensions at the southwest border by border patrol agents. Historical data from Border Patrol show that Trump’s claim is accurate. Southwest border apprehensions Trump has used different timeframes to make a case that fewer people are attempting to cross into the United States illegally. He’s looked at year-over-year March border apprehension data to say there’s been a 64 percent decline; compared February 2017 numbers to the election month, November 2016 to say it’s gone down 61 percent; and said there was a 40 percent decline from January, the month he was inaugurated, to February. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data show that in March 2017 agents made 12,193 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. It is the lowest number in at least 17 years, according to monthly southwest border apprehension numbers since fiscal year 2000. Apprehension data is generally used as a metric to measure illegal immigration. Experts have told us that Trump’s rhetoric has played a role in deterring illegal immigration, perhaps more so than his newly issued policies, which may take longer to implement on the ground. ""The recent dip in apprehensions likely does signify a trend, in particular as apprehensions typically rise in March and early spring,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that researches migration. It’s still to be determined if it’s a temporary lull or a lasting decline, ""but at this point it seems clear that would-be migrants are concerned about rising enforcement not just at the border but within the United States,"" Mittelstadt said. Apprehensions at the southwest border peaked in 2000 at 1.6 million (yearly total) but began a declining trend during the 2008-09 recession that has continued since, Mittelstadt said. Aside from policies and enforcement in the United States, factors in Mexico have contributed to lower apprehension numbers, Mittelstadt said, among them: lower birth rates, increased educational levels and an improved economy. Trump isn’t the only one who has said the numbers are declining; Democrats have cited the same point. During the Democratic National Convention we rated Mostly True a claim by U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. that fewer people were crossing the southwest border than in the last three decades. More recently, Democratic congressman John Conyers Jr., of Michigan, also said apprehension rates had plummeted and that numbers for Mexicans caught by Border Patrol had reached their lowest point in nearly half a century. That also rated Mostly True. Mittelstadt, from Migration Policy Institute, noted that as the number of Mexicans apprehended has gone down recently, about one-third of apprehensions last year were Central American unaccompanied minors and families seeking refuge in the United States – presenting themselves to immigration authorities instead of evading detection. Apprehensions of Central Americans outnumbered those of Mexicans in 2014 and 2016. ""Amid overall declining unauthorized inflows, the Obama administration prioritized putting more people in formal removal proceedings rather than permitting voluntary return, which increases the range of punishments for those seeking to re-enter illegally,"" Mittelstadt said. ""And during the Obama administration, as occurred with prior administrations, sizable new border enforcement resources were provided by Congress."" Our ruling Trump said illegal immigration on the U.S.-Mexico border is ""the lowest in 17 years."" Border Patrol data support Trump’s claim. In March, Border Patrol recorded 12,193 apprehensions at the southwest border, the lowest in at least 17 years. It’s worth noting that apprehension rates have been declining since the recession, and significantly so since their peak of 1.6 million in 2000. Overall, we rate Trump’s claim True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/25/donald-trump/illegal-immigration-lowest-17-years-trump-said/

Are there three times as many solar energy jobs as coal jobs?
","As a candidate and as president, Donald Trump has championed the cause of coal mining. But critics of the coal industry have countered that Trump and other supporters of coal are overlooking an energy sector with an even bigger impact on jobs -- solar energy. In a Chicago Tribune op-ed published on April 20 -- two days before Earth Day -- Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill., took issue with Trump’s environmental priorities. At one point in the op-ed, he wrote, ""More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry."" We had previously looked at whether there are more people employed in the U.S. solar-energy industry than in the oil industry. (There aren’t.) But the comparison with the coal industry was new to us, so we decided to take a look. The sources of Schneider’s statistics When we contacted Schneider’s office, they cited two sources, one for each number in the statement. The first number -- 260,000 U.S. solar workers -- stems from the 2016 edition of the National Solar Jobs Census, which is published by the Solar Foundation, a nonprofit organization aligned with the solar industry. We confirmed that, according to the foundation’s calculations, there were 260,077 solar workers in the United States in 2016. The second number -- unstated in the op-ed, but equaling 87,000 workers employed in coal mining, if you do the math -- actually overstates the number of mine workers. According to the Energy Information Administration, a part of the federal Energy Department, the number of people working at coal mines was 65,971 in 2016. The actual ratio between the two numbers would be almost four-to-one. So the congressman has some support for his statement. However, the comparison is not exactly apples-to-apples. Let’s explore why. Comparing data for energy jobs is tricky One problem for Schneider’s numerical comparison is that it uses different databases, with different methodologies. The Solar Foundation told us that their data comes from more than 500,000 telephone calls and more than 60,000 emails to known and potential energy establishments across the United States, resulting in a total of 3,888 full responses. The group counted jobs held by a worker who spends at least 50 percent of his or her time on solar-related work. They included jobs in installation, manufacturing, sales, distribution, and project development, among other categories. The Energy Information Administration data, meanwhile, comes from official U.S. Labor Department data. It includes employees ""engaged in production, preparation, processing, development, maintenance, repair shop, or yard work at mining operations, including office workers."" The coal industry considers the official coal employment numbers to be low ""to the point of being fiction,"" said Terry Headley, a spokesman for the American Coal Council. ""They don't include many people who work at a coal mine every day, full time, but are not company employees,"" Headley said. ""They are employees of service companies that provide direct support services, such as coal truck drivers, electricians, surveyors, machinists, mechanics, construction workers and others. Taken together, despite everything that has been thrown at it, West Virginia alone has some 50,000 ‘coal miners and contractors’ according to the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training. If you go by the federal government data, West Virginia has only about 13,000 coal miners working."" A better source While there will always be difficulties in making an exact comparison between the two energy sectors, there is a database well-suited for directly comparing solar and coal jobs. The United States Energy and Employment Report was designed by the Energy Information Association to put a variety of energy sectors on an equal statistical footing. This report found 373,087 solar jobs in 2016, compared to 160,119 coal jobs. (That’s a higher number for solar jobs than in the Solar Foundation report; it’s because the Energy Information Administration included jobs even if a relatively small proportion of the worker’s work week was spent on activities related to solar energy.) Here’s the full summary:  This data produces a ratio of 2.3 solar jobs for every coal job. So by this measurement, there are more solar jobs than coal jobs, but it’s short of three times as high, as Schneider wrote. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and an expert in labor-force data, said she agreed that the U.S. Energy and Employment Report data is the best source to use. She added that other data from Indeed, where she is a senior economic fellow, bolsters the idea that the labor market is healthier for solar than for coal. ""We saw almost eight times more solar job postings than coal job postings in the United States in the first quarter of 2017,"" Sinclair said.  ""Of course, these numbers don't represent current employment and are reflective of both growth and turnover in the different sectors. Still, it gives a sense of scale of these industries. This comparison leads me to think that Rep. Schneider's estimates may be on the conservative side looking forward."" Our ruling Schneider said, ""More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry."" Based on an apples-to-apples comparison using the best available data, the ratio is just short of three-to-one. Still, the data we found confirms that the number of solar-related jobs does outpace the number of coal-related jobs today. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/25/brad-schneider/are-there-three-times-many-solar-energy-jobs-coal-/

Viral 4/20 image blazes through a misleading claim about the drug war and police deaths
","On Thursday – which was the unofficial stoner holiday of 4/20 – supporters of legal marijuana and opponents of the U.S. ""war on drugs"" took to the internet to make the case for their causes. One widely shared image made an unexpected implication – that decriminalizing drugs could be a pro-police move. It features images of police destroying liquor bottles and marijuana plants, with this text: ""Did you know? More American police officers died during prohibition of alcohol than any other time in history. 300 died in 1930 alone. After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs."" A quick Google search showed us the image has been popping up on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and other websites – and that it has been making the rounds since at least 2015. The message is clear: When the government bans popular substances, like liquor or marijuana, black market trade makes life more dangerous for those enforcing the ban. We wondered, however, if the data actually supported that message. The war on drugs Marijuana and other drugs had been illegal in the United States for years before the federal government – under President Richard Nixon, as the image correctly states – launched what we now call the ""war on drugs."" In June 1971 Nixon declared ""a full-scale attack on the problem of drug abuse in America."" He called for harsher drug laws and millions of dollars in extra spending, and Congress complied. Today, spending on the drug war has continued to grow, and the United States has either the largest or second-largest prison population in the world. Yet marijuana remains popular. A CBS poll released Thursday found 61 percent of Americans favor legalizing pot and 33 percent are opposed. It also found 88 percent of Americans support medical marijuana. A 2015 National Institute on Drug Abuse survey reported that 22.2 million people – 7 percent of the U.S. population – had used pot within the last month. That’s about twice the rate at which people are abusing the second-most popular drug, illicit prescription painkillers (see fact-checks on opioids here, here and here). A deadly job? Comparing Prohibition with the drug war is common in American culture. Just listen to the popular 1988 country song ""Copperhead Road"" by Steve Earle, about a man from an Appalachian moonshining clan who switches the family business to weed. But is it also fair to compare police deaths during the two periods? That’s a little iffy. It’s correct that 1930 was the deadliest year in U.S. history for police. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which tracks officer deaths going back to 1791, says 307 officers died in 1930. It’s also correct that police deaths decreased sharply after Prohibition. But the numbers behind the claim that ""police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs"" are a bit off. Nixon began the war on drugs in 1971, but police deaths actually topped 200 the year before that in 1970. And that wasn’t any sort of a spike – the number of deaths had been just below 200 all throughout the late 1960s. And that’s not the only thing wrong with this claim. Not all deaths are violent The image clearly uses the violence associated with organized crime to make its point. However, not every officer who dies in any given year is killed by someone else in the line of duty. Many officers die from car crashes, illnesses and other causes. Yet the data this viral post cites on police deaths includes all deaths of police officers each year – violent and non-violent, on-duty and off-duty. In 2007, according to the memorial group, 202 officers died. According to FBI data, 57 of those officers were killed by a criminal while on duty. That means nearly three-fourths of the deaths that year were not the kind of violent deaths this image is alluding to. And even while on duty that year, an officer was more likely to have been killed in an accident than by a criminal. Fewer police deaths We focused on 2007 for a reason. In the last 36 years, only 2007 and 2001 (due to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks) have had more than 200 officer deaths. Yet the typical person who sees this image might very well believe that 200 or more police officers are continuing to die each year during the war on drugs. In reality that’s only happened 12 times, and only twice since 1981. Nicholas Kristof wrote in 2015 that toddlers are killed by guns more often than on-duty police officers are, which PunditFact rated Mostly True. And whatever the cause of officers' deaths in a given period, the war on drugs still doesn’t compare to Prohibition, when for 14 years an average of 252 officers died every year. Since Prohibition ended more than 80 years ago, however, there have been more than 250 officer deaths only twice – in 1973 and 1974. In fact, during most years from the 1990s until today, the number of officer deaths has been roughly the same as 100 years ago, when there were far fewer officers. Our ruling A viral image making the rounds on 4/20 compared the number of police officer deaths during Prohibition to the drug war: ""After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs,"" the image said. Those numbers aren’t totally accurate, and the comparison itself is misleading. For one, it counts many officers' deaths that had nothing to do with the prohibition of drugs or alcohol, like an officer who dies of cancer or in a car crash on vacation. And despite the direct comparison between the deadly years of Prohibition and the war on drugs, police deaths have largely been on the decline for decades even as the drug war continues and the number of officers has grown significantly. Since the image uses a semi-accurate statistic to make a misleading comparison, we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/apr/24/viral-image/viral-4-20-image-makes-misleading-claim-about-drug/
