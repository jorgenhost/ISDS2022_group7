Dennis Kucinich says the tax code effectively subsidizes fast food and junk food marketing that targets children
","
Dennis Kucinich became a lame-duck member of Congress after the 10th District he has represented since 1997 was redrawn out of existence and he lost a primary contest to another sitting Democrat, Marcy Kaptur, in the new Ohio 9th District.

But Kucinich has not stopped working on the issues that have engaged him.

He issued a news release and video on Nov. 2 supporting HR 4310, the bill he introduced to ""end the childhood obesity subsidy.""

""Congress -- with your tax dollars -- subsidizes the marketing efforts of fast food and junk food companies by as much as $19 billion over 10 years,"" thereby ""subsidizing the childhood obesity epidemic,"" he said.

Do fast food and junk food companies really enjoy an advertising subsidy? PolitiFact Ohio decided to dig in.

Kucinich builds his case first by noting that childhood obesity -- which has more than tripled in the past 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- has been linked to the influence of targeted marketing, though ""partial blame does lie with a more sedentary lifestyle and a worsening diet.""

He cites several prominent studies in support, with the most recent study coming from the Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences. It says: ""Aggressive marketing of high-calorie foods to children and adolescents has been identified as one of the major contributors to childhood obesity.""

(Others with the same conclusion included the American Heart Association, the American Journal of Public Health and the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University.) 
Kucinich's bill would prohibit any company from claiming a tax deduction for the expense of marketing that is directed at children ""to promote the consumption of food at fast food restaurants or of food of poor nutritional quality.""

Under current law, fast food marketers get the same break that other businesses do. The federal tax code allows companies to deduct ""reasonable and necessary"" expenses of marketing and advertising from their income taxes.

How is that a subsidy?

""The way the federal funding system works,"" Kucinich said, ""is that if we give a tax break in one place, we need to replace that lost income from somewhere else, like with higher taxes from the rest of us. In other words, this tax break is a massive subsidy for the junk food and fast food industry.""

The question then is how much the deduction, or tax break, is worth.

According to a report to Congress from the Federal Trade Commission, the most recent we could find, the fast food industry spent nearly $2 billion in 2006 on marketing and advertising specifically aimed at children. That would yield about $700 million in tax revenue at the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent.

A report in the New England Journal of Medicine put the marketing budgets for ""kids' foods"" at $10 billion annually -- which would yield $3.5 billion in revenue.

A study in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity said ""it It is unclear how much money is spent on food advertising specifically directed at children and adolescents,"" but put the total for advertising, youth-targeted promotions and public relations and packaging especially designed for children at $10.5 billion.

The Economic Policy Institute estimated 10-year tax savings of $15 billion through legislation to ""end subsidies for junk and fast food advertising to children to promote health.""

Kucinich relied on Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which estimated ""on a very preliminary basis"" that his legislation could raise $15 billion to $19 billion in additional federal revenue over the 10-year budget period.

That is as much as $19 billion, as Kucinich asserted, though the committee also noted that unsettled issues surrounding his bill would affect its impact and the revenue it would raise. Those issues primarily include defining ""fast food"" and determining what advertising is ""primarily directed at children.""

What's our take-home?

PolitiFact examined Kucinich's legislation two years ago, when he made a statement about it that we found relied too firmly on a high-end estimate of its potential tax saving and implied a direct cash payout by taxpayers to the food industry. He chose his words more carefully this time.

His assertion that the tax code provides a subsidy of ""as much as $19 billion"" needs additional information for clarification, but it is well supported.

On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/nov/26/dennis-kucinich/dennis-kucinich-says-tax-code-effectively-subsidiz/

No evidence found to back up Fulton commissioner's claim
","
Fulton County election officials have been the subject of much scrutiny from state officials and some news outlets for problems many voters had at the polls on Election Day.

Annoyed by the criticism, County Commissioner Emma Darnell defended the staff at a recent meeting.

""I did some checking on my own to see what are the error rates for elections departments as large as this one. You’re well below the average,"" Darnell said during the County Commission’s meeting Nov. 7.

PolitiFact Georgia was curious to determine whether Fulton’s error rates were below average, but we encountered a roadblock.

Darnell said she respects the work of PolitiFact Georgia but wouldn’t discuss anything related to the election department. She complained about biased media coverage on the subject, particularly by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The commissioner did suggest we examine Fulton and compare it with other Georgia counties.

Since Fulton is Georgia’s highest-populated county, we also thought a fair comparison would be to examine Fulton against other counties across the nation with similar populations. Without knowing exactly what the commissioner meant by ""error rates,"" we sought ways to examine mistakes by election officials at the polls. 

In Georgia, most voters cast their ballots on touch screens that are recorded on cards. Other states use other methods to record votes, so there is not a uniform way to measure errors. One uniform method to count votes, though, is provisional ballots, which appeared to be a problem for Fulton on Election Day.

The greatest complaint about Fulton came from people who said they were told their names weren’t on the county’s voter rolls. In such cases, the person is given a provisional ballot and the county then works to verify that person is registered to vote.

According to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, 9,575 provisional ballots were cast on Nov. 6 in Fulton. That was more than twice the total of provisional ballots cast in Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties combined, state data show. More than 100 people who tried to vote in Fulton have filed complaints to the state about the Nov. 6 election, the AJC reported. 

Fulton elections officials were still printing and delivering supplemental voter lists to precincts hours after the polls opened, the AJC has reported. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp called the situation a ""debacle.""

Fulton officials have made some mistakes in recent years administering elections. In 2008, the county sent absentee ballots late to as many as 2,500 voters, the AJC reported at the time. The result: Some voters were unable to cast ballots in that year’s presidential election.

In April 2009, state records show some Fulton election workers tossed thousands of voter registration cards in a Dumpster, violating proper procedure. They also failed to retain absentee ballot applications. The State Elections Board ordered Fulton to pay a $120,000 fine, plus costs associated with an investigation, a remedial plan and other penalties. 

Nearly 400,000 people voted in Fulton in the November 2012 general election, according to the Georgia secretary of state’s website. The county has 567,174 registered voters, state records show.

Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, used 2008 federal elections data to compare the percentage of provisional ballots used by Fulton and nearly three dozen other U.S. counties with 400,000 to 800,000 voters. Other experts on elections also suggested we contact Stewart.

In 2008, slightly more than 400,000 Fulton residents voted in the presidential election. About 4,100 ballots were cast using provisional ballots. That’s a 1 percent rate, which was about average among those 35 counties, Stewart said. Fulton’s 1 percent was twice as high as that in Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. There were nine smaller Georgia counties with a higher percentage of provisional ballots than Fulton, Stewart found.

Those provisional ballots still needed to be checked to determine whether the vote should be counted. Nearly 1,500 of those provisional ballots in Fulton were rejected, Stewart said, which amounts to an acceptance rate of nearly 64 percent. The average acceptance rate for U.S. counties similar to Fulton was about the same, Stewart said.

Stewart looked at the number of provisional ballots cast in Fulton in the Nov. 6 election and compared it with all the people who voted.

""If there are 11,000 provisional ballots this year out of 400,000 cast, that’s a 2.8 percent rate, which is quite a bit higher than 2008,"" Stewart said.

Let’s recap. Fulton Commissioner Emma Darnell said the number of errors by the county’s elections staff was ""well below the average."" She declined to provide details to back up her claim. Research shows Fulton was in the middle among U.S. counties of comparable size when it came to provisional ballots rejected in 2008, the last presidential election. That year, twice as many provisional ballots were cast in Fulton than there were in some of Georgia’s largest counties.

From the evidence available, the county’s recent history and the high number of provisional ballots cast in this month’s election, there’s not much evidence to back up Darnell’s claim that Fulton was ""well below the average."" We rate her claim False.",/factchecks/2012/nov/26/emma-darnell/no-evidence-found-back-fulton-commissioners-claim/
"['Drugs', 'Poverty', 'Texas', 'Marijuana', 'Joseph ""Joe"" Deshotel']","
Joe Deshotel says there is no evidence showing poor people use drugs more frequently than members of other socio-economic groups
","A Beaumont legislator opposed to drug-testing applicants for government benefits challenged Republican proponents to mandate testing of candidates for state office.

Democratic Rep. Joe Deshotel urged the unlikely prospect in a Nov. 13, 2012, press release after suggesting Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and others were targeting struggling Texans without reason.

Perry and Dewhurst had called on the 2013 Legislature, which convenes in January, to authorize drug screening of applicants for unemployment assistance or Temporary Aid for Needy Families, which provides government aid to children and their parents or relatives who are living with them.

Dewhurst said: ""We owe it to Texas taxpayers to structure our welfare and unemployment programs in a way that guarantees recipients are serious about getting back to work.""

Deshotel said in his response: ""There is no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group.""

None?

Deshotel, a House member since 1999, told us by phone that he should have said there is ""little evidence"" that low-income people abuse drugs more than others. By and large, he said, he believes Texans with more disposable income--those with greater wealth--are the biggest users of illegal drugs, especially cocaine.

Deshotel followed up by email, pointing out that in the federal government’s 2007 National Survey of Drug Use and Health, a little over half of unemployed and full-time employees reported trying marijuana. The survey indicates 23 percent of unemployed individuals had tried cocaine, compared to 19 percent of full-time employees and nearly 15 percent of part-time employees.

The annual survey, conducted since 1971, draws on face-to-face interviews of some 70,000 individuals aged 12 and older.

Since the survey does not gauge drug use levels by income level, the closest possible indicator may be job status. In the 2007 survey, nearly 2 percent of unemployed individuals reported more than 100 days of cocaine use in the previous year, compared to 0.4 percent of full-time workers. More than 10 percent of unemployed individuals said they had used marijuana more than 100 days, the survey says, compared to 4 percent of full-time employees.

Last year, PolitiFact Florida touched on the survey while tackling a flip-side version of Deshotel's claim. In June 2011, Florida Gov. Rick Scott told an interviewer: ""Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare.""
   
At the time, Scott’s office pointed out that the government used its 1999 and 2000 surveys to publish a report titled ""Substance Use Among Persons in Families Receiving Government Assistance.""

Among the findings, researchers concluded that ""past-month illicit drug use was higher in assisted families than in unassisted families among persons aged 12 to 64."" Specifically, the report said 9.6 percent of people in families receiving some type of government assistance reported recent drug use, compared to 6.8 percent among people in families receiving no government assistance.

PolitiFact Florida also cited research by Harold Pollack, a University of Chicago professor who studies substance abuse among welfare recipients, suggesting that  ""substance abuse and dependence are relatively uncommon"" for such recipients. Yet the same research found--by reviewing many different surveys--that ""approximately 20 percent of TANF recipients report that they have used an illicit drug at least once in the past year.""
   
Pollack told PolitiFact Florida that compared to other women of the same age, TANF recipients are more likely to use illicit substances, though he said most women who have used an illicit drug in the past year do not meet the diagnosis of being dependent on, or abusing, drugs. A lot of casual marijuana users may well test positive, Pollack said, but they do not have a ""drug problem.""

We ran Deshotel’s statement past Pollack, who called it an oversimplification, though he said substance abuse is widespread and not limited to low-income residents.

Pollack nudged us to contact Beau Kilmer, co-director of the California-based RAND Drug Policy Research Center, which says it provides decision-makers with research on substance use and drug policy. Kilmer emailed us his writing from a 2010 book stating that a ""wealth of evidence"" suggests substance use and poverty are ""closely connected.""

Surveys of the homeless show ""staggering rates of alcohol and drug dependency,"" Kilmer wrote. Like others, Kilmer cited the 2007 federal survey, writing that its results indicate that individuals living below the federal poverty line were 50 percent to 100 percent more likely than individuals with incomes at twice the poverty level to report use of an illicit drug in the past month or dependence/abuse in the past year, he wrote. However, Kilmer wrote, the ""limited scientific literature examining a causal connection between poverty and substance abuse remains unsettled.""

By telephone, Miguel Ferguson, an associate professor at the University of Texas School of Social Work, took issue with Kilmer’s characterization of the differences in illicit drug use suggested by the survey results.

The percentage differences underscored by Kilmer may be statistically significant, Ferguson said, but in real-world social terms, the contrast between 2 percent of survey respondents living at twice the poverty level and above having abused or depended on an illicit drug in the past year compared to 5 percent of individuals living below the poverty line is practically no difference--at best, he said, marginal. ""Given what I know about living in poverty and the stress that people are under, I am shocked that it is that low,"" Ferguson said.

We shared Kilmer’s chapter with Deshotel, who noted by email the slight difference in reported dependence on an illicit drug between the groups, adding: ""My ultimate argument is that there is no significant difference between those who use drugs who are poor and those are not that would warrant the state spending tax dollars to test some beneficiaries and not others.""

Deshotel also pointed out an April 17, 2012, New York Times news article indicating that after Florida imposed drug screens on its applicants for cash benefits, 2.6 percent of applicants failed the test--the most common reason being marijuana--over the first four months, or 108 of 4,086, according to results obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, which won a court order blocking the Florida drug screens. An additional 40 people canceled the tests without taking them, the newspaper said.

Separately, we asked the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a federal agency that supports research to prevent and treat drug abuse and addiction and mitigate consequences, to evaluate Deshotel’s statement. By email, Susan Weiss, the institute’s scientific adviser to its director, told us through a spokeswoman: ""There are a variety of factors that can contribute to drug abuse, socio-economic status being one of them, along with family support, peers/siblings that use drugs, genetics"" and ""school problems. Being poor doesn’t necessarily put you at risk, nor does being rich protect you from risk.""

All that said, Weiss later said, poverty can be a major stressor in a person’s life leading to drug use.

In 2011, Florida’s ACLU offered other government and academic research for PolitiFact Florida to consider.

Researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a part of the National Institutes of Health, published findings in 1996 that said welfare recipients ""using, abusing, or dependent on alcohol or illicit drugs are consistent with proportions of both the adult U.S. population and adults who do not receive welfare.""
   
The research relied on 1992 data and concluded that drug use among welfare recipients ranged between 1.3 to 3.6 percent, compared to 1.5 percent for non-welfare recipients.
   
The caveats here are much like the government research Scott’s office highlighted. Namely, it includes other types of welfare than cash assistance, and it's old. The report was published in 1996 and relies on 1992 data.
   
Another researcher used data from Michigan--a state that participated in drug-testing for welfare recipients until a federal court held in 2003 that subjecting every applicant to a drug test without reason was unconstitutional. In Michigan, 10 percent of recipients tested positive for illicit drugs. That's comparable to the National Survey on Drug Use & Health, which found that in 2007-08, 8.95 percent of all Michigan residents (grouping non-welfare and welfare recipients) said they used illicit drugs in the past month.

Our ruling

Deshotel said there is ""no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group.""

We agree with PolitiFact Florida that it's difficult to make broad generalizations about whole groups of people. And it's even more difficult to definitively measure drug use. Some research indicates drug abuse among the poor and those who are not poor is consistent. However, there also are studies showing a higher prevalence of drug use among some welfare recipients.

So, evidence is debated. Still, the idea that there is no evidence that low-income people use drugs more frequently does not hold up. As Pollack told us, that's an oversimplification. We rate this absolute claim as False.",/factchecks/2012/nov/26/joseph-joe-deshotel/joe-deshotel-says-there-no-evidence-showing-poor-p/

Erpenbach says Walker misled on federal health care law
","
Republican Mitt Romney’s defeat in the November elections, coupled with the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2012 ruling, put an end to debate about whether President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law would take effect.

Or did it?

Gov. Scott Walker, a vocal critic of the law, seemed to bow to legal and political realities on Nov. 16, 2012, when he announced his administration was ""complying with the law, whether we like it or not.""

The statement was part of an announcement that he would not create a state-run insurance marketplace to put the law into effect. Rather, Walker told reporters, he would let the federal government run it, another of the options under the law. Democrats and some prominent business organizations wanted a state exchange, arguing it could be better tailored to Wisconsin’s needs, and any problems could be dealt with at the local level.

State Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) issued a statement criticizing the decision.

""I am disappointed that Governor Walker does not have enough faith in the people of Wisconsin to help create a health insurance marketplace that best fits our needs as a state,"" Erpenbach said.

That critique was a common refrain from Democrats that day. But Erpenbach added a twist that caught our eye.

Walker, he said, ""has led people to believe that if Wisconsin doesn’t implement an exchange, ObamaCare doesn’t happen here.""

The background

A core of conservative critics of ""Obamacare"" believes that states maintain the ability to challenge -- and possibly block -- the federal health care reform law if they decline to run the exchanges. 
  
The legal theory holds that an unintended loophole in the law could block federally run exchanges from functioning legally in states. The state of Oklahoma made a version of the argument in amended court filings in September 2012. 
Wisconsin tea-party groups lobbied Walker not to create an exchange in part by raising this issue. And one of the leaders of that effort, Ross Brown of the Dane County group known as We the People of the Republic, feels it was a likely factor in Walker’s decision. 
Brown said he has no hard proof of that. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie told us the governor had not opted against a state exchange to keep the legal option open. 
Werwie said Walker’s is aware of the legal argument and has not ruled out pursuing it, but added that it was not under active consideration now. 
""At this time, this is how the Walker administration is moving forward,"" Werwie said. 
Erpenbach’s claim 
  
While there is some fuzziness about what could happen in the future, Erpenbach’s claim was entirely about the past -- that Walker had led residents to believe if the state did not create an exchange Obamacare would not be implemented here. 
Erpenbach pointed us to several Walker statements at key junctures in the ""Obamacare"" drama: 
February 2011: Walker joined 21 Republican governors favoring repeal of Obamacare if the courts don’t first strike it down. Lacking either, they wrote, federal officials should change the law to address the GOP governors’ fiscal and philosophical objections. They said that, lacking major improvements, they’d let the feds run the exchanges. 
December 2011: Walker suspended planning for a state-run exchange, a change in position. He had previously talked about creating one. He cited the pending Supreme Court case. 
In neither case was there a hint that Walker’s position on the exchanges was a move to stop the law. 
Erpenbach argues that Walker omitted the fact that if Wisconsin didn’t run the exchange, the feds would. But the clear context of Walker’s statements, and the news coverage of it, was that it was either/or. 
January 2012: Walker stopped work on a state exchange, eliminated his own Office of Free Market Health Care and turned down $37 million in federal planning money. 
  
Here’s how he explained his decision on creating an exchange: 
""Stopping the encroachment of Obamacare in our state, which has the potential to have a devastating impact on Wisconsin’s economy, is a top priority. Wisconsin has been a leader and innovator in health care reform for two decades, and we have achieved a high level of health insurance coverage without federal mandates. When job creators and Wisconsin families are facing difficult times it doesn’t make sense to commit to a federal health care mandate that will result in hidden taxes for Wisconsin’s families, increased health care costs and insurance premiums, and more uncertainty in the private sector."" 
In that statement, Walker directly linked the exchange decision to ""stopping"" Obamacare in Wisconsin and not committing to it. And he did not explain the federal role. 
June 2012: After the Supreme Court upheld much of the law, Walker issued a statement saying that ""Wisconsin will not take any action to implement Obamacare."" 
He pinned his hopes for stopping it on the fall elections, and made it sound like the last hope: ""I am hopeful that political changes in Washington, D.C., later this year ultimately end the implementation of this law at the federal level. If there is no political remedy from Washington and the law moves forward, it would require the majority of people in Wisconsin to pay more money for less health care."" 
He again pledged not to phase in any parts of the law pending the election outcome. 
Around the same time, we fact-checked a Walker op-ed piece in the Washington Post. We rated False his claim that a study showed that Obamacare would ""devastate Wisconsin"" by pushing people off employer-sponsored insurance, driving up premiums, increasing dependency and making 122,000 people ineligible for Medicaid. 
After the Nov. 6, 2012 elections, Walker contemplated his final decision on a state or federal exchange. This is when the tea-party lobbyists and Obamacare critics such as Sen. Frank Lasee, R- De Pere, pressed him to let the feds do it -- in part hoping to keep alive a possible legal challenge. 
Walker, though, made no mention that we could find of that legal option when he announced on Nov. 16, 2012, he’d let the feds run it. Rather, he focused on possible costs to taxpayers. 
Wisconsin ""will defer to the federal government’s insurance exchange,"" Walker wrote to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. 
One historical footnote: Walker’s remarks to reporters on Nov. 16, 2012, included the assurance that  ""We are complying with the law, exactly as the law is written."" 
Was that a sly nod to the potential legal problem with how the law was written? 
Werwie said no, that Walker simply meant the law gave states the option of not creating an exchange and deferring to the federal government. 
Our rating 
Erpenbach said Walker ""has led people to believe that if Wisconsin doesn’t implement an exchange, ObamaCare doesn’t happen here."" 
There’s no doubt that some conservative Obamacare critics see a link between stopping federal health care reform and not creating a state exchange. They are thrilled that Walker did what he did, in part for that reason. 
But Walker for the most part clearly cast his rhetoric about ""stopping"" the law in terms of the Supreme Court case and the election. And he has mostly made it clear that no state exchange would instead mean a federal exchange -- not no Obamacare. 
An exception was his January 2012 remarks, which coupled some heated language about stopping the law with his decision to punt the exchange to the federal government. 
That gives Erpenbach’s claim an element of accuracy, but we rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/nov/25/jon-erpenbach/erpenbach-says-walker-misled-federal-health-care-l/

Frank Lautenberg says after Hurricane Sandy much of the boardwalk in Atlantic City no longer exists
","
Hurricane Sandy washed iconic Jersey Shore landmarks into the sea, but despite what you may have heard -- from social media, television or maybe even a United States senator --  the historic boardwalk fronting Atlantic City’s casinos survived.

Two weeks after the monstrous storm swept through New Jersey, devastating large swaths of the state’s coastline, Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat, took to the Senate floor to describe the destruction and push for funding for recovery efforts.

In his Nov. 13 speech, the senator mentioned damage across the state, but said, ""the seashore community was hit especially hard.""

""The boardwalk is the defining image of the New Jersey shore. Many of us remember walking on that boardwalk in wonderment of the attractions. The boardwalk has been a constant in the lives of those who live there or visit the shore. But for communities like Belmar, Seaside Heights, the Atlantic City, and others, much of that boardwalk no longer exists -- just the pillars where the boardwalk used to be, as we see it here,"" Lautenberg said as he showed a photograph of damage to a section of boardwalk in Atlantic City.

""It was a magnificent boardwalk and had people in cars that were -- in wagons that were pushed along, and you would view the sea and the attractions on the other side. And it was painful to see the destruction of the part of the boardwalk in Atlantic City firsthand that day.""

Lautenberg’s spokesman, Caley Gray, pointed out the senator did reference ""part"" of the boardwalk in his speech, but the senator omitted a critical detail: the section of boardwalk in Atlantic City that the storm washed away was in disrepair and much of it had been scheduled for demolition.

The main promenade that runs in front of the city’s casinos remains intact and open for business.

""It is factually accurate that a portion of the boardwalk was destroyed by Sandy,"" said Jeff Guaracino, chief communications and strategy officer for Atlantic City Alliance, but ""it’s not the boardwalk that the average person would typically associate with a visit to Atlantic City.""

Atlantic City Alliance, a nonprofit group focused on increasing tourism, has launched a campaign to dispel the rumor that the city’s famed boardwalk was destroyed.

Guaracino said some media outlets, particularly television stations, cut from stock images of the oceanfront boardwalk to the destruction of the dilapidated promenade, leaving viewers with the impression the commercial section of the boardwalk had washed away.

But the walkway destroyed by Sandy stood in a primarily residential neighborhood near the Absecon Inlet. That area of the boardwalk had been deteriorating for decades. Portions of it had collapsed well before the storm and were closed to pedestrians.

Now, Keith Mills, the city’s director of planning and development, said what remains are a ""couple of ramps, couple of stairways, but at this point they are ramps and stairways to nothing but a series of pilings in the water.""

But that’s not the case for the commercial stretch of the city’s boardwalk.

Gray said in a statement that Lautenberg walked the boardwalk after the storm and surveyed the damage in the inlet section. ""The main drag in Atlantic City was fortunate to not have sustained more damage,"" he said, adding that Lautenberg is working to secure federal funding to fully restore the state’s coastline.

Our ruling

Lautenberg said that because of Hurricane Sandy in Atlantic City, ""much of that boardwalk no longer exists—just the pillars where the boardwalk used to be.""

The storm washed away a dilapidated section of Atlantic City’s boardwalk -- much of which had been scheduled for demolition -- that runs along the Absecon Inlet. So there’s an element of truth to Lautenberg’s claim.

But the stretch of the boardwalk in front of the casinos -- the area most tourists associate with Atlantic City -- fared the storm well.

Lautenberg’s speech ignored those important details, so we rate this claim Mostly False.

Delta broke promises to Memphis says Congressman Cohen
","
When the merger of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines was under consideration in 2008, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., was skeptical of the deal. While noting that the Memphis Airport Authority and the Memphis Chamber of Commerce backed it, Cohen sought some assurances from those seeking to implement it.

The Memphis congressmen is now assailing Delta, which has grown very unpopular in the region while flights are cut and fares are raised, for failing to live up to those assurances.

Cohen put out a press release Oct. 31 saying some of the assurances he received were misrepresentations and ""that Delta has once again broken a promise they made to me and to the people of Memphis."" The release’s opening paragraph referred to a ""string of broken promises,"" so we decided to look at the history and determine if Cohen is accurately representing the company’s record.

Cohen’s office provided hearing transcripts and press accounts. In one, the CEO of Delta, Richard H. Anderson, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee’s task force on antitrust laws in April 2008, and Cohen was there to question him. Anderson, who had served as a senior vice president for labor relations at Northwest in the early 1990s, noted that he’d spent ""many days in Memphis"" and was ""instrumental in launching the service from Memphis to Amsterdam some, I guess, 10 years ago now.""

Cohen: ""The Amsterdam flight would remain, I presume?""

Anderson: ""Yes.""

The Delta-Northwest merger was announced on April 14, 2008, and the boards of the two companies approved terms of the deal in September of that year. It received regulatory approval from the Justice Department’s antitrust division and from European regulators.

Delta announced in March of this year that the flight to Amsterdam, inaugurated in 1995 and giving the Bluff City huge international cachet, would be converted to a summer-only schedule. Then, in October, the airline dropped the flight from the schedule completely.

Similarly, in a Memphis Daily News article of June 2008, Anderson was quoted saying Memphis would be an integral hub of the merged airline: ""The consolidation is about addition, not subtraction."" The article was one of many from that time noting that, ""Anderson said the move could even bring more flights to the city, especially international flights, considering the long list of worldwide cities now served by the two companies.""

At the time, the cheering section included Memphis Airport Authority chairman Arnold Perl, who was quoted as saying, ""The Northwest-Delta merger is great for Memphis, great for the Memphis region, great for Tennessee and great for the United States.""

To many in Memphis, including  those among the 6,000 members of the anti-Delta Facebook group, ""Delta Does Memphis,"" the merger now seems more grating than great.

Northwest Airlines flew 240 flights out of Memphis before being acquired by Delta in 2008. In June of this year, Delta announced it would chop 25 flights from Memphis out of its schedule, leaving the hub with 46 percent fewer flights than when the merger took effect. Memphis International Airport chief financial officer Forrest Artz reported that, in September, daily Delta flights were down to 122, compared to 175 the same month a year earlier.

For its part, Delta blames other factors beyond the merger for the reduced flights. ""Any operational assurance that Delta provided officials was under the understating that any action to the contrary would not be directly related to the merger,"" Delta spokesman Anthony L. Black said by email. ""Specifically, raising fuel costs, the current international economic environment, lack of passenger demand and profitability have been the primary drivers of all network restructuring.""

While Delta may now claim that any assurances it gave were conditioned by any number of factors, people in Memphis thought they had a deal that meant a strengthened hub and a continued flight to Europe, and maybe more. The facts are the Delta Air Lines CEO said the Memphis-Amsterdam flight would continue. It was first curtailed to summer-only, then chloroformed. That’s a broken promise.

Next, the Delta point man said Memphis would remain an integral hub of the new merged airline and might even have ""more flights to the city."" The number of flights has dropped from 240 to 122, a 49 percent decline.

Whatever the circumstances, these qualify as broken promises.

Our ruling

Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen accuses Delta of breaking promises made to him and the city of Memphis about the impact of its merger with Northwest. Delta has subsequently ended the city’s direct flight to Amsterdam and has cut the number of flights nearly in half.

State Rep. Patricia Morgan says Rhode Island spends 42 percent of its budget on 'welfare systems'
","
The classic conflict that underlies many political debates these days is how to balance what we wish government would do for us with how much we can afford to pay for those government services.

One of those who worries our good intentions may be getting too big for our wallets is state Rep. Patricia L. Morgan, R-West Warwick, who won reelection this month to her second term.

A reader sent us one of her campaign fliers last week, asking us to check one of its claims. The headline on the flier was ""Waste and Abuse in Rhode Island Government is hurting our JOB Climate and YOU. Is it Fair?""

The claim that caught our reader’s eye: ""Our welfare system now consumes more than 42 percent of our budget.""

The flier said such spending was diverting funds that could otherwise be spent on roads, higher education and improving the economic climate for private business.

We wondered what Morgan’s definition of the ""welfare system"" was and whether it really made up 42 percent of the budget.

When we called Morgan she said she defines welfare as a payment from the government that someone gets without having to work to earn it. That would cover food stamps, free or subsidized childcare, subsidized housing, even the RIPTA bus passes given to participants in Rhode Island IWorks,  the welfare and job training program for low-income families, she said.

She said she didn’t do an exhaustive breakdown of all state agencies to arrive at her 42 percent figure. Instead, she used the state House of Representatives fiscal staff’s evaluation of the fiscal 2013 budget as enacted.

She said she took the $3.66 billion the staff calculated the state is set to spend on ""assistance, grants and benefits"" in 2013 and divided it by the total budget of state and federal spending, around $8.09 billion. ""Assistance, grants and benefits"" made up 45.2 percent of the budget.  

We decided to take a deeper look to see whether Morgan’s number and analysis was on target.

But first, let’s talk about Morgan’s definition of ""welfare system."" When many people hear the term, they might think of welfare payments to poor people -- now known as Rhode Island Works.

But other programs provide types of direct payments too, such as General Public Assistance, Supplemental Security Income and Individual and Family Support. Combined, those are slated to cost about $562 million in 2013, about 7 percent of the total state budget.

But for purposes of this item, we’ll work with Morgan’s broader definition of welfare as any government payment to an individual.

The House analysis of the budget notes that while most of the $3.6-billion figure Morgan cited is made up of social service aid, it also includes ""grants to environmental agencies, local law enforcement agencies.""

State Budget Director Thomas Mullaney told us that, in fact, the ""assistance, grants and benefits"" category includes every grant from every department.

That would include such spending as Federal Emergency Management Agency payments for storm cleanups as well as the legislative grants representatives and senators give out to such groups as Little League teams in their districts.

The House staff analysis actually broke out what it classified as human service-related assistance, grants and benefits -- closer to Morgan’s definition of ""welfare system.""

They totaled $2.54 billion, or about 31 percent of the total state 2013 budget -- lower than Morgan’s figures. More than half of that, $1.6 billion, was federal money spent on providing Medicaid services to Rhode Island’s poor.

What about the costs for administering these programs? Morgan said the House report says overall, all spending for human services -- including administration -- totals about $3.19 billion, or about 39.3 percent of the budget. Even though some of that money wasn’t going directly to beneficiaries, she said it counted because it was the expense of delivering those benefits.

But that figure includes spending on departments that don’t make payments to individuals, including the Department of Health, the state medical examiner’s office, the Office of Child Advocate and the Office of Child Support Enforcement, which last year helped collect about $80 million in child support owed by deadbeat parents.

We believe the 31 percent figure is more applicable

Our ruling

State Rep. Patricia Morgan says spending on ""welfare systems"" in Rhode Island accounts for 42 percent of the budget.

Even working with Morgan's broad definition of welfare, our analysis showed that figure is closer to 31 percent.

Why does this matter?

As Morgan’s flier noted, social-service programs, particularly Medicaid, are clearly putting an increasing strain on state and federal taxpayers. That’s a big challenge for lawmakers. It’s important to get the numbers right.

With Jersey on the itinerary for both events, wrestler Triple H says WrestleMania has surpassed Super Bowl ticket sales
","
Guess what, sports fans? The Super Bowl may not be the biggest ticket in town after all, according to popular wrestling entertainer Triple H.

That designation might instead go to WrestleMania, an annual one-night event featuring matches between some of the most popular wrestlers within World Wrestling Entertainment. And MetLife Stadium is likely to become the show ring for that title when WrestleMania comes to town in April and the real Super Bowl follows in February 2014.

""We’ve outdrawn the Super Bowl for a little while now in the arenas and stadiums that we’ve followed them in for the Super Bowl,"" Paul Levesque (Triple H’s real moniker) said in a Nov. 8 interview on NYPost.com. ""We’ve gone in after [the NFL] and surpassed their ticket sales."" Levesque is executive vice president for Talent Relations and Live Events for the Stamford, Conn.-based WWE.

In the context of attendance, Levesque wins this bout.

PolitiFact New Jersey can’t predict the ticket sales outcome for both events at MetLife Stadium, so we looked at six stadiums where WrestleMania was held after a Super Bowl. In five of the six arenas (Pontiac Silverdome, Ford Field, Reliant Stadium, University of Phoenix Stadium and Sun Life Stadium), WrestleMania attendance topped Super Bowl attendance.

Here’s a breakdown by arena: 
  
Sources: World Wrestling Entertainment, NFL’s Super Bowl XLVI  2011 Postseason Media Guide 
So why has WrestleMania had better ticket sales than the Super Bowl? Staging. Seats can be added to the field for Wrestlemania events, but not for Super Bowls, possibly giving WrestleMania a capacity advantage.

""The difference between WrestleMania and Super Bowl staging is that WrestleMania has a stage much like a concert so seats behind the stage are unavailable but would be used for football,"" Kevin Hennessy, WWE senior director of publicity, said in an e-mail. ""However, for WrestleMania, seats are added to field level which would not be done for football. That is why we feel justified in making the comparison.""

That was the case at Glendale, Ariz.’s University of Phoenix Stadium, where temporary seats were added for WrestleMania in 2010, spokesman Scott Norton said.

And New Jerseyans have a reason to care about ticket sales when both events come to MetLife Stadium: ticket sales equal economic impact.

""According to the NY/NJ Super Bowls Host Committee (headed by CEO Al Kelly) approximately 150,000 out-of-town visitors will attend non-game events and that the region will have approximately 400,000 people total who will attend events related to Super Bowl activities that are not the actual Super Bowl game,"" Wayne Hasenbalg, president and CEO of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said in an e-mail.

""According to a SMRI (Sports Management Research Institute) economic study, the recent Super Bowl in Indianapolis (XLVI) had a $155 million economic impact on the central Indiana region,"" Hasenbalg continued. ""The SMRI estimates $550 million in regional economic impact for our Super Bowl (XLVIII).""

The SMRI did not return a call for comment.

WrestleMania 28’s economic impact on Miami this past April totaled $103 million, according to a report assessing the event’s financial impact on that city.

Our ruling

WWE executive Paul Levesque, better known by his stage name Triple H, said in a recent interview that ""we’ve outdrawn the Super Bowl for a little while now in the arenas and stadiums that we’ve followed them in for the Super Bowl. We’ve gone in after [the NFL] and surpassed their ticket sales.""

In terms of attendance, Levesque is largely correct: WrestleMania sold more tickets than the Super Bowl in five of the six stadiums where WrestleMania was held after a Super Bowl. It's worth noting, however, that since WrestleMania's staging is similar to a concert's, field seating may be added to compensate for lost seating behind the WrestleMania stage. 
Levesque’s claim rates Mostly True.

Ann Kuster touts being a member of the most diverse Congress ever
","
New Hampshire voters made history this month, electing the nation’s first all-female delegation to Congress. And they weren’t the only ones to break down barriers.

Across the country, voters broke records, electing the most diverse class ever to enter Congress, according to U.S. Rep.-elect Ann McLane Kuster, who will be sworn in in New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District in January.

""I’m … entering in the most diverse class ever,"" Kuster told MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry, Sunday, Nov. 11 -- five days after the election. ""The Democratic caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives will be (a) majority of women and minorities. So, that is a wonderful experience. … I take great pride in that, as well.""

As Kuster notes, the incoming Democratic caucus includes a majority of women and minorities for the first time in history, according to news reports. Despite the gains, however, white men still hold a two-thirds majority in the 113th Congress.

Bloomberg News pointed out that the House floor didn’t even have women’s restrooms until 2011, when Speaker John Boehner had them installed.

But, does that make this House of Representatives the most diverse ever? We decided to check the books.

According to preliminary counts, the incoming class in the House of Representatives, to be sworn in in January, features 78 women, 42 African Americans and 28 Latinos, among the 435 total representatives.

Voters initially elected 43 African American representatives across the country, but that number fell to 42 after U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. resigned his seat Wednesday. If that number stands, the Congressional Black Caucus will have lost two members from the 2012 count, falling from 44.

Overall, since other minority groups will have added to their numbers, new records for diversity are poised to be set.

The class of 78 women elected to the House this month marks an increase of five over the record 73, who served in each of the last three sessions of Congress, according to the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University.

Federal counts show a total of 277 women have served in the House since 1917, when Rep. Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first elected to Congress.

As for Latinos, the 28 members represent an increase of four over the 2012 count -- the previous high, according to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund.

In total, 91 Hispanic representatives have served since Joseph Marion Hernandez, of Florida, became the first in 1822. The current Congress’ class of 24 had been the largest until this month’s election.

""We are seeing greater geographic representation,"" said Rosalind Gold, senior director of policy research and advocacy for the California-based Education Fund. ""We’re seeing more and more that candidates can both win in districts that are traditional centers of Latino population, but they can also appeal to very diverse constituencies. … There were a lot of milestones in this election.""

Looking forward, the next Congress also will see more Asian American and Pacific Islander members in Congress than ever before-- 13 in the House-- while Arab Americans retained at least four of their five House seats, as U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana, faces a December runoff election.

Our ruling:

The 113th Congress, like the ones before it, will go down as the most diverse class in history. The African Americans caucus have lost one seat, but voters elected more women than ever before (78), more Latinos (28) and more Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (13).

Mike DeWine touts his wife's recipes as a delicious part of Thanksgiving
","
Even PolitiFact Ohio needs an occasional break from politics. We decided that taking one on Thanksgiving would give all of us something to be thankful for.

But fact-checking doesn't take a holiday.

When we received a Thanksgiving news release from Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, our attention was immediately seized. In addition to holiday greetings, the release included three recipes DeWine credited to his wife, Fran.

He said the recipes -- for crescent rolls, broccoli salad and ""Fran's carrot cake with lemon cream cheese icing"" -- are family favorites and part of a delicious and traditional Thanksgiving meal.

Hoping it didn't look too obviously like we were pitching for samples, PolitiFact Ohio asked the attorney general how he backs up his claim of deliciousness.

""I think I would start with the rolls,"" he told us. ""Fran's been making these rolls for, well, we've been married for 45 years, and she's been making the rolls for probably 40. She took it from a recipe in one of her first cookbooks, and she modified it mainly by adding honey.""

She also adds cracked wheat flour from the family farm because ""it embodies the spirit of the harvest,"" he said.

""The strongest evidence (of deliciousness) I would give,"" he continued, ""is if you would be there on Thanksgiving, or any other meal, to watch our grandkids wait for the turkey to come out of the oven.

""Fran takes the turkey out and puts the rolls in. Before they can actually get served, kids are taking rolls off the pan, burning their fingers to get them. I've seen them put as many as five on a plate.""

The DeWines have 18 grandchildren, with a 19th on the way next month. They host 75 people for Thanksgiving.

To feed them all, Mrs. DeWine makes 12 dozen rolls.

""They're to die for,"" her husband said. ""The best evidence is to watch people eat them. Even people who say they don't eat rolls like them. At any family gathering, really, people expect Fran to have them.""

DeWine sometimes spreads them with red raspberry jam from his son, an organic farmer. To be really decadent, he said, he adds both jam and butter.

We questioned whether that wouldn't be so good it's illegal. Exercising his prosecutorial discretion as the state's chief law enforcement officer, he assured us we would be on safe legal ground.

He said the broccoli salad was a relatively new addition to the holiday menu that was added by a daughter-in-law.

""I'm not a great fan of broccoli per se, but in that combination it's very, very tasty,"" he said. ""It's a healthy, interesting mixture.""

We asked him about the cake. At PolitiFact Ohio, we are well known as carrot cake fiends.

""The carrot cake is also a favorite of mine,"" he said. ""The frosting is very similar to a frosting my mother used to make on chocolate cake, a cream cheese with lemon frosting. When it comes out of the oven …""

PolitiFact Ohio didn’t press him to finish the description. We had heard enough to begin pondering how we could slip in for dinner.

A family recipe in use four decades certainly is a tradition. And DeWine’s descriptions left us craving his wife’s cooking. We rate his claim of deliciousness as True.

We’re sharing the recipe for Fran DeWine’s Favorite Rolls above. They would certainly enhance any holiday leftovers. You can find the others in his news release.

Tom Craddick says 39 states and about 25 Texas cities bar texting while driving
","
Pitching a statewide ban on texting while driving like one vetoed by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011, a former speaker of the Texas House said two dozen Texas cities and most states already bar the practice.

Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland, said in a Nov. 12, 2012, press release: ""Approximately 25 Texas cities have adopted an ordinance banning texting while driving."" He also said: ""It is time for Texas to join the other 39 states"" in banning ""this dangerous behavior for all drivers.""

Craddick’s House Bill 63 would bar the use of a wireless communication device to read, write or send a text-based communication while driving, except when a vehicle is stopped. The ban would not apply to hands-free devices or to dialing a number or using the GPS on a hand-held phone.

Perry’s June 17, 2011, message accompanying his veto of Craddick’s previous proposal said that texting while driving is reckless and irresponsible, but the proposed change in law amounts to a ""government effort to micromanage the behavior of adults."" Perry said the keys to ""dissuading drivers of all ages from texting while driving are information and education.""

Nationally, according to a web post by the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 220 million people subscribe to wireless services and up to 80 percent of those subscribers use their phones while driving. Further, distracted driving including cell phone use figured into 16 percent of fatal U.S. crashes in 2009, up from 10 percent in 2005, as noted in a June 2011 Truth-O-Meter article.

We won’t judge here whether restrictions on cell phone use affect accident rates.

But is Craddick correct that 39 states and about 25 Texas cities now bar texting while driving?

To our inquiry, Kate Huddleston of Craddick’s office forwarded an email from Julian Hoffman of the National Safety Council stating that 39 states ban texting while driving. By email, Hoffman told us the council drew its count from information posted online with a map of the United States by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which describes itself as an effort funded by auto insurers dedicated to reducing deaths, injuries and property damage related to highway and roadway crashes.

An introduction to the institute’s map of states with limits on texting while driving, dated November 2012, says: ""Text messaging is banned for all drivers in 39 states and the District of Columbia."" The map indicates that six additional states, including Texas, have imposed partial bans. In Texas, an institute chart says, individuals barred from texting include drivers in school crossing zones; bus drivers when a passenger 17 or younger is present; and drivers younger than 18.

States lacking any such restrictions are Montana, Arizona, South Dakota, South Carolina and Florida, according to the map.

We asked the institute how it determined the states with such laws. Spokesman Russ Rader told us by phone: ""We track state laws. That’s part of what we do.""

Rader also sent a chart showing the date each state’s texting-while-driving ban took effect.
Among the states, Connecticut had the first law, in 2005. The year 2010 had the highest count of any year with restrictions taking effect in 14 states. From January through August 2012, most recently, bans took effect in six states--Nevada, Pennsylvania, Idaho, West Virginia, Alabama and Ohio.

Similarly, the National Conference of State Legislatures says 39 states have banned texting while driving. Anne Teigen, a conference policy specialist, told us by phone that the group independently confirmed each state’s ban.

Next, we hunted breakdowns of the Texas cities that have banned texting while driving.

According to a February 2012 report by the non-partisan House Research Organization, which analyzes legislative issues for the Texas House, Austin was the state’s first city to do so, in November 2009. In total, the report says, at least 23 Texas cities approved bans. Besides Austin, cities listed as having bans are: Alamo, Arlington, Bellaire, Brownsville, Conroe, El Paso (which bans motorists from using any hand-held devices), Galveston, Harlingen, Magnolia, McAllen, Mission, Missouri City, Mount Vernon, Nacogdoches, Palmview, Penitas, San Antonio, Shoreacres, Stephenville, Tomball, Universal City and West University Place. By telephone,  Laura Hendrickson, the research group’s director, told us its researcher compiled the list.

Amarillo, described in the report as weighing a ban, later banned the use of hand-held phones while driving, according to a Nov. 12, 2012, news article in the Amarillo Globe-News.

Separately, Craddick’s office forwarded an email from the Texas Department of Transportation listing the same cities plus Canyon. TxDOT spokeswoman Veronica Beyer told us by phone its list originated with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute whose spokesman, Bernie Fette, emailed that it was built from online news sources checked during August and September 2012.

Health First Wisconsin says Wisconsin stands alone on allowing underage drinking in bars
","
Wisconsin’s ranking as the nation’s top binge-drinking state was confirmed in a 2012 study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But is the state the most permissive in America on allowing minors to imbibe in a public establishment?

That’s the gist of a claim by Health First Wisconsin, a group that lobbies to prevent alcohol abuse and curb tobacco use.

On Nov. 12, 2012 the organization, (formerly known as Smoke Free Wisconsin) decried what it called Wisconsin’s ""extreme alcohol culture"" after a question on Reddit, the social news website, led to online debate over ""extreme legal loopholes.""

One of the ""loopholes"" cited prominently was a Wisconsin liquor law that creates an exception to the 21 drinking age.

""Wisconsin needs to send a strong message that 21 means 21,"" Maureen Busalacchi, executive director of Health First Wisconsin, said in a news release. ""Wisconsin is the only state that allows parents or guardians to purchase alcohol for their children – regardless of whether that child is seven or 20 years old – at bars and restaurants.""

Health First wants to eliminate the exception, saying the law fuels an unsafe drinking culture and that research shows impaired brain development associated with early-age drinking.

Does Wisconsin really stand alone by allowing children of any age to drink in taverns and eateries under such supervision?

The evidence

Asked for backup, the group pointed us to state and national research on state-by-state alcohol-control laws, which we reviewed along with other materials in order to compare states, starting with Wisconsin.

Wisconsin law does say that persons under 21 can be sold alcohol and drink it if they are with their parents, guardians or spouses of legal drinking age, the state Department of Revenue website says. State law allows that at bars as well as restaurants with liquor licenses.

And as Health First says, the Wisconsin law sets no age restriction.

But it’s important to note that establishments can decline, on their own, to serve parent-accompanied minors.

The Wisconsin Tavern League doesn’t tell its members how to handle it, but many are not comfortable serving the underaged, executive director Pete Madland said. Others do so.

Madland said it’s an option for people who want to teach their children how to drink responsibly, a practice he noted is common in European countries with lower legal drinking ages.

How does Wisconsin compare?

We did not check on all 50 states because the available national research doesn’t get to the level of state-by-state detail required to fully check this.

But we didn’t need to check all 50 to assess the group’s Wisconsin-stands-alone claim.

We found that many states allow parent-supervised underage drinking at home by their children. And a few allow underaged drinking by 18-20 year olds at bars if they are accompanied by parents or guardians.

What’s at issue here is narrower: how many states allow underage imbibing at bars (and restaurants) at any age.

Based on our reporting, Wisconsin is not alone, though it appears to be a very short list.

Laws in Texas, Ohio and Montana closely mirror the law in Wisconsin.

Texas: In many places in the Lone Star State, persons of any age can consume or possess alcohol in bars and restaurants when in the ""visible presence"" of their adult parent, legal guardian or spouse, according to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.

Unlike in Wisconsin, those accompanied drinkers can’t actually buy booze themselves. But their adult parent, guardian or spouse can buy it for them.

""It does happen,"" commission spokeswoman Carolyn Beck said of parent-supervised drinking in public places. They hear occasional complaints, especially in divorce situations in which someone objects to a former spouse getting alcohol for their child.

Texas has some ""dry"" counties and cities that prohibit some or all alcohol sales, but there’s still a way for underage drinkers to tip one legally, Beck said. At private clubs in dry areas, adult members can get served and in turn can provide booze to their children, under the same law that applies at bars.

Ohio: Sales to underage drinkers are allowed if they are supervised by a parent, a spouse who is not an underage person, or a legal guardian. Tavern owners can allow underage drinking on premises if one of those persons gives the liquor or beer to the underage person and is present when they drink it, according to the Ohio Division of Liquor Control and state statutes.

Bartenders can refuse to serve these drinkers if they want to. As in Wisconsin, no minimum age is specified.

 Montana:  An exception to Montana’s underage drinking law allows a person under 21 to receive a ""non-intoxicating quantity"" (less than 0.5 percent of alcohol by volume) from that person’s parent or guardian. It doesn’t rule out that happening in licensed drinking establishments. But it’s a legal gray area because another law contradicts that and the exception is not clearly written. No minimum age is specified.

The state’s Liquor Control Division suggests that minors not be served; the office is trying to change the law to rule out such sales on licensed premises.

So that’s the quick tour.

We asked Julia Sherman, coordinator for the Wisconsin Alcohol Policy Project at the University of Wisconsin Law School, to describe Wisconsin’s relative position among the states on this.

She said Wisconsin’s statute is ""out of the mainstream"" in allowing drinking under such circumstances.

""Ours is clearly extremely broad,"" Sherman said.

But it doesn’t stand alone.

Our rating

A health advocacy group pushing to tighten up drinking laws said Wisconsin is ""the only state that allows parents or guardians to purchase alcohol for their children – regardless of whether that child is seven or 20 years old – at bars and restaurants.""

We found less than a handful of states that allow that, but a few others do. So Wisconsin’s law is not unique.

Emails, blog posts claim Mitt Romney got zero votes in some Greater Cleveland precincts
","
Election night results showed Barack Obama topped Mitt Romney in Ohio by a margin of 2 percentage points, but the distribution of votes was much less even than that split.

Romney won 72 of Ohio's 88 counties, including two that no Republican had won since 1972.

""On a map depicting the 2012 outcome, Ohio would be a sea of red with islands of blue,"" The Plain Dealer reported.

Obama's margin of victory was provided by Democratic strongholds like Cuyahoga County. In some areas, his tally was so lopsided that the numbers caused disbelief.

Readers asked PolitiFact Ohio to check into the accuracy of chain emails and blog and Facebook postings about Romney’s performance in some Cuyahoga County precincts.

""Mitt Romney received exactly zero votes in at least 12 Cuyahoga County precincts,"" one email said. Others made similar claims, citing 9 or 21 or some other number of precincts, depending on the source.

The emails and postings variously described the numbers as ""strange,"" ""disturbing,"" ""bizarre,"" ""alarming"" and ""unprecedented,"" and some questioned whether the figures indicated impropriety.

So just what do the election numbers show? Did Obama indeed pitch a shutout in a dozen precincts?

PolitiFact Ohio started with the unofficial returns posted by the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections for the county's 1,077 precincts.

The table shows that Romney received no votes in 17 precincts in Cleveland. Romney also was shut out in one precinct in East Cleveland. That's 18 total precincts in Cuyahoga County where Romney received no votes.

Romney got just one vote in each of 20 precincts in Cleveland, two precincts in East Cleveland and two precincts in Warrensville Heights. And he got just two votes in each of 28 other precincts in Cleveland, East Cleveland and Highland Hills.

Some online postings about the election results linked to a Plain Dealer article by data analysis editor Rich Exner.

Exner told us that one sentence in the article was cited in a number of postings and emails to him: ""The vote, incredibly, was unanimous in Obama's favor in nine Cleveland precincts."" (Because third-party candidates received votes in the eight other Cleveland precincts where Romney received none, those weren't unanimous.)

Some of the blogs and emails interpreted his use of the word ""incredibly"" as meaning ""not credible"" and therefore not true.

Not so, says Exner.

""I used the word in the sense of 'amazingly' or 'strange but true,' as in 'Incredibly, he was still alive' -- meaning 'it's amazing' and 'he was alive,' not that it's not true.

""The vote was lopsided, but it was believable.""

In his checks around the state, Exner found lopsided tallies for Obama in other urban areas, including precincts with no votes for Romney in Cincinnati (Hamilton County) and Dayton (Montgomery County).

PolitiFact Ohio also checked the 2008 results for Cuyahoga County. We found that John McCain got no votes in 18 precincts then, or the same total that denied any votes to Romney.

CBS News took note of the shutout precincts in Cuyahoga County while reporting that Romney also received no votes in 59 voting divisions in Philadelphia.

""Incredulous Republicans might be tempted to indict voter fraud as a culprit,"" the CBS story said, but ""the reality is less salacious than the conspiracy theory - a consequence of demography, not electoral shenanigans. Most big cities are heavily Democratic to begin with, and geographic patterns of racial segregation may yield an even more one-sided electoral result in certain areas than in the city as a whole.""

All the Cuyahoga County precincts in which Romney was shut out are in neighborhoods with heavily African-American or Latino populations.

An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in August underlines the significance of that demographic. It showed Obama leading by a 2-to-1 margin among Hispanic voters and had his support at 94 percent among black voters, with zero percent favoring Romney. Six percent said they were undecided or had no opinion. None of the poll's 120 black respondents picked Romney.

An election day exit poll by NBC News found that black voters in Ohio picked Obama over Romney by 96 percent to 3 percent. That percentage matches the spread by which Obama won in Cleveland precincts east of the Cuyahoga River.

For more perspective, PolitiFact Ohio turned to an authority on voting in Cleveland: Mark Salling, senior fellow in the Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University and director of its Northern Ohio Data & Information Service since 1981. He is also Ohio’s liaison to the Census Bureau for its redistricting data programs.

Salling cited census data that showed more than 90 percent of the voting age population is black in 15 of the 17 Cleveland precincts in which Romney received no votes.

""Using standard measures of probability, given the overall distribution of percentages in the county's precincts,"" he said, ""I find that a zero percent vote for Romney, though somewhat unlikely, is also entirely feasible.""

Conversely, he said, those same demographics suggest it is ""virtually impossible Obama would receive zero votes"" in the county’s precincts. It may be surprising that no Romney votes were found in some precincts, Salling told us, ""but it is a far reach to suggest  fraud as the explanation.""

The claim that Mitt Romney received no votes in more than a dozen precincts in Cleveland may seem amazing. But voting history, registration, demographics and statistical analysis say it is both feasible and credible. The Board of Elections says it is actually understated.

Sanders twists Bloomberg’s record on tax hikes and cuts to Medicare and Social Security
","As Bernie Sanders moved on to Nevada after winning the most votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, he aimed some sharp barbs at a rival who isn’t competing in Nevada’s caucuses — former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. ""We will not defeat Donald Trump with a candidate who opposed modest proposals during Barack Obama’s presidency to raise taxes on the wealthy, while advocating for cuts to Medicare and Social Security,"" Sanders said at a large rally in Las Vegas Feb. 15. Did Bloomberg oppose tax hikes on the wealthy while supporting cuts to Medicare and Social Security? It’s not quite the way Sanders presented it. Here’s what the record shows. The Sanders campaign pointed to two moments in 2012 when Bloomberg opposed a tax hike on wealthy New Yorkers and supported cuts in Medicare and Social Security.  While mayor in October 2012, Bloomberg, no longer a mayoral candidate himself, dismissed plans from the leading New York City mayoral contenders to raise taxes on the most well-off. ""If you want to drive out the 1% of the people that pay roughly 50% of the taxes, or the 10% of the people that pay 70-odd percent of the taxes, that's as good a strategy as I know,"" Bloomberg told reporters. ""Our revenue would go away, and we wouldn't be able to have cops to keep us safe, firefighters to rescue us, teachers to educate our kids."" This was no one-off position. Bloomberg had opposed higher taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers since at least 2009. But Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser said that overlooks what Bloomberg did when he first became mayor in 2002. ""Mike’s response comes in the context of having drastically raised taxes on wealthy New Yorkers, both personal income tax and property taxes,"" Loeser said. New York City has an income tax and rates on the wealthiest varied but ended up higher during Bloomberg’s stint as mayor from 2002 to 2013. A report from the city’s Office of Management and Budget shows that people making over $500,000 a year saw their tax rate go from 3.648% in 2002, to 4.45% in 2003 through 2005. That was temporary. (Households making over $100,000 also saw a temporary increase.) In 2006, the rate returned to 3.648%. Then in 2010 — for all of New York State — it rose again to 3.846%. ""Bloomberg was not anti-tax across the board,"" said Maria Doulis, vice president of the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission. ""He recognized the combined state and local taxes were very high in New York City and put the city at a competitive disadvantage. He would argue that if you needed to raise revenues, do it another way."" Doulis also said that tax policy at the city level is quite different from tax policy at the national level. In a December 2012 op-ed, Bloomberg argued for a grand deal to begin to dial down the nation’s deficits. Unlike his stand on taxes in New York City, this concerned the entire country, and as part of a package deal, Bloomberg voiced support for higher taxes on well-to-do Americans. ""There have been signs that Congress and the White House are beginning to move toward an agreement that would include modest tax increases and spending cuts, as well as a commitment to enact broader-based tax and entitlement reforms in 2013,"" Bloomberg wrote. ""While the tax revenue and entitlement cuts being discussed are both less than what I and many others believe are necessary to maximize long-term growth, the specifics of the deal are to some extent less important than the act of getting one."" The context here was deficit negotiations between President Barack Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner. The exact terms were never fully hammered out, but basically, Obama agreed that if Republicans backed tax hikes, he would go along with trims to future Medicare and Social Security spending. ""Every version of the negotiated ‘grand bargain’ included tax increases on the rich,"" said Marc Goldwein with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates deficit reductions. ""Rich"" was understood to include people making over $250,000 a year. Goldwein said that Bloomberg’s words show he supported higher taxes on the wealthy as part of a package that cut Medicare and Social Security spending.  Bloomberg’s current policy is to expand Medicare and increase Social Security’s minimum benefits. His tax plan would increase taxes on the well-to-do. Sanders said Bloomberg opposed modest increases in taxes on the wealthy while advocating cuts in Medicare and Social Security. While Bloomberg did speak against tax hikes inside New York City and encouraged cuts in Medicare and Social Security, several factors make it misleading to put the statements side by side. When Bloomberg talked about trimming Medicare and Social Security, he also favored tax increases on wealthier Americans. That undermines Sanders’ claim. There were times when Bloomberg spoke out against tax increases on wealthier New Yorkers, but at other times he was prepared to raise taxes on them.  We rate this claim Mostly False. UPDATE, Feb. 20: After we published, the Sanders campaign sent us additional examples of Bloomberg rejecting tax hikes at the national level and advocating for cuts in entitlements. For example, in 2011, asked point blank if he would raise taxes on the wealthy, Bloomberg said, ""No, because I just think this economy nationwide is at a point where it really could go either way."" But in the same interview, Bloomberg also said that both sides in the deficit reduction debate were right to propose raising taxes on those making over $250,000, and spending cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Bloomberg said the majority of the money ""is going to come from the wealthy."" And then he added, ""you have to do it with meaningful cuts done in a time frame that is believable."" The constant theme is that when Bloomberg talked about cutting Medicare and Social Security it was in the context of deficit reduction. And his plan for the deficit included tax hikes. To be sure, if he had his way, those increases would fall on both middle class and wealthy families, but he wouldn’t exempt the wealthy. Our ruling remains Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/feb/18/bernie-sanders/sanders-twists-bloombergs-record-tax-hikes-and-cut/

Mike Bloomberg opposed a minimum wage increase in 2015. He supports one now
","U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders welcomed Democratic rival Mike Bloomberg into the thick of the presidential primary with a slew of attacks on the former New York City mayor’s moderate record. Speaking at a gathering of Democrats in Nevada, Sanders contrasted his own consistent support for raising the minimum wage with Bloomberg’s on-the-record opposition. ""We will not defeat Donald Trump with a candidate who in 2015 stated, and I quote: ‘I, for example, am not in favor, have never been in favor of raising the minimum wage,’"" Sanders said. We wondered if that was true, and it is. It’s worth clarifying that this is no longer Bloomberg’s position in 2020.  Bloomberg supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, up from $7.25, putting him in line with the rest of his primary opponents. RELATED: Who led the way for a $15 minimum wage in New York? RELATED: Fact-checking Bernie Sanders on a $15 minimum wage In 2015, Bloomberg spoke against raising the minimum wage: ""I, for example, am not in favor, have never been in favor of raising the minimum wage,"" Bloomberg said on the Bloomberg TV channel. (Sanders quoted him accurately.) Bloomberg went on to describe what he would support: raising the Earned Income Tax Credit. Doing so, he said, would reduce the burden on employers and protect jobs. ""I think you should raise the income tax credit, which does the same thing for the same people, but it spreads the burden across all the taxpayers rather than just a small number of businesspeople whose inclination would be to cut back employment. Earned Income Tax Credit doesn’t get anybody to cut back, it gets them to hire more people."" The federal Earned Income Tax Credit reduces taxes for low- and moderate-income working people. About 29 states have passed their own earned-income tax credit. While mayor in 2004, Bloomberg signed legislation starting a local tax credit. In 2018, Bloomberg again called for using the tax credit rather than hiking the minimum wage. During an interview with Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund, he repeated his concern that a hike in the minimum wage would lead to job losses. (The Congressional Budget Office has found far more people would receive wage hikes than likely lose their jobs under a national increase to $15 an hour.)  Bloomberg’s support for the tax credit rather than a rise in the minimum wage is shared by some experts. However, others say the two policies can work in tandem, and both could help poor workers. While Bloomberg spoke broadly against a minimum wage increase, in 2012 he did support raising the minimum wage in New York to $8.25 an hour. Also, Bloomberg had a mixed record on living-wage proposals to lift wages of certain workers who were employed by entities that had city contracts. When Bloomberg opposed such measures, he raised concerns about the cost for the city or the impact on economic development. During his 2020 campaign for president, Bloomberg has called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. He also calls for enhancing the tax credit. Bloomberg’s labor plan says he will sign the Raise the Wage Act, which would raise the minimum wage gradually over six years to $15 an hour. The bill passed the House in July 2019 and has not had a vote in the Senate. The Bloomberg campaign did not explain the change of position. Bloomberg has not publicly addressed it, as far as we can tell. Sanders quoted Bloomberg as saying in 2015 that he had never supported raising the minimum wage.  Bloomberg did make that statement. He called for raising the Earned Income Tax Credit instead.  Bloomberg changed his position in 2020. He now supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over six years.

Prosecutor releasing 90 murderers in Michigan? That's misleading

The article is about Ingham County Prosecutor Carol Siemon, a Democrat elected in 2016 who campaigned on making progressive changes in the criminal justice system. She previously served for 11 years as an assistant prosecutor in the office. The headline of the article, which blasts Siemon as being ""on a mission to empty her community’s local prison,"" suggests that the prosecutor wants to free the 90 killers and is moving to do so.  But the article itself says only that Siemon will begin a review of the 90 cases. The article is based on a story from City Pulse, a news operation based in Lansing, the state capital, which is located partly in Ingham County. (The county seat, Mason, is about 15 miles away.)  But the article’s headline goes further, suggesting that the prosecutor is seeking the release of 90 inmates. City Pulse reported: ""Siemon — with pro-bono help from former Assistant Attorney General Ron Emery — this year plans to begin a formal review of the 90 convicted murderers serving life in prison without parole in Ingham County. And for a select few, she said she plans to seek a gubernatorial commutation that could get them back out on the streets. In Michigan, only the governor has the power to commute the inmates’ sentences, if they are recommended for release by the state Parole Board, according to Siemon and news reports. Several days after the City Pulse story was published, Siemon released a statement saying she regretted not speaking beforehand to the families of people who could be affected by her decision to review the cases. But she said she would go ahead with her review, which would focus on cases from the 1970s and 1980s. ""I regret that I did not fully take into account the impact on victims and their families when I prematurely discussed the concept of reviewing older cases of life-without-parole,"" Siemon said. ""My intent has always been that the victim’s families or their representatives would get their first notice from trained professionals in our office after any review and before offering support or opposition to any application to commute a sentence. A Facebook post links to an article with a headline that claimed: ""Michigan prosecutor looks to release 90 convicted murderers serving life sentences.""

Attempt to link Mitt Romney to alleged 'recruiter' of accused sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein misleading
","Before Sen. Mitt Romney made history as the lone Republican to vote to convict President Donald Trump at Trump’s impeachment trial, he became the target of social media smears. One attack linked the Utah senator to Ghislaine Maxwell, the woman who allegedly recruited girls and young women for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. The Jan. 29 post is a screengrab of what appears to be a news story or blog post featuring a photo of Maxwell. It reads, in all-caps: ""Epstein’s recruiter Ghislaine Maxwell’s father Robert Maxwell gave Mitt Romney his first $2M investment and started him in business."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim has an element of truth, but is misleading. The body of Robert Maxwell, a British publishing baron, was found floating in the Atlantic after he went missing off his private yacht in November 1991 and the circumstances have remained mysterious. He was an early investor in Romney’s first investment fund at the Bain Capital firm, which was pivotal in Romney’s later political career.  But Romney had already established himself in business by the time Robert Maxwell gave him money — and Maxwell’s investment was not the first in the fund. Epstein, a disgraced financier, was accused of sexually abusing and trafficking underage girls. He committed suicide by hanging himself in a New York City jail cell Aug. 10. Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, is the Oxford-educated daughter of Robert Maxwell. Her father's business empire collapsed following his death, according to ABC News, which did a series on Epstein. Ghislaine Maxwell moved to New York and became Epstein’s girlfriend. Her whereabouts are unknown.  Ghislaine Maxwell allegedly helped recruit girls for Epstein and is being sued, along with Epstein’s estate, by three women who say they were among the victims.  The post we’re checking shows a headline from an article on JohnBWellsNews.com, whose slogan is ""Making The News Great Again."" That article links to a July 2012 article in The Telegraph, a London-based news organization.  The Telegraph reported that after Romney set up the Boston consulting firm Bain Capital in 1984, Robert Maxwell invested $2 million in Romney's first private equity fund, a fund that ""launched (Romney’s) controversial career in finance."" The same day, the Los Angeles Times reported that the fund had been seeded with $12 million from Bain partners and that Maxwell’s $2 million was one of the early, but certainly not the first, outside investments. After Maxwell’s death, investigators discovered Maxwell had stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from his company's pension funds. Romney’s fund was invested in startup companies and leveraged buyouts. It paid out an average of 173% in average annual returns over a decade and was the ""start of the private equity powerhouse that ultimately fueled Romney’s political career,"" the Times said. Romney was established in business before starting the fund. He worked for two years at the Boston Consulting Group and six years at the Bain & Company consulting firm before co-founding the new firm-within-a-firm, Bain Capital, in 1984. A Facebook post claims that Robert Maxwell — the father of the woman who allegedly recruited girls and young women for sexual exploitation by Jeffrey Epstein — gave Mitt Romney ""his first $2 million investment and got him started in business."" The $2 million from Maxwell did not start Romney in business. Romney had eight years of business experience before co-founding the Bain Capital investment firm.

""Just last year, De Niro decided to slam President Trump and dub him a sexual predator. He went so far as to call Trump ‘a dog,’"" the post reads. ""Now the tables have severely turned around.

Previously, in a story from February 1998, Lichfield wrote that De Niro had been questioned by French police in connection to the prostitution ring investigation.  Lichfield also reported that De Niro’s lawyer said he found the way his client was treated shocking and upsetting given ""(De Niro’s) name came up only incidentally"" in the investigation.   Lichfield was not the only source to report that De Niro had been questioned. The Irish Times’ Lara Marlowe also reported in February 1998 that De Niro was detained at the Bristol Hotel in Paris and questioned for about nine hours due to his connection with an international prostitution ring that had been under investigation since 1996.  Marlowe’s story said officials ""stressed"" De Niro was questioned as a potential witness, and Lichfield said the police were clear that De Niro was never arrested.

No, Trump didn’t sign a bill returning prayer to schools
","After President Donald Trump made an announcement about school prayer in January, a video on Facebook exaggerated the impact of his actions. ""President Trump signs bill returning prayer in schools,"" said the headline of one video by Eyes Open Media. The narrator said that prayer in school is no longer banned. ""Donald Trump just put prayer back in schools,"" the narrator said. The video is misleading because Trump’s announcement doesn’t change the status quo. Since prayer wasn’t banned at schools before Trump’s announcement, it’s not possible that he returned prayer to schools. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On National Religious Freedom Day, Jan. 16, 2020, Trump announced constitutional guidance on school prayer, which was posted by the U.S. Education Department. The video called the document a ""bill,"" which it isn’t.  A bill would require congressional action. Trump said he was ""announcing historic steps to protect the First Amendment right to pray in public schools. So you have the right to pray."" This guidance was not ""historic,"" as there was a similar one issued in 2003 during President George W. Bush’s tenure. Both guidance documents explain that students may pray when not engaged in school activities or instruction and that teachers in their official capacities can’t encourage or discourage prayer, or actively participate in prayer with students.  We sent a copy of the 2003 and 2020 guidance documents to Richard Layton, associate professor of religion at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Layton found no significant shift in the legal terrain. He found modest differences, most notably that the 2020 document expands on reporting requirements related to complaints. ""This seems to be potentially a mechanism that will support more aggressive intervention into state and local educational policies/practices,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, the main purpose of the new guidelines seems to be to advertise to Christian communities that the administration will advocate for them."" The ACLU concluded that both the 2003 and 2020 guidance documents ""affirm a core constitutional protection: School officials are prohibited from imposing their faith on students."" The Freedom From Religion Foundation concluded that the guidance ""reiterates the state of law."" To be clear, religion has not been banned from public schools. In 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that school-sponsored or state-organized prayer violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. But the decision does not prohibit prayer or religious expression at school.  RELATED FACT-CHECK: Rafael Cruz, father of Ted Cruz, says 'everybody prayed,' read Bible at schools prior to 1962 A video on Facebook said, ""President Trump signs bill returning prayer in schools."" Trump didn’t sign a bill; his administration issued a guidance. But that guidance didn’t return prayer to schools.

Does North Carolina have one of the most lenient voter ID laws in the US?
","When it comes to voter identification, North Carolina’s efforts have stopped and stalled over the course of the decade. In 2013, the state enacted a law requiring voters to present photo ID at the polls. But in 2016, the law was struck down by a federal appeals court.  In 2018, state lawmakers put the idea of photo ID on the November ballot. Voters supported the measure, so the GOP-controlled legislature approved a new law that December. Fast forward to the present day. A federal court blocked the state’s new law in order to hear arguments that the law would deter black and Latino residents.  Republicans responded with outrage, arguing that their law provides ample opportunity for voters to acquire proper identification. In a press release, House Speaker Tim Moore described the law as ""one of the nation’s most lenient voter ID laws – which 34 states already have."" Is it true that North Carolina has one of the ""most lenient voter ID laws"" in the country? Not quite. In the context of requiring identification at the polls, specific words are extremely important. The term ""voter ID"" is an all-encompassing description that could refer to any form of identification, photo or not.  For this fact check, we relied heavily on information from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan group that tracks state laws.  The NCSL says there are 36 states that have voter ID laws, but only about half of those states require voters to display a form of photo ID. (In Ohio, for instance, voters can show a utility bill or bank statement, among other things.) The NCSL separates photo ID laws from other voter ID laws, then describes each law as ""strict"" or ""non-strict."" The NCSL considers states to have ""non-strict"" photo ID laws if they offer voters more than one way to cast their ballot without showing photo ID. We found that North Carolina’s photo ID law is lenient compared to other photo ID laws -- but not compared to the 18 states with  ID laws that don’t require a photo ID. When it comes to photo ID states, seven have strict laws and 11 states have non-strict laws. Even though its not currently being implemented, North Carolina’s photo ID law falls into the ""non-strict"" category, said Wendy Underhill, a spokeswoman for the NCSL. The Tar Heel state’s law would require voters to show a photo ID at the polls, but it gives voters several options for compliance.  For instance, if the photo ID law were in place and a North Carolinian showed up to vote without a photo ID, he or she would be allowed to fill out a ""Reasonable Impediment Declaration Form."" The voter would be exempt from the law if the county elections board found that the voter had: An inability to obtain photo identification due to lack of transportation,  A disability or illness,  Lacked a birth certificate or other underlying documents required,  Been prevented from acquiring an ID due to work schedule or family responsibilities;  lost their photo ID or had it stolen;  Or they applied for a photo ID but hadn’t received it yet. If none of these scenarios were the case, the voter could write an explanation that would be reviewed by the local elections board. North Carolina’s photo ID law also offers options that several other ""non-strict"" states don’t. PolitiFact reviewed the following laws with Underhill. Unlike NC, South Dakota doesn’t accept military and veteran cards. Unlike NC, Michigan doesn’t accept passports. Unlike NC, South Carolina doesn’t accept student ID cards.  Michigan and Florida specifically require the ID to be ""current."" Rhode Island only allows IDs expired for six months while North Carolina allows one year. Among states that require photo ID at the polls, North Carolina may indeed have one of the most lenient laws. But remember: that’s not what Moore claimed. Moore said North Carolina’s voter ID law is ""one of the nation’s most lenient voter ID laws – which 34 states already have."" That indicates he’s comparing NC’s law to non-photo ID states. And in that sense, Moore’s claim is inaccurate. For some people, having to acquire a photo ID is a burden, said Ted Shaw, Julius L. Chambers Distinguished Professor of Law and Director of the UNC Center for Civil Rights. Shaw is also the former Director-Counsel and President of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. And the requirement alone -- even with the reasonable impediment provision -- might be enough to keep some people from voting, he said. Shaw noted that 25 percent of black voters lack government-issued photo IDs -- a claim PolitiFact has found to be Mostly True.  Even if North Carolina offers photo ID cards for free, Shaw said some people don’t have the documents that might be needed to secure those cards. ""Take birth certificates. My grandmother searched for years for her birth certificate. The courthouse burned down when she was young,"" Shaw said. Compared to other photo IDs, North Carolina’s law might look lenient on paper. But it’s hard to tell just how well it might work without seeing it put to the test, said Max Feldman, counsel for the Voting Rights and Elections Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. Citing a Caltech/MIT study, the ACLU says photo ID laws are sometimes enforced in a discriminatory manner. The study ""found that minority voters are more frequently questioned about ID than are white voters,"" the ACLU says. ""I think the reasonable impediment declaration is a distinguishing characteristic,"" Feldman said of North Carolina’s law. ""The inclusion of student IDs is also good,"" he said. ""But it depends on how the law will be implemented."" Moore described the law as ""one of the nation’s most lenient voter ID laws – which 34 states already have."" This is misleading because it gives the impression that 34 other states have photo ID laws like North Carolina’s. But that’s not true.  North Carolina’s law is lenient compared to other states that require photo IDs. But not compared to the 18 states that don’t require photo IDs.  Moore’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/feb/17/tim-moore/does-north-carolina-have-one-most-lenient-voter-id/

No, the Ku Klux Klan has not endorsed Trump for 2020
","A reader suggested we check a Facebook post that showed a poorly constructed image of President Donald Trump next to two people in what appear to be Ku Klux Klan robes and hoods.  Below the image was this headline:  ""The KKK officially endorses Trump 2020."" The post is from a March 2019 article on NPC Daily, which includes another photo of what appears to be Trump with hooded KKK members. The letters ""NPC"" stand for the author of the site, Neville Percival Croft. And the klansmen photo is from artist Alison Jackson, who uses celebrity lookalikes for her work. A bio box for Croft below the NPC article ends with a disclaimer:  ""This entire site is satire."" Former KKK leader David Duke of Louisiana in 2016 publicly endorsed Trump’s candidacy for president. Trump at the time received criticism for not disavowing Duke’s support when asked about it on CNN by journalist Jake Tapper. Days later, Trump issued a tweet about the matter saying, ""I disavow."" Trump has been criticized for not condemning white nationalists, such as when he said there was ""blame on both sides"" after a 2017 white nationalist rally and counterprotest in Charlottesville, Va., turned violent. But there is no indication that Trump has received the official endorsement of the KKK, which, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, has become less visible and more fractured in recent years compared with other movements propelled by white supremicist thought.  
An image shared on social media claimed: ""The KKK officially endorses Trump 2020."" The image is from a March 2019 article on a website that publishes only satire. While Trump was infamously endorsed by a former KKK leader in 2016, we do not find evidence that the organization has issued a formal endorsement of the president in his run for reelection in 2020.  We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2020/feb/17/facebook-posts/image-shared-facebook-claims-ku-klux-klan-endorsed/

Fact-checking Facebook post on Amy Klobuchar, refugee resettlement
","Sen. Amy Klobuchar gained voter and pundit attention after the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary debate, and that spotlight continues on Facebook. ""Amy Klobuchar vows to resettle 500 percent more refugees, none in her neighborhood,"" said a Feb. 12 Facebook post from Breitbart, a right-leaning news site. This post, which is an image of a headline from Breitbart, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook account provides a link in its comments to a story on Breitbart. The part about the 500% overall increase needs context, and the story does not prove that Klobuchar vowed to exclude her Minneapolis neighborhood from resettlements. The Breitbart story makes a reference to a line in Klobuchar’s presidential campaign website. It says she would, ""direct the State Department to restore the refugee admissions cap to at least its pre-Trump Administration level."" It does not specify a number. A president has the authority to determine, in consultation with Congress, the maximum number of refugees that will be allowed into the United States per fiscal year. (The cap represents the top number that will be allowed in and does not necessarily mean that many people will be admitted.) Refugees are legally admitted into the United States after demonstrating they were persecuted or fear persecution due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Refugees undergo extensive vetting before arriving in the United States. Refugee resettlement agencies try to work on the local level, placing refugees wherever they have family or close friends and where it’s believed that they’ll have the best opportunity to do well; presidents don’t designate what neighborhoods refugees go to. The refugee admissions ceiling set by President Barack Obama fluctuated over his years as president, averaging 80,125. The highest ceiling he set was for fiscal year 2017, at 110,000. A week into his presidency, President Donald Trump ordered that the refugee admissions ceiling set by Obama for 2017 be reduced to 50,000. (Ultimately, 53,716 refugees arrived that year.) From fiscal years 2018 to 2020, the cap set by Trump averaged 31,000. The lowest ceiling was for 2020, at 18,000 refugees. The Breitbart post on Klobuchar reaches a 500% increase by comparing Trump’s lowest and most recent ceiling, 18,000, to Obama’s highest and final ceiling, 110,000. Trump entered the White House promising to limit legal immigration and his refugee admissions ceilings have decreased year after year, setting record lows. Breitbart’s story headline and Facebook post both say: ""Amy Klobuchar vows to resettle 500 percent more refugees, none in her neighborhood."" Klobuchar has not said she would reject refugees from settling in her neighborhood. A representative for Breitbart said in an email that PolitiFact is ""misinterpreting"" the headline. ""We never say that Senator Klobuchar has vowed not to resettle refugees in her neighborhood, rather we said she vowed to resettle 500% more refugees,"" wrote Elizabeth Moore, vice president of public relations and communications at Breitbart News Network. The Breitbart story is less assertive than its headline, saying that thousands of refugees have resettled in Minneapolis, but ""almost none"" in Klobuchar’s Marcy-Holmes neighborhood. Publicly available State Department data on refugee resettlement also is not broken down by neighborhoods; the most localized data available is by city. So we asked Breitbart for more information. Moore said ""it is safe to conclude that likely no refugees"" would be resettled in Klobuchar’s neighborhood because over roughly the last decade, no refugees from China, India, Korea, Germany, Thailand, and Malaysia have resettled in Minneapolis. (Moore said she was highlighting those six countries because the majority of the foreign-born population in Klobuchar’s neighborhood came from there.) Most refugees coming into the United States in recent years are not from the six countries flagged by Breitbart. At least since 2000, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burma, Syria, and Iraq are among the top countries of nationality of refugee arrivals. A Facebook post from Breitbart said, ""Amy Klobuchar vows to resettle 500 percent more refugees, none in her neighborhood."" Klobuchar wants to let in more refugees than Trump has, but she has not specified how many refugees she would allow into the United States per year. Breitbart reached a 500% increase by comparing the 2017 admissions cap set by Obama (the highest and final cap he set) and the 2020 cap set by Trump (the lowest and most recent admissions cap set). Klobuchar has not said she would deny refugee resettlement in her neighborhood. And the resettlement process is determined not by presidents but by resettlement agencies that take into consideration where the refugees may have family, friends or other factors that could aid in their success. This Facebook post is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Trump cited 'serious economic conditions' in reducing federal worker pay raises
","In spite of how often President Donald Trump trumpets the strength of the U.S. economy, he’s being accused of reducing pay raises for federal employees and blaming the economy for it. ""Breaking: Trump just cut the scheduled federal pay raise, stating that he can’t do it now because of ‘serious economic conditions’ in America,"" claims the Feb. 13 post. It ends with: ""#ImpeachTrumpAgain."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s pretty much on target. On Feb. 10, 2020, six days after declaring in his State of the Union address ""that our economy is the best it has ever been,"" Trump announced he was reducing across-the-board pay increases for civilian federal employees that are scheduled to take effect in January 2021.  Instead of being 2.5%, the raises will be 1%.  A yearly adjustment of paychecks based on the region of the country where a worker is posted was also to take effect in January 2020, but Trump decided those salaries would remain at 2020 levels. Trump cited in his message to Congress his legal authority to make the changes ""because of ‘national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare.’"" That phrasing is from the federal law that gives him the authority. He added this, however: ""We must maintain efforts to put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course; Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases."" Trump’s order is not necessarily the final word, however. Congress could pass a spending bill that includes a federal pay raise. Such a bill would be subject to a possible veto from Trump. A Facebook post says: ""Trump just cut the scheduled federal pay raise, stating that he can’t do it now because of ‘serious economic conditions’ in America."" Trump reduced to 1% from 2.5% across-the-board raises for civilian federal employees, citing his authority under a law that allows for such changes due to ""national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare."" More specifically, Trump cited spending concerns in reducing the raise.

Milwaukee Mayor Barrett on target with housing creation claim
","Seeking his fifth term as mayor, Tom Barrett has focused on bringing more jobs and housing to Milwaukee, among other issues.  On the campaign trail, and again in his Feb. 10. 2020 State of the City address, Barrett has touted his 10,000 Homes Initiative, announced in 2018, which aims to increase affordable housing availability in the city by building or improving 10,000 housing units within 10 years. That reminded us of a claim from his Nov. 20, 2019 campaign launch we wanted to check. ""I am more optimistic now than I have ever been about the future of our city,"" Barrett said during that speech, before touting various accomplishments. ""It’s about building for the future of this city. We’ve done so by creating homes, 7,000 homes."" The issue of housing in Milwaukee has also entered the mayoral race. Primary opponents, including state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, have criticized Barrett’s record on housing.  Is Barrett, first elected in April 2004, correct that 7,000 homes have been created since he took office? Let’s take a look. When asked for the evidence to back up the claim, Barrett’s staff directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a Department of City Development (DCD) report.  The report shows that as of October 2019, a total of 7,261 affordable housing units had been developed since Barrett took office in 2004. Of those, 690 were downtown and 6,571 were outside downtown. All are rental units. ""The majority are apartments located in both newly-constructed buildings and existing buildings, including offices, manufacturing space, warehouses and vacant schools that have been redeveloped into apartments,"" said Martha Brown, deputy DCD commissioner, in an email. ""The total also includes several hundred new single-family homes, and both one- and two-family vacant houses that have been completely rehabilitated and made available as affordable rental housing."" Milwaukee housing changes Map shows the change in the number of residential properties in each aldermanic district from 2004 to 2019. Design: Eric Litke, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
Source: Wisconsin Elections Commission  According to Brown, the developments were financed with federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits allocated by the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority.  Under the program units are deemed affordable based on a variety of factors, but can’t go to anyone making more than 60% of the median income for the area. For a family of four, the cut-off would be $49,380. In many cases, the apartments are earmarked for those making an even smaller percentage of the median income. Brown also noted that Habitat for Humanity develops affordable housing for homeownership and those units were not included in DCD’s count. Brian Sonderman, executive director of Habitat for Humanity Milwaukee, said since 1984 the group has built or rehabbed 620 single-family homes and has assisted more than 700 additional families through affordable home repair and loan assistance. ""We believe affordable homeownership is key to helping local families build strength, stability and independence,"" Sonderman said in an email. Sonderman said the city has helped the process with acquisition as well as funding. For instance, the city may sell vacant lots to the group for $1 each. Habitat also receives federal grant money allocated through the city. So, by the numbers, Barrett is on target. Is there anything else to consider? Residential vs. apartments According to the city Assessor’s Office, the count of residential properties as reported on the city’s 2004 Statement of Assessment (the year Barrett was elected) was 135,352. The number from 2019 showed 137,098 parcels. But that figure accounts for only residential housing and condos, not the apartments that are the focus of the tax credit program.  In August 2019, Mike Ruzicka, president of the Greater Milwaukee Association of Realtors, sent a letter to community leaders in Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties urging officials to think twice before approving more apartment projects. ""Greater Milwaukee is following a trend seen across the country,"" he wrote. ""Numerous multifamily units are being built at the expense of owner-occupied condominium and single-family units.""  Indeed, at the same time the city has been adding affordable housing units, it has been busy bulldozing derelict ones.  Between April 1, 2004 and Oct. 31, 2019, some 3,542 units were razed by the city, and 3,123 razed privately, for a total of 6,665 units razed, according to the city Department of Neighborhood Services. ""These are not places where people live; and in many instances, removal of these blighted structures spurs additional neighborhood revitalization and growth,"" said Christina Klose, a department spokeswoman.   Our ruling  Barrett said since he took office, the city has seen the creation of 7,000 new affordable housing units. The numbers back him up: Through affordable housing programs, 7,261 units have been created since Barrett took office. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2020/feb/17/tom-barrett/milwaukee-mayor-barrett-target-housing-creation-cl/
