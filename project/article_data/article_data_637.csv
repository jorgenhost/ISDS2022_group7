It's not welfare
","


 
(Published Oct. 21, 2008)
 
A new Web ad from John McCain's campaign features the ubiquitous Joe the Plumber and attacks Barack Obama’s tax plan as ""welfare.""
 
""Obama raises taxes on seniors (and) hard-working families to give welfare to those who pay none,"" the announcer says.
 
In the background is the phrase ""$100-billion to those that pay no taxes.""
 
There are a number of misleading things packed into a tight space here.
 
McCain's claim that Obama's plan will translate to higher taxes for seniors and working families is grossly misleading. As we have pointed out

many times

, that’s only true if a senior or a family is making more than $250,000 a year, or $200,000 for a single person. Otherwise, it’s generally not the case.
 
Here we will focus on the claim from the ad — repeated by McCain in recent stump speeches — that Obama’s tax plan amounts to welfare.
 
First, McCain is targeting Obama’s plan to enact a number of refundable tax credits. Refundable means the government sends a check if the taxes owed are less than zero. Among the refundable tax credits proposed by Obama:
 
• Under the Making Work Pay plan, a tax credit for wage earners of up to $500.
 
• A mortgage credit equal to 10 percent of mortgage interest for nonitemizers, up to a maximum credit of $800.
 
• A refundable higher education tax credit for the first $4,000 of qualifying higher education expenses.
 
Obama also has proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit for some; as well as the child and dependent care credit.
 
The McCain campaign cites a

report

from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center as evidence that Obama's tax plan would amount to more government giveaways. The Tax Policy Center analyzed Obama’s tax proposals (as described by his economic advisers) and concluded that in 2009, his plan would, in fact, result in $100-billion in government outlays to people who have no income tax liability. That figure would gradually inch up in ensuing years, to $111-billion in 2018.
 
A couple of major caveats are in order. The government already outlays nearly $53-billion to 57-million people (38 percent of all tax filers) who have a zero or negative income tax under current law. A negative income tax means that refundable tax credits amounted to more than the person’s income tax liability, meaning they got a check from the government. The Tax Policy Center estimates another 15-million people would fall into the ""zero or negative income tax"" category under Obama’s tax plan.
 
Obama’s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center, would add an additional $48-billion in government outlay to those who pay no federal income tax. We think the ad is misleading in that it suggests Obama proposes an additional $100-billion for those who pay no federal income taxes.
 
""There clearly are aspects of the Obama plan that would give to people who pay no federal income tax,"" said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center.
 
But there’s another big hole in the ad’s logic. Obama’s proposed tax credit for wage earners is designed to offset payroll taxes. Those are the taxes withheld from your paycheck for Social Security and Medicare, 6.75 percent of your earnings.
 
All workers pay payroll taxes, even people who pay no income tax. So for McCain to say that Obama’s tax credits would go to people who ""pay no taxes"" is inaccurate. There are some under Obama’s plan whose tax credits would actually come to more than their income tax liability

and

their payroll tax liability, but that’s a very small percentage of people, said Eric Toder of the Tax Policy Center.
 
And there’s some hypocrisy here: McCain has proposed a refundable tax credit of his own. McCain proposes a $5,000 tax credit for people to buy health insurance. (We should note that the refundable portion of McCain's health care tax credit must go to a special health spending account so that it only pays for health-related expenses.)
 
Inasmuch as the plan is being sold as a way to help make health care affordable to those at the bottom of the income scale, it too would result in payments to those who pay no income tax.
 
""It absolutely is the pot calling the kettle black,"" Williams said.
 
We also think it's misleading to call Obama’s plan ""welfare."" Welfare is a loaded word that connotes government aid to those who aren’t working. Obama’s tax credit for wage earners is just that, for wage earners.
 
We also note that the earned-income tax credit has historically enjoyed strong support from Republicans as well. It was designed, in a way, to replace welfare payments to those who don’t work with government subsidies to low-income people who do work.
 
McCain is not proposing elimination, or reduction, of the existing earned income and child care credits. The existing system results in $53-billion to those who pay no income taxes. Is that support for welfare?
 
McCain is technically accurate when he says that under Obama’s plan, refundable tax credits would result in more people getting a check from Uncle Sam, rather than writing one. But we think it’s misleading to call that welfare.
 
So let's review again the McCain ad's claim in its totality. ""Obama raises taxes on seniors (and) hard-working families to give welfare to those who pay none."" The claim that Obama will raise taxes on seniors and hardworking families? Misleading. Using the term ""welfare"" to describe refundable tax credits? Not by most people's definition. That the plan would give payments to people who pay no taxes? Only if you don't consider payroll taxes as taxes. That all adds up to False.

Proposed cuts are too vague
","
 
In his half-hour prime time political ad on Oct. 29., Sen. Barack Obama made his case for a number of new initiatives for such things as health care, education and energy.
 
Those will cost money. But Obama assured that for all of his new spending proposals, he’s proposed commensurate spending cuts, and then some.
 
""Across the country, families are tightening their belts, and so should Washington,"" Obama said. ""That’s why, for my energy plan, my economic plan, and the other proposals you’ll hear tonight, I’ve offered spending cuts above and beyond their cost.""
 
Note what Obama is not saying here. He is not saying he will reduce the federal deficit, or even stabilize it. A number of non-partisan budget and tax analysts say that the deficit is likely to grow considerably under Obama’s plan - mostly due to his proposed tax cuts for the middle class.
 
What Obama did say is that for all of his new spending initiatives, he is proposing offsetting spending cuts.
 
""I think he can go out with a clear conscience and claim that,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which performed a detailed analysis if the budget impact of the Obama and McCain plans as revealed through the camapign.
 
But it's based on a number of shaky assumptions, she said.
 
Obama has proposed several nitiatives - expanded health care coverage, investments in alternative energies and increases in education spending, foreign aid and the size of the military - that the CRFB estimates at a cost of about $220 billion.
 
On the ""savings"" side of the ledger, the Obama campaign includes ending the Iraq war, letting tax cuts expire for people who earn more than $250,000, closing corporate tax loopholes, discouraging offshore tax havens and reducing wasteful spending.
 
The campaign says all those changes would yield several hundred billion dollars a year. For example, ending the Iraq war — the first five years of which cost $600-billion, according to the Pentagon — would save between $90-billion and $100-billion a year, the Obama campaign asserts. All the savings together would easily be enough to pay for all the programs Obama mentioned, along with all the other new spending and tax cuts he plans, the campaign says.
 
But the Obama campaign uses a few ""gimmicks"" to make its numbers work, said MacGuineas, a former adviser to the 2000 McCain for President campaign.
 
For example, the Obama campaign includes ""savings"" realized by a phased-down withdrawal of combat troops in Iraq. The CRFB put a $156 billion tag on that. But to include that figure as ""savings"" is shaky, MacGuineas said, inasmuch as it’s double counting to include reductions in policies that we are already borrowing to pay for.
 
It also assumes that the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 would be extended indefinitely, even though they are set to expire in 2010. That way, Obama can claim savings with his proposal to eliminate those tax cuts for people making over $250,000 a year.
 
The Obama plan is also short on details when it comes to spending cuts, MacGuineas said.
 
For example, the campaign has pledged to save tens of billions of dollars by ""reducing and reforming government contracting"" and ""reducing wasteful spending."" The campaign gives a few examples, she said, ""not enough to fill in all of the (claimed) savings.""
 
""All of his plans to spend money have far more specifics than his plan to save money,"" MacGuineas said.
 
It’s that lack of detail that makes many budget experts skeptical of Obama’s claim.
 
Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that advocates budget restraint, said it’s a leap of faith to put a monetary figure to something like Obama’s plan to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. Which waste exactly? Which fraud? Which abuse?
 
""In the sense that they are trying to come up with offsets to the spending plans they are proposing, that’s a good thing,"" Gordon said. ""Whether the numbers are completely accurate, I think even the campaigns would admit they are just best guesses.""
 
Isabel Sawhill, an associate budget director during the Clinton administration and a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said she has yet to see specific proposals for spending cuts from the Obama campaign that go beyond his more specific spending plans.
 
""Frankly, it’s a mystery,"" Sawhill said. ""He’s been petty vague.""
 
That’s often true with presidential campaigns, said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
 
Does a candidate get credit for being more fiscally responsible if they talk about larger, unspecified savings?
 
""I think the best you can do is get a sense of what the candidates priorities are,"" Horney said. ""But at the end of the day, it’s difficult to add it all up and come up with a number, then later be able to back that number up.""
 
And even if all of Obama’s proposals were budget neutral, Gordon said, the country’s existing debt would continue to grow. Without any changes to current policies, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts a $2.3 trillion budget deficit over the next decade.
 
""If there’s not a net tax increase or a net cut in spending, we’re just treading water as the ship is going under,"" Gordon said.
 
The ""all paid for"" logic also assumes you don’t include Obama’s proposals for a host of refundable tax credits. Some would argue those are simply spending initiatives dressed up as tax cuts.
 
""The overall effect of the these policies, there’s no question it would put the country deeper in debt,"" MacGuineas said. ""His plan will significantly increase the budget deficit.""
 
A detailed analysis of the Obama tax plan by the non-partisan Tax Policy Institute concluded Obama’s tax plan would increase the country’s debt by $3.5 trillon over 10 years. They estimated McCain’s tax cut plan would boost the deficit even more, by $5 trillion.
 
""He (Obama) is digging a $3.5 trillion hole that has to be filled with spending cuts,"" said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center.
 
To be fair, Obama has not pledged to cut the deficit.
 
""I do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013,"" Obama said, ""because I think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in America’s families.""
 
Still, experts agree that while Obama has made efforts to correlate new spending initiatives with proportionate spending cuts, his proposals to cut spending make too many best-case-scenario assumptions and are far too vague to be relied upon. We rate his claim Barely True.

Updated: McCain is right about 5 of 11 polls
","

UPDATED NOV. 1:

Sen. John McCain sounded upbeat in a Halloween morning interview on CNBC. But was the enthusiasm just a mask?
 
We can't be sure. But we can check some data McCain cited to justify his optimism.
 
""I'm very optimistic, and we're coming from behind,"" McCain told anchor Larry Kudlow in the Oct. 31, 2008, interview. ""I'm the underdog. There's where we always like to be. But we are within the margin of error, my friends. And I'm very happy where we are.""
 
McCain was clearly talking about national polls, which are not necessarily indicative of Electoral College results. Nevertheless, only four presidents have won the election without winning the national popular vote — John Quincy Adams in 1824, Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, Benjamin Harrison in 1888 and George W. Bush in 2000.
 
So we looked at every national poll we could find from the day McCain spoke and the day before to see if he really was within the margin of error.
 
Five polls were released the same morning McCain was speaking.
 
Rasmussen's daily tracking poll

 showed Obama up 51 to 47 with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. That means if one gives McCain the full benefit of the margin of error, his score could be as high as 49 percent (his 47 plus the 2-point margin of error) and Obama's could be as

low

as 49 percent (his 51 minus the margin of error). There's a very low probability of that outcome, but still, it's within the margin of error. 
 
The method we employed above of factoring in the margin of error is the one most commonly used by pollsters and political scientists. Some statisticians quibble with it and use a more complicated calculation, but we think it's fair to judge McCain's claim by the most common measure. (We can say for certain that another method the media commonly use — saying a race is within the margin of error only if the gap between the candidates is smaller than the margin of error — is wrong. You have to apply the margin to

both

candidates' scores.)
 
Let's look at more polls from Oct. 31. The

Diageo/Hotline tracking poll

had Obama up 48 to 41 with a margin of error of 3.3 percent, a lead that was outside the margin of error. The

Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll

showed Obama up 50 to 43 with a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points, also outside the margin of error.

Research 2000/Daily Kos

had Obama up 51-45 with a 3-point margin of error, just within the margin of error. And an

Associated Press-Yahoo News poll

showed Obama up 51 to 43 with a margin of error of 3 percentage points, back outside the margin of error.
 
Let's look at the polls released the previous day, Oct. 30.
 
A

Washington Post-ABC News poll

showed Obama leading 52 to 44 with a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points — no dice for McCain on that one. The

New York Times/CBS News poll

showed Obama leading 51 to 40 with a margin of error of three percentage points — even worse news for McCain. The

Investor's Business Daily/ TechnoMetrica Institute of Policy poll

showed Obama leading 47.7 to 43.6, a lead well within the margin of error of 3.5 points. The

GWU/Battleground poll

showed Obama up 49 to 45, also within the 3.5 percent margin of error. The

Gallup daily tracking poll

had Obama up 50 to 45 with a traditional model of turnout, and 51 to 44 with an expanded turnout; both outside the 2-point margin of error. A

FOX News/Opinion Dynamics poll

had Obama leading 47 to 44, easily within the 3-point margin of error.
 
So McCain was within the ""margin of error"" in five of the 11 polls we checked. We find his statement Half True.
 

UPDATE:

Our original item mistakenly calculated the margin of error without using its impact on the number for both candidates. We have changed the calculations, which changed our ruling from Barely True to Half True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
Savings projection is best case scenario
","
 During a 30-minute campaign ad that aired Oct. 29, 2008, Barack Obama laid out his policy proposals in detail, including health care.
 
""In the last year, I've visited many hospitals that are computerizing records and implementing technology that improves patient care and dramatically reduces costs,"" Obama said. ""That's why my health care plan includes improving information technology, requires coverage for preventive care and pre-existing conditions, and lowers health care costs for the typical family by $2,500 a year, and you can keep your same coverage and your same doctor.""
 
As Obama's statement makes clear, he brings down costs by introducing efficiency to the existing health care system. He believes the savings should be reflected in lower costs for health insurance and medical care.
 
We wanted to look into that $2,500 number and see what's behind it. From our previous coverage of health care, we know that

it's difficult to forecast costs with precision

. But we were curious whether Obama's number was an approximation of realistic savings or an outlandish exaggeration of what experts would say is possible.
 
The Obama campaign pointed us to a memo several researchers at Harvard University wrote after the campaign asked them to

review Obama's plan

. Their report concluded that health savings could reach about $2,500 per family, though they included the caveat that ""there is no consensus in the research community about how much each element will save, or how much could be saved if these elements were effectively implemented in combination.""
 
We then turned to an independent health policy expert, Kenneth Thorpe of Emory University. He drew up detailed examinations of the Obama and McCain health plans that he published this summer.
 
Thorpe considered savings that could be achieved through the following Obama proposals:
 
• expanding evidence-based, best practice programs in public programs like Medicare
 
• accelerating the adoption of electronic health information technology, such as electronic medical records
 
• promoting wider use of wellness programs designed to reduce obesity and smoking
 
• reducing administrative costs through changes in insurance programs
 
• creating a clinical effectiveness research institute to discourage unproductive health care spending
 
• improving patient safety by reducing preventable medical errors
 
Obama's plan has additional cost-savings measures that relate to the way private insurance works. Thorpe did not include those measures in his analysis. 
 
Thorpe concluded that by 2012, the Obama plan could reduce health care spending by $203 billion to $273 billion per year. It sounds like a lot, but it's actually not that much when you consider the United States spends more than $2.5 trillion annually on health care. 
 
Thorpe's report figured that Obama's proposal could reduce total spending by between 6 and 9 percent. Other researchers believe it could be more, with some estimates as high as 30 percent.
 
So take the total savings Thorpe found and divide it by about 140 million tax filers -- a rough equivalent for families -- and you get savings of between $1,500 and $2,000 per family. That's $1,000 to $500 away from what Obama touts, but he is likely using more aggressive savings targets. Both sets of numbers, however, are estimates based on events that have not yet come to pass, and it's not really possible to say that one set is wrong and another is right.
 
Thorpe did say, though, that Obama's proposal is superior to John McCain's in achieving cost savings because Obama has designated funding to get initiatives off the ground, such as $50 billion over five years to encourage health information technology. McCain's plan does not include this funding, Thorpe said.
 
The $2,500-per-family savings that Obama mentioned in his ad is a speculative estimate of what he hopes will happen once all the pieces of his plan are in place. It's $500 to $1,000 dollars higher than the number we came up with using Thorpe's independent analysis. We recognize that plans are vague and it's difficult to predict future numbers with any precision. But Obama's numbers are significantly higher than the best independent estimate we could find. So we find his statement Half True.

Fidel Castro no fan of McCain
","


 
Florida is a swing state, and in Florida, Cuban-Americans are a swing constituency.
 
By and large, Cuban-Americans don’t like Fidel Castro. And Castro, it seems, doesn’t much like Sen. John McCain.
 
So it comes as little surprise that McCain would wear Castro’s disdain like a badge of honor in an interview with a Spanish-language radio station in Miami on Oct. 29, 2008.
 
""I notice in the past couple of days that Fidel has made his preferences known in the campaign and had some very unkind things to say about me,"" McCain said. ""My feelings are hurt.""
 
How’s this for unkind words? In an Oct. 11, 2008, commentary published in Cuban state newspapers, and translated by Granma Internacional, Castro says McCain ""cultivates his reputation as a belligerent man"" and ""was one of the worst students in his class at West Point.""
 
""He has confessed that he knows nothing about Mathematics, and presumably far less about complicated economic sciences,"" Castro states. ""There is no doubt that his rival surpasses him in intelligence and serenity.""
 
Castro doesn’t seem to think much of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin either, and he warns that due to McCain’s age ""his health is not at all secure.""
 
""I mention this information to indicate the eventual possibility — if anything should happen in terms of the candidate’s health, given that he is elected — of the rifle lady, the inexperienced former governor of Alaska, becoming president of the United States,"" Castro states. ""It is obvious that she knows nothing about anything.""
 
While Castro stops short of supporting either candidate, he seems to pay Obama the most backhanded of compliments, saying, ""It’s a miracle that the Democratic candidate has not met the same fate as Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and others who dreamed of justice and equality in recent decades.""
 
Earlier this summer, we took a look at an e-mail from the Republican Party of Florida (which claimed it was a joke) that carried the headline, ""Fidel Castro endorses Obama,"" and included a doctored image of Castro holding a poster of Obama. Above Castro were the words, ""I love this guy!"" We ruled that one

Pants on Fire

.
 
A link in the e-mail went to another Castro commentary published in a Communist newspaper on May 26, 2008. In it, Castro says Obama is ""doubtless, from the social and human points of view, the most progressive candidate to the U.S. presidency."" Castro also praises Obama’s ""great intelligence, his debating skills and work ethic."" But it amounts to lesser-of-two-evils praise, at best. For example, Castro later calls the embargo that Obama pledged to maintain ""an act of genocide.""
 
Stated Castro: ""Presidential candidate Obama’s speech may be formulated as follows: hunger for the nation, remittances as charitable handouts and visits to Cuba as propaganda for consumerism and the unsustainable way of life behind it.""
 
Castro also clearly understood that any praise for Obama would provide fodder for his opponents.
 
""I feel no resentment towards him (Obama), for he is not responsible for the crimes perpetrated against Cuba and humanity,"" Castro said then. ""Were I to defend him, I would do his adversaries an enormous favor. I have therefore no reservations about criticizing him and about expressing my points of view on his words frankly.""
 
But back to McCain’s statement. That Castro had ""unkind things to say"" about McCain is clear. Our issue is whether Castro ""made his preferences known in the campaign."" Castro stops short of endorsing one candidate or the other. But we think the tone of Castro’s statements leaves little doubt he prefers Obama. For whatever that’s worth. We rule McCain’s statement True.

Different statements, different numbers
","
In a rally in Hershey, Pa., John McCain accused Barack Obama of using different numbers to talk up his tax plans.
 
""Senator Obama has made a lot of promises,"" McCain said. ""First he said people making less than $250,000 would benefit from his plan. Then this weekend he announced in an ad that if you're a family making less than $200,000, you'll benefit. But yesterday, right here in Pennsylvania, Senator Biden said tax relief should only go to middle class people, people making under $150,000 a year.
 
""Are you getting an idea of what's on their mind? A little sneak peek. It's interesting how their definition of rich has a way of creeping down. At this rate, it won't be long before Senator Obama is right back to his vote that Americans making just $42,000 a year should get a tax increase.""
 
The $42,000 tax vote is a dubious claim, one we've checked before and found

Barely True

. It's based on a vote Obama made that set broad revenue goals. No one's taxes went up as a result of the vote.
 
But McCain is on firmer ground when he talks about the different numbers Obama and Biden have used to tout their tax plans. They have used different numbers, and it can get confusing.
 
We'll say right off the bat that candidates' tax proposals are general outlines that don't have the specificity that actual tax law requires. So there are gray areas, particularly when we're talking about specific income amounts.
 
We've also noticed that candidates don't like to talk about the difference between single people and couples.
 
So Obama will say he won't raise taxes for people making $250,000 or less, and McCain will say he offers a health care tax credit of $5,000. But these numbers are for

couples

. If you're a single person, Obama will likely raise your taxes if you make more than $200,000, and you would only get $2,500 from John McCain's health care tax credit. Roughly 47 percent of people file taxes as a single person, so this is not an insignificant difference.
 
But the numbers McCain cited in his speech seem to all apply to families, so let's zoom in closer on that.
 
Obama often says that he won't raise taxes for those making $250,000 or less. This appears to be generally true for couples. He also offers tax credits to workers of $500 each — and, yes, that's $1,000 for couples if both spouses work. The tax credits, though, phase out as you get closer to the $250,000 mark. The Obama campaign hasn't detailed how the tax credits phase out. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center believes the tax credits will phase out generally at about $150,000 for couples.
 
The Obama campaign's tax calculator, which

we evaluated in depth previously

, sheds some additional light on the issue of credit phase-outs. If you mark the category of married filing jointly, the Obama tax calculator shows that for the $100,000 to $150,000 income category, there is a tax cut of $1,000. For the $150,000 to $200,000 income category, it shows a tax cut of $500. And for the $200,000 to $250,000 category, it shows a tax cut of $0. The calulator appears to assume the both members of the couple work. So it seems like the credits start phasing out around $150,000 and completely phase out around $200,000.
 
We want to issue a big word of caution here. People with the same income levels can have different tax burdens. Different sources of income tend to be taxed differently, and you must work to get Obama's tax credit. The Tax Policy Center's analysis projects that most people with low incomes will see lower taxes under Obama's plan — but not all of them. Conversely, their analysis projects that most of the top 1 percent of income tax filers will see higher taxes under the Obama plan — but again, not all of them. In that high-earning group, 93 percent will see their taxes go up, but 7 percent won't, because of the intricacies of the tax system. Did you make that exclusive 7 percent of the top 1 percent? Only your accountant knows for sure. (For more detail on these points, take a look at the

Tax Policy Center's analysis of the Obama plan

.)
 
Getting back to McCain's statement: Did Obama say that ""people making less than $250,000 would benefit from his plan""? Obama typically states that he won't raise taxes on people making $250,000 or less, but the McCain campaign points to a statement Obama made in Powder Springs, Ga., on July 8, 2008.
 
Obama emphasized that he would not raise taxes on people making less then $250,000, then said: ""If you make $


250,000


a year or less, we will not raise your taxes. We will cut your taxes.""
 
That's problematic, because Obama clearly does not offer a tax cut for

everyone

making less than $250,000.
 
But we only found a few times that Obama or his advisers talked about tax cuts for people making less than $250,000. Much more often, they said they wouldn't

raise

taxes on people making less than $250,000. It's a small but significant difference, and it's possible Obama simply tripped up his lines in Powder Springs.
 
McCain then said Obama ""said in an ad that if you're a family making less than $200,000, you'll benefit."" That's also true. Obama said in a television ad, ""If you have a job, pay taxes and make less than $200,000 a year, you’ll get a tax cut."" Obama's statement seems very likely true, though naturally we hesitate to say it's true always and everywhere, for the reasons outlined above.
 
Finally, McCain went after Joe Biden, saying that Biden said tax cuts ""should go to middle class people — people making under $150,000 a year,"" a comment Biden made to a Pennsylvania television station on Oct. 28, 2008. Biden did say that, but the Obama campaign said he only meant it as an example of the types of income levels that should get a tax cut.
 
That may be right; it's hard for us to say based on Obama's proposals. But $150,000 is also the income level that the Obama tax calculator shows that tax credits start phasing out. The Tax Policy Center uses that number as a phase-out for tax cuts. We can't say that's what was in Biden's head, but it seems likely to us that the $150,000 number is likely where the tax credits will start going away.
 
To be clear, we don't see evidence that Obama is crawfishing backward from his tax plan, as McCain implies. Most of the statements McCain refers to are consistent with Obama's long-stated tax policies. But McCain is also correct that there are a lot of numbers flying around that can be used in different ways. Voters need to be cautious in evaluating these numbers, because there are caveats and assumptions behind them. For this reason, we rate McCain's statement Mostly True.

21 bottles of deregulation on the wall
","
Following the financial crisis, Sen. Barack Obama has blamed a scarcity of government regulation, and in turn criticized Sen. John McCain for advocating even less regulation over the past year.
 
Here's a passage from Obama's speech in Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 29, 2008:
 
""When it comes to the economy – when it comes to the central issue of this election – the plain truth is that John McCain has stood with this president every step of the way. Voting for the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he once opposed. Voting for the Bush budgets that spent us into debt. Calling for less regulation 21 times just this year. Those are the facts.""
 
We'll be the judge of that – at least with respect to the claim that McCain called for less regulation on 21 separate occasions this year.
 
We asked the Obama campaign for evidence, and spokesman Tommy Vietor provided 21 citations of news reports over the past year.
 
Some were clear cut calls for deregulation.
 
For example, ""We need less government. We need less regulation,"" McCain said in a quote that appeared on

Washington Week

, the PBS show, on Jan. 25, 2008.
 
No doubt about that one.
 
But what about this statement the Obama campaign cited from a July 3, 2008, statement McCain made after goverment figures showed a sixth straight month of job losses:
 
""At a time when our small businesses need support from Washington, we cannot raise taxes, increase regulation, and isolate ourselves from foreign markets.""
 
One could quibble over whether a warning against increased regulation is the same as a call for less regulation.
 
And this, from a McCain speech in Livonia, Mich., on Jan. 12, 2008: ""Michigan's problems are rooted in failed government policies. Heavy regulation, too much government spending and taxes, and a high cost of doing business has hurt it dearly.""
 
That too is an implied, but not explicit, call for less regulation.
 
In all, 14 of the examples the Obama campaign provided were explicit calls by McCain for less regulation. Six others were along the lines of the general condemnations of regulation cited above – what we would call implied calls for less regulation. (The Obama campaign cited two news accounts of the same McCain statement, so we discounted one of those.)
 
Our fellow fact-checkers at CNN arrived at the

same conclusion

, and labeled Obama's claim ""misleading."" However, we found several instances of McCain calling for deregulation that the Obama campaign did not cite.
 
For example, later in that Jan. 12 Michigan speech he said, ""Michigan – and the United States – needs deregulation, freedom, innovation, and private control of money.""
 
On March 4, 2008, in Dallas, he said, ""We will campaign to strengthen job growth in America by helping businesses become more competitive with lower taxes and less regulation.""
 
In Tampa on April 29, 2008, he called for ""ridding the market of both needless and costly regulations.""
 
At a town hall event in Denver on July 7, 2008: ""Beth (a local business leader) tells me it gets harder every year, not because of the market and competition, but because of government regulations, taxes and the cost of health care. Beth, I promise you, if I'm elected president, we're going to remove these obstacles to your continued success.""
 
We should note that since the financial crisis worsened this fall, McCain has softened his advocacy of deregulation of the financial markets.
 
For example, on

This Week

on Sept. 28, 2008, George Stephanopoulos asked him, ""In the past you said you were for less regulations, maybe even a moratorium. Do you think now we're heading into an era where we're going to have to have enhanced regulation?""
 
""Two years ago, I said that I was worried about – co-sponsored legislation because of the excesses of Fannie and Freddie that I saw,"" McCain replied. ""Six years ago, I railed about corporate excess and not expensing stock options. I'm a Teddy Roosevelt Republican. I believe there's a role of government. I believe that government has to be part of the solution. I mean, regulation and oversight has to be absolutely essential. Teddy Roosevelt said unbridled capitalism leads to corruption.""
 
Still, between the 14 explicit and six implied calls for deregulation the Obama campaign cited, plus the four explicit calls we found, Obama was on fairly solid ground with this claim. We find it Mostly True.

McCain opposed law for equal pay lawsuits
","


 
In a direct appeal to women voters, a recent Obama campaign television ad features a handful of female supporters taking shots at Sen. John McCain. Borrowing from a common theme on the campaign trail, one of the women, Sherri Kimbel, calls out McCain on the issue of equal pay for women.
 
""In April, Sen. McCain came out against helping women earn equal pay for equal work,"" Kimbel said.
 
So we’re clear, McCain did not make some sort of public pronouncement in April that he is against helping women earn equal pay. To the contrary, McCain has repeatedly stated that he is for equal pay for equal work.
 
Kimbel is referring specifically to McCain’s opposition to the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, a law designed to make it easier for women to sue their employer over unequal pay.
 
The law was named after Lilly Ledbetter, a former 19-year supervisor at a tire plant in Alabama who sued the company after discovering several months before her 1998 retirement that, for years, she was being paid less than her male counterparts. Ledbetter was awarded more than $3-million by a jury. But the Supreme Court overturned that judgment in March 2007, ruling 5 to 4 that a 180-day statute of limitation for her to file a lawsuit had started from the first instance of discrimination, meaning that her suit about more than a decade of discrimination was untimely.
 
Numerous women’s rights activists decried the ruling, arguing that it was unfair to expect that a woman would know within six months after her hiring or promotion that she was getting unequal pay.
 
A handful of like-minded officials in Congress quickly drafted legislation so that the 180-day window to file a suit could start with each new discriminatory paycheck, rather than when the person was hired or promoted.
 
The bill passed the House but stalled in the Senate after a 56-42 vote fell short of the needed 60 votes for the legislation to proceed and overcome a filibuster. The vote came down largely along party lines, and Obama took time out of his campaign to vote for it. Republicans who opposed it argued the proposal to ease the filing deadlines would prompt a rash of lawsuits and unfairly burden companies with litigation over outdated cases.
 
Although McCain was campaigning in New Orleans and not present for the vote, he told reporters at the time that he opposed it.
 
""I am all in favor of pay equity for women, but this kind of legislation, as is typical of what’s being proposed by my friends on the other side of the aisle, opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems,"" McCain said.
 
McCain echoed that stance when Obama highlighted the legislation during the final presidential debate.
 
""That law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years,"" McCain said. ""It was a trial lawyer’s dream.""
 
That’s not entirely accurate. The law would have started the 180-day clock on filing a discrimination lawsuit from the time ""an unlawful employment practice"" occurs, and would have included each time compensation is paid. The law stated that a person could seek relief including recovery of back pay for up to two years.
 
Back in August, PolitiFact ruled on a statement from Sen. Hillary Clinton that McCain ""still thinks it’s okay when women don’t earn equal pay for equal work."" We ruled the statement

False,

noting that opposing that one bill was not the same as thinking it’s okay if women don’t get equal pay for equal work. We also noted that Clinton’s assertion was flatly contradicted by public statements McCain has made. On April 23 he said he is ""all in favor of pay equity for women,"" then said in July, ""I’m committed to making sure that there’s equal pay for equal work.""
 
The claim in the recent Obama campaign ad is more carefully worded, however. It includes a small print reference to the Ledbetter bill, and could reasonably be said to be a comment about McCain's position on that one bill. So its truth lies in the extent to which you believe MCain's position was ""against helping women earn equal pay for equal work.""
 
That’s certainly the view of the National Organization for Women, which has endorsed Obama for president.
 
Equal pay laws have been fairly stable for decades, NOW president Kim Gandy told PolitiFact, and the Ledbetter bill was the most important piece of legislation in years to gauge congressional support for it.
 
""It’s disingenuous to say ‘I support equal pay for equal work’ but then not support any way to enforce it legally,"" Gandy said.
 
The wording of the claim in the ad makes our ruling tricky. Interpreted broadly, one might be led to believe that McCain made a decision to oppose any help for women getting unequal pay. And that would be misleading, because we are only talking about McCain's opposition to a single piece of legislation that would have eased the statute of limitations for bringing a lawsuit over unequal pay — weighed against McCain's numerous pronouncements of support for equal pay for equal work.
 
On the other hand, one could argue that the woman is simply stating an opinion about McCain's vote on the Ledbetter bill. McCain did oppose it. And one could certainly argue the bill was designed to help women get equal pay for equal work. And so we rule the statement Mostly True.

Campaigns volley over Biden's warning
","
Sen. Barack Obama plays defense in a new

television ad

, alleging that in a previous ad Sen. John McCain's campaign ""selectively edits"" the words of Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden.
 
The only problem is the Obama ad – which the campaign released Oct. 27, 2008, in the Northern Virginia market – at a minimum employs, um, selective editing.
 
Let's unravel this tangled web of selectivity to see who's being dishonest, beginning with the

McCain ad

that started the volley.
 
""Listen to Joe Biden talking about what electing Barack Obama will mean,"" the narrator says.
 
Then we hear an audio recording of Biden at a recent fundraiser: ""Mark my words: It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama,"" we hear Biden say, as sinister music plays over images of hooded gunmen, and hostile foreign leaders. ""The world is looking. We're going to have an international crisis to test the mettle of this guy. I guarantee you it's gonna happen.""
 
""It doesn't have to happen,"" the narrator continues. ""Vote McCain.""
 
Those comments by Biden are lifted from

a talk

he gave to campaign contributors at Seattle's Sheraton Hotel on Oct. 19, 2008.
 
Are they a fair representation of Biden's point of view? To find out we have to look at Biden's remarks in more context – a good deal of context, in fact.
 
""Barack is the right guy at the right moment for this job,"" he said.
 
He riffed on foreign affairs a bit, then continued:
 
""Barack gets it...And I'll tell you why I'm telling you this: because we're going to find ourselves in real trouble when we get elected...We're gonna have the largest systemic deficit in modern – not modern – in the history of the world...So there are going to be a lot of tough decisions Barack's gonna have to make, a lot of very tough decisions, including on foreign policy. And here's the point I want to make: mark my words. Mark my words. It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy. The world is looking. We're about to elect a brilliant 47-year-old president of the United States of America. Remember I said it standing here if you don't remember anything else I said. Watch, we're gonna have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy...we're gonna need you to use your influence, your influence in the community, to stand with him. Because it's not gonna be apparent initially, it's not gonna be apparent that we're right. Because all these decisions, all these decisions, once they're made if they work, then they weren't viewed as a crisis. If they don't work, it's viewed as you didn't make the right decision, a little bit like how we hesitated so long dealing with Bosnia and with Kosovo, and as a consequence 200,000 people lost their lives that maybe didn't have to lose lives. It's how we made a mistake in Iraq. We made a mistake in Somalia. So there's gonna be some tough decisions.""
 
Did McCain's ad distort Biden's point?  
 
It omitted Biden's implication that Obama is up to whatever challenges he'll face. But by raising the interventions in Bosnia, Iraq and Somalia – decisions by Republican and Democratic presidents that Biden framed as flawed – he also left room for the possibility that Obama will make mistakes in grappling with international challenges.
 
So the McCain campaign omitted crucial context, but didn't exactly turn Biden's meaning on its head either.
 
Now let's look more closely at Obama's response ad.
 
""An economic meltdown, two wars,"" it says. ""And John McCain's playing with audio tapes, selectively editing Joe Biden's words.""
 
So far, that's more or less accurate, as we've seen. It goes on to say:
 
""The next president will be tested. But here's what Biden actually said about Barack Obama: 'They're gonna find out this guy's got steel in his spine.'""
 
Well yes, Biden did say that. But not at the appearance the McCain campaign highlighted in its ad. The ""steel in his spine clip,"" a phrase Biden has used frequently, came from an appearance a day earlier at a

fundraiser in San Francisco

.
 
So the Obama campaign took Biden's words out of context even as they accused the McCain campaign of that very sin. But was

that

a distortion?
 
Not really. It was more of a misdemeanor. At the Seattle fundraiser Biden did indeed praise Obama emphatically, just perhaps not as concisely as he had in San Francisco. (We should note that several news organizations

erroneously reported

that Biden made the ""steel in his spine"" comment at the Seattle fundraiser, so the Obama campaign's mistake may have been inadvertant.)
 
Did the McCain campaign ""selectively edit"" Biden? Yes, but editing generally is selective, and this editing didn't really distort Biden's meaning. Did Biden actually say Obama had steel in his spine? Yes, but a day earlier than he made the comments the McCain ad highlighted, not immediately afterward as the Obama ad claimed. The Obama ad suggests there was some outrageous lapse here, but we don't see it. We find the Obama ad Barely True.

'Tiny' ad makes large error
","
In the final week before the election, the McCain campaign is airing a rerun.
 
The campaign announced on Oct. 28, 2008, that it was launching an ad called ""Tiny"" that alleges that  Barack Obama described Iran as a ""tiny"" country that is not a serious threat to the United States. The ad, which was initially released in August, repeats a claim McCain made in a speech in May.
 
The ad opens with scary music, a photograph of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the words ""Don't forget to say Death to America"" painted on a wall.
 
""Iran. Radical Islamic government. Known sponsors of terrorism,"" the announcer says in a somber tone. ""Developing nuclear capabilities to 'generate power' but threatening to eliminate Israel. Obama says Iran is a 'tiny' country, 'doesn't pose a serious threat.' Terrorism, destroying Israel, those aren't 'serious threats'? Obama – dangerously unprepared to be president.""
 
Back in May, McCain made the claim in an address to the National Restaurant Association in Chicago.

We rated that claim False.

We examined it again in August when the ad first aired and again found the statement to be

False

. But the ad will be new to many viewers this week, so we are revisiting it here.
 
McCain is distorting Obama's original comments. Here’s the full context of Obama’s remarks in Pendelton, Ore., on May 18, 2008:
 
“Strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries,” Obama said. “That’s what Kennedy did with Khrushchev. That’s what Reagan did with Gorbachev. That’s what Nixon did with Mao. I mean, think about it. Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don’t pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us. And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying we’re going to wipe you off the planet. And ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war, and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the Berlin Wall. Now, that has to be the kind of approach that we take.
 
“You know, Iran, they spend one-one hundredth of what we spend on the military. If Iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us, they wouldn’t stand a chance. And we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen. That doesn’t mean we agree with them on everything. We might not compromise on any issues, but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest, and we can reduce some of the tensions that have caused us so many problems around the world.”
 
McCain twisted Obama's words when he claimed that Obama characterized the threat from Iran as tiny or insignificant. Obama never said that.
 
Obama was speaking about whether to negotiate with Iran, which the Bush administration resisted. Obama noted that previous presidents had met with adversaries from the Soviet Union and China that were willing to destroy the United States, but that President Bush refused to meet directly with leaders of smaller global players such as Iran, Cuba and Venezuela.
 
Rather than dismiss those countries as insignificant, Obama was urging direct talks to engage them.
 
And Obama elaborated on his comments back in May when he issued a retort to McCain: “So John McCain, he said, ‘Oh, Obama doesn’t understand the threat of Iran.’ I understand the threat of Iran. But what I know is that the Soviet Union had the ability to destroy the world several times over, had satellites spanning the globe, had huge masses of conventional military power all directed at destroying us, and so I’ve made it clear for years that the threat from Iran is grave, but what I’ve said is that we should not just talk to our friends, we should be willing to engage our enemies as well, that’s what diplomacy is all about.
 
“So let me be absolutely clear: Iran is a grave threat. It has an illicit nuclear program, it supports terrorism across the region and militias in Iraq, it threatens Israel’s existence, it denies the Holocaust. But this threat has grown, primarily – and this is the irony – the reason Iran is so much more powerful now than it was a few years ago is because of the Bush-McCain policy of fighting an endless war in Iraq and refusing to pursue direct diplomacy with Iran.”
 
This isn’t the first time Obama has talked about the grave threat posed by Iran. He has repeatedly characterized it as such during his campaign.
 
Obama never said the threat from Iran was “tiny” or “insignificant,” only that the threat was tiny in comparison to the threat once posed by the Soviet Union. And if the McCain campaign was unclear on that point, it should have been clear after Obama's comment in May that ""Iran is a grave threat."" To continue to twist Obama's words, especially after that clarification, earns another False.

Felony cherry-picking
","A recent attack mailer from the Republican Party of Florida calls Obama ""Soft On Crime."" ""Barack Obama has consistently voted against tougher penalties for criminals — including major offenses — allowing criminals to remain on the streets,"" the mailer states.  This mailer, like so many other mailers and TV ads, cherry-picks a few choice examples and conveniently ignores evidence that contradicts its conclusions. We'll review the four Obama positions highlighted by the mailer to back up its claim, and put Obama's position in a fuller context. We'll also examine Obama's fuller record on each front to show how the ad distorts its claims.  A mail ad targeting Barack Obama.  •   Against tough penalties for drug-related crimes.  ""Obama is against tougher penalties on crack-cocaine users and would use taxpayers dollars to provide addicts with hypodermic needles.""  When the federal Sentencing Commission voted in November to lower sentencing guidelines for crack-related crimes, and bring them closer to sentences for powder cocaine, Obama spoke approvingly of the action and said he supported applying the lower jail terms retroactively to current prisoners. Obama echoed concerns among some civil rights leaders and elected officials about disparities between mandatory prison terms for crack cocaine offenses, which affect mostly black prisoners, and terms for powder cocaine, which affect mostly whites. As for the second part of the claim, Obama did tell the Associated Press in February that if elected, he would move to repeal a 20-year-old ban on federal funding for needle exchange programs. And when he was an Illinois senator, Obama also supported a law that would allow the purchase of needles without a prescription. Obama's position was framed as an attempt to help stem the HIV/AIDS epidemic — particularly acute among black Americans — by encouraging drug addicts who might otherwise use contaminated needles to exchange them for clean ones. Obama also expressed concern about disease being spread to the innocent children of drug users. ""And what’s more important is the fact that many intravenous drug users are now passing on their afflictions onto a spouse who does not engage in drug use or, more tragically, an infant who, as a consequence of being born to a mother who engages in drug use, might be born with AIDS,"" Obama said. ""And so I think I recognize some of the cultural concerns and the symbolic concerns that people may have, what kind of message does this send. But I also think it’s just important to recognize the enormous costs and potentially fatal consequences that we’re placing on individuals when they are reusing dirty needles over and over again. We may think that’s what they deserve, but I personally, at least, think particularly because the impact often goes beyond the drug user themselves, that this is a modest, measured and effective strategy for dealing with this problem."" For the Republican Party of Florida to single out these two positions to conclude that Obama is ""against tough penalties for drug related crimes"" is grossly misleading. It's not hard to find a few examples of Obama initiatives that show just the opposite. For example, Obama took aim at the methamphetamine epidemic when he co-sponsored the Combat Meth Act of 2005, which sought to provide more money to investigate and prosecute methamphetamine offenses, tighten controls on the sale of meth ingredients, and provide assistance grants to the children of meth abusers. And in 1997, Obama voted to increase penalties for marijuana possession.    •   Against protecting children from danger.  ""Obama refused to take a stand and protect our children from guns fired at or near schools.""  This relates to a 1999 bill in the Illinois Senate that sought to allow adult prosecution for juveniles over the age of 15 charged with aggravated battery with a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. Obama voted ""present,"" a procedural vote that carries the same effect as a no, though the bill passed overwhelmingly. Speaking before the general assembly at the time, Obama said, ""there is really no proof or indication that automatic transfers and increased penalties and adult penalties for juvenile offenses have, in fact, proven to be more effective in reducing juvenile crime or cutting back on recidivism."" Yes, Obama did not support this bill, but there are many other votes that contradict the mailer's blanket claim that Obama is ""against protecting children from danger."" In 2001, for example, Obama voted to increase penalties for repeat sex offenders; for those convicted of child abduction and child molestation. In 2005, he co-sponsored legislation to require sex offender data be available on the Web.    •   Against tougher penalties for street gangs.  ""Obama voted against making gang members eligible for the death penalty if they kill someone to help their gang.""  In 2001, Obama was one of nine Illinois senators who voted against a bill that would have allowed the death penalty for a person convicted of first-degree murder ""in furtherance of a gang activity."" Obama argued the law was too vague about what constituted gang activity and would disproportionately affect black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Again, this bill is not the entirety of Obama’s record with regard to gangs. Someone could just as easily have highligted a few other votes to reach an exactly opposite conclusion. In 2003, Obama voted to prohibit released gang members from associating with their old gang members. In 2004, he voted in favor of a law to make gang recruiting at a school a crime.  •   Against protecting families from abuse.  ""Obama is against a cooling-off-period of 48 hours for those who abuse their family.""  Obama served on the Illinois Senate Judiciary Committee that declined to pass a bill that would have required anyone convicted of domestic battery to serve at least two days in jail. According to a Copley News Service story on April 20, 1999, opponents of the measure feared it would take away too much discretion from judges and tax already overcrowded jails. Specifically, the article says Obama ""questioned whether the bill would hurt prosecutors in the long run. Victims are usually reluctant to testify, so prosecutors have to push more for plea bargains. If defendants know they face a minimum two-day sentence, more will choose to fight their cases in court."" Not mentioned in the mailer is that in 2001, Obama co-sponsored a bill to increase penalties for domestic batteries committed near domestic violence shelters. Or that in 2002, he co-sponsored a bill to toughen penalties for repeat domestic violence offenders. In each case, the RPOF has taken selective votes or positions to prop up sensational headlines that are belied by a fuller examination of Obama's record. Similarly, the claim that Obama has ""  consistently  voted against tougher penalties for criminals"" — when weighed against the entirety of Obama's record — is untrue. We rule the ad’s claim False.","[('Illinois government Web site, 91st General Assembly,  Summary of Senate Bill 759', 'http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/legisnet91/summary/910SB0759.html'), ('Illinois government Web site, 91st General Assembly,  Vote on Senate Bill 759  , March 25, 1999', 'No link'), ('Illinois government Web site, 92nd General Assembly,  Summary of House Bill 1812 ', 'http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/votehistory/srollcalls91/pdf/910SB0759_03251999_001000T.PDF'), ('Illinois government Web site, 92nd General Assembly,  Vote on House Bill 1812  , March 15, 2001\xa0', 'No link'), ('Illinois government Web site, 92nd General Assembly,  Status of Senate Bill 1080 ', 'http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/legisnet92/summary/920HB1812.html'), ('Illinois government Web site, 93rd General Assembly,  Summary of Senate Bill 880 ', 'No link'), ('Illinois government Web site, 91st General Assembly,  Status of House Bill 33 ', 'http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/votehistory/srollcalls92/920HB1812_05152001_034000T.PDF'), ('Illinois government Web site, 92nd General Assembly,  Status of House Bill 4081 ', 'No link'), ('Illinois government Web site, 90th General Assembly,  Summary of House Bill 379 ', 'http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/legisnet92/status/920SB1080.html'), ('Illinois government Web site, 93rd General Assembly,  Bill Status of House Bill 506  \xa0\n\nIllinois government Web site, 93rd General Assembly,  Bill Status of House Bill 4786 ', 'No link'), ('The Library of Congress, 109th Congress,  H.

Few ""guarantees"" in McCain's plan
","
The Planned Parenthood Action Fund has launched an attack ad on John McCain that makes a case that his health care plan hurts women.
 
The ad features a nurse, Shaina Klackle, talking about a study created by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.
 
""As a nurse, I'm concerned about your health care,"" Klackle says. ""And so is Planned Parenthood's Action Fund. In fact, their study found John McCain's plan won't guarantee coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care.""
 
The ad goes on to make other claims about McCain's health plan, but here we wanted to look at the claim about guaranteed coverage for cancer screenings and maternity care.
 
We should say off the bat that McCain's health plan contains no details about specific conditions or coverage. The heart of his plan seeks to stimulate the market for individual health insurance by ending the tax exemption on employer-provided health care benefits in exchange for a tax credit. McCain hopes this will lead to greater competition in the health care market by allowing people to shop around for their own insurance. Also along those lines, his plan calls for allowing people to shop for policies across state lines, so they can purchase the most effective policy, no matter where the insurance provider is located.
 
It's that last provision that is the basis for Planned Parenthood's statement, according to the report they issued to back up the ad. Many states have passed laws that say health care providers operating in their state must provide coverage in certain areas. Planned Parenthood cites requirements for cancer screenings and maternity care in more than 20 states. Under a McCain plan, insurers could operate in any state and sell all over the country. 
 
A rollback of insurance requirements isn't spelled out in McCain's plan. But it's a reasonable fear, said Sara Collins of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan policy group that seeks to improve the health care system.
 
Health insurance requirements differ substantially from state to state, and insurance companies would likely locate in the states with the least regulations, Collins said.
 
""Ultimately, you would have an individual market that's not regulated in any state,"" Collins said. ""It's very different from what we have right now.""
 
Planned Parenthood's ad says that McCain's plan doesn't ""guarantee"" coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care, and on a literal level, that's true. But Planned Parenthood's deeper point is that some people have a ""guarantee"" under their respective state's current laws, and they could lose that guarantee under McCain's plan. McCain's plan has no literal guarantees for coverage, and Planned Parenthood makes an additional case that his regulations could undermine existing state guarantees. On that basis, we rate Planned Parenthood Action Fund's statement True.

The rich are, in fact, getting richer
","


 
In an interview making the rounds on the Internet due to its, let’s say, aggressive tone of questioning, Barbara West of WFTV in Orlando grilled Sen. Joe Biden about Sen. Barack Obama’s tax plan and at one point cited Karl Marx to ask whether Obama’s plan to ""spread the wealth around"" amounted to Marxism.
 
She also asked this doozy: ""Sen. Obama now famously told Joe the Plumber he wanted to spread his wealth around. A Gallup poll showed 84 percent of Americans prefer government focus on improving economic conditions and creating more jobs in the U.S. as opposed to taking steps to distribute wealth. Isn’t Sen. Obama’s comment a potentially crushing political blunder?""
 
""Absolutely not,"" Biden answered. ""The only person who has spread the wealth around has been George Bush and John McCain’s tax policy. They have devastated the middle class. ... For the first time since the late 20s, 1 percent of the American people make over 21 percent of all the income in America. That wasn’t the way before George Bush became president.""
 
In highlighting the growing income disparity for the very wealthy, Biden is citing an analysis of U.S. tax returns published in the

Quarterly Journal of Economics

in 2005. Updated versions of the report show that in 2006 (the most recently available year) the top 1 percent made 22.8 percent of all the income in the United States.
 
And Biden is correct that it hasn’t been that high since 1928.
 
End of story? Not quite.
 
When Biden says ""that wasn’t the way before George Bush became president,"" some context is in order. The increase became evident long before Bush took office.
 
In 2000, the year Bush won election, the top 1 percent made about 21.5 percent of all the income in the United States. So, 21.5 in 2000 to 22.8 in 2006. An increase, but not huge.
 
And the percentage of income captured by the top 1 percent has risen steadily since the 1970s (when it hovered around 9 percent) and through several presidencies. It began to soar in the 1980s, and reached new heights and grew more quickly during the 1990s administration of Bill Clinton, a Democrat. The number dropped in the early 2000s with the burst of the dot.com bubble, and then steadily increased until 2006. So while some of Bush’s policies have favored the rich, economists say it is not fair for Biden to lay the entire rising income gap at Bush’s feet.
 
""The big picture is that we have seen dramatic increases (in the percentage of income for the top 1 percent) over the last couple decades,"" said Emmanuel Saez, professor of economics at University of California and a co-author of the study.
 
Saez thinks more attention is being focused on the figures now because during the Clinton administration expansion, the bottom 99 percent captured more than half the growth. During the Bush expansion, real incomes for the bottom 99 percent remained fairly stagnant, while the top 1 percent captured 73 percent of the growth.
 
Bottom line, says Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, the bottom 99 percent fared better under the Clinton administration than they did under Bush. Under Clinton, the very rich got richer, as they have under Bush. The difference is that under Clinton, the average salary for the bottom 99 percent increased from $35,500 to nearly $42,000; while under Bush the average salary for the bottom 99 percent has actually gone down $1,100.
 
Economists point to several reasons for the growth in disparity between the very rich and everyone else, including the decline of labor unions, the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs to cheap labor overseas, rising executive pay, and the relative drop of the minimum wage from 1981 to 2007. While goods and services became more expensive, the minimum wage stayed the same.
 
Bush has, however, exacerbated the after-tax income inequality with tax cuts that disproportionately help the rich, economists said. He also has resisted congressional attempts to cut costs for the working poor, such as by opposing an expansion of a popular children’s health insurance program that he says helps some who don’t need it.
 
Biden cites the number accurately for the amount of income captured by the top 1 percent, and he’s technically right when he says ""that wasn’t the way before George Bush became president."" It went from 21.5 to 22.8. We allow that there is a more stark difference in how well the lower 99 percent fared, which backs up Biden's overall point about income disparity growing under Bush. It has, some. But the percent of income caputured by the top 1 percent has risen fairly steadily for decades, and we think it's misleading for Biden to suggest this disparity didn't exist before Bush. And so we only give him a Half True.

Picking a favorite holiday is almost like picking a favorite child, but PolitiFact Ohio admits to particular fondness for the Fourth of July.

We enjoy the invocations of history, especially when they're factually accurate. We like the annual cookout with old friends. And we love fireworks.

So we were especially interested to read a newspaper commentary by Bill Weimer, vice president of Youngstown-based Phantom Fireworks, the nation’s largest retailer of consumer fireworks.

""Fireworks have never been safer, and their use continues to increase each year,"" he wrote. ""This alone provides a strong case for the regulated and sensible use of consumer fireworks.""

Really? Safer than ever?

In 1994, Weimer said, the United States imported 117 million pounds of fireworks, and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported 12,500 fireworks-related injuries. By 2010,  fireworks imports grew more than 75 percent to 205.9 million pounds, but the number of fireworks-related injuries dropped by more than 30 percent to 8,600.

""This is phenomenal progress in safety,"" Weimer wrote, calling on Ohio's General Assembly to relax state laws and legalize consumer fireworks.

PolitiFact Ohio looked at the law and checked the numbers.

Ohio law, which now permits the use of only ""novelty and trick"" fireworks, is among the more restrictive nationally. Three other states have similar laws, and four ban all consumer fireworks. 

Forty-one states and Washington, D.C., allow some or all types of consumer fireworks permitted by federal regulations, according to the American Pyrotechnics Association.

We found that Weimer's numbers, as reported by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Pyrotechnics Association, a trade group, are accurate.

The same day Weimer’s column was published, the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, which set standards for consumer fireworks in 1976, issued its annual fireworks report last week. It confirmed the injury number Weimer used -- 8,600 for 2010.

CPSC spokeswoman Nikki Fleming said the injury rate as measured by injuries per 100,000 persons has leveled off.

The Massachusetts-based National Fire Protection Association takes the position that ""using consumer fireworks is simply not worth the risk,"" division manager Guy Colonna said.

""We don't seem to be trending that rapidly toward zero,"" he said of the injury numbers. ""You
haven't moved the needle so much in terms of saying it's safe for consumers to use.""

The NFPA -- which coordinates the national Alliance to Stop Consumer Fireworks -- said in its annual report in June that there are more fires on a typical July 4th than any other day of the year, and that fireworks account for 40 percent.

Colonna acknowledged statistics showing that the rate of injury per 100,000 pounds of imported fireworks has declined, but said it is ""still a significant number.""

The American Pyrotechnics Association, a trade group, cites the latter statistic. It shows that the rate of injuries dropped from 38 per 100,000 pounds of fireworks in 1976 to 7 in 2000 and to 4 per 100,000 pounds of fireworks in 2010.

The trade group considers that significant because U.S. fireworks consumption has skyrocketed. It more than doubled between 2000, when the trade group says ""the trend in relaxing (state) consumer fireworks laws was first initiated,"" and 2011, when 212 million pounds were sold.

The trade group credits ""safety education efforts and the ever improving quality of its products."" It says that injuries and fires most typically result from illegal fireworks and from improper use, especially involving children.

But does that mean that fireworks themselves are safer?

We asked Weimer what he had to support his statement. He immediately credited the work of the CPSC and the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory.

In the 1970s, the CPSC set federal requirements for consumer fireworks that cover cautionary labeling, the burn time of fuses, explosive powder content, stability for both ground-based and aerial devices and proper performance.

In 1988, the CPSC started an inspection and enforcement program for Chinese-manufactured fireworks. China -- which now supplies 98 percent of the fireworks in the United States -- began exporting fireworks to this country in 1973.

Initially, 75 percent of fireworks tested  by the CPSC failed to comply with the regulations.

""The quality truly wasn't very good,"" Weimer said. ""The quality was inconsistent. The industry knew that if it didn't so something there would be big issues.""

Working with the CPSC, importers established the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory to set additional, stricter requirements for consumer fireworks. The AFSL went to factories in China, conducted seminars, worked with manufacturers and started a testing program in China in 1994.

""The linchpin of the system is the testing,"" Weimer said.

The testing is conducted by an independent laboratory hired from outside China by the AFSL. Each fireworks shipment is tested for compliance with 15 quality standards, Weimer said. If any standard is not met by any of the randomly selected cases, the entire case lot fails.

In the program's first year, 1994, 36 percent of the random lots of tested fireworks were rejected. By 2002, that number was less than 10 percent. The compliance rate exceeded 90 percent.

CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum, speaking at a symposium in China last January, noted that the agency has been working for years with manufacturers and with China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.

""While AQSIQ and CPSC may work to improve product safety with somewhat different motivations, everyone benefits from the end result, which is improved product safety,"" she said, adding that ""we have increased the frequency, scope, and depth of our training in China.""

Weimer thinks that the availability of regulated consumer fireworks diminishes the use of the ""really lethal"" illegal and homemade variety.

So what's the grand finale?

PolitiFact Ohio is not ruling on the advisability of maintaining, relaxing or tightening Ohio laws regulating fireworks. And we’re not taking a position on whether consumer use of fireworks is even a good idea.

Weimer’s statement addressed legal and proper use of fireworks by consumers -- not use of homemade or illegal products. And fireworks are -- as Weimer told us -- a ""product with risk associated with it.""

But, the statistical record shows that the rate of injury from fireworks declined nationally while their use increased dramatically, and while laws governing their consumer use loosened. There still are injuries, but the annual rate has plateaued even while consumption continues to grow.

We found no stronger explanation than the concurrent regulatory and policing work of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory to make fireworks safer.

Weimer’s claim is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter it rates True.","[('\nNews-Herald, ""Another Viewpoint: Time for Ohio to change its fireworks laws,"" June 26, 2012\n\nOhio State Fire Marshal, ""Frequently Asked Questions""\n\nOhio State Bar Association, ""Ohio Law Governs Fireworks,"" June 26, 2012\n\nAmerican Pyrotechnics Association, ""2012 State Fireworks Control Laws,"" Jan. 1, 2012\n\nU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, ""CPSC Special Study on Fireworks Incidents Finds Hundreds of Injuries a Day Surrounding July 4 Holiday Festivities,"" June 26, 2012\n\nCPSC, ""2011 Fireworks Annual Report,"" June 26, 2012\n\nIntervew with Nikki Fleming of CPSC, June 27, 2012\n\nNational Fire Protection Association, ""Fireworks,"" June 21, 2012\n\nInterview with Guy Colonna of NFPA, June 28, 2012\n\nAmerican Pyrotechnics Association, ""Number of Injuries & Fires Decline With Liberalization of Consumer Fireworks Laws,"" June 25, 2012\n\nAmerican Pyrotechnics Association, Fireworks Industry Facts & Figures\n\nInterview with Bill Weimer, Phantom Fireworks, June 29, 2012\n\nAmerican Fireworks Standards Laboratory\n\nArizona Fireworks Newswire, ""Milestones in Fireworks History""\n\nCPSC, Comments by the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory on proposed rulemaking, July 11, 2006\n\nCPSC, Chairman Inez Tenenbaum, ""Fireworks Symposium Remarks,"" Liuyang, China, Jan. 9, 2012\n\nAssociated Press via The Plain Dealer, ""Ohio fire marshal warns against backyard fireworks,"" June 30, 2012', 'http://www.news-herald.com/articles/2012/06/26/opinion/nh5640663.txt')]",/factchecks/2012/jul/04/bill-weimer/fireworks-executive-says-theyve-never-been-safer-a/

Does Portland Public Schools spend $12,000 a year per student?
","Portlanders will vote on a $35 per person annual tax this November, aimed at helping the arts. Mayor Sam Adams, who orchestrated the plan, was on OPB’s Think Out Loud last week touting the proposal as a way to boost music and arts education for children.

On the other side was veteran tax activist Don McIntire. He called the plan ""cockamamie"" and ""frivolous,"" and one which Adams and the city had no business promoting.

""We’re spending $12,000 bucks a kid a year in the school system. If they’re not getting art training that’s the fault of the school system and that needs to be rectified,"" McIntire said on Think Out Loud.

PolitiFact Oregon rang up McIntire for his source. He didn't specify Portland Public Schools on the radio, but he made clear to us that he was talking about the state's largest school district. He said it’s a national average, and he suspects PPS is even higher. In getting back to us with more information, McIntire upped the ante to $15,000 per student. His math is terrifically simple. Follow along.

The adopted budget for Portland Public Schools is $678 million for 2012-13. Resources include a beginning balance, food service sales and government funding. The expenditures category includes salaries, materials and debt service. McIntire subtracted about $11 million for fund transfers, which leaves roughly $667 million.

Divide that by 47,288 students -- which is current enrollment -- and voila, $14,100 per student. McIntire also said we should add $900 per student for education service district support. That, he said, gets us to $15,000.

We asked him if it was fair to include building costs or debt service. Obviously those are not dollars going toward student instruction. McIntire said that it’s entirely fair ""if money is taken and derived from the taxpaying public, and it goes into the system somewhere and it’s spent.""

OK, let’s move on. Next we asked Matt Shelby, spokesman for Portland Public Schools, to ask his people for a figure. He said he’d get back to us. Because PolitiFact Oregon is always on the move, we started looking online and found that the U.S. average in per pupil spending was $10,615 in 2009-10, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. So, there’s some context.

In Oregon, according to the bureau, the number was lower: $9,624 per pupil (page 8). In Portland Public Schools, however, the number was higher: $10,949 (page 106). The averages included salaries and support services, with a portion for school and general administration.

We turned to the Oregon Department of Education, which tracks spending by school district. We zeroed in on a report called operating versus capital expenditures per student. This looked like the report we needed. Hurray!

There we found that the actual amount of money spent statewide per student, on average, in 2010-11 was $9,362. In Portland Public Schools, the per student spending was higher at $11,830. That is very close to $12,000. To short-circuit the process, we asked Shelby the spokesman if Portland Public Schools officials were comfortable with that breakdown. He said they were.

We will not rule on McIntire’s revised statement that the district spends about $15,000 on each student a year. He and others may think that’s a better estimate of how much money the district has -- and therefore, what it can afford to spend on arts education -- but that’s not what he said publicly. We will rule on the $12,000 per student figure instead.

The best historical numbers we have are state figures that show that Portland Public Schools in 2010-11 spent $11,830 per pupil. (The same report shows capital outlay per student was about $400, and $777 statewide.)

Now, let’s go back to Portland Public Schools’ 2012-13 adopted budget. If you add together salaries, benefits, materials and services -- in other words, take out debt, capital and contingencies-- you get nearly $542 million. Divide that by the number of students and we end up at $11,459 per student. Again, we think that’s pretty close to $12,000.

With debt and capital -- the way McIntire and some others think is more accurate -- the number would be more than $12,000. It would be anywhere from $13,200 (without contingency and ending fund balance) to $14,100 (if those categories are included) to $15,000 (if he is correctly adding education service district costs to the budget).

His larger point is that the district, spending roughly $12,000 a student, has enough money to pay for arts and music classes. A higher number just makes his point stronger.

Whether any of that is enough for Portland Public Schools to offer art and music instruction without a $35 per-person income tax is not for us to decide. McIntire’s statement is accurate and we rule it True.","[('Interview with and emails from Don McIntire, June 26, 30, 2012\nEmails from and interview with Matt Shelby, spokesman, Portland Public Schools, June 28, July 2, 2012\nInterview with and email from Michael Elliott, state school fund coordinator, and Christine Miles, spokeswoman, Oregon Department of Education, July 2, 2012\nOregon Public Broadcasting, Think Out Loud, June 26, 2012\nThe Oregonian, ""Oregon\'s new normal: School spending consistently trails the national average,"" May 30, 2011\nPolitiFact Oregon, ""Portland Public Schools paints picture of declining state funding over past few years,"" April 23, 2011\nPortland Public Schools, ""Approved Budget for the fiscal year 2012/13 School District No. 1J, Multnomah County, Oregon,"" 2012\nNational Center for Education Statistics, ""Fast Facts: Expenditures""\nU.S. Census Bureau, Public School Finance Data, 2010 data\nU.S. Census Bureau, ""Public Education Finances: 2010,"" June 2012\nOregon Department of Education, ""Actual Operating vs Capital Expenditures per Student,"" 2010-2011', 'http://www.opb.org/thinkoutloud/shows/proposed-portland-arts-tax/')]",/factchecks/2012/jul/03/don-mcintire/does-portland-public-schools-spend-12000-year-stud/

Facebook post compares corporate, individual tax burden in 1950, today
","
A reader recently forwarded us a Facebook post that sought to blame corporations for not carrying their fair share of the tax burden. It read, ""According to the Office of Management and Budget, back in 1950, corporations paid $3 in taxes for every $1 by a worker. Today, they pay 22 cents for every $1 by a worker.""

We wondered whether that was true.

The Facebook post was credited to an activist group called ""The Other 98 Percent,"" which describes itself as at the forefront of a ""new movement to kick corporate lobbyists out of D.C., hold our elected officials accountable, and fix our democracy to make Washington work for the other 98% of us."" We tried to reach the group through its website but did not receive a response.

The Facebook post cited the Office of Management and Budget -- the executive branch’s budget-policy arm -- but it didn’t get any more specific than that. When we went to OMB’s website, we found some historical data that addresses this claim.

The simplest ratio to use is the ratio of corporate income taxes paid to individual income taxes paid. In 1950, corporations paid 66 cents in income taxes for every dollar of income taxes paid by individuals -- nowhere near the ratio claimed in the Facebook post. In 2011, corporations paid 17 cents in income taxes for every dollar in income taxes paid by individuals. That’s not exactly 22 cents, but it’s in the ballpark.

By this measurement, then, the Facebook post is misleading. It’s true that the share of income taxes paid by corporations has declined over the years, but not as dramatically as the post suggests. In addition, it was never the case in 1950 that corporate income taxes even equaled the level of individual income tax revenues, much less tripled them.

You can also use a more detailed ratio. Under this formula, total corporate taxes consists of corporate income taxes plus the employer’s share of payroll taxes. Individual taxes consist of individual income taxes, plus the employee’s share of the payroll tax, plus excise taxes (such as levies on alcohol, tobacco, telecommunications and gasoline), plus the estate tax.

Using this formula, the ratio in 1950 was 48 cents paid by corporations for every dollar paid by workers -- even more incorrect than it was using our first calculation. In 2011, the ratio was 37 cents paid by corporations for every dollar by workers.

So using these numbers, the Facebook post is misleading as well.

""The assertion is plain wrong,"" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.

""This seems to be a very flippant comment without any basis,"" agreed William McBride, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax issues.

Part of the reason for the shift from corporate taxes to individual taxes is that a significant chunk of individual taxes are actually, in effect, business taxes, since more business owners have chosen to be taxed as individuals rather than as corporations, McBride said. If it were possible to reliably separate out such taxes and shift them from the individual column to the corporate column, the premise of the Facebook post would likely be further weakened.

Our ruling

The one thing the Facebook claim gets right is that corporations are carrying less of the burden for taxation now compared to 1950. But the difference is not nearly as dramatic as the Facebook post indicates, and its numbers are wide of the mark. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.","[('\nFacebook post, received June 2012', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist02z1.xls'), ('\nOffice of Management and Budget, Table 2.1—Receipts by Source: 1934–2017, accessed July 2, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nOffice of Management and Budget, Table 2.4—Composition of Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts and of Excise Taxes: 1940–2017, accessed July 2, 2012', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist02z4.xls'), ('\nOffice of Management and Budget, Table 2.5—Composition of ""Other Receipts"": 1940–2017, accessed July 2, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nTax Foundation, ""Social Security and Medicare Tax Rates, Calendar Years 1937 - 2009,"" accessed July 2, 2012', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist02z5.xls'), ('\nEmail interview with William McBride, economist at the Tax Foundation, July 2, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, July 3, 2012', 'http://taxfoundation.org/article/social-security-and-medicare-tax-rates-calendar-years-1937-2009')]",/factchecks/2012/jul/03/facebook-posts/facebook-post-compares-corporate-individual-tax-bu/

David Dewhurst says he ""passed"" eight notable measures, including anti-groping and anti-sanctuary-city proposals
","
David Dewhurst pitched his U.S. Senate candidacy at the Republican Party of Texas convention by casting himself as an ace lawmaker. 
""You know some people are all about talk. I'm about results,"" Dewhurst told delegates June 9, adding a moment later: ""Every victory, every conservative victory, I've had, I've had to bleed and fight to accomplish it, ...always adhering to our conservative principles, and refusing to take no for an answer.""

Dewhurst, who faces Ted Cruz, a lawyer and former Texas solicitor general, in a July 31, 2012, runoff for his party’s nomination, then said: ""Over the last several years, I’ve passed defunding Planned Parenthood, the sonogram bill, voter ID. I passed the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) anti-groping bill, sanctuary cities, loser pay, border security, and the toughest Jessica’s law in the entire nation against sexual predators.""

As the state’s lieutenant governor, Dewhurst presides over the Texas Senate. Was he really 8-for-8 in advancing those measures into law?

Most of them made it.

Lawmakers in 2011 agreed on measures defunding Planned Parenthood clinics, requiring pregnant women to view a sonogram before receiving an abortion and mandating that voters present photo IDs at the polls. With Gov. Rick Perry’s approval, the 2011 Legislature also passed ""loser pays,"" a measure intended to make it easier for judges to dismiss lawsuits, and agreed to a two-year, $70-million increase in border security funding to the Department of Public Safety, as we noted in checking a Perry campaign promise.

Earlier, the 2007 Legislature approved Jessica’s Law; it permitted the death penalty for offenders twice-convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child under 14. However, the death penalty element was struck down by a 2008 Supreme Court ruling against Louisiana’s similar law; the court held that capital punishment for such offenders was cruel and excessive, according to a June 26, 2008, Austin American-Statesman news article.

However, high-profile proposals to bar airport security officers from groping passengers and to keep cities from discouraging police officers from checking the immigration status of residents did not make it into law -- and news articles and legislative records indicate that the only way the proposals ""passed"" on Dewhurst’s watch is that versions cleared the Senate before dying in the House.

Let’s recap.

State Rep. David Simpson, R-Longview, proposed his anti-groping measure on March 7, 2011, about three months into the year’s regular legislative session, records show. Simpson’s House Bill 1937, which aimed to limit where airport security could touch an individual during pat-down checks by making inappropriate contact a state crime, cleared the House, but died in the Senate after sponsoring Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, withdrew it, according to a May 26, 2011, El Paso Times news article.

According to a May 24, 2011, Statesman blog post, the proposal had lost momentum, and much of its support, after John Murphy of San Antonio, the first assistant U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, wrote lawmakers, saying that the legislation would ""criminalize searches that are required under federal regulations."" According to the blog post, Murphy advised, too, that the federal government would pursue legal action to prevent its enforcement. This, Murphy’s letter said, would likely require the government ""to cancel any flight or series of flights for which it could not ensure the safety of the passengers and crew,"" the Statesman reported.

Perry brought the topic back to life by adding it, on June 20, 2011, to the agenda of a summer special legislative session. A week later, two days before the session’s end, the Senate passed its bill, Senate Bill 29, according to a June 27, 2011, Statesman news article.  On the session’s final day, House advocates fell short of the votes needed to send the measure to Perry, according to a June 29, 2011 Statesman news article.

On the last day of the special session, Dewhurst, a vocal proponent of the measure during the special session, drew criticism from House members, who blamed the lieutenant governor for the bill’s demise, according to that June 29, 2011 Statesman article. They claimed that by adjourning the Senate before the House had even voted on the bill, Dewhurst had weakened its chances of passing into law.

House critics said that by adjourning early, Dewhurst and the Senate had put the representatives in an uncomfortable position. Rep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas told the Tribune on June 28, 2011, that the Senate had left the House in a ""take it or leave it"" position, forcing representatives to either pass SB 29 as was or deny it outright, since the House wouldn’t have an opportunity to negotiate the bill’s terms with the Senate.  

One recap down, one to go.

So-called sanctuary cities -- defined as places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally -- were central to Perry’s 2010 re-election. Perry ran against Democratic nominee Bill White, who Perry claimed had allowed Houston to become a sanctuary city during his tenure as mayor.

On January 11, 2011, Perry declared sanctuary cities an ""emergency"" issue for lawmakers, according to a Statesman news article published that day. A proposal banning sanctuary cities cleared the House during the fifth and last month of the regular session, according to a May 10, 2011, Statesman blog post, as House Democrats said the ban would effectively make Hispanic Texans second-class citizens.

Despite Democrats’ attempt to prevent the measure from advancing, the legislation passed out of a Senate committee on May 20, 2011, according to a Statesman news article posted that night. Still, the session ended without there being enough Senate support to bring it up for consideration. According to a May 26, 2011, Statesman news article, a vote to bring up the measure on the Senate floor was 19-12, along party lines. The proposal needed twenty-one votes, two-thirds of the Senate membership, to win consideration.

Next, Perry resurrected the topic during the summer special session, according to his June 7, 2011, proclamation. The special session proceeded without the Senate observing the two-thirds’ hurdle, so SB 9 passed the Senate in mid-June, according to a June 15, 2011, Statesman news article.

But, in a reverse of the regular session turns, the anti-sanctuary-city measure died in the House. According to a June 30, 2011, news article posted by the Texas Tribune, both SB 9 and the House’s version of the bill, House Bill 9, languished in the House State Affairs Committee through the end of session.

Dewhurst fumed, saying two days before the session ended: ""I don't pretend to understand the House... I have enough challenges with running the Senate that I'm not going to get into the House business, but I would love to see the House come together and take that legislation so we can send it directly to the governor,"" according to a June 27, 2011, news article in the Tribune.  

When we pointed out that these two proposals, unlike the others cited by Dewhurst, did not make it into law, Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch said we were ""picking at word choices.""

Our ruling

In his speech, Dewhurst listed the unsuccessful sanctuary and anti-groping proposals with other proposals, saying he ""passed"" each of them -- a characterization leaving the impression that every one of them became a statute. That's correct for six of them. But the fact that the sanctuary and anti-groping measures fell short amounts to vital missing detail, making his statement Half True.","[('\nPerry-O-Meter article, Politifact Texas, ""Perry keeps promises on border security, trafficking,"" \xa0July 7, 2011\n\nNews articles and blog posts, Austin-American Statesman, ""Court ruling weakens child-rape law in Texas,"" June 26, 2008; Lawmakers face budget crisis, imperative from Perry,"" January 11, 2011; House, still simmering, OKs sanctuary city bill in late-night vote,"" May 10, 2011; ""Senator\'s maneuver derails sanctuary cities legislation,"" May 18, 2011; ""\'Sanctuary cities\' bill brought back to life,"" May 20, 2011; ""Senate fight erupts over ‘airport groping’ bill,"" May 24, 2011; ""House speaker calls pat-down bill a stunt,"" June 24, 2011; ""Senate stirs pot with TSA groping bill, sanctuary cities,"" May 25, 2011; ""New rules, new outcome as Senate OKs sanctuary cities bill,"" June 15, 2011; ""Legislature passes budget, health bills,"" June 27, 2011; \xa0""Special session ends in acrimony and failure of airport pat-down bill,"" June 29, 2011\n\nNews article, El Paso Times, ""Measure restricting pat-downs derailed in Senate,"" May 26, 2011\n\nNews articles, Texas Tribune, ""Fed Threat Shuts Down TSA ""Groping"" Bill in Texas,"" May 24, 2011; ""Dewhurst: It\'s Up to the House to Pass Sanctuary Cities,"" June 27, 2011; ""Senate Adjourns, Leaves TSA in House\'s Lap,"" June 28, 2011;""Lawmakers Call it Quits, Leave Unfinished Business,"" June 29, 2011; ""Sine Die Report: What Survived, What Died,"" June 30, 2011;\n\nProclamations regarding special session agendas, Gov.

Mitt Romney says Dow Chemical chose Saudi Arabia over Oklahoma for plant
","
Mitt Romney likes to draw a straight line between environmental regulations and the jobs they cost. That was the thrust of his statement at a Frankenmuth, Mich., campaign event on June 19, 2012.  Romney said Oklahoma lost out on a plant that Dow Chemical ended up building in Saudi Arabia.

Citing a conversation he'd had with a person from Dow, Romney told his audience at a business roundtable, ""They said they couldn't rely on the natural gas here given the environmental regulation and whether it would be an abundant supply and reliable or not."" 

We dug into the history and found the decision was actually made years ago. In 2007, Dow announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the oil giant Saudi Aramco to build a ""world-scale chemicals and plastics production complex"" in Saudi Arabia. This $20 billion joint venture would be the largest of its kind in the world.

But Romney wasn’t highlighting a Dow project by itself. He was saying it could have happened in Oklahoma. We asked the Romney campaign to back up the claim that Dow had picked Saudi Arabia over Oklahoma for reasons related to the natural gas supply. We never heard back.

We asked Dow if Oklahoma had ever been in the running as a possible location for that facility. The company never responded to that direct question. 
Instead, a spokesman released a statement that said Saudi Arabia was a good fit for the company’s goals of being able to serve growing markets, to develop new product lines and to operate in places where the costs give the company an advantage.

On the subject of the natural gas supply, Dow said supply issues did matter in the days before natural gas from shale began flooding the market. Until then, ""the climate for investment in the U.S. was increasingly challenging, resulting in decisions to preferentially invest in geographies with more stable, competitive energy and (natural gas) costs.""

The Dow statement went on to say that situation has changed. What it calls the ""shale gale"" has made the U.S. ""a place where we can once again invest and grow."" In April of this year, Dow announced it would build an ethylene production plant in Freeport, Texas, creating about 150 permanent jobs and about 2,000 construction jobs. That investment is part of a larger U.S. investment plan by the company in Texas and Louisiana that could add some 35,000 jobs nationwide.

The company says this activity notwithstanding, the ""need for regulatory reform remains critical."" 
But still, nothing about Oklahoma.

We searched the Dow Chemical website, reviewed the company’s past annual data books -- the ones it packages for investors -- and checked with a variety of trade publications for any mention of Oklahoma as a potential location for Dow’s future plants. No luck. 
We called the Oklahoma Department of Commerce. The deputy general counsel, Don Hackler, also drew a blank. 
""That doesn't sound familiar,"" Hackler said. ""I don't remember it coming up."" 
Hackler added that if Dow had been interested, his department would have likely heard, if for no other reason than the state offers incentives to companies who invest in Oklahoma. 
Al Greenwood who covers Dow for ICIS, an international news service for the petrochemical industry, said the assertion that Oklahoma was under serious consideration sounds like a stretch.

""You don’t produce these compounds out of thin air,"" Greenwood said. ""Dow needs feedstocks (of natural gas) and in the U.S., the feedstock hubs are in Texas and Louisiana. I don’t know why they would ever consider Oklahoma.""

Greenwood added that the Saudi Arabian investments put manufacturing closer to the boom markets of China and India and came with another important benefit -- ready access to propylene. Many of the products Dow wants to make in Saudi Arabia require a lot of propylene. Propylene is in short supply in the U.S. because it is most readily derived from oil, not natural gas. As is often noted, Saudi Arabia has plenty of oil. Oklahoma offers Dow no advantage in either market access or raw materials.

Our ruling

Mitt Romney said that a Dow official told him that the company opted to build a plant in Saudi Arabia rather than Oklahoma due to the state’s limited supply of natural gas thanks to environmental regulations. If that's case, no record of it appears to exist, Romney's campaign didn't offer any evidence to back it up and neither did Dow.

"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'Debbie Dooley']","
Tea party leader makes case for telecommuting
","
Transportation planners and elected officials across metro Atlanta spent about two years coming up with a comprehensive list to resolve some of the region’s traffic troubles and a way to pay for it.

Meanwhile, a tea party leader who opposes the plan has some ideas of her own to ease traffic congestion. And one of them involves no taxpayer funds being spent.

Encourage more people to telecommute -- to work from home.

""Statistics show that more people at this time telecommute than they ride carpools, mass transit, bicycle or walk,"" Atlanta Tea Party Patriots co-founder Debbie Dooley said during a June 12 forum organized by the Civic League for Regional Atlanta.

PolitiFact Georgia has seen some long lines of people waiting to ride MARTA or some of the suburban bus systems around town. There couldn’t possibly be more people who work from home than take public transportation or carpool. Or is Dooley right?

Dooley said she did not mean to include carpools in her statement. She sent us an email distributed the day before the forum in which she made a similar argument about telecommuting but did not mention carpools. We still decided to examine the entire claim, since the audience wasn’t aware she did not intend to mention carpools.

There’s little research on telecommuting. And much of it is several years old or questionable. In some cases, people who do work at someone’s home, like a plumber, are included as people who work at a home-based business.

Most organizations use U.S. Census Bureau data to base their reports about the percentage of people who telecommute. In recent years, there’s been criticism from some members of Congress and a few statistical experts about the survey’s accuracy.

Dooley said she based her statement on a report by the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a fiscally conservative think tank based in Atlanta. The report examined the transportation plan, commonly referred to as T-SPLOST. Metro Atlanta residents will vote July 31 whether to approve a penny-per-dollar increase in sales tax to pay for billions of dollars in new transportation  projects.

Supporters say the 1 percent sales tax will fund projects to help untangle the metro region’s legendary traffic jams. Opponents, such as Dooley, say it will have little impact on traffic congestion while burdening taxpayers with billions in new sales taxes. 

The foundation’s report contains a chart from the Census Bureau that measured the percentage of residents in 10 major metropolitan areas who use various forms of transportation or telecommute. In the Atlanta area, nearly 78 percent of commuters drive alone. No surprise there. That was second among the list of cities. Dallas was first at 80 percent; New York was last at 50.4 percent.

The rest of the list for Atlanta went as follows: 
The report was based on 2009 research from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Census Bureau survey statistician Kin Koerber said those percentages were close to the mark in each category. The percentage of those who telecommuted was slightly higher and has increased in recent years. 

Researchers interviewed about 60,000 metro Atlanta residents and asked them where they work, which means of transportation they use, their departure time to work and their commute time. There are about 2.2 million metro Atlanta residents currently employed, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That equates to 1 out of 37 employed Atlantans interviewed.

A September 2011 Census Bureau report on how people across the nation get to work had similar numbers to Atlanta, but there was a key difference. The percentage of Americans who use public transit (5 percent) was slightly higher than those who worked at home (4.3 percent).

The most recent Census Bureau data show more people telecommute in the Atlanta area than use public transit, bike or walk to work. The national census data show slightly more people use public transit than telecommute. 

But Dooley overshot those numbers by throwing in carpools. First lady Michelle Obama recently made a verbal slip-up in a statement about the percentage of public high schools that offer physical education classes. She meant to say only 2 percent offer those classes daily. Obama  got a False on the Truth-O-Meter. 

In this case, Dooley’s overall thrust of her statement is correct. But including carpools into the mix takes it down a notch or two on the Truth-O-Meter.

Our ruling: Half True.","[('\nCivic League for Regional Atlanta forum video, June 12, 2012', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj5ajsUpbfI&feature=youtu.be'), ('\nAmerican Public Transportation Association 2011 Factbook', 'No link'), ('\nGeorgia Public Policy Foundation report on Transportation Investment Act', 'http://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Documents/FactBook/APTA_2011_Fact_Book.pdf'), ('\nGlobal Workplace Analytics statistics on telecommuting', 'No link'), ('\nMARTA fact sheet, 2010', 'http://www.gppf.org/pub/Transportation/120523IATSPLOSTFINAL.pdf'), ('\nThe New York Times news analysis, ""The Beginning of the End of the Census,"" May 19, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""American Time Use Survey Summary Release,"" June 22, 2012', 'http://www.teleworkresearchnetwork.com/telecommuting-statistics'), ('\nU.S. Census Bureau, ""Commuting in the United States 2009,"" Issued September 2011', 'No link'), ('\nWorkshifting.com, ""How Many People Actually Telecommute?""

Rick Scott's story of a small business doesn't match with the law's actual rules
","
People who work in small businesses are fearful of being forced to provide health insurance to full-time employees.

Gov. Rick Scott, who entered the political fray in 2009 on a strictly anti-""Obamacare"" platform, says they’re confessing their fears to him.

""I was in a business the other day, and they walked up to me and they said, 'Governor, is this really going to become the law?' "" Scott told Fox News host Greta Van Susteren on June 29, 2012. "" 'Because if it does, we’re out of business. We have 20 employees. We know we won’t be able to buy any health care for anybody.' ""

Scott’s story was similar to one he told in Tampa earlier that day and at the Reagan Day Dinner of Pasco County Republicans that night. Scott told attendees at the dinner he was stopping in for a Blizzard at Dairy Queen when he was asked about the law.

A Tampa Bay Times reporter tracked down a Dairy Queen owner in Tallahassee who said he recently talked with Scott about how complying with the law would hurt his business.

The owner, Jamshaid Mohyuddin, 47, said he told the governor that he couldn’t afford to provide health insurance to his 16 employees.

""I'm a businessman myself, and I don’t even have health insurance,"" Mohyuddin said. ""I can’t afford it.""

Scott encouraged him to link up with other business owners to support Mitt Romney's campaign for president, Mohyuddin said.

Scott’s communications staff didn’t confirm that Scott was talking about Mohyuddin. Really, though, it’s not so important for the purposes of this fact-check.

What’s important is this: They are mistaken. Businesses with fewer than 50 full-time employees are not required to offer coverage. (See sections 1513 and 4980H of the Affordable Care Act).

For larger companies, those with 50 or more full-time employees, there are fines if they do not offer insurance and one of their employees qualifies for government-subsidized insurance.

But again, small employers don’t face those fines.

While there are no penalties for small businesses like the one Scott described, the law offers tax credits for these employers if they decide to offer coverage.

Employers with fewer than 25 employees, whose average annual wages are below $50,000 and offer health insurance, qualify for a tax break of no more than 35 percent. That cap will be lifted to 50 percent in 2014.

The law also creates a health insurance exchange for small businesses, with the idea being they can comparison shop for plans.

Mohyuddin was elated when a reporter told him that the law exempts him from penalties for not offering health insurance.

""That helps me a lot,"" Mohyuddin said. ""I always thought I had to do this.""

Our ruling

Scott repeated an anecdote about a business of about 20 employees that will go broke from having to offer health insurance under the law. But these employers would face no such penalty like the one described. They are exempt from requirements put on larger businesses. If he knew the basic facts about the health care law, he would know that.

Rick Scott says Medicaid expansion will cost state $1.9 billion
","
Gov. Rick Scott announced June 29, 2012, that Florida will not expand its Medicaid program, saying that provision of the federal health care law would cost the state an additional $1.9 billion a year.

""It’s going to cost Florida $1.9 billion a year,"" Scott said July 2, 2012, while co-hosting CNBC’s Squawk Box. Scott repeated the $1.9 billion claim on Fox News June 29 and July 2, on CNN July 1 and in a July 1 official statement.

Don’t believe it.

Scott’s Medicaid figure is an oversimplified estimate that relies on several assumptions and ignores how the Medicaid expansion would actually be implemented. Even if you believe the assumptions and ignore how the law would be implemented, Scott is still quoting the wrong number, according to an estimate created by his own Agency for Health Care Administration.

By now, you’ve probably read about the proposed Medicaid expansion, which was part of the 2010 federal health care law. But you’ve also likely missed some critical details in the few paragraphs of background you’ve seen.

Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health care program for the very poor. (Its cousin, Medicare, is for senior citizens of any income level.) Medicaid is an entirely voluntary program for the states -- but every state participates -- in part because of the good financial terms. The federal government covers about 55 percent of all Medicaid costs in Florida and covered about 68 percent in recent years with additional stimulus funding.

The health care law required states to expand eligibility to Medicaid by raising income eligibility limits to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. States currently have widely varying thresholds depending on a person’s age and situation, and Florida has some of the strictest thresholds in the country. For instance, childless adults cannot receive Medicaid in Florida, and parents who have children must make less than 22 percent of the federal poverty level to receive Medicaid. (That means a single parent of one would have to make less than about $3,500 a year to qualify for Medicaid in Florida.)

The federal government agreed to fund 100 percent of the cost for states to expand Medicaid for three budget years. The federal government would cover 95 percent of the costs in 2017, 94 percent of the costs in 2018, 93 percent of the costs in 2019 and 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond.

The expansion, too, was technically voluntary, but the federal government said it would penalize any state (by withholding Medicaid funds) that failed to comply. That penalty was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 28, 2012.

The court’s ruling allows states like Florida to decline expansion without losing any current funding.

That brings us back to Scott.

His own Agency for Health Care Administration attempted to quantify the financial impact to the state because of the changes to Medicaid (which is quite different than the expansion of Medicaid Scott is talking about). We received a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation of the agency’s findings, dated Jan. 4, 2012.

The state first assumed that there are people who currently qualify for Medicaid, pre-expansion, but have not enrolled for one reason or another. They would come forward, however, in the new system. The cost to Florida: $516 million a year.

The state also figured that there are people currently privately purchasing insurance who would abandon their private plans because they would be eligible for Medicaid as part of the expansion. That would cost Florida another $90 million a year.

And of course the state estimated the number of people who would be eligible for the Medicaid expansion and would apply. The cost: $500 million.

Most of these costs, mind you, would not kick in until 2020 -- a fact Scott ignores.

That said, the state estimates the Medicaid expansion -- which the state says would provide health insurance for an additional 2 million Floridians -- would cost about $1 billion a year starting in 2020.

More than half of that cost, however, would come from people who today are eligible for Medicaid but have not yet enrolled. That cost could come whether or not Florida agrees to participate in the Medicaid expansion.

The state health care agency lumps in another $400 million in costs each year for increased rates for Medicaid primary care physicians in its report. But we’re not sure why.

The rate increase was part of the federal health care law -- not the Medicaid expansion -- as a way to make reimbursement rates the same for Medicare and Medicaid patients. But the rate increase was only temporary for 2013 and 2014, and was fully funded by the federal government. Florida could decide to continue paying higher reimbursement rates, but it is not required to.

So the state’s most generous estimate is that the Medicaid changes as part of the federal health care law will cost the state about $1.47 billion a year starting in 2020. But really, the expansion to Medicaid -- the part Scott is fighting -- would cost the state about a little more than $500 million once it’s fully implemented in 2020, according to the state. 
(We should note that a Tallahassee group called the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy has criticized the state estimates, saying its figures are ""hyper-inflated."" We're not taking a side on the estimates as a whole as it pertains to this fact-check.)

The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation put the additional cost to the state between $1.2 billion and $2.5 billion between 2014 and 2019, which is roughly between $200 million and $400 million a year. That would help insure between 950,000 and 1.3 million Floridians. (Kaiser did not calculate a cost to the state in 2020, when Florida would pay for 10 percent of the expansion.)

Our ruling

In triumphantly declaring that Florida will reject a provision of the federal health care law that expands Medicaid coverage, Gov. Rick Scott told national television audiences that the expansion would cost Florida $1.9 billion a year. 
The most recent estimate from the state health care agency says a series of changes to Medicaid could wind up costing about $1.4 billion a year, but that number includes things beyond the expansion to Medicaid that Scott was talking about. 
For instance, about $400 million is tied to increased reimbursement payments to Medicaid providers. But the state isn't required to pay that out. 
And another estimated $516 million will pay for people who are eligible for Medicaid under its current provisions but have not enrolled. They would remain eligible whether or not the program is expanded in Florida. 
That leaves about $500 million in estimated new costs for Medicaid patients under the federal government expansion. And that cost would not fully kick in until 2020. 
So yes, the Medicaid expansion will cost the state.

But Scott’s $1.9 billion claim appears to be wildly high. We rate this claim False.","[('\nGov.

Rick Scott says the health care law rations care, like systems in Canada and Great Britain
","
Gov. Rick Scott continues to oppose the national health care law and said Friday that Florida would be opting out of parts of the law.

In a blitz of media appearances over the week, Scott said the state would not expand Medicaid, an existing health insurance program for the very poor. He also said he wouldn’t allow the state to open health insurance ""exchanges,"" places where consumers will comparison shop for health insurance.

Scott also repeated the claim that the health care law rations care. Scott said driving down the costs of health care should be left to the free market, and that expanding government-run health insurance programs to the uninsured was a bad idea.

""Insurance is not the answer. (The answer is to) drive down the cost of health care. You have insurance in places like U.K. and Canada, where they say, oh we cover you. But you don’t get it, because it’s rationed. That’s what’s going to happen,"" Scott said in an interview on Fox News on July 2. 
Earlier in the interview, Scott said: ""Look, government health care programs everywhere in the world do three things. They promise you the world. They say, oh we’re going to cover everything. Then what they do is they run out of money and they underpay hospitals, doctors, and guess what happens? They don’t want to take care of you. There’s fewer of them, just like what’s happened in England, Canada, places like that.""

Scott’s answer is problematic on several levels. For one thing, people in the United Kingdom and Canada do receive care. Sometimes patients have to wait for appointments, but they do receive care.

More significantly, Scott implied that the types of systems in Canada and the United Kingdom are what’s going to happen under the current health care law. That’s not the case.

In Canada, the government pays the bills for health care for everyone. The closest comparison for this country would be if Medicare (the health insurance program for people over age 65) were extended to everyone. In the United Kingdom, the government runs the National Health Service, directly owning hospitals and employing doctors.

The health care law does neither of those two things. Instead, it leaves in place the current systems of Medicare, Medicaid and employer-provided insurance. It expands Medicaid coverage for the very poor, and offers credits to people of modest means to buy insurance on their own. To make those purchases easier, it creates health insurance exchanges, where plans have to meet minimum standards and explain their coverage in plain language.

On the specific charge of ""rationing,"" we’ve fact-checked several claims about the health care law, that various parts of the law result in rationing. Scott’s statement doesn’t refer to a specific part of the law.

Here’s the bottom line: The health care law rations care no more nor less than the current health care system does.

The current health care system  -- whether it’s private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid -- does not allow people to have all the health care as they want. Under the new law, people still can’t have all the health care they want.

"['Virginia', 'Majority PAC']","
Majority PAC says Tim Kaine made Virginia the best state for business
","
The Majority PAC, an advocacy group for Democrats, has jumped into Virginia’s ad wars to boost U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine.

One of its TV spots starts by slamming Republican nominee George Allen’s record during his term in the Senate from 2001 to 2007. Then the ad exalts Kaine’s record as governor from 2006 to 2010.

""But Tim Kaine? He made Virginia the best state for business four years in a row,"" the narrator says.

In citations in the ad and on its website, Majority PAC bases its claim on a story in The Virginian-Pilot on September 24, 2009 about then-Gov. Kaine’s announcement that Forbes magazine had named Virginia the best state for business for the fourth consecutive year.

We’ll stipulate that Forbes proclaimed Virginia the best state for business each year of Kaine’s governorship, a fact we have previously noted. On April 7, 2011, we gave a True rating to Kaine’s statement that during his governorship, various publications had named Virginia ""best managed state, best state for business and best state to raise a child.""

But Majority Pac’s commercial adds a wrinkle. It says Kaine ""made’’ Virginia the best state for business.

So in this Truth-O-Meter, we will examine whether Kaine’s efforts as governor were the reason Virginia topped Forbes’ lists.

Kurt Badenhausen, a senior editor at Forbes who works on the state rankings, was reluctant to say whether Kaine was responsible for Virginia’s No. 1 status. ""I’ll just say that we base the rankings on 30-something economic metrics,"" he told us.

Badenhausen said the metrics fall into six categories: business costs, labor supplies, regulatory environment, current economic climate, the state’s growth prospects and quality of life.

As our collegues at FactCheck.org recently noted, Forbes started its annual ""best state"" rankings in August 2006 --  just seven months into Kaine’s term as governor. That was hardly enough time for Kaine to have major impact on the Virginia’s business climate. Kaine didn’t take credit for the honor, and was quoted in the 2006 Forbes article saying the state had a ""bipartisan tradition of wanting to have a strong business climate.""

The 2006 article lauded Virginia for a number of attributes that had been decades and longer in the making. Forbes noted Virginia’s low corporate income tax of 6 percent, a level that had existed for more than 30 years.

The magazine also said Virginia’s top-notch AAA bond rating kept the state from ""nickel and diming its corporate constituents."" The state has had a AAA credit rating since 1938.

The article said, ""Virginia gets a ""tremendous benefit from its location and infrastructure. The state is located within 750 miles of two-thirds of the U.S. population. It is home to one of the country's busiest international airports, Washington Dulles International, and the country's fifth busiest port, Hampton Roads.""

Forbes listed as among ""Virginia’s strongest attributes"" the University of Virginia (founded in 1819) and The College of William & Mary (founded in 1693).

We should note that Virginia was highly regarded by Forbes in 2005 -- the year before Kaine entered office.

That year, Forbes ranked the nation’s 150 largest metropolitan areas by their friendliness to starting a business or a career. Virginia had three regions on the Top 20 list: Washington DC-Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads and metropolitan Richmond. Only Texas had more, with four areas in the Top 20.

Forbes wrote, ""Where are the best places to jumpstart a business or a career? Texas and Virginia, with highly educated labor forces and relatively low business costs, score well on our annual rankings of the 150 biggest metros. No other state places more than one locale in the upper echelon.""

Virginia ranked second behind Utah on the Forbes best state list in 2010 and 2011 under Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell.

Our ruling

Majority Pac says Tim Kaine ""made Virginia the best state for business four years in a row.""

The state earned the honor from Forbes Magazine for four straight years when Kaine was governor, but it’s wrong to say Kaine created the conditions that led to Virginia’s selection.

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson says public-private pay gap after collective bargaining changes is still large
","
On the morning after Gov. Scott Walker rolled to victory in the recall election, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) made it clear the battle over public employee pay and benefits is far from over. 
Appearing on Charlie Sykes’ talk show on WTMJ-AM (620), Johnson cited Walker’s move to curb collective bargaining and make public employees pay more for pensions and health care. He said the measure, known as Act 10, only had a slight impact on the disparities between public and private sector workers in Wisconsin. 
And Johnson cited a new study to prove his point. 
Johnson said that even after the changes, ""the pension benefits for public sector employees is still four and a half times richer than the private sector, and the health benefits are two times richer than the private sector."" 
He continued: ""Before Act 10, the total cost of public sector employees’ employment was 29 percent higher than that in the private sector. After the act, it’s still 22 percent higher."" 
Johnson added this footnote: 
""I do want to point out … about those statistics that I just spouted in case people want to punch holes in them. That was just a study by Heritage and AEI working together and that does factor in equal educational experience and equal types of job classifications. So this isn’t just because public sector employees are higher educated or have more important jobs. This equalizes that and it’s still 22 percent higher cost."" 
That comparison caught our attention, since no one had highlighted it during the recall itself. 
We started with the report, since Johnson cited it directly as his source. 
The report was completed by Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute and Jason Richwine of the Heritage Foundation. The researchers at the conservative think tanks have done numerous studies on public-private pay -- both at the state and federal level -- that show public employees come out ahead in compensation. 
The paper focused on Wisconsin was issued May 30, 2012, less than a week before the June 5, 2012 recall election. 
When we asked several experts on public employment compensation for their take on the paper, we ran into a familiar debate between competing political agendas. 
Indeed, the foes know each other so well, it’s a little like the ""Spy vs Spy"" comic in Mad magazine. Each time either side issues a report, researchers from the other side try to punch holes in it. 
Here’s how the debate plays out on this one. 
The report used a bad comparison: Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, noted the report compares state workers’ compensation to pay and benefits at private sector firms with far fewer workers. He said a state is more properly compared to the state’s largest firms. Such companies, he noted, generally pay better. 
The comparison is fine: Biggs, one of the authors of the paper, said the size of the companies didn’t skew the results. ""We could choose the largest establishment size"" -- firms with more than 500 workers ""and, so long as you value the pensions right, public employees would still have a large advantage.""  
The report used a bad assumption: Brainard and Jeffrey Keefe, a professor at the Rutgers University School of Management and Labor Relations, argue private sector benefits are understated in the report. Specifically, they say the report uses today’s low interest rates to calculate the value of private sector workers’ 401(k), which magnifies the public-private gap. 
They argue that the rate of return, 3.67 percent, is based on low-risk U.S. Treasury securities and  is less than half of what such funds have historically earned over the long-term through investments in stocks, bonds and so forth. Said Brainard: ""The net result is to produce a substantial difference between the current private sector annuity values."" 
The report’s assumptions are valid: Biggs and Richwine said they are trying to treat public and private pensions equally. Using something other than Treasury securities would produce a retirement benefit with far greater risk than found in the public employee retirement system. 
Said Biggs: ""Our approach is consistent with economic theory, with how liabilities are priced in private financial markets, and with the findings of non-partisan government agencies like the Confirmation Budget Office, the Federal Reserve, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (which constructs the National Income and Product Accounts, which are the official 'books' of the US economy)."" 
Keefe said it was impossible to replicate the research using the formula contained in the Biggs-Richwine report. 
Keefe did his own earlier analysis of Wisconsin public-private pay using data from the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. That report, issued in February 2011 as Act 10 was unveiled, found  Wisconsin public employees earn 4.8 percent less in total compensation per hour than comparable full-time employees in Wisconsin’s private sector. 
That’s compared to the Biggs-Richwine study which put the pre-Act 10 gap at 29 percent. 
Why did Johnson chose to highlight the study he did? 
In an emailed statement, Johnson said the study  ""is a product of two highly respected institutions. That said, I don’t endorse the findings of any specific study, or validate their findings."" 
He added: ""No one wants to underpay government workers, but with mounting deficits and debt, we can’t afford to overpay them either. We need to make sure that government sector salaries are benchmarked against those of the private sector. I welcome studies like this one, which help us understand how to set those benchmarks."" 
Our rating 
Johnson argued the changes included in Act 10 were modest -- public employees still receive 22 percent higher wages and benefits than private sector workers. Johnson cited the work of two researchers for conservative think tanks, but later told us he ""doesn’t endorse"" the findings of that study, or ""any specific study."" 
That underlines what we found: There are different ways to measure the same thing. Indeed, an academic came up with a far different pre-Act 10 starting point when he did his own study in 2011. 
There certainly appears to be an element of truth in the study, but it’s not as definitive as Johnson presented it on the radio. And credible independent researchers have raised valid questions about the conclusion. 
We rate Johnson’s statement Mostly False.","[('\nSen.

"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Albio Sires']","
Congressman Albio Sires claims college tuition has increased by 28 percent in the last decade
","
Pointing out how college tuition has increased over the last decade, U.S. Rep. Albio Sires recently called on his colleagues to stop a scheduled increase in interest rates for federally subsidized student loans.

That increase would be ""extremely burdensome"" for students and families at a time when the cost of a college education has grown by nearly one-third in the last 10 years, Sires (D-13th Dist.) said June 20 in a speech on the House floor.

""Just in the past 10 years, college tuition has increased 28 percent,"" Sires said. ""Middle class families are struggling to send their sons and daughters to school. For many Americans, a college education is essential to future success.""

But PolitiFact New Jersey found that the increase in tuition and fees has been even higher than Sires claimed.

Instead of 28 percent, those costs have jumped by about 72 percent at public four-year colleges and universities over the last decade, according to inflation-adjusted figures released by the College Board, the New York-based organization behind the SAT exam and many other higher education programs.

Sires spokeswoman Erica Daughtrey told us the congressman meant to cite the increase over the past five years at public four-year institutions. During that timeframe, tuition and fees grew by roughly 28 percent at those colleges and universities, according to the College Board.

Let’s break down the numbers.

As compiled in the College Board’s ""Trends in College Pricing"" report, the estimates for tuition and fees are based on an annual survey of nearly 4,000 postsecondary institutions across the country. The figures represent average prices for one year of full-time enrollment. 
In the following cost estimates, charges reported by institutions with larger full-time enrollments are weighted more heavily than those with smaller enrollments.

According to the report, after adjusting for inflation, the average tuition and fees for public four-year institutions in the 2011-12 school year was $8,244. That figure marks a roughly 72 percent increase over the $4,793 charged in the 2001-02 school year, the report states.

The average tuition and fees at public two-year institutions grew by about 45 percent during the last decade, after adjusting for inflation, from $2,047 in the 2001-02 school year to $2,963 in the 2011-12 school year, the report states.

The increase in tuition and fees during the last decade has not been as steep at private nonprofit, four-year institutions, according to inflation-adjusted figures in the report.

In the 2011-12 school year, the average cost at those schools was $28,500, representing a nearly 29 percent increase over the $22,117 in tuition and fees for the 2001-02 school year.

The College Board also notes that while tuition and fees have increased during the last decade, average family incomes at all income levels have dropped.

""In addition, the assets many families have saved to pay for college have diminished in value,"" the college board said in the report. ""In other words, rising tuition levels cause more problems because of the economic environment in which they are occurring.""

Our ruling

While discussing a pending increase in interest rates for student loans, Sires said in a speech on the House floor: ""Just in the past 10 years, college tuition has increased 28 percent.""

But according to the College Board, average tuition and fees at public four-year institutions increased by about 72 percent over the last decade. A spokeswoman for the congressman said Sires meant to cite the cost increase at those institutions over the past five years.

So, Sires’ figure for the 10-year period is largely off, but his overall point about the rising cost of a college education is solid.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Dan Ramos says Lorain is the poorest school district in Ohio
","
State lawmakers generally agreed that too many Ohio school children are struggling to read during a debate in June on legislation to advance Gov. John Kasich’s education agenda.

But many Democrats in the House of Representatives voted against the Republican governor’s education policies, which included a third-grade reading guarantee, when they were up for a vote on June 13.

Their reasons for opposition varied.

Some thought the changes amounted to an unfunded mandate on schools whose state funding already had been cut through Kasich’s budget.

Rep. Dan Ramos, a Democrat from Lorain, said the bill was incomplete because it lacked early education programs such as all-day kindergarten to prepare young students, particularly children in poverty.

During a floor speech June 13, Ramos made clear his district’s educational needs:

""I represent, amongst others, the city of Lorain, which is the poorest urban school district in the state of Ohio.""

Ramos was one of several lawmakers to speak that day about the bill, Senate Bill 316, also known as the ""education MBR"" because it was the education component of Kasich’s mid-biennium budget review. The bill passed the House that day by a vote of 56-35, with most Democrats voting ""no.""

Although Ramos’ claim is not about specific provisions in the bill, it caught our attention. Does Lorain really hold the unwanted title of the state’s poorest urban school district.

So we called Ramos for an explanation.

Ramos said he did not have any statistics or information that showed Lorain is the state’s single poorest district. He provided data from the Ohio Department of Education that shows the city is among districts with the highest percentage of poor students.

""I should have said, ‘one of the’"" poorest urban school districts, Ramos said.

The city had the state’s sixth-highest percentage, 84.5 percent, of students in poverty in the fiscal year ending in July 2011. Students were considered to be living in poverty if they received free or reduced-priced lunches or if their guardians receive public assistance.

Cleveland was first, with 100 percent of students in poverty; Dayton was second with 92.5 percent; Youngstown was third with 91.9 percent; East Cleveland was fourth with 88.5 percent and Akron was fifth with 84.7 percent.

Lorain ranked fourth the previous year behind Cleveland, Dayton and Youngstown.

Ramos said the fact Lorain is among the state’s poorest districts – rather than the single poorest – does not negate the overarching point of his floor speech: School children in Lorain are on hard times and need the state’s help to get a better education, however, the policies in SB 316 do not fully address those needs.

Ramos may have a point. And he is correct to say students in Lorain are needy. But his explanation does not make his claim on the House floor accurate. The poorest urban school district in Ohio, in the eyes of the Ohio Department of Education, is Cleveland.

On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates False.","[('\nThe Ohio Channel, House floor debate on Senate Bill 316, June 13, 2012\n\nPhone interview with State Rep.

"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'Georgia Green Party']","
Transportation tax opponents says Emory gets a free ride
","
Georgia voters will decide on a series of regional transportation plans in the July 31 primaries that could bring as much as $8.5 billion in new spending to metro Atlanta alone.

The money would come from a special 1-cent sales tax dedicated to dozens of road, rail and other projects. The plan has a lot of support from the business community, but groups across the political spectrum oppose it.

For example, the left-leaning Georgia Green Party has circulated a list of the ""top ten lies"" about the referendum, including a claim that the projects are giveaways to rich businesses and institutions at the expense of working people who would pay the ""regressive"" tax.

The flier specifically mentions a proposed $700 million MARTA rail spur from the Lindbergh Center station to the Emory University campus.

""Sales taxes [are] highly regressive, falling most heavily on low income consumers, much more lightly on higher income persons and almost not at all on big corporations and other wealthy institutions like Emory University, which is literally getting its own transit line at virtually no cost to itself,"" the flier claims.

If the referendum passes, the 3.7-mile rail line is scheduled to be built along the Clifton Corridor around 2020. Hugh Esco, a member of the state Green Party committee, said the line is an example of the problem with using sales taxes to fund infrastructure projects.

""We’re being asked to pony up ... to pay for this new construction,"" he said. ""If there were no other mechanisms for raising funds, that might be appropriate.""

Esco said the rail line to Emory is an example of working-class people subsidizing a benefit for a wealthy institution. As a nonprofit, private university, Emory does not pay sales tax, so the university itself will not contribute to building the line.

""This is insane to ask us to pay for this nonsense. This isn’t serving the general public,"" he said.

Let’s split the Green Party claim into its two basic parts:
     
-- Sales taxes are regressive and place a heavier burden on the poor.
  
-- Because the line is built with sales tax money, big business and institutions such as Emory are getting something for nothing.

Georgia State University economist David Sjoquist said the regressiveness of the sales tax depends on how you look at it.

""Conventional wisdom is that if you look at annual income, people with lower income pay a higher percentage of their income in sales taxes,"" he said.

In that sense, the Green Party is right that the sales tax is regressive. A 1 percent sales tax on groceries means more to a person making $18,000 a year than someone making $180,000 a year.

The Green Party claims that big businesses pay almost no sales taxes. That’s not true. Sjoquist said businesses account for between 35 percent and 40 percent of sales tax collection in Georgia.

""They buy a computer, a desk, food for parties, they pay sales tax,"" he said. ""They are paying a share of this.""

But he said businesses have a choice when paying that tax to either eat it or pass that cost along. Except in highly competitive situations, sales taxes that businesses pay end up being passed down to the consumer in higher prices or to employees in lower wages, he said.

Sjoquist said the inequities of the sales tax tend to flatten out over a consumer’s lifetime due to changes in how people of even modest incomes spend and save, but he said people typically don’t look at it that way.

That gets to the Green Party’s second point: The proposed line to Emory is a freebie catering to a wealthy private university.

While it may be true that Emory -- as an institution -- would not pay the sales tax (private colleges are specifically exempt), Douglas Hooker, executive director of the Atlanta Regional Commission, said another funding mechanism might make little difference.

""Large institutions that are nonprofits tend not to pay any kind of tax, so this is no different,"" he said.

But it is not true that Emory has nothing invested in the effort. Hooker said the university is a member of the Clifton Corridor Transportation Management Association, which funded the design of the rail spur. That design work costs money, but it is just a tiny fraction of the cost of building it.

So, if Emory doesn’t pay into the sales tax, is it true the university would get its ""own transit line""?

According to a project fact sheet developed for the referendum, the line would have five stations with an estimated 10,300 daily boardings. Emory spokesman Ron Sauder said the line would serve people heading to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, among other big employers.

Emory is by far the largest of the employers in the corridor, plus it has more than 7,200 students in its undergraduate programs alone. Emory would likely claim a large share of the ridership on the rail line. But not all of it.

Sauder said Emory already operates a shuttle bus fleet and subsidizes public transit fees for employees, but the line isn’t ""just about Emory.""

ARC spokeswoman Julie Ralston said this: """"That’s the largest employment center in DeKalb County. Those are jobs that contribute to the livelihoods of people. It’s been part of an aspirational plan for a long time to have rail in that area.""

So where does that leave the Green Party’s two-barreled statement?

There is general agreement that the sales tax is more of a burden on lower-income people than people with higher incomes, businesses and nonprofit institutions. But there is also evidence that the proposed rail line is not simply a paean to Emory University.

Half the Green Party statement is true; the other half, not so much.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says no one should eat more than one serving of freshwater fish per month caught in Rhode Island because of mercury pollution
","
Are Rhode Island's lakes and rivers so contaminated from air pollution that originates from out of state that it's unsafe to eat more than one serving per month of fish caught here?

That's what Sheldon Whitehouse said on June 19, 2012, when he urged his colleagues in the U.S. Senate to approve new standards for mercury contamination caused by air pollution emitted from coal-burning power plants in states to our west.

After contending that lives would be saved, heart attacks would be prevented and emergency-room visits would be reduced if the new restrictions were finally put in place, Whitehouse turned to fishing to describe some of the intangible problems caused by the airborne mercury that lands in Rhode Island.

Whitehouse displayed an image of a Norman Rockwell painting, ""Catching the Big One,"" from the Aug. 3, 1929, issue of the Saturday Evening Post. It shows a boy and his grandfather fishing.

""That image in Rhode Island is shadowed by the fact that this small child would not be allowed to eat any freshwater fish that he caught with his grandfather because of this mercury pollution that has been bombarded in on us by these power plants that did not clean up their act,"" the senator said.

According to the Rhode Island Department of Health, he said, ""No one in Rhode Island -- not just children, no one in Rhode Island -- should eat more than one serving of freshwater fish caught in our state each month. So if the grandfather caught two fish, he could eat one [in] a month, but he shouldn't eat the other because of the health effects of the mercury that has piled up in the bodies of the fish.""

No children should be eating local freshwater fish and no adult should eat more than one serving per month? We wondered if the pollution was really that bad.

So, perched at our computer, we checked the Health Department's website, where we found the latest test results for 31 bodies of fresh water.

The chart says, as Whitehouse said, that nobody should be eating fish caught in Yawgoog Pond or Wincheck Pond, both in Hopkinton, or in the Quidnick Reservoir, in Coventry.  It also says fish other than trout in Meadow Brook Pond in Richmond shouldn't be eaten. (Trout are an exception because they are raised by the state on a mercury-free diet.)

It also says that none of the freshwater fish caught in the state should be eaten by women who are pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy or by children under age 7.

And what about everybody else?

In 12 of the 31 areas (13 if you count trout from Meadow Brook Pond), the Health Department says it's safe for adults and children over 6 to eat the fish in unlimited amounts, according to the chart. There's no once-a-month restriction.

In 13 other areas, the consumption should be limited to once per week for most adults and older children.

Only in 3 of the 31 areas does the state say that mercury pollution makes it unsafe to eat more than one fish meal a month: Watchaug Pond, in Charlestown, and Tucker and Yawgoo Ponds in South Kingstown.

The same day we called Whitehouse's office asking for the source of his information, spokesman Seth Larson called back to say that the senator's staff was using the same source we found.

""It turns out we made an error in preparing the senator's remarks,"" he said, promising a quick correction.

The next day, on the floor of the Senate, Whitehouse said that he erred in his statement. ""I would suggest Rhode Islanders consult the Health Department's website where the agency lists fish advisories by pond and by river and that way Rhode Islanders can make an informed decision for themselves and their families as to where and when our fish are safe to eat for mercury contamination,"" he said.

That's easier said than done because the Health Department data are outdated and confusing, so consumers may end up more perplexed than before.

Its mercury testing wasn't done systematically because of a lack of funding. Most rivers, lakes and ponds have not been tested at all. The results on the waters that were tested are from 1996 to 2000. No testing has been done since then because, again, the department hasn't had the money. And the data posted online sometimes contradict what Health Department official Robert Vanderslice says the department has been recommending.

For example, in the waters listed as being safe (where everyone except for small children, pregnant women and nursing women ""can consume any amount safely""), the website doesn't make it clear that the findings don't apply at all to largemouth and smallmouth bass, chain pickerel, black crappie or eel. Those species eat other fish and tend to concentrate mercury in their bodies, Vanderslice explained.

That eliminates most of the fish people would want to eat.

""You cannot predict from one pond to the next"" how much mercury will be in fish because the amount can vary from pond to pond, and from time to time, he said. ""If you sample one pond, you know about that one pond at that time for the species you sampled.""

""What our data show is that when you're freshwater fishing in Rhode Island, you don't know what the levels are,"" said Vanderslice. ""The best way you're assured to being safe is to limit how much fish you eat, vary where you fish and change the type of fish you eat.""

That's not very reassuring to adults who may have repeatedly eaten fish from the dozen areas listed as safe by the Health Department.

Whitehouse, in his followup Senate speech, said the larger point remains: ""Mercury contamination is a continuing public health problem in Rhode Island and one that we can do very little about without EPA standing up for us and defending us. Because in these other states it is a great deal for them to be about to poison our state's waters but get cheaper power in their states because they don't force their utilities to put scrubbers on and to keep themselves operating at appropriate levels of pollution control.""

Our ruling

Sheldon Whitehouse said that ""No one in Rhode Island -- not just children, no one in Rhode Island -- should eat more than one serving of freshwater fish caught in our state each month.""

Whitehouse made that absolute statement based on a Health Department web page indicating that his statement wasn't true for 25 of the 31 freshwater bodies. Not only can older children and most adults eat fish caught there more than once a month, in at least a dozen areas they can eat it as often as they'd like, it said.

Whitehouse acknowledged misstating the posted test results.

But fish from those limited areas haven't been tested in more than a decade, a lapse in public health monitoring we find disturbing.

And the data are, at times, so at odds with what the Health Department says it is recommending, any conclusion drawn from them should be accompanied by a hefty dose of skepticism.

Mercury pollution poses a signIficant public health problem and clearly consumers should be wary about eating freshwater fish caught in state waters. That's a large kernel of truth in Whitehouse's statement.

But because much of the published data contradict his broad assertion, we rate it Half True.

Romney cut millions for firefighter gear, Wisconsin Democrat and firefighter union head says
","
A political product of the mass demonstrations against Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in early 2011, Democrat Mahlon Mitchell lost his electoral debut in the state’s historic recall elections on June 5, 2012.

But three days later, Mitchell -- defeated 53 percent to 47 percent by GOP Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch -- was hailed as a rising star at the state Democratic Party’s annual convention.

So it wasn’t surprising that Mitchell was among those chosen to criticize Republican Mitt Romney ahead of the presumptive presidential nominee’s June 18, 2012 visit to Wisconsin.

Mitchell’s line of attack: As Massachusetts governor, Romney cut millions for firefighters’ equipment. It carried extra weight because Mitchell is head of the Wisconsin firefighter union.

On June 12, 2012, Romney claimed that President Barack Obama wants to add more government jobs and said the nation doesn’t ""need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers.""

The same day, the Wisconsin Democratic Party issued a news release in response, quoting Mitchell and a national Democratic Party spokesman.

Mitchell claimed in the release that Romney used a line-item veto to cut ""millions of dollars for firefighting equipment,"" including firefighters' ""coats, pants, helmets and boots.""

His claim was similar to one made a day earlier by an Obama campaign official and another made days later by Vice President Joe Biden.

Is Mitchell right?

Mitchell’s evidence

Asked for evidence, Mitchell referred us to Gillian Morris, spokeswoman for Obama's re-election campaign in Wisconsin.

She cited a July 2006 veto Romney issued for line item 8000-0050 in Massachusetts’ 2007 budget, his last during his single four-year term as governor.

The item, which was restored  by the legislature, provided for $2.5 million in grants to local fire departments for firefighting equipment that would ""include, but is not limited to, turnout gear.""

Turnout gear, said Edward Kelly, Mitchell’s counterpart with the Massachusetts firefighters union, generally includes a firefighter’s coat and pants.

That’s also how turnout gear is described by the National Fire Protection Association.

But Kelly said turnout gear could also be interpreted to include a helmet and boots. And in any case, the line item allowed local governments to spend the grant money on any type of fire safety equipment.

Other views

For context, we wondered whether Romney’s veto was indicative of his treatment of fire departments and firefighters when he was governor.

Kelly said Romney cut aid to local governments, which resulted in cuts in fire department funding and led to firefighter layoffs.

A February 2012 Boston Globe article also mentioned the aid cuts in recounting how, as governor, ""Romney fiercely protected a costly and controversial perk for police officers after seeking and receiving the endorsement of the politically influential police unions.""

We also contacted Jim Stergios, executive director of the Pioneer Institute, a Boston think tank that values ""free market principles, individual liberty and responsibility, and the ideal of effective, limited and accountable government."" He said the Romney administration generally ""limited grant programs to municipalities because their view was that such programs represented a relatively unaccountable entry into local affairs.""

""There was also a political principle at work,"" Stergios said in an email. ""Resist the usual small, targeted grants to local constituencies because they opened up all kinds of political fights among those constituencies (the firefighters got a grant, so shouldn't the police officers?) and localities (Bourne, Lawrence, and Worcester all wanted grants for fire stations, why shouldn't other communities?).""

We asked Romney’s campaign for a response to Mitchell’s claim. Spokeswoman Allie Brandenburger provided a video clip of comments Romney gave in response to an interview question about his statement that the nation didn’t need more firefighters.

That had nothing to do with Mitchell’s claim, so we emailed Brandenburger again, but got no reply.

Our rating

Mitchell said that as Massachusetts governor, Romney used a line-item veto to cut ""millions of dollars for firefighting equipment,"" including firefighters' ""coats, pants, helmets and boots.""

In 2006, Romney vetoed $2.5 million in grants for all types of fire safety equipment, including those Mitchell cited.

Jennifer Beck claims New Jersey residents are working at the highest rate in three years
","
Legislators armed themselves with job statistics before dueling over tax cut proposals in the state budget last week.

Some Democrats argued that the responsible course of action was delaying any tax cuts considering the state’s high unemployment rate.  Gov. Chris Christie wanted a 10 percent income tax cut. Democrats had offered two plans focused on reducing the property tax burden but passed a budget that tied any tax cut to the state meeting Christie’s revenue projections.

State Sen. Jennifer Beck, a Republican from Monmouth County, pointed to other labor data to show New Jersey’s economy is starting to recover.

""New Jersey's citizens are working at the highest rate in three years. That's good news,"" she said in her June 25 speech on the state Senate floor. ""We have more businesses expanding their footprint in this state. We've seen almost $8 billion in public-private investment over the last two and a half years. All of those are good signs and today in delivering this budget without a tax cut I think we’re giving a kick in the shins to our citizens because we have the revenue now to be able to deliver that relief and it should be our foremost and top priority.""

PolitiFact New Jersey checked Beck’s claim that residents are ""working at the highest rate in three years.""

Beck cited labor data showing that roughly 4.17 million New Jersey residents were employed in May.

""The last time that New Jersey had this many people employed was in February of 2009, more than 3 years ago,"" Beck said in an e-mail. PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that’s accurate.

But raw numbers are not a rate.

Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, agreed that the number of New Jerseyans working is the highest in three years, but said ""the confusion would be the word rate.""

""Usually a rate is expressed per unit of something,"" Seneca said, as in per thousand or per unit of time.

And when comparing the number of employed people to the labor force, the statistics tell a different story.

The employment rate is essentially the opposite of the unemployment rate.

The unemployment rate is calculated by taking the number of people who are unemployed but looking for work and dividing it by the labor force. The labor force includes employed people and people who are unemployed but looking for work.

People who are unemployed but aren’t looking for work are not included in the labor force.

New Jersey’s unemployment rate -- and therefore the employment rate -- has fluctuated some in the past three years, but overall has remained relatively even.

In May of 2009 the unemployment rate was 8.9 percent and the employment rate was about 91 percent.

Since then both rates have varied, but in May of this year, the unemployment rate was 9.2 percent and the employment rate was 90.8 percent.

So, as a rate, fewer New Jerseyans are working now than three years ago.

In response, Beck pointed to the rate of employment compared to the total state population, but that includes individuals who are younger than 16, as well as people who are institutionalized and active duty service members.

Excluding those groups of individuals, as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does, about 61.4 percent of New Jersey’s population was employed in May 2009. In May 2012, roughly 60 percent of the population was employed.

""What is unassailably true is that the employment level is the highest in 3 years.  It is my belief that New Jersey is moving in the right direction,"" Beck said.

Our ruling

Beck said that ""New Jersey's citizens are working at the highest rate in three years.""

To support her claim, Beck pointed to the number of employed residents, which is at the highest level since more than three years ago.

But Beck said rate and the percent of employed residents ticked down slightly from May 2009 to May 2012.

We rate this statement False.
