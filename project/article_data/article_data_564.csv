Obama says job growth always lags behind economic growth
","
Some Republican critics have scoffed at President Barack Obama's pronouncements that the economy seems to be improving, pointing to the unemployment rate, which keeps going up.
 
But Obama has consistently tempered his hopeful words about positive economic indicators with warnings that unemployment rates are likely to continue to rise for a while, even as the economy improves.
 
""History tells us that job growth always lags behind economic growth,"" Obama said Nov. 6, 2009, in remarks in the White House Rose Garden.
 
""He's right about that,"" said William Beach, director of the conservative Heritage Foundation's center for data analysis.
 
In the post-World War II era, there have been 10 recessions and after most of them, employment lagged a few months behind other improving economic indicators. But after the last two, in 1991 and 2001, unemployment rates continued to climb for more than a year.
 
Interestingly, Democrats criticized President George W. Bush regarding the 2001 ""jobless recovery,"" much as some Republicans now criticize Obama for the current one.
 
The latest jobless recovery came as little surprise to economists who study such trends.
 
""Employers are hesitant to hire people back to the work force (after a recession) because they don't know if the economy is going to continue to grow, which is understandable,"" Beach said.
 
But more importantly, he said, the American economy has become increasingly reliant on service jobs, such as information and financial jobs. ""Those jobs come back very slowly,"" Beach said.
 
The recession this time is even more severe, so Beach predicts this jobless recovery will last even longer than past recessions.
 
""I don't think we'll see jobs coming back for a long time,"" Beach said.
 
But even without government meddling, Beach believes employment was destined to lag.
 
The

San Francisco Chronicle

, relying on numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in August charted the lag between recessions' end and the peak of unemployment rates. In the eight recessions between 1949 and 1991, unemployment rates lagged by an average of about three months. After the last two, however, it took 15 months and 19 months, respectively, before unemployment rates peaked.
 
Bottom line, President Obama is right when he cautions that employment has lagged behind economic recovery in the past. And so we rate his statement True.

House health care bill pays for itself over the long run, CBO says
","
Do you think the conservative editorial board of the

Wall Street Journal

likes the health care bill written by Democrats in the House of Representatives?
 
Well, the headline on a recent editorial about it was ""The Worst Bill Ever.""
 
The editorial disliked new regulations for the health care system and additional taxes to pay for health insurance expansions.
 
The bill also ""disguises hundreds of billions of dollars in additional costs with budget gimmicks,"" the editorial said. ""It 'pays for' about six years of program with a decade of revenue, with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five years. The House also pretends Medicare payments to doctors will be cut by 21.5% next year and deeper after that, 'saving' about $250 billion.""
 
We've looked into

the problem of Medicare payments

previously and whether that should be considered part of health care reform. We found evidence to support both sides. So we rated Sen. John Cornyn's statement about it -- ""The first installment of health care reform ...

will raise the deficit by $250 billion

"" -- as Half True.
 
Here, we wanted to look at the claim that the bill pays for ""about six years of program with a decade of revenue, with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five years.""
 
To check on the bill's financial condition, we turned to the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, the nonpartisan budget agency that creates calculations for how much bills in Congress will cost the government. Political leaders and others regularly turn to the CBO as the definitive source for budget projections.
 
The CBO looked at the bill's new spending, new savings and new taxes. CBO analysts added those numbers together to get the bill's impact on the deficit for a given year, and over 10 years. Generally speaking, the CBO does not provide numbers after the first 10 years, because it believes those numbers are subject to too much uncertainty.
 
Looking at the House health care bill, it takes awhile for all the pieces of it to take effect, with different measures going into effect in different years. The requirement for individuals to buy insurance, for example, doesn't begin until 2013. People are subject to a tax penalty for not having insurance, and they'll see that penalty on the return they file in 2014.
 
The new taxes on high-income individuals, however, go into effect earlier, in 2011. The CBO projects that these tax revenues will rise gradually over the first nine years.
 
Meanwhile, cost savings don't start kicking in until 2012. The cost savings grow slowly but then get bigger in the last three years of the plan. (You can follow along with these numbers by looking at

Page 3 of this CBO report

.)
 
The

Journal

editorial is right that the CBO shows the biggest costs come in the second five years of the program, from 2015 to 2019. But the cost savings are the biggest in the final years as well. Overall, the plan is in the black through 2014, dips briefly into the red in 2015 and 2016, and then pays for itself again in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Over 10 years, the bill reduces the deficit by $104 billion.
 
The CBO did not create numerical projections for the years 2020 to 2029, but the report notes that for those years, the bill would probably result in ""slight reductions in federal budget deficits. Those estimates are all subject to substantial uncertainty.""
 
To be clear, those who oppose the Democratic bill think the CBO's estimates will likely be undermined by future events. ""The tax hikes will bring in less revenues than is estimated, and the spending provisions will likely be expanded over time,"" said Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Institution. ""Even if the CBO assumes it's revenue neutral, the smart money would bet on lower tax revenues, fewer spending cuts and higher program costs."" (Riedl added that he wasn't questioning the work of the CBO, he just thought it would be overtaken by political realities.)
 
On the other hand, Edwin Park of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that it's significant that the CBO found the bill lowered the deficit over the first 10 years and

also

in the subsequent 10 years after that. That shows that the bill pays for itself over the long term and is fiscally sound.
 
""The CBO has been crystal clear that it reduces the deficit in the out years,"" he said.
 
The

Journal

editorial says the House bill ""'pays for' about six years of program with a decade of revenue, with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five years."" It's true that the taxes kick in first, before many of the bill's biggest expenses get started. But the editorial doesn't mention that the CBO projects the largest cost savings for the bill's final four years, and that the bill appears to be self-sustaining starting around 2017. So we rate the statement Half True.

U.S. Rep. Mike Pence says CBO confirms GOP health plan reduces insurance premiums up to 10 percent
","A day after the GOP released its 219-page alternative health care bill, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, sent out a press release boasting that the ""the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now confirms that families will see their health care premiums reduced by up to 10 percent."" Lowering health care costs -- rather than reducing the ranks of the uninsured -- has been the primary focus of many Republicans in Congress, and so we wanted to check out Pence's claim. First, a few words about the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. The nonpartisan budget agency calculates how much bills in Congress will cost the government. Political leaders and others regularly turn to the CBO as the definitive source for budget projections. And here's what the CBO concluded about how the GOP health care plan would affect private health insurance premiums: • For the small group market (generally businesses with two to 50 employees -- about 15 percent of the private market), the GOP plan would reduce average premiums in 2016 by 7 to 10 percent compared with amounts under current law. • For the individual market (just over 5 percent of the private market), the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 5 to 8 percent. • And for the large group market (which represents 80 percent of private premiums), the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 0 to 3 percent. The CBO cautioned that those estimates are ""very preliminary and are subject to an unusually high degree of uncertainty"" because of the difficulty in trying to untangle how various proposals in the plan might affect premiums. But you can see what Pence has done. The Indiana congressman cherry-picked the most favorable number to put the GOP plan in the best light. Yes, for people in the small market group, the CBO estimates they could see average premiums reduced in 2016 by ""up to 10 percent"" compared with amounts under current law. But only 15 percent of the total private premiums fall into that category. The overwhelming majority, 80 percent of people paying private premiums, are in the large market group. And for them, the CBO estimates the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 0 to 3 percent. But Pence did say ""up to,"" providing himself with some very broad wiggle room. And so we rate Pence's statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a2bc5368-e052-449d-b9e1-d63c5904a6fb",/factchecks/2009/nov/06/mike-pence/us-rep-mike-pence-says-cbo-confirms-gop-health-pla/

Americans United for Change Ad claims GOP health plan will let insurers raise premiums four times faster than wages
","
The liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change has

an ad

running in the Washington, D.C., market that attacks the GOP's

recently released alternative

to the Democrats' health care plan.
 
The ad adopts a faux broadcast news format, beginning with this jab:
 
""This just in: Republicans in Congress have introduced the Health Insurance Industry Profits Protection Act.""
 
The announcer says the GOP plan would let insurance companies continue denying care for pre-existing conditions, a

claim we looked at more closely

when U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the same thing.
 
The ad then makes this claim: ""Republicans will still let insurers raise premiums four times faster than wages.""
 
In its backup material for the ad, Americans United for Change cites

a report

from the liberal group Health Care for America Now! (guess where they are in the health care debate) that states, ""Commercial health insurance premiums have risen four times faster than wages and have more than doubled in the last nine years."" That report, in turn, credits the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation's

""Employer Health Benefits -- 2008 Annual Survey,""

which backs up the statistic.
 
So it's fair to say that insurance premiums have risen four times faster than wages over the last nine years. But is it fair to say that trend would continue under the Republican plan?
 
""They (Republicans) do nothing to control the cost of premiums,"" said Lauren Weiner, a spokeswoman for Americans United for Change. ""It's a tacit approval of the current trend.""
 
Weiner said that's because the Republican plan does little to expand the insurance pool, which she argues would lower costs for everyone. A report from the Congressional Budget Office concluded the GOP plan would only reduce the number of uninsured people by 3 million by 2019, while 52 million nonelderly people would remain uninsured (by contrast the Democrats' plan would reduce the uninsured by 36 million, leaving 18 million without coverage).
 
The Republican plan also does not include a public option, Weiner said, so it would not create the necessary competition to drive down health insurance costs.
 
Republicans say their plan would reduce premiums because it would let people buy health insurance across state lines; allow small businesses to pool together and offer health insurance to their employees at much lower costs; and institute medical malpractice reforms.
 
 For an objective assessment, we turned to the

Congressional Budget Office analysis

of the GOP plan. The CBO is a nonpartisan budget agency that creates calculations for how much bills in Congress will cost the government. Contrary to the Americans United claim, the CBO concluded the GOP plan would

lower

premiums. Specifically:
 
• For the small group market (generally businesses with 2 to 50 employees — about 15 percent of the private market), the GOP plan would reduce average premiums in 2016 by 7 to 10 percent compared with amounts under current law.
 
• For the individual market (just over 5 percent of the private market), the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 5 to 8 percent.
 
• And for the large group market (which represents 80 percent of private premiums), the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 0 to 3 percent.
 
The CBO cautioned that those estimates are ""very preliminary and are subject to an unusually high degree of uncertainty"" because of the difficulty in trying to disentangle how various proposals in the plan might affect premiums.
 
Still, the CBO has done the most thorough and objective analysis of the bill, while the liberal groups have merely assumed that past trends will continue. Given the CBO's role as a nonpartisan, well-respected authority, we find its estimates more persuasive. We find the Americans United claim to be False.

Charlie Crist says he didn't endorse stimulus bill
","Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, facing a potentially bruising Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, continues to run from any assertion that he is linked to President Barack Obama. Last week Crist told reporters he didn't know Obama was traveling in Florida. On Wednesday, Crist told a national television audience he didn't endorse the $787 billion federal stimulus bill pushed by Obama and passed by Congress in February. ""I didn't endorse it,"" Crist told CNN host Wolf Blitzer. ""I — you know, I didn't even have a vote on the darned thing. But I understood that it was going to pass and I wanted to be able to utilize it for the benefit of my fellow Floridians."" This, from the same man who skipped a Florida Cabinet meeting to campaign with Obama for the stimulus in Fort Myers in February? Who went on national talk shows and across the state selling the plan? As the interview continued, Crist got on a roll. ""You know, unfortunately, the president thinks that everything we need to do for every problem that comes along is spend more money and that's just wrong,"" he said.   ""Frankly, enough is enough. And I know that the people understand that. And I understand it. And I understand it because I'm the grandson of a Greek immigrant who came to this country with nothing, really taught me the value of a dollar, because his first job in America, in Altoona, Pa., was shining shoes for a living for $5 a month."" Crist's comments about the stimulus startled conservatives, Democrats, and frankly, us, who all remember things differently. The conservative Club for Growth responded Thursday with an  online television ad,  criticizing Crist's support for the stimulus plan. And the Democratic National Committee blasted Crist's comments to reporters across the country. Let's go back to earlier this year, to see what Crist had to say then. From  Hardball with Chris Matthews  on Feb. 3: Speaking of the stimulus, Crist said, ""It's going to help (Floridians') children. It's going to help their traffic situation. It's going to help produce more jobs here in the Sunshine State. That's a perspective that I have to have as, in essence, the CEO of Florida. And that's why I support it."" From  Time  on Feb. 10: ""I see this package as a pragmatic, commonsense opportunity to move forward. I didn't campaign for Obama, we don't agree on everything, but he's my president, and my job is to help Florida stay in the black."" From  Meet the Press  on Feb. 22: Q: Why would you buck your own party, which did not vote for this plan in Congress, as you know, to support the stimulus? Crist: ""It's not a matter of bucking the party, it's a matter of helping the people. I mean, I really view it as an issue of what can I do that's best for the people of Florida? We've got almost 20 million people that live in the Sunshine State now. I think my obligation is in essence the CEO of the state, to do everything I can to help us get through this tough economy. Certainly this stimulus package, about $12.2 billion to Florida, will help Florida an awful lot."" And that's just a sampling. But then there's the rally in Fort Myers Feb. 10. Crist skipped a Florida Cabinet meeting and a lunch with former Gov. Jeb Bush to tout the stimulus bill in person. If you've forgotten, here's a  photo  and  video  to jog your memory.  Here's  the retelling of that day from the  St. Petersburg Times  : ""We know that it's important that we pass a stimulus package,'' Florida's popular Republican governor said amid ""Yes, we can!"" cheers as he introduced the Democratic president. ""This is not about partisan politics. This is about rising above that, helping America and reigniting our economy."" Crist went as far earlier this year as to lobby members of Florida's congressional delegation from both parties to support the stimulus package. The  Miami Herald  reported that Crist lobbied Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and his brother, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, along with Democratic Reps. Kathy Castor and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. In fact, he was one of the few prominent Republicans to support the stimulus at any level, a choice that won him accolades from Obama. And Crist  was among a group of governors  to write Obama on Feb. 3 to express support for the stimulus plan. ""As stewards of the economies of our respective states and regions, we urge the Congress to reach prompt resolution of all outstanding differences and you to sign the bill when it reaches your desk,"" the letter read in part. Oh, oh, oh. One more. In May, according to the  Orlando Sentinel  , Crist himself said he would have made the ""pragmatic"" decision to vote for the stimulus bill that ultimately passed. On Thursday, Crist tried to expand on his CNN comments. When asked by state Capitol reporters if he were changing his position on the stimulus, Crist said, ""I don't think so. I don't think so."" ""The bill that passed wasn't exactly what I would want to vote for. But it's what passed,"" Crist said. ""And once that happened, you need to realize you need to do everything you possibly can to fight for Florida and our fellow Floridians, whether they're school teachers, construction workers or whatever it might be. And so once this happens, you know, I think it's important to embrace it, fight for Florida's fair share and do what's right for the state."" That sounds a lot like Obama, actually, who has said several times that the stimulus wasn't perfect. Crist even said as much during his interview on  Meet the Press  in February. Back to Crist's original statement. He said Wednesday that he didn't endorse the stimulus and offered the fact that he didn't have a vote on the proposal as evidence. Of course, Crist, as governor, couldn't vote for the stimulus. But, strictly speaking, neither could Obama as president. So that's hardly a proper measure to justify a claim that Crist didn't endorse the stimulus bill. What is a proper measure are Crist's actions in January and February. Crist broke ranks with many in the Republican Party by publicly campaigning for the stimulus package on television and with the president. He lobbied Florida's congressional delegation to vote for the bill. And he signed Florida's budget, which was balanced because the state received billions of dollars in federal stimulus money. (The stimulus provides Florida $15.7 billion over three budget years ending next budget year.) White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on Thursday even acknowledged Crist's support. ""I think his words at that (Fort Myers) event speak for themselves,"" Gibbs said. ""I think he was very supportive of the legislation and supportive of the benefits that it would have and has had for — for the state of Florida in seeing positive economic growth."" Facing a primary challenge from the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Crist appears to be trying to rewrite history. But there are mountains of evidence that he not only supported the stimulus, he sang its praises. The meter is ablaze: Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2009/nov/05/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-he-didnt-endorse-stimulus-bill/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Debbie Wasserman Schultz']","
Wasserman Schultz says GOP alternative health care plan allows insurers to continue denying coverage for pre-existing conditions
","
The GOP's alternative health care plan hadn't even hit the streets before the Democratic push-back began.
 
The day before the plan was officially unveiled, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., took aim at the way the GOP plan was described by media outlets that had gotten early, leaked versions of it.
 
In a press release from the Democratic National Committee, Vice Chair Wasserman Schultz said the GOP plan, ""would allow health insurance companies to continue engaging in unfair and discriminatory practices like denying coverage to people because of a pre-existing medical condition.""
 
Requiring insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions has been a popular element of the Democratic plan.
 
Now that we've seen the full 219-page GOP alternative plan, it shows Wasserman Schultz is correct that it does not prohibit health insurance companies from denying coverage to people due to pre-existing medical conditions.
 
But to listen to her, one might get the impression the Republicans have completely ignored the issue of pre-existing conditions. And they haven't. They have a different idea that they think will get at the problem.
 
More than 10 pages of the GOP bill spell out a plan to help people with pre-existing conditions by allowing universal access to expanded and improved state-run high-risk pools. They accept patients who have health conditions that might prompt private insurance companies to reject them. Already, 34 states have high-risk insurance pools.
 
""We want to encourage all states to have these,"" said House Republican Leader John Boehner. ""And we put more money into these high-risk pools so that we can bring down the cost of health insurance. And at the end of the day, what we're doing with our proposal is lowering health care insurance premiums — lowering cost and expanding access.""
 
The Republican plan calls for $25 billion in funding through 2019 to subsidize state high risk pool and reinsurance programs.
 
In an MSNBC interview on Nov. 4, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said the cost of bolstering state funds and insurance programs to cover people with pre-existing conditions would be offset by savings from medical malpractice reforms that he said would ""rein in some of these runaway massive lawsuits that drive defensive medicine and drive up the cost of premiums.""
 
Democrats counter that high-risk insurance pools have done little to solve the problems faced by people with pre-existing medical conditions. Premiums in those pools are usually far more expensive than in your average health insurance plan, and therefore remain out of reach for many moderate to low-income people with pre-existing conditions.
 
The Republican plan tries to address that by requiring that the pool ""must limit the pool premiums to no more than 150 percent of the average premium for applicable standard risk rates in that state."" In other words, it might cost people with pre-existing conditions 50 percent more than average premiums paid by healthy people.
 
But a study shows that might make the price too high. A February 2005 study by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund found that in states with high-risk pools, the rates were typically 25 percent to 50 percent higher than average rates. People with lower incomes just couldn't afford to buy into the state pools. As a result, they found, high-risk pool subsidies tended to go to a small number of relatively high-income people, those who could afford premiums well above market rates.
 
The GOP plan for dealing with the issue of people with pre-existing conditions ""is essentially the same as now, and now is not working,"" said Jonathan Beeton, a spokesman for Wasserman Schultz.
 
Wasserman Schultz was correct when she said the GOP plan does not prohibit health insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. We found nothing in the 219-page Republican plan that would do that. Insurance companies have argued that they can only absorb the cost of taking people with pre-existing conditions if they could offset that expense by expanding their customer base through mandates that everyone buy insurance. And the Republican plan doesn't do that.
 
Still, we think Wasserman Schultz's comments imply that Republicans have simply ignored the issue of pre-existing conditions altogether. They have not. They have taken a different tack from  the Democrats. And Democrats may not agree that dealing with the issue through state-run high-risk pools is an adequate plan, but it

is

a plan. And so we rule Wasserman Schultz's comment Mostly True.

The Health Benefits Advisory Committee doesn't tell you what plan to buy
","
A few months ago, a chain e-mail purporting to be a

line-by-line analysis

of the House health care reform bill reached in-boxes all over the country, warning people of the dire consequences of the Democratic plans for reform. Taking a page from the same playbook, the House Republican Conference has created

a similar list

our fact-check of the Republican analysis

in its entirety. Here, we're looking only at the statement, ""Page 111 - Section 223 establishes a new board of federal bureaucrats (the 'Health Benefits Advisory Committee') to dictate the health plans that all individuals must purchase.""
 
Under the Democrats' health care reform plan, people will have to buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty, and policymakers have said they want everyone covered. The House bill also says what basic coverage should include: hospitalizations, physicians' visits, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse treatment, preventive care, maternity care, well-baby and well-child care, and durable medical equipment.
 
But it doesn't provide specifics, like what kinds of prescription drugs or specific medical procedures must be covered.
 
The bill creates the Health Benefits Advisory Committee to advise the secretary of Health and Human Services on what the specifics should be. The committee will have up to 27 members appointed by the president and the Comptroller General, and it will represent the major stakeholders in the health care system, according to the bill.
 
The committee doesn't dictate health plans, though: It advises the secretary, who can reject the recommendations. Another important caveat is that the committee helps set a baseline for different types of coverage.
 
People are then free to select any health plan they like that meets or exceeds the basic requirements. So the committee does not dictate which health plans all individuals must purchase.
 
We find the House Republican Conference's statement, ""Page 111 - Section 223 establishes a new board of federal bureaucrats (the 'Health Benefits Advisory Committee') to dictate the health plans that all individuals must purchase,"" makes it sound as if bureaucrats tell you which plan you have to buy. In reality, the committee advises the secretary of Health and Human Services on what baseline coverage should include. We rate the statement False.

our fact-check of the Republican analysis

in its entirety. Here, we're looking only at the statement, ""Page 110 - Section 222(e) requires the use of federal dollars to fund abortions through the government-run health plan.""


We should emphasize that the House bill has yet to be voted on, and Democratic leaders have said they might consider new language on how the bill handles abortion. The Senate is expected to consider its own bill with details that diverge somewhat from the House.
 
The latest version of the House bill incorporates an amendment proposed by Rep. Lois Capps, a Democrat from California. Her proposal sought to create a compromise on abortion, especially in regards to the public option, a basic insurance plan run by the government and offered as a choice on the health insurance exchange.
 
The public option could offer abortion services, but if it does, those services would be paid for with segregated patient premiums, not public subsidies. We looked at

the Capps amendment

is some detail previously. We concluded that the Capps amendment would stop tax dollars from subsidizing abortion.
 
The sticking point in the new Republican claim, though, is the term ""federal dollars.""
 
If you consider federal dollars to be tax revenues, then the public option would not pay for abortion, because patient premiums will pay for abortion.
 
On the other hand, if you consider ""federal dollars"" to be any money handled by a federal agency, then the public option would pay for abortion.
 
We've concluded before that if millions of uninsured people would now get insurance due to the health care plan, and some of the plans offer abortion coverage, we think it's fair to conclude that means more women would have access to abortion services. Our previous coverage has more detail on

abortion and health care reform

, and how it has been handled in the Senate.
 
The House Republican Conference said that health reform ""requires the use of federal dollars to fund abortions through the government-run health plan."" We find this depends on how a person defines the somewhat vague term ""federal dollars."" We rate the statement Half True.

Republicans gloss over the details on a study on the employer mandate

A few months ago, a chain e-mail purporting to be a

a similar list

for the new health care bill that will be coming to the House floor in the next few weeks.
 
You can read

our fact-check of the Republican analysis

in its entirety. Here, we're looking only at the statement, ""Page 313 - Section 512 imposes an 8 percent 'tax on jobs' for firms that cannot afford to purchase 'bureaucrat-approved' health coverage; according to an

analysis

by Harvard Professor Kate Baicker, such a tax would place millions 'at substantial risk of unemployment'—with minority workers losing their jobs at twice the rate of their white counterparts.""
 
This point refers to the House bill's employer mandate, which requires large employers to offer health insurance for their workers. (This is a major difference with the Senate bill, which is not expected to include an employer mandate.)
 
So the House bill does tax employers that don't offer insurance. The Republicans say that Baicker's research shows that millions would be at risk for unemployment, and her research does show that.
 
But the number of people who would actually lose their jobs, according to her projections, is much smaller.
 
Baicker and co-author Helen Levy identified workers who lacked insurance and whose wages are so close to the minimum wage that employers will not be able to reduce their pay in order to pay for health insurance. That pool of uninsured, low-wage workers is 5.5 million.
 
Of those, however, she concluded that a much smaller number — 224,284 — were ""likely"" to lose their jobs. And about 136,342 were likely to be racial and ethnic minorities, she concluded.
 
Baicker and Levy also wrote that those numbers would be fewer if small employers were exempt from the mandate. And the House bill does just that: It exempts employers with a payroll of less than $500,000.
 
We contacted Baicker, who also added the following note of clarification: ""Our estimates were done years ago and were meant to model a stylized mandate policy, not any of the actual policies under consideration at the moment.  The effect on employment will be driven by a lot of the details, such as which workers are included based on number of hours worked and which firms are included based on firm size.""
 
So the House Republican Conference takes a study that looked at a general policy, not the details of the current House bill. Additionally, the exemption for small employers would reduce the number of workers who would be at risk for losing their jobs. So we rate this statement Half True.

Rush Limbaugh said bump in GDP due to Cash for Clunkers and government incentives to first-time home buyers
","While many hailed the news that the gross domestic product had increased 3.5 percent in the third quarter as a sign that the recession has ended, political commentator Rush Limbaugh was not one of them. On the  Fox News Sunday  program on Nov. 1, Limbaugh scoffed at a question about whether President Barack Obama had saved the country from ""a financial abyss,"" as witnessed by reports about the bump in the GDP. ""There wasn't any growth in the private sector,"" Limbaugh said. ""That 3.5 percent came from two things — government spending on Cash for Clunkers — they just moved fourth-quarter auto sales into the third quarter — and the first-time home buyer thing."" Limbaugh is referring to the Cash for Clunkers program that provided up to $4,500 to consumers to trade in their old cars for new ones, as well as to a government incentive program that provides an $8,000 tax credit to first-time home buyers.  There's little debate that the Cash for Clunkers program gave a serious jolt to the car industry in the third quarter and contributed significantly to the GDP bump. In a statement before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, J. Steven Landefeld, director of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, said consumer spending on durable goods — which increased by 22.3 percent — was driven by motor vehicle purchases and that Cash for Clunkers ""accounted for most of this increase."" But not all of it. Landefeld noted that ""real spending on other durable goods, nondurable goods and services also increased in the third quarter,"" he said. There's no way of untangling exactly how much Cash for Clunkers or home-buying incentives directly affected the GDP, said Eugene Seskin, an economist with the Bureau of Economic Analysis. But statistics on the categories those programs would affect provide strong clues. In a breakdown of the contributors to the 3.5 percent increase in GDP, the Bureau of Economic Analysis attributed 1 percentage point to consumer purchases of motor vehicles and parts. In a broader sense, motor vehicles — including commercial purchase of vehicles and parts (not eligible for Cash for Clunkers) as well as vehicle imports and exports — raised real GDP growth in the third quarter by 1.7 percentage points, Landefeld said. But, he added, ""Excluding the effects of motor vehicles, real GDP increased 1.9 percent in the third quarter after decreasing 0.9 percent in the second quarter."" In other words, there was a lot more to the bump than just cars.

Okay, what about the effect of the government incentives to new home buyers? According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, residential construction rose by 23.4 percent in the third quarter, the first increase in 15 quarters. That translated to 0.53 percentage points of the increase in GDP. But economists say it would be wrong to assign credit for that entirely to government incentives through tax credits to first-time home buyers. First of all, most of the homes purchased through the program were existing homes, not new construction. The new homes figure also includes such things as brokers commissions on sales of homes. So the correlation between that increase and the tax-credit incentives to new home buyers is more tenuous. Still, it appeared to have had some benefit. But for argument's sake, let's say all of the consumer purchases of new cars and parts (1 percentage point) and all of the new home purchases (0.53 percentage points) in the third quarter were tied to the programs Limbaugh mentioned. That still only accounts for less than half of the bump. If Limbaugh's bigger point was that the bump was largely due to government intervention, he's on more solid ground. In fact, it's a talking point from the White House defending the effectiveness of the economic stimulus package championed by the president. The stimulus ""contributed between 3 and 4 percentage points to real GDP growth in the third quarter,"" said Christina Romer, the chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. ""This suggests that in the absence of the Recovery Act, real GDP would have risen little, if at all, this past quarter,"" said Romer. Josh Bivens, an economist with the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute, thinks Limbaugh missed the biggest drivers from government intervention: tax cuts, extended unemployment benefits and food stamps, and aid to states from the stimulus. By Bivens' back-of-the-envelope assessment, the stimulus accounted for about 2.5 percentage points of the increase. The truth in Limbaugh's statement, Bivens said, is that government intervention is driving the economy forward right now. In addition to the stimulus, the third quarter saw an increase in direct government spending, mostly on defense (adding 0.5 percentage points to the bump). ""If not for the government intervention, the numbers would not be as strong right now,"" he said. ""That's why we did it."" Other economists say Limbaugh missed the mark when he began by saying the growth in the GDP was not in the private sector. While the government may have provided incentives with Cash for Clunkers, for example, consumers still bore the majority of the cost of new cars. So while the government may be acting as a catalyst, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, it's still private sector growth. Bottom line, Limbaugh dismissed the growth in the GDP as being simply from Cash for Clunkers and tax credits to first-time home buyers. Economists agree those programs, particularly Cash for Clunkers, contributed significantly to the bump. And it's certainly valid to caution that much, if not all, of the bump can be attributed to government intervention. But Limbaugh oversimplifies things when he dismisses the growth as tied solely to those two programs. By our math, even a generous reading of government data ties less than half of the growth in GDP to sectors of the economy those two programs may have influenced. And so we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2009/nov/03/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-said-bump-gdp-due-cash-clunkers-and-/

Michele Bachmann claims Page 92 prohibits private insurance
","
House Democratic leaders last week released the health care bill they plan to bring to the floor, and it didn't take long for the Republicans to publish a laundry list of complaints about it.


We'll be exploring those complaints with a story we'll publish later today or tomorrow, but in the meantime, we'd like to explore one of the points made by Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Republican from Minnesota.
 
She made the statement on Oct. 30, 2009, on Sean Hannity's show on the Fox News Channel.


She said that on Page 92 of the new bill, ""it says specifically that people can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain, which means people will ultimately go into a single-payer plan where it is government providing health care and only one single government system. That's why this is so bad, Sean. This is socialized medicine ... This is, as I said, the crown jewel of socialism. It's what Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid have wanted from the very beginning."" (See her comments starting about the 2:15 mark in

this video

.)


We won't rate her opinion that Democrats are proposing the ""crown jewel"" of socialized medicine, or her prediction that it will ultimately lead to a single-payer system. Instead, we're interested in Bachmann's claim that Page 92 of the bill prevents people from buying private health insurance after a certain date.
 
We not only find that she is misinterpreting that one page, but that she's also distorting the other 1,989 pages of a bill that would construct a system largely based on private health insurance. Her claim is a serious misrepresentation of a plan that relies on a marketplace of private coverage.
 
Bachmann's office did not respond to our call or an e-mail, but we found the language that she seemed to be referring to on Page 91 of the new bill: ""The individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day of Y1.""


To decipher it, we called Karen Pollitz, project director for the Health Policy Institute at the Georgetown University Public Policy Institute. She said it was a clause that allows people who would be eligible for coverage in the new health care exchange to keep an old policy they like.


""If you have a plan that's in effect prior to the effective date (of the exchange) and you like it, you can keep it,"" she said. (This is similar to a claim we checked back in July when the editorial page of

Investor's Business Daily

said the bill

would outlaw private insurance

. We rated that Pants on Fire.)


Here's how the exchange would work: Under the House bill, insurance companies would sell individual policies through a government-run health care exchange, and the government would set minimum standards for coverage. For example, the government would require companies to cover people even if they have pre-existing conditions such as serious illnesses or pregnancy. The government would also set levels for minimum coverage for services such as mental health coverage.
 
But if someone liked a plan they owned before the new law kicks in, they'd be able to keep the policy, no matter the level of coverage. The rules would largely prevent insurance companies from changing benefits in these grandfathered plans or altering the premiums.


So Bachmann is referring to language that prevents the health insurance companies from enrolling new people in old plans that don't meet the new standards, Pollitz said. Any plan sold after the new law is enacted must provide better coverage.


Bachmann is incorrect that people ""can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain."" To the contrary, a key principle of the bill is to create a new marketplace for people to buy private insurance. People who already get private coverage from their employer would continue to do so and should be able to shop for new plans with different coverage. People who are self-employed or work for small businesses will be able to buy private insurance through the new exchange.


In fact, the bill requires that everyone have some form of coverage, Pollitz said. ""Not only do you have to [buy insurance], but you can"" buy it after the bill goes into effect, she said. ""There's no reasonable way to look at Page (91) and say that you couldn't.""


Bachmann isn't just guilty of misinterpreting the language from one page of the bill. She's taken that misinterpretation to a ridiculous extreme — the claim that no private insurance could be sold after a certain date. That ignores the central tenet of a plan that's been discussed for months — that the plan would rely on a marketplace of private insurance. So we rate her claim Pants on Fire.

California Republican lumps Obama in with Hoover in his approach to fighting recession
","
President Barack Obama has been in office for just 10 months, but already he's being measured against his predecessors in the Oval Office. In a House floor speech on Oct. 27, 2009, Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., said Obama and Herbert Hoover were ineffective at dealing with recessions.
 
""Three presidents within the last 100 years have responded to recessions by reducing taxes and regulations,"" McClintock said. ""Warren Harding, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan all produced rapid and dramatic economic recoveries. We’ve had two presidents in those 100 years who reacted to recessions by doing the opposite — Herbert Hoover in the early 1930s, who radically increased taxes and spending and who imposed unprecedented burdens on trade, and the other is Barack Obama.""
 
We contacted a host of presidential historians and economists to see whether they agreed with McClintock.
 
First, let's discuss where the experts generally agree that McClintock is right.


Harding, Kennedy and Reagan each acted to lower taxes, and in fact each of them staked some political capital on it. (Technically, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson, brought the tax cut to fruition after Kennedy's assassination.) Each of these presidents either inherited a recession upon entering office or saw one emerge early in their first term. Meanwhile, Hoover did indeed hike taxes and spending during his tenure, and he signed the Smoot-Hawley Tarriff Act of 1930, which raised tarriffs on thousands of goods to record levels.


Two of those we spoke to -- David Boaz of the Cato Institute and Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute -- were generally favorable toward McClintock's comments. But other scholars we spoke to saw a number of failings in McClintock's thesis.


1.

McClintock's list of recessions is selective, in a way that favors Republicans

. A look at the official list of recessions compiled by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that McClintock ignores a number of downturns that occurred under Republican presidents — including Dwight Eisenhower (1953, 1957-58), Richard Nixon (1969-70, 1973-75), George H.W. Bush (1990-91) and George W. Bush (2001) — while ignoring recoveries under Democratic President Harry Truman (1945, 1949).

 

2.

Recessions stem from a number of causes

. Sometimes they are caused by factors internal to the economy (such a downturn in the business cycle) and sometimes they are prompted by an external development (such as oil shocks in the 1970s or the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks). Because these recessions have different origins, economists say, no single policy prescription works for all of them. This suggests that McClintock is oversimplifying matters.


3.

McClintock distorts Hoover's tax record

. Hoover is widely blamed for worsening the economy by signing the Smoot-Hawley law. But that was a tariff; Hoover's record on taxes is more complicated. He did sign the Revenue Act of 1932, which more than doubled the top income tax rate and probably worsened the nation's already dire economic situation. But that law came three years after the Depression began, so for the first three years of his tenure, the economic outlook worsened without any assistance from a tax hike. Indeed, the tax laws then in force were initiated by steep tax cuts urged by long-serving Republican Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon and enacted under Hoover's predecessors, Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge — not necessarily a winning argument in favor of low taxation. Finally, Hoover did in one instance reduce taxes rather than raise them: He signed a joint congressional resolution that cut taxes by 1 percentage point on Dec. 16, 1929, shortly after the stock market crash of 1929.


4.

The Reagan recovery may have been dramatic, but it was anything but ""rapid.""

The second dip of the ""double-dip"" recession of the early 1980s — which occurred entirely on Reagan's watch — lasted 16 months from peak to trough. That made it the longest recession between the Great Depression and today's ""Great Recession.""

 

5.

Focusing on the presidential role in combating recessions ignores other important factors

. Something McClintock's formulation ignores is the enormous role of the Federal Reserve in leveraging monetary policy to fight recessions. For instance, many give Fed Chairman Paul Volcker significant credit for the 1980s recovery, due to his leadership (supported by Reagan) in lowering double-digit inflation. Meanwhile, some argue that, before the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt, federal revenues and spending were so small as a percentage of the nation's economy that presidents had only weak levers to work with as they tried to fight economic downturns. Finally, actions of the 50 state governments can have major effects on the economy, yet cuts at the federal level often prompt spending increases at the state and local level, complicating the influence that government has on the economy.

 

6.

The Obama record isn't settled yet

. So far at least, Obama hasn't raised taxes; he's actually cut certain taxes, totaling $288 billion for individuals and companies, as part of his economic stimulus package. It's true that passage of health care reform would involve raising taxes, and passage of a ""cap-and-trade"" climate-change plan would represent an increase in regulation. But both initiatives are staunchly opposed by Republicans and there's no guarantee they'll be enacted, or, if they are, what their provisions will be.

 

7.

Finally, correlation does not mean causation

. Even if tax cuts happened to coincide with recoveries and tax hikes tended to coincide with recessions, it doesn't necessarily mean that one causes the other. For instance, tax cuts and deregulation likely aided the Reagan recovery (as did Volcker's inflation-fighting efforts) but historians say that higher defense spending, another Reagan priority, also helped bring the United States out of recession, as did historically lower oil prices. Meanwhile, Kennedy, in addition to cutting taxes, supported major increases in public works spending, not least the space program. The implementation of so many policies at the same time makes it hard to credit just one or two with launching a recovery.

 

When we showed the criticisms we heard to McClintock's office, he responded with a detailed critique, which we encourage readers to visit

here

. He made a valid point about the recession and recovery under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, which this story now reflects. But overall, he did not persuade us that the 12-plus experts we consulted were wrong. 
 
We will readily acknowledge that it's impossible to encapsulate a century of American political and economic history into three sentences, so some oversimplification is inevitable. And McClintock did get several key facts in his statement correct. Still, most of the dozen-plus scholars we contacted agreed that the congressman greatly oversimplified matters, and we feel that describing history this way will leave an incorrect impression. So we rate McClintock's claim False.

Olbermann claims Connecticut has a public plan
","Sen. Joe Lieberman, former Democrat and now independent from Connecticut, made headlines recently when he said he would join Republicans in a filibuster against a health care bill with a public option.
 
Keith Olbermann brought it up on his Oct. 27, 2009, episode of  Countdown  .
 
Olbermann said Lieberman was being hypocritical because, ""he will side with the Republicans, denying Americans an up-or-down vote on any health care plan that includes the public option, even though his home state has a public option which covers about 10,000 of its citizens that was introduced by its Republican governor.""

Lieberman is crucial for the Democrats because he usually votes with them and in effect is the important 60th vote so they can overcome a Republican filibuster.

Lieberman has said that he will side with the Democrats on a procedural motion to start debate on the health care bill (in theory, with Lieberman's support, Republicans could block bringing the bill to the Senate floor). But because he opposes the public option that's included in the bill, he has said he will side with Republicans on the ultimate vote to end the debate, which also requires 60 votes. And that means Senate consideration of the health care bill could stall.
 
We contacted Olbermann's staff and found out that the Connecticut health plan he was referring to is the 1-year-old Charter Oak Health Plan, the state-run program that is designed to compete in the market for individual insurance policies. That means people who are buying individual health care plans — the unemployed, young college graduates, early retirees — can get coverage under Charter Oak. The state has contracted with three insurers to offer a variety of coverage options. Premiums and deductibles depend on household income.
 
According to David Dearborn, a spokesman for Republican Gov. Jodi Rell, while the plan is ""a state-sponsored, state-subsidized and state-administered health coverage program, we contract with private insurers ... as managed care organizations to coordinate the benefits, enroll and set rates with providers, and pay for the services.""
 
The insurance companies bear the risk for actual medical costs, not the state, Dearborn said. But the government is involved in the sense that people can get a government subsidy to help them buy private insurance.
 
So is that a ""public option"" similar to the one offered in the Democrats' health care bills?
 
We contacted Jacob Hacker, a health care expert at Yale University who is widely credited with coming up with the concept of a public option, for a definition.
 
Generally speaking, a public option should look a lot like Medicare, Hacker said. It should be run by the government, and the government should bear the insurance risk.
 
On the last point, Hacker said Connecticut's public option ""falls into a gray area. It is not public in the same ways that the public health insurance option under consideration in Congress is. But it seems more public than, say, the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, which is often cited as a model for the so-called insurance exchanges.""
 
So it seems that the Connecticut plan is a hybrid of a public option and an insurance exchange. It allows consumers to choose from a limited number of health insurance options offered by private insurers, but it is sponsored, subsidized and administered by the state.
 
Olbermann is correct on his second and third points. At the one-year anniversary of the program's existence, Rell, the Republican governor who introduced the program in 2007, estimated that about 10,000 had joined the plan. Rell's name and photograph have featured prominently on information about the program, and she's gone to bat to defend the plan several times since it was enacted in the summer of 2008.
 
So, back to Olbermann's claim. The Charter Oak plan does not meet a strict definition of a public option. In fact, it bears some marks of a health insurance exchange, where private plans compete. But ultimately, it is sponsored and subsidized by the state of Connecticut and is open to the public, so Olbermann is mostly on the mark with his characterization of the program. On his other two points — that 10,000 people are enrolled and that it was introduced by a Republican governor — Olbermann is correct. All in all, we give him a Mostly True.",/factchecks/2009/nov/02/keith-olbermann/olbermann-claims-connecticut-has-public-plan/

Ron DeSantis falsely claims Biden trying to ‘buy off’ states to adopt critical race theory
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized President Joe Biden for what he said were attempts to ""indoctrinate students"" with critical race theory. In a press conference, DeSantis hailed the state’s improving test scores on civics and history and contrasted Florida’s approach — which included contentious civics training for educators — with the Biden administration’s ""ideological agenda."" ""These efforts all come as Congress considers the misleadingly titled ‘Civics Secures Democracy Act,’ which would allow the Biden Administration to buy off states with $6 billion if they sacrifice American History for Critical Race Theory and Biden’s other political whims of the day,"" DeSantis said in a press release on June 30.  If passed, the Civics Secures Democracy Act, introduced with bipartisan support in 2022, will prioritize civics education and devote $1 billion annually to bolster the effort.  We wondered whether DeSantis was right that the legislation provides $6 billion to states that incorporate critical race theory, a broad set of ideas about systemic bias and privilege, into their curricula.  PolitiFact found that DeSantis’ portrayal was inaccurate. The bill would authorize the education secretary to make grants to support educational programs in civics. It doesn’t mention critical race theory. The legislation was introduced in June by a bipartisan group of senators, including Republicans Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and John Cornyn of Texas, Democrats Chris Coons of Delaware and Mark Kelly of Arizona, and independent Angus King of Maine. DeSantis and other Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have condemned the bill, suggesting it will give the federal government the financial backing to compel states to adopt critical race theory.  Cornyn defended the legislation from Republican criticism, tweeting on June 20 that such claims are ""hysterical"" and ""not a serious discussion of our bill."" Further, the evidence tying the Civics Secures Democracy Act to critical race theory is rife with speculation. DeSantis’ argument ignores a provision in the bill that reads: ""Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the Secretary of Education to prescribe a civics and history curriculum."" David Shultz, professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University, told PolitiFact that if the bill becomes law, the U.S. Department of Education ""will lack any administrative authority to create rules to mandate a curriculum."" ""There is no truth to the claim that the proposed Civics Secures Democracy Act is a backdoor effort to mandate the teaching of critical race theory,"" Shultz said. ""There is no precedent for the federal government to mandate state education curriculum, and it is not clear that the federal government has the authority to do that even if it tried."" When we asked DeSantis about his claim, spokesperson Christina Pushaw said there is ""extensive evidence"" that the Biden administration is promoting ""ideological indoctrination,"" pointing to an article from the National Review, a conservative magazine.  The article didn’t provide credible evidence that the measure would ""buy off"" states and relied heavily on prediction. It said the bill’s direction to prioritize grant proposals that will close gaps in ""civic knowledge and achievement"" among ""underserved students"" is a push for critical race theory.  The article then suggested the criteria for receiving the grants could entice states to conform their curricula to ""federal demands,"" such as when states began adopting Common Core, a set of national educational standards.  Common Core’s critics have often accused the federal government of coercing states into adopting the standards in exchange for grant money. We have fact-checked similar claims about Common Core before and found them inaccurate.  A U.S. Department of Education spokesperson directed PolitiFact to a webpage explaining the federal government’s role in education.  ""Education is primarily a state and local responsibility in the United States,"" the website reads. States and communities ""establish schools and colleges, develop curricula and determine requirements for enrollment and graduation."" A 2021 blog post from Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said his department ""has not, does not, and will not dictate or recommend specific curriculum be introduced or taught in classrooms."" DeSantis also conflated the amount of federal grant funding offered to state education agencies.  The Civics Secures Democracy Act would set aside about $6 billion for federal civics education grant programs over the next six years — but much of it would not go to the states. The bill would award $585 million to state education agencies for civics initiatives annually for six years — totaling about $3.5 billion. The rest of the funding would go to nonprofit organizations, universities, researchers and a new fellowship program.  DeSantis said the Civics Secures Democracy Act ""would allow the Biden administration to buy off states with $6 billion"" and compel them to adopt critical race theory. But his claim ignores a provision in the bill that prevents the education secretary from imposing a curriculum on states that accept the grant funding. Also, the legislation does not mention critical race theory. Instead, it prioritizes grant proposals that improve civic knowledge among ""traditionally underserved students."" DeSantis also misrepresented the amount of grant funding reserved for the states. The bill would award $585 million to state education agencies for civics initiatives annually for six years — totaling about $3.5 billion, not $6 billion.  The rest of the funding would be given to nonprofit organizations, universities, researchers and a new fellowship program.  We rate DeSantis’ claim False.",/factchecks/2022/jul/08/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-falsely-claims-biden-trying-buy-state/

Trump was in SUV after Jan. 6 rally, not presidential limousine

Mayor Johnson overestimates economic benefit of hosting RNC
","Editor's Note: Since this item was first published, VISIT Milwaukee reduced its estimate for hotel revenue from the RNC. The change is reflected in the text.   In 2020, before the pandemic upended plans, the fact the Democratic National Convention was coming to Milwaukee was widely cheered. Now, with a decision looming on whether the city will get to host the 2024 Republican National Convention, views are more mixed. Liberal groups from across the state have called on city officials to reject the convention, citing Republicans who continue to question the results of the 2020 presidential election and a range of other criticisms. But the Milwaukee Common Council ultimately endorsed an agreement with the Republican National Committee, which is to decide between Milwaukee and Nashville in the coming weeks. Various city officials, including Mayor Cavalier Johnson, have boasted of the benefits of holding the convention – including one boast that we found goes too far. During a May 27, 2022 news conference, Johnson said that the RNC is ""a $200 million economic infusion into our communities."" Let’s dig in. The $200 million number was based on estimates from the city’s tourism bureau, VISIT Milwaukee, according to a Johnson spokesperson. The estimate, in turn, was based on a study by Cleveland State University on the economic impact of the 2016 RNC in Cleveland. So why use the 2016 RNC as a basis? VISIT Milwaukee used the study for a number of reasons, including that it’s the most recent non-pandemic political convention. What’s more, Milwaukee has a similar population and geography to Cleveland, said Peggy Williams-Smith, president and CEO of VISIT Milwaukee. ""We’re confident that this convention will have not only a short-term economic boost, especially for our hospitality businesses, but will lead to more and larger meetings in the long run,"" Williams-Smith said. She noted that Cleveland officials believe the 2016 RNC played a role in securing the NBA and Major League Baseball all-star games. Williams-Smith believes that hotel nights alone could generate $32 million (the convention is expected to draw about 45,000 people and will have to secure at least 16,000 rooms for state delegations) and other parts of the hospitality industry will benefit. Note: (After this item was published, VISIT Milwaukee reduced its estimate of revenue from hotels to $23.2 million. ""It should not be forgotten that one amazing part about Milwaukee is how many of our restaurants are locally owned and totally unique to our city,"" she told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Many of them will benefit just as the hotels will."" Let’s look more closely at the Cleveland study, which was completed by a four-person team at Cleveland State University’s Center for Economic Development. The Cleveland study examined the RNC’s economic impact through spending by the RNC Host Committee, spending by the city of Cleveland, and visitor spending. The total labor income tied to Cleveland hosting the RNC reached $52.4 million and the value-added impact was $84.8 million — bringing the total impact to $142.2 million, according to the study. The RNC was responsible for $16.9 million in taxes (that’s 30% in state and local taxes and 70% in federal taxes). All in all, the overall economic impact of Cleveland hosting the RNC in 2016 included 855 direct jobs, $27.6 million in labor income and supported 1,348 total jobs. So, does that make the $200 million estimate from VISIT Milwaukee correct? One academic who has studied the fiscal impact of national political conventions says the estimate is likely far higher than the actual impact will be, especially when you look at how the local economy will benefit. Victor Matheson, an economics professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, along with two co-authors carried out an extensive peer-reviewed study that analyzed the economic impact on cities who have hosted the Republican and Democratic national conventions from 1970 to 2004. The study carried out by Matheson and other academics discerned that there were no ""significant wage gains for local employees"" and that the ""economic gain from the event does not accrue to the host city but rather benefits the bottom line back at corporate headquarters."" The report found the presence of the Republican or Democratic convention had ""no discernible impact on employment, personal income, or personal income per capita in the cities."" It also noted that many studies exaggerate the ""multiplier"" effect of money spent in the community, which is meant to approximate how often it changes hands. For instance, money paid to a hotel goes products from local companies and goes to pay staff members, who in turn spend it on gas, food and even their own entertainment. When looking at just the hotel revenue, Matheson told us the study found revenue increased by $20 million on average. ""It's pretty hard to get from $20 million of hotel revenue, up to $200 million in total economic activity,"" he said, adding: ""Even if you could get $200 million worth of expenditures, it certainly wouldn't be $200 million of money that winds up in the pockets of local Milwaukee residents."" For a convention, much of the money will quickly leave the community, he said, providing these examples among others: ""I think it's almost certainly wildly exaggerated,"" Matheson said. Johnson claimed the RNC is ""a $200 million economic infusion into our communities."" While the figure from VISIT Milwaukee is grounded in the experience of Cleveland in 2016, an expert who has studied a range of past conventions say it is ""wildly exaggerated."" What’s more, even if anticipated spending figures were reached, much of the money would quickly leave the local economy for other places. We rate the claim Half True.  ",/factchecks/2022/jul/08/cavalier-johnson/mayor-johnson-overestimates-economic-benefit-hosti/

Florida not requiring professors, students to register political views with the state
","Author and ""King of Horror"" Stephen King has had readers switching on the nightlight for six decades.  But on July 6, King took the fright to Twitter, warning his followers that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill ""requiring Florida students, professors to register political views with (the) state."" His claim copied the headline of a June 2021 article published by Salon (Salon has since changed its headline), and was echoed by others on Twitter in reference to Florida House Bill 233. The bill requires the states’ public colleges and universities to ""conduct an annual assessment of the intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity,"" using a survey developed by the State Board of Education or the Board of Governors.  The inaugural surveys were emailed to faculty and students in early April 2022. Copies of the surveys were sent to PolitiFact by Andrew Gothard, statewide president of the United Faculty of Florida and an instructor at Florida Atlantic University. The faculty survey has one question about participants’ political leanings (asking if people were conservative, moderate, liberal or none of the above), but the majority of the survey concerns the university’s cultivation of open political discourse and whether certain political viewpoints are discouraged or favored. The student survey has no questions on participants’ political beliefs. The survey begins with the disclaimer that it is both anonymous and ""completely voluntary."" Although many critics fear the new bill could limit free speech, the 2022 survey is not a required registration of political views as King claimed. PolitiFact reached out to King’s team for comment but received no response.  House Bill 233 was one of three education bills DeSantis signed into law on June 22, 2021. After banning the teaching of ""critical race theory"" a few weeks prior, DeSantis said he saw the bill as an opportunity to protect free speech and promote ""intellectual diversity"" on college campuses.  ""The goal of this legislation is to ensure that no one feels as though a political ideology is being forced on them in higher education, from any angle,"" said Christina Pushaw, press secretary for DeSantis, ""The college campus is supposed to be a place to freely discuss ideas, weigh them against one another, and draw informed conclusions. It is not supposed to be an indoctrination camp pushing any singular ideology."" The bill requires ""an objective, nonpartisan, and statistically valid survey to be used by each institution which considers the extent to which competing ideas and perspectives are presented and members of the college community, including students, faculty, and staff, feel free to express their beliefs and viewpoints on campus and in the classroom."" The 2022 survey, the first of its kind, asked students and faculty how they agree or disagree with a number of statements about the educational environment on campus. Here are a few examples from the student survey:  My college or university campus provides an environment for free expression of ideas, opinions, and beliefs. My professors or course instructors use class time to express their own social or political beliefs without objectively discussing opposing social or political beliefs. I feel comfortable speaking up and giving my views on controversial topics. I have felt intimidated to share my ideas or political opinions because they were different from those of my professors. And from the faculty survey:  Students in my classes are exposed to competing arguments and multiple perspectives on a topic. Students at my institution are not shielded from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable or even deeply offensive. An expectation of receiving continuing contract/tenure is that faculty ascribe to a particular political viewpoint. My institution encourages research, publications, dissertations, etc. on topics that span both liberal and conservative viewpoints. If participants disagree with certain statements, they are asked which views are favored — conservative or liberal. The survey ends with a series of identity questions on race, gender and position at the university.  Although the 2022 survey was anonymous and voluntary, the bill’s language does not require such criteria. The open-ended language led to speculation after its signing about whether faculty and students would be required to share their political affiliation. Based on statements from the Florida Department of Education, PolitiFact found a similar claim to be False in 2021.  Critics of the bill, like Gothard of the United Faculty of Florida, see the legislation as an attempt to ""chill the right to freedom of speech, freedom of association and the right to privacy among all the Florida students, higher education students, faculty, and staff."" Gothard also expressed concern that if future survey results are not anonymous, they could be used against faculty. The United Faculty of Florida, the higher education branch of the Florida Education Association, is challenging the bill’s legality in federal court.  Pushaw told PolitiFact that the administration wants the survey to remain anonymous and voluntary. ""That’s the best way to understand how respondents really feel,"" she said. ""If some people don’t want to take the survey for whatever reason, that’s their prerogative."" King claimed DeSantis signed a ​​bill ""requiring Florida students, professors to register political views with (the) state."" Florida House Bill 233 requires an assessment of the ""intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity"" at state colleges and universities. Although not stipulated in the bill, the 2022 survey was anonymous and voluntary. Only the faculty survey had a question pertaining to individual political beliefs.  It remains to be seen whether future surveys will change, but DeSantis’ press secretary said the administration’s goal is to keep the survey anonymous and voluntary. We rate King’s statement False.  UPDATE: After we published this fact-check, Stephen King gave a statement to CNN on the matter: ""I regret having posted the headline without being more confident the story was correct. Salon is usually more reliable. Twitter is a constant learning experience, and I will try to do better.""",/factchecks/2022/jul/07/stephen-king/florida-not-requiring-professors-students-register/

Lyu said: ""The time-stretching algorithm is widely used to change the playback speech of audio, but it tries to keep the original pitch in the sound while slowing down the tempo, so that the slowed sound would not sound like slowing down a vinyl record."" ""In my opinion,"" Lyu said, ""there is no doubt that the Facebook version of the video is a slowed-down version of the original PBS video.""  It’s the same technique that was used to slow down a speech by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to make it appear like she was slurring in 2019, he said.   We then rated claims that Pelosi was slurring during her speech Pants on Fire.  This post gets the same rating: Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2022/jul/07/viral-image/video-joe-biden-slowed-down-his-speech/
