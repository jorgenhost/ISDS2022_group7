RNC chair Reince Priebus says today's long-term unemployment is worse than Great Depression
","
During a June 12, 2011, face-off between party chairs on NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus compared the unemployment situation since the start of the past recent recession to what the nation faced during the Great Depression.

Priebus invoked the Great Depression twice during the joint interview with Democratic counterpart, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.

The first instance came as Priebus was parrying questions about why he has failed to call for the resignation of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., after Vitter was implicated in a prostitution scandal. (The topic came up because the day before Meet the Press aired, Wasserman Schultz had been among several Democratic House leaders to call for the resignation of Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., who is embroiled in a scandal for texting sexually suggestive photos to young women.)

Priebus said, in part, ""Look, I'm not defending these guys, but the fact of the matter is, we have big issues here to tackle in this country. We have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression. We have gas prices that are out of this world. We have crushing debt. We know what's happening to this economy. And here's the problem. It's not so much as much as 'the economy, stupid,' as people say, it's 'the policy's stupid' too. And the president's policies in regard to saving this country, getting our economy back on track are not working.""

The second instance came when Priebus sought to counter Wasserman Schultz’s defense of President Barack Obama’s economic record.

Addressing host David Gregory, Priebus said, ""The chairwoman's living in Fantasyland. We know that the facts are the facts, and we can't get away from that. And Barack Obama is defenseless to the truth on what's going on in the American economy. We have lost as--two and a half million jobs since Barack Obama's been president. And of that two and a half million jobs, almost 45 percent of those people have been out of work for six months. That number, that number rivals the Great Depression.""

We perceive these two references to the Great Depression as related, but distinct, so we’ll take them in turn.

First, is it fair to say that ""we have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression""?

As bad as the unemployment situation is currently -- and it’s unquestionably bad -- there’s little statistical support that it ""rivals"" the situation that existed during the Great Depression.

Before we analyze this further, we will mention a caveat. The current system for measuring the unemployment rate began shortly after World War II. The methodology used during the Great Depression was similar, but not identical. One difference is that post-war statistics are available on a monthly basis, whereas Depression-era statistics are available only on an annual basis. Another is that the 1930’s data includes those age 14 and up, not 16 as today.

We asked several economists whether the differences in methodology suggest that it’s inaccurate to compare the old-fashioned statistics to the current ones. They agreed that comparisons are appropriate as long as the differences are disclosed.

So, what did the unemployment rate look like during the Great Depression?

1930: 8.7 percent
1931: 15.9 percent
1932: 23.6 percent
1933: 24.9 percent
1934: 21.7 percent
1935: 20.1 percent
1936: 16.9 percent
1937: 14.3 percent
1938: 19.0 percent
1939: 17.2 percent
1940: 14.6 percent
1941: 9.9 percent

And how does that compare to today? The current monthly unemployment rate -- for May 2011 -- is 9.1 percent. Since the onset of the current recession in December 2007, unemployment has spiked as high as 10.1 percent, in October 2009. And the annual unemployment rates for 2009 and 2010 -- perhaps the closest analogue to the Depression-era statistics -- are 9.3 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively.

Any way you cut it, peak unemployment since the start of the most recent recession, as bad as it has been, remains well under half of the peak it reached during the Great Depression. For more than a decade, annual unemployment never fell below 14.3 percent, or a level about 40 percent higher than the worst of what we’ve seen recently. Any suggestion that the two situations are equivalent requires herculean cherry picking.

So Priebus is wrong on the first claim. But what about the second -- that ""almost 45 percent of (the unemployed) have been out of work for six months,"" a number that ""rivals the Great Depression""?

Priebus is correct on the current figure. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 45.1 percent of unemployed workers have been jobless for at least 27 weeks. That’s not the highest rate in recent months, but it’s in line with historically high levels.

But Priebus’ comparison has a problem: We couldn’t find any equivalent data from the Great Depression, and the economists we spoke to weren’t aware of any either.

The only place we saw this claim made came in a CBS News story from June 5, 2011, which said that ""45.1 percent of all unemployed workers in this country have been jobless for more than six months -- a higher percentage than during the Great Depression."" When we checked with the CBS reporter, Ben Tracy, he told us that there had been an error in the story due to some garbled relaying of information and that a corrected version of the story had been ordered.

At PolitiFact, our policy is that citing a news account does not protect a statement from being ruled False if it turns out that news account is inaccurate. 
When we contacted the RNC, we were told that the notion that unemployment ""rivals the Great Depression"" is valid since there are 13.9 million unemployed Americans today, according to BLS, compared to a maximum of 12.8 million unemployed Americans during the Great Depression, specifically in 1933. ""‘Rivals’ would be the right characterization,"" the RNC said in a statement. ""Chairman Priebus did not cite the ‘unemployment rate,"" as PolitiFact did in its query.

But we think this is a ridiculous comparison, since the population of the United States was 123 million then, compared to nearly 309 million today.

On the second point, the RNC said it had been referring to the CBS News story, but also pointed to a 1984 paper from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that said that ""the 1981-82 recession resulted in levels of long-term unemployment far higher than any experienced since the Great Depression,"" specifically 25.7 percent.

In an e-mail to PolitiFact, the RNC argued that ""today, chronic unemployment of 27 weeks or longer is 45.1 percent. As BLS itself cited the Great Depression in talking about a chronic unemployment rate almost half of what it is today, we think it’s more than fair for Chairman Priebus to make the Great Depression comparison in reference to today’s numbers.""

We disagree. Just because BLS in 1984 said that the 1981-1982 recession ""resulted in levels of long-term unemployment far higher than any experienced since the Great Depression"" doesn’t mean that nearly doubling the rate brings it to levels that ""rival"" the Great Depression. The fact that the recent recession was the worst since the Great Depression doesn't mean that it ""rivals"" the Great Depression in severity. The fact is, the RNC can’t point to any statistic that makes its point. Maybe it’s true, but with the disappearance of the erroneous CBS report, there is no evidence for it.

More broadly, both liberal and conservative economists expressed skepticism about Priebus’ comparison of the recent recession and the Great Depression.

""The pre-World War II statistics are, at best, very sketchy, so people have a lot of ability to make claims that are hard to verify or debunk,"" said Daniel Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. He added that, in his view, ""the unemployment rate assertion seems a bit farfetched. I suppose Priebus also could be looking at the broader measures of unemployment, some of which have been north of 15 percent for quite some time. But we don't have any comparable figures for the 1930s, so that's uncharted territory.""

Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, agreed that he sees no ""sound factual basis"" for either of Priebus’ two claims. However, he said it’s important to remember that the statistics we have suggest that the most recent recession has been the worst since the Great Depression.

So where does this leave us? Today’s jobs picture is the worst it has been in decades, not just measured by unemployment rates but also by duration of unemployment. However, all of the available statistics -- imperfect though they may be -- suggest that today’s numbers aren’t anywhere near high enough to ""rival"" those that prevailed for more than a decade during the Great Depression. We rate Priebus’ statement False.",/factchecks/2011/jun/13/reince-priebus/rnc-chair-reince-priebus-says-todays-long-term-une/

Rep. Tim Ryan says Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal will cost patients $6,000 more a year
","
Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat from Niles, Ohio, shares a last name with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, but the pair don’t share the same vision for Medicare, the U.S. government’s health insurance program for the nation’s elderly and chronically disabled.

Republican Paul Ryan’s budget blue print suggests retaining the current Medicare system for people who are currently over age 55 but giving future retirees a ""premium support payment"" they could use to purchase private insurance, prompting Democrats to accuse the GOP of attempting to dismantle Medicare. Those on the House Energy and Commerce Committee even put out a report that purports to outline the amount of extra Medicare costs that the new program would require taxpayers in every congressional district to pay.

Tim Ryan, whose office frequently gets phone calls meant for the other Ryan, took to the House floor on May 24 to denounce the GOP plan. He argued that the value of the proposed vouchers would not keep pace with heath care costs because they’d be linked to the Consumer Price Index, which hasn’t risen as fast as health care costs.

""The average person going into this Medicare proposal will pay $6,000 more a year,"" Ohio’s Ryan said in his speech.

Would the GOP plan escalate yearly out-of-pocket health care costs for the elderly as significantly as Tim Ryan claims?

The budget by Wisconsin’s Ryan  --  which he dubbed  ""The Path to Prosperity"" -- argues that Medicare won’t be able to meet the needs of current seniors or future generations without reforms. It aims to balance the federal budget by slicing $5.8 trillion in government spending over 10 years, reforming taxes and trimming the growth of entitlement programs including Medicare.

An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that Ryan’s plan would accomplish its budget balancing goals, putting the budget into a surplus by 2040, and reducing federal debt to about 10 percent of Gross Domestic Product by 2050. Much of that would be accomplished by reducing the government’s costs for Medicare.

Currently, Medicare is a ""fee for service"" program, which pays health care providers for each procedure or visit. Instead, Paul Ryan wants the government to issue a subsidy that will pay part - but probably not all - of the cost of a person’s health insurance. The size of that subsidy would depend on the beneficiary’s income and health status.

Ryan’s GOP ""Path to Prosperity"" document calls Medicare a ""top-down, government-run system"" marked by unnecessary tests, redundant treatment and an inefficient bureaucracy that bungles billings and misplaces records. It contends the system’s ""open-ended blank-check commitments to reimburse health-care providers for services"" creates incentives for them to bilk the government. Such flaws drive up costs, threatening to ""bankrupt the system - and ultimately the nation,"" the budget document says.

Starting in 2022, Paul Ryan’s budget blueprint calls for enrolling new Medicare beneficiaries in a program that would pay ""a Medicare premium-support payment"" to an insurance plan ""chosen by the beneficiary, subsidizing its cost."" Existing Medicare beneficiaries could stay in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan, or enroll in the new program. The age for Medicare eligibility would ratchet up by two month increments each year, until it reached 67 in 2033.
       
Analyses by the Congressional Budget Office, which does budgetary analysis for both parties in Congress, and by the Kaiser Family Foundation concluded that Medicare beneficiaries coming into the system after 2022 would spend significantly more for health care under the proposal from Wisconsin’s Ryan. Pegging the growth of the federal government’s Medicare payments to the Consumer Price Index will save the federal government money, but ""expose beneficiaries to increasingly larger out-of-pocket costs and risks over time,"" the Kaiser report says.

""First, private plans would cost more than traditional Medicare because of the net effect of differences in payment rates for providers, administrative costs, and utilization of health care services,"" said CBO’s report on Paul Ryan’s plan. ""Second, the government’s contribution would grow more slowly than health care costs, leaving more for beneficiaries to pay.""

The CBO estimates the net federal premium support payments for a typical 65-year-old would be $8,000, or 39 percent of Medicare spending per enrollee, under the program that would be established by the GOP’s ""Path to Prosperity.""  That means the total cost of providing health care benefits (premium and other costs) to a typical 65-year-old in such a plan would be about $20,500 in 2022. The beneficiary would pay $12,500 in out-of-pocket costs.

Using CBO projections, the folks at Kaiser did the math, and determined that if a person who turned 65 in 2022 were to remain in the traditional Medicare system, the out-of-pocket costs would be just $5,630 - a full $6,870 less than it would be under the new program.

Kaiser explains it would cost more money to provide benefits under the Republican proposal ""because private plans have higher administrative costs and typically pay higher fees to providers than Medicare.""

""While private plans may be able to achieve lower utilization through tighter costs and care management practices, the CBO believes the total costs of providing a similar benefit package would be higher under private plans than Medicare, and that the differential between the costs under traditional Medicare and the costs under private plans would widen over time,"" the Kaiser report says.

Paul Ryan’s proposal would reduce federal spending for Medicare by providing future beneficiaries with a fixed amount of money they could put towards an insurance premium, leaving them on the hook for significantly greater out-of-pocket payments than they’d pay under the current Medicare system.

In his speech, Tim Ryan said said that those new out-of-pocket costs would amount to $6,000 each year, a bit of less than what the CBO calculated. So although perhaps undersold, Tim Ryan’s claim is accurate with nothing significant missing for an understanding.

On the Truth-O-Meter, that rates as true.",/factchecks/2011/jun/13/tim-ryan/rep-tim-ryan-says-rep-paul-ryans-medicare-proposal/
"['State Budget', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Gov. Rick Scott says state debt is $23 billion
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a record $615 million from the 2011-12 state budget on May 26, 2011, targeting an array of money for projects such as university buildings, a rainwater study and $4.8 million for public broadcasting.

The latter cut caused station managers across the state to worry about possible layoffs, station closings and an increased reliance on private donations.

In a June 2 interview, ABC 27 reporter Jerry Hume in Tallahassee asked Scott if vetoing public broadcasting dollars was a hard choice compared to other line items. Here is Scott's full response (available by video):

""I don't think the state ought to be paying for that. But the easy ones are things like studying how to collect rainwater, stuff like that, and a new barn and things like that. But there's a lot of tough ones. But the way I thought about it was, what should state government be doing? I mean, there's a lot of good things in there, but they were local issues, or charity should be doing it, or there's a better way of doing it, or we're already doing it a different way.

""And on top of that, I don't want to increase the debt in the state. We already have $23 billion worth of debt, so those are things I thought about. But really, it was how do we get jobs going?""

Scott mentions the state debt as support for his big cuts, even though the state wasn't going to issue new debt just for public broadcasting. But it got us thinking: How big is the state debt, anyway?

Turns out, this isn't the first time Scott has bemoaned the state's debt. In late May, Scott warned he was thinking about vetoing Public Education Capital Outlay projects, which pay for college and university construction projects and represent the state's largest bond program. He said the added debt of $134 million could jeopardize the state's credit rating and increase costs of future borrowing.

""I'm clearly focused on the amount of debt the state has,"" Scott said then. ""I'm clearly focused on the debt rating.""

Where does he get that number?

Our search for the state debt level starts with Scott spokesman Lane Wright. He directed us to a December 2010 report on Florida's debt affordability, written by the State Board of Administration's Division of Bond Finance. The division is responsible for executing bonds authorized by the Legislature and administers financing programs for educational facilities and transportation projects, among other programs.

As of June 30, 2010, the state's total overall debt outstanding stood at $28.2 billion.

Now, this doesn't mean Scott's figure is off from the get-go. That $28.2 billion figure includes $23.6 billion for ""net tax-supported debt"" and $4.6 billion for ""self-supporting debt.""

These are important differences to understand (page 7 of the document is helpful).

Net tax-supported debt, which Scott seems to reference in his TV interview, is debt accrued when the state issues bonds to raise money for spending on projects such as PECO, Everglades restoration, right-of-way acquisition for roads and bridge construction.

Self-supporting debt is made up of bonds that include a source of revenue, and is excluded when calculating the state's benchmark debt ratio. Examples of this are bonds to build toll roads, covered by the tolls, or university dorm maintenance, covered by student fees.

Net tax-supported debt is paid off through the state's ability to tax all residents and tourists, while self-supporting debt is paid off by the people who pay to use the facilities.

The benchmark debt ratio is important SBA jargon for measuring the state's annual payment on borrowed money, said Ben Watkins, the division's director. The annual payment, called debt service, works kind of like a mortgage, in which you pay off a chunk each year over a certain span of years. Debt service is based on tax-supported debt. To calculate the benchmark debt ratio, the division divides the annual debt service -- for tax-supported debt only -- by available state revenues.

Florida Statutes say the ratio should not exceed a target of 6 percent and a cap of 7 percent. But in 2010, it was over the cap at 7.91 percent. That did not happen as a result of outstanding debt, Watkins said, but declining state revenues (the denominator of the benchmark ratio equation). The Legislature authorized more borrowing in 2010 due to a ""critical state emergency,"" pursuant to state law.

The law on benchmark debt ratios is really a ""soft"" policy limit to give lawmakers perspective on how much debt the state can afford, Watkins said. The cap is seen as a planning tool and not an absolute ceiling, though other states have ""hard limits."" Still, exceeding the ""soft cap"" should signal the state has borrowed all it should, and more borrowing should happen for absolutely essential projects, Watkins said.

Anyway, Florida pays about $2.1 billion a year for debt service on the state's tax-supported debt.

There's another type of debt to consider, called indirect debt. Unlike tax-supported and self-supported debt, this category does not get as much attention because the debt obligation lies with a separate legal entity such as Citizens Property Insurance, Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Finance Corporation, water management districts or the Florida Housing Finance Corporation -- not the state. As of June 30, 2010, the indirect debt total was $16.4 billion. It is a whopping figure, but it is not included in the state's debt ratios or debt burden, according to the report.

We mention all of this to explain that Scott is essentially short-handing the state's debt by describing it as $23 billion. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

""This is the debt (figure) that matters to the state from a financial management perspective,"" Watkins said.

Putting Florida debt in context

Now that we've considered the 2010 financial report, we looked for another opinion to make sure we understood all the context. Florida TaxWatch, a group that analyzes state spending and taxes, uses the same data supplied by the Division of Bond Finance to track the debt.

Kurt Wenner, TaxWatch vice president of tax research, echoed much of Watkins' analysis and agreed that $23 billion is probably the most accurate figure to use to describe the state debt.

""That is the amount of debt that is backed by Florida taxpayers,"" Wenner said.

Florida's debt doesn't get as many people talking as the country's $14 trillion-plus national debt. One explanation is that Florida has a balanced budget requirement, Wenner said. So it cannot ""spend money it simply doesn't have, like Washington does.""

Florida's borrowed money goes toward ""bricks and sticks"" projects, Watkins said, and not for normal government operations.

Florida's total outstanding debt last year grew $1.8 billion, exceeding the $1 billion average for the past decade, according to the report. Still, the debt is considered ""moderate"" and ""manageable"" at its current level.

Our ruling

Scott said he thought about the state's $23 billion debt as he weighed whether to veto certain programs. We verified that figure with the Division of Bond Finance's most recent estimate, and experts consider the figure a street convention to describe the debt. We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/13/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-state-debt-23-billion/

Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst says 1,000 World War II veterans die every day
","
On the 67th anniversary of D-Day, when allied troops landed in France to fight Nazi forces on the beaches of Normandy, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst took to Twitter to praise World War II veterans.

""We lose 1000 #WWII veterans every day. Take a moment to share your stories & thank America's #GreatestGeneration,"" he tweeted on June 6.

With nearly 70 years gone since D-Day, it’s no wonder that many veterans of the war are passing away. But 1,000 a day?

Dewhurst spokesman Mike Walz passed on eight pieces of documentation to back up his boss, including four news articles. The latest, a May 31, 2010, Dallas Morning News article, said: ""Only about two million World War II veterans are still alive, and an estimated 1,000 die every day.""

Walz also passed on a congressional transcript, in which then-U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, who served as national chairman of the World War II Memorial Campaign, said at a June 2000 U.S. House hearing: ""We are losing 1,000 World War II veterans every day. We have lost over 1 million since March 1997.""

So the daily statistic is at least 10 years old. Does it stand?

According to data from the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, in fiscal year 2010, about 263,000 veterans who served during World War II died, nearly 15,000 of whom lived in Texas. Nationally, that’s about 721 a day.

Some 244,000 are expected to die in 2011, according to the department’s estimates — nearly 670 a day.

In 2002, nearly 368,000 World War II veterans died, or just more than 1,000 a day. By 2006, the number dropped to about 332,000, or 909 a day. By 2008, about 815 veterans on average were dying each day.

Veteran Affairs spokesman Ozzie Garza told us: ""The number is decreasing because, of course, there’s fewer World War II veterans alive now."" Today, the average age of a World War II vet is 92, he said.

As of Sept. 30, 2010, about 23 million veterans were alive nationwide, with 1.7 million in Texas. Of those veterans, nearly 1.8 million served during World War II, with 101,400 of that war’s veterans living in Texas.

Lastly, we wondered how veteran deaths from that era compared to those who served during the Vietnam War era, from 1964-1975. According to Veteran Affairs data, 103,890 died in 2010, about 285 a day. And veterans who served during the Korean War? In 2010, nearly 134,000 died, or 367 a day.

Bottom line: Dewhurst’s well-meaning salute relies on an outdated statistic, overstating the number who now die daily. Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/13/david-dewhurst/lt-gov-david-dewhurst-says-1000-world-war-ii-veter/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Taxes', 'Steve Oroho']","
Sen. Steve Oroho says New Jersey has nation’s highest per-pupil cost
","
What’s so bad about finishing in first place?

Plenty, if you’re New Jersey and per-pupil costs top those of any other state in the nation, according to State Sen. Steve Oroho (R-Dist. 24). He cited that statistic in a May 26 Star-Ledger news story about how the Legislature will fit a Supreme Court-ordered $500 million payment to New Jersey’s 31 Abbott districts in the state budget. Lawmakers have to reach an agreement before July 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year, on how to spend approximately $30 billion.

Oroho said in that story that he won’t vote for a budget that sends the $500 million just to the Abbott districts.

""We have the highest per-pupil cost in the country,"" he said. ""No one can say there’s not enough money in education.""

PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check whether Oroho was right.

The senator, a certified financial planner who serves on the Senate’s Budget and Appropriations and Economic Growth committees, told us he researched National Center for Education Statistics data going back to the 2004-05 academic year. He said his statement was based on data for 2006-07, which showed that New Jersey’s per-pupil cost -- for grades K-12 and including all school districts -- was $17,794.

PolitiFact New Jersey contacted the nonpartisan National Center for Education Statistics to vet Oroho’s statistic. We studied nearly 10 years’ worth of data and found that among states, New Jersey has had the highest per-pupil cost in the nation since at least the 1999-00 school year. It’s worth noting that Washington, DC -- not a state -- had higher per-pupil costs than New Jersey from 1999-03 and from 2006-07.

Cathy Clement, operations officer for the National Center for Education Statistics, explained that the center’s data comes from information reported by local jurisdictions to states, which then report the data to the U.S. Department of Education. The national center is part of the Education Department’s Institute of Education Sciences.

The New Jersey Education Association, however, disputes Oroho’s claim.

Spokesman Steve Baker shared with PolitiFact New Jersey the Public Education Finances: 2009 report issued May 20 by the U.S. Census Bureau. It shows that New Jersey was third in per-pupil spending for the 2008-09 year, at $16,271. New York was highest, at $18,126, followed by Washington, DC, $16,408.

The National Center for Education Statistics told us the discrepancy stems from slight differences in what costs get reported and factors such as whether public charter schools are included.

We also checked with the New Jersey Department of Education to see which agency’s figures they would rely on for accurate per-pupil cost data.

""We often cite National Center for Education Statistics,"" said Alan Guenther, department spokesman.

So why is education so expensive in New Jersey? 
Both Oroho and Baker say there are multiple factors involved. Oroho points to administrative costs and regulatory requirements as possible factors. The NJEA’s Baker, referring to the School Finance 101 blog by Bruce Baker, no relation, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers University, cited special-needs programming and interventions, as well as education needs for children in poverty, as elements that contribute to per-pupil costs.

Let’s return to Oroho’s statement. The senator says New Jersey has the highest per-pupil costs in the country, but admits basing that statement on data for the 2006-07 and 2007-08 school years. Still, our analysis of data from a nonpartisan arm of the U.S. Department of Education shows that among states only, New Jersey has held the title of highest per-pupil costs in the nation for nearly a decade. The U.S. Census Bureau, however, ranks New Jersey’s per-pupil spending for 2008-09 as third-highest in the nation. Therefore, we rate Oroho’s statement Mostly True.

Mine in Wisconsin would operate for 100 years and generate billions
","The heat is on for state lawmakers to quickly approve a bill that would allow planning to proceed for a massive iron ore mine in far northern Wisconsin.

Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group, the week of June 1, 2011 launched a statewide radio ad campaign pushing for swift approval of legislation that allows mine planning to move forward. The group sees approval of the mine bill as a top priority, said Scott Manley, director of environmental policy.

One version of the ad is directed at residents of southeastern Wisconsin, and specifically those represented by state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills. She’s one of six Republican and three Democrat state senators facing recall elections this summer.

That ad urges listeners to call Darling’s office and ask her to support the ""Jobs for Generations Act.""

The ad says the mine project will create 2,000 jobs initially ""and sustain thousands of jobs statewide for years to come.""

""Over the 100 year life of the mine, it will generate billions of dollars in economic activity, and millions of dollars in tax revenue to pay for schools, libraries, roads, parks and other vital services.""

WMC’s ad stirs several questions, including what this mine has to do with residents in southeastern Wisconsin, and why Darling is a focus of the ad. There’s also another issue: No legislation has been introduced. More about these below.

The ad states that the mine will be open for 100 years, and will be a boon to the state’s economy. Let’s look at the broader impact of the mine, and how realistic it is that it would operate for so long and have such an impact. We’ll set aside for now the considerable environmental concerns that make this project highly controversial.

The mine would be located in a remote section of far northern Wisconsin, about 25 miles southeast of Ashland, near the burg of Mellen.

The project is proposed by Gogebic Taconite, a subsidiary of the Cline Group, a privately owned coal-mining company based in Florida with operations in Illinois and the Appalachian mountains. The firm holds the rights to mine the iron ore in a 22-mile-long portion of the ore body. The company would dig out the ore, crush it, and use water and magnets to extract the iron and then return the unused material, or tailings, back to the ground.

Gogebic wants to speed up the permitting process and eliminate steps that can be used by opponents to create years of delays. They want to condense a five- to seven-year process to 300 days.

The key to the project is the massive amount of iron ore believed to be there. Remember: We’re talking about the key component used to make the steel used in the cars and trucks of the future.

There are various estimates about the amount of iron ore at the Gogebic site. One estimate by the U.S. Geologic Survey says in excess of 2 billion tons. An earlier estimate said there was 3.7 billion tons.

The company is only seeking permission to mine the first phase, a 4.5 mile by 1.5 mile stretch along State Highway 77 east of Mellen. One projection says that the company could process about 8 million tons of ore a year, based on the current demand and prices for steel.

That phase would be mined for about 35 years, the company says. At 8 million tons a year, that’s less than 15 percent of the low-end estimated ore deposit.

At that rate, it’s going to take a lot longer than 100 years to dig up all of the ore.

The WMC’s 100 year claim is based on the 2 billion tons estimate. But the PolitiFact calculator says that at 8 million tons a year, it would take 250 years.

WMC’s Manley admitted that the 100 year claim was an estimate that depends ""on how quickly you can dig out 2.2 billion tons or iron ore.""

So the business group’s claim is off by more than a bit. But there’s are problems with their estimate beyond simple math. The permit being sought is for 35 years, in one phase. The company would have to seek another permit - or more than one - for expansion of the mine.

""The future of this proposed mine ultimately depends on the economics of the world iron ore market and the future of the domestic iron and steel industry,"" wrote Bruce A. Brown of the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey in a study about the project..

Gogebic Taconite says that the project would employ about 700 direct mining jobs, and 2,834 total jobs created from related businesses. Construction of the mine would create 3,000 jobs and have a $2 billion economic impact on the state, according to a study done by Gogebic by economist David Ward of NorthStar Economics.

Ward says the ripple effort of the mine’s operation would be $604 million, and produce $17 million in state and local taxes. That effect, too, extends the impact of the mine hundreds of miles, including to southeastern Wisconsin, home to mining equipment makers Joy Global and Bucyrus International.

That’s some project.

But that’s not what’s before the Legislature. In fact, nothing is before lawmakers right now. And Sen. Darling hasn’t indicated she’s opposed to the project.

A draft proposal of the mine law was circulated last month and scheduled for a hearing in a rushed fashion. But then it was pulled back for retooling.

The WMC ad isn’t limited to Darling’s district. Similar versions are being aired statewide and in the districts of all six Republican senators who face recall elections.

One thing is clear: The mining company (and WMC) want to get the bill approved while the Republicans control both the legislative and executive branches of state government. If the GOP loses the state Senate in the recall elections, the bill could face big delays.

So where does that leave us?

The state’s largest business group is ramping up the effort on behalf of Gogebic Taconite. They want state law changed so the company can receive speedier consideration -- and presumably approval -- of permits to mine iron ore in northern Wisconsin. Injecting the mine ads into the recall campaigns could lead to a quicker vote; it’s also a move by WMC to link business-friendly Darling to a project that could create many of jobs.

If approved, the mine could operate for decades and employ thousands of people. Yet the WMC ads take the extra leap of referring to the mine as having a 100 year life. That’s a leap. Any vote before today’s Legislature would be for the first 35 year phase. Another permit would be required to extend the project’s life. And the 100 year claim is based on current demand for steel. In short, it’s a complete guess.

It’s no surprise the state’s largest business group wants to put the best possible spin on a project that will generate heated debate. Surely, the mine could generate an economic boon to numerous parts of the state. But the claim leaves out some critical information -- the permits, details of the legislation, and assumptions of the market for steel decades in the future -- as it makes a sweeping claim about jobs and longevity. We rate the claim Mostly True.

Kathie Tovo says Austin City Council may vote to subsidize race track with $4 million a year
","
Kathie Tovo, facing Austin City Council Member Randi Shade in a June 18 runoff, says in a TV ad that debuted in April: ""We’re in a budget crisis, but the council may give $4 million a year to subsidize a race track. That’s the wrong priority.""

City Hall coughing up for vroom-vroom?

First, let’s brake to define ""subsidy."" Merriam-Webster’s Online Dictionary says it’s ""a grant by a government to a private person or company to assist an enterprise deemed advantageous to the public."" Offered examples are expenditures for public transit or to farmers in case of crop failure.

To back her claim, Tovo’s campaign pointed us to an eight-page ""fact sheet"" on her website touching on money that could flow to support Formula One races to be held on a track being built east of Austin’s airport.

According to the sheet, state Comptroller Susan Combs has agreed to provide $25 million a year for 10 years from a state trust fund to cover an annual sanctioning fee that local F1 organizers must pay to the British-based international race organization.

The fund reimburses event organizers with some of the ""extra"" sales, hotel, alcohol and car rental tax revenue attributable to the event itself — i.e., money that the state theoretically would not have collected if the event had not been held. In the past it has been used to attract NFL Super Bowls and the Major League and NBA All-Star games.

Per a 2009 state law, though, the state’s $25 million a year can only be spent if a local city or county government puts up $1 for every $6.25 in state aid. The law specifies that in order to get the state aid, local organizers need a local city or county to agree to endorse the event.

So, $4 million a year is to be ginned up locally with the money would be dedicated to covering costs of staging the event -- police overtime, say, or erecting traffic barriers -- municipal expenses that might otherwise be charged to the promoter.

Subsidy case closed?

Not by the lights of Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell. A June 8 Austin American-Statesman news article quotes Leffingwell saying during a June 7 City Council work session: ""The city will never put any money"" into the Formula One project.

During the session, Richard Suttle, the project’s Austin lawyer, said the first of the 10 payments will come from a local organizing committee, which in turn expects to get the money from the Formula One promoters. A city employee noted that the subsequent local contributions of $4 million will come from tax revenue the state expects to reap in connection with the races.

Next, we asked Tovo’s camp why the $4 million amounts to a subsidy if the first installment is to come from a non-governmental source and future payments are expected to reflect tax revenue that presumably would not exist without the races.

Jim Wick, Tovo’s deputy campaign manager, replied: ""What you have happening right now is the mayor and some members of the council are trying to figure out how to structure this so that it doesn’t appear the city (is) giving the promoters of this event a subsidy. It looks like fuzzy accounting.""

Shade campaign spokeswoman Lynda Rife pointed out by email that the trust fund money can be spent on the races -- not construction of the track itself. Also, each race ""is expected to generate more than $4 million in new tax revenue that wouldn't come to the city without the event taking place.""

Rife’s email continued: ""If we don’t generate that $4 million in new tax revenue from the event, then the city doesn’t have to pay the whole $4 million. The city is not on the hook, if the event doesn’t meet the performance standard,"" she said.

Notably, the city can use its contribution to the trust fund to pay race-related expenses. According to Rodney Gonzales, deputy director of the city's Economic Growth and Development Services office, any amount not spent to cover hosting expenses would remain in the trust fund the next year and could not be spent for other municipal purposes.

Time to wave our checkered flag.

Maybe we missed a hairpin turn or two, but it’s clear the council is gearing up to vote on an agreement committing tax revenue to a trust fund devoted to supporting the F1 races.

Subsidy? Sure, though Tovo’s statement skirts the expectation that the area will draw tax benefits equal to or exceeding the local expenditures. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/12/kathie-tovo/kathie-tovo-says-austin-city-council-may-vote-subs/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Lou Greenwald']","
Assemblyman Lou Greenwald says Gov. Chris Christie’s veto pen is to blame for New Jersey ranking the lowest out of the 50 states in job growth
","
Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden) wants to blame Gov. Chris Christie’s veto pen for New Jersey’s last-place finish in the nation for job growth. But with his own timing, the legislator is guilty of a false start.

As the state’s budget battle raged in Trenton, the Assembly Democrats on May 12 posted a video on their website -- www.assemblydems.com -- where Greenwald launched yet another attack on Christie.

In an accompanying message that day on Greenwald’s Facebook page, the assemblyman said: ""The Governor vetoed our 30 bill job creation package to put New Jerseyans back to work. Unfortunately, now New Jersey ranks 50th in the nation in job creation as a result.""

PolitiFact New Jersey decided to explore Greenwald’s argument, and found an inherent timing conflict between when the governor’s vetoes occurred and Greenwald’s job growth statistics.

First, let’s talk about that veto pen.

The Assembly Democrats on May 18 provided a list of 33 bills comprising the ""Back to Work NJ Economic Development Package."" Of those bills, 30 were passed by the Assembly and the Senate by early January, and another was passed by both houses by mid-February, according to the Legislature’s website. Two bills were passed only in the Assembly, never making it to the governor’s desk.

Of the 31 bills submitted to Christie by the time of Greenwald’s statement, the governor signed 13 and vetoed 18. After Greenwald’s statement, Christie signed one of the bills that he had conditionally vetoed. The Legislature had incorporated his recommendations.

Greenwald, who is chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee, is clearly wrong when he says the governor vetoed a ""30 bill job creation package.""

As far as whether those vetoes are to blame for New Jersey’s job growth ranking, here’s the problem: Christie vetoed those bills in February and March.

But when we checked with Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, about where Greenwald got his job growth rankings, Hester pointed us to federal data on job growth from December 2009 to December 2010.

That means, according to Greenwald’s logic, Christie’s vetoes in February and March were to blame for a lack of job growth through the previous December.

Asked about this timing conflict, Brian McGinnis, Greenwald’s communications director, emailed us a ""clarification,"" which read as follows:

""The reason why the Legislature passed a job creation package was to stimulate an economy struggling to create jobs that was on a worrisome trend. With the Governor’s failure to sign those bills, it destines New Jersey to continue falling further behind and stay dead last in the nation in job creation.""

But did Greenwald admit his original statement was wrong? McGinnis told us: ""The clarification speaks for itself.""

Now, let’s take a closer look at those job growth rankings.

Hester directed us to a chart on page 2 of a Feb. 4 report from the Pennsylvania-based, liberal-leaning Keystone Research Center.

According to that chart -- based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics -- New Jersey ranked 50th for the number of seasonally adjusted jobs created from December 2009 to December 2010.

But since Greenwald made his comments in May, PolitiFact New Jersey was looking for more recent figures.

Keystone Research Center told us that for the period from March 2010 to March 2011 -- the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics available at the time of Greenwald’s statement -- New Jersey ranked 49th in both the number of jobs created and the percent change in jobs.

To be more specific, New Jersey lost 1,700 jobs from March 2010 to March 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data at the time of Greenwald's statement. Kansas and New Mexico were the only other states to have job losses during that same time period, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

To explain New Jersey’s economic plight, experts from Rutgers University pointed to the loss of government jobs in 2010 and climbing tax rates during the last decade. Those increases helped erase the state’s previous reputation as a low-cost place to do business.

It’s worth noting that a less awful picture emerges when the study period is narrowed.

Doug Hall of the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, ran the numbers for us and determined that from September 2010 to March 2011, New Jersey ranked 37th in the number of jobs created and 43rd in percent change.

From December 2010 to March 2011, New Jersey ranked 36th in the number of jobs created and 43rd in percent change.

""There are signs of hope, I suppose,"" said Hall, director of EPI’s Economic Analysis and Research Network.

In regard to New Jersey's job figures between March 2010 and March 2011, the analyses performed by the Keystone Research Center and Hall were based on federal data for seasonally adjusted jobs available at the time of Greenwald's statement.

After a decade where private sector jobs sunk by 153,700 and government jobs rose by 68,800, New Jersey is starting to head in the other direction, according to James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.

In the first quarter of 2011, New Jersey added 6,100 private jobs -- more than the number added in all of 2010, Hughes said. The government sector may stabilize during 2012 and the ""private-sector growth is already back,"" he said in an email.

""The only caution is a national economy which shows signs of weakening, which will feed back to NJ,"" Hughes wrote in the email.

Returning to Greenwald’s statement, let’s review:

Greenwald overstated the number of Christie’s vetoes from February and March, and claimed they are why New Jersey ranks 50th in job growth. But a spokesman said Greenwald’s rankings were based on data from between December 2009 and December 2010.

Greenwald’s rankings aren’t far off from more recent calculations that show New Jersey ranks 49th in a year-over-year comparison. Yet when we look at three- and six-month periods, the Garden State is faring a little bit better.

But Greenwald’s biggest mistake here is to blame Christie’s vetoes from February and March for employment changes that occurred several months earlier. That makes the claim not just wrong, but ridiculously wrong. Pants on Fire!

R.I. Rep. DaSilva says 1 in 10 violent deaths in U.S. are caused by strangulation
","
Last month, the House, on a vote of 59-11, passed legislation that would make it a felony to attempt to strangle or choke someone, even if the attack did not result in any injury to the victim.

The bill, H-5087, is now before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The proposal is intended, in part, to make it easier to prosecute anyone who applies pressure on a person's throat or neck with the intent to cause harm. The chief advocate, Rep. Roberto DaSilva, a Pawtucket police officer, said he submitted it because he was seeing too many cases in which serious strangulation attempts would be prosecuted as misdemeanor simple assaults because the attack, although potentially fatal, didn't result in obvious signs of serious bodily injury. 

""If you take a knife, swing it at someone and not strike them, that's a felony,"" he said. ""Under this law, strangulation itself would be a felony. When you have your hands around their throat, you've taken it to the next level. It's serious enough.""

But it was his assertion about the prevalence of the crime that caught our attention.

""Ten percent of violent deaths in the U.S. each year are due to strangulation,"" he said, adding that there are ""six female victims to every male victim.""

We wondered if the rate was really that high.

DaSilva sent us a handful of documents. One was a 2001 article from the Journal of Emergency Medicine, which flatly stated that ""Ten percent of violent deaths each year in the United States are directly because of strangulation.""

Where did that statistic come from? Although the article has 35 footnotes, the ""ten percent"" statement carries no citation.

Two of the three authors, Dr. George E. McClane and Gael B. Strack, a lawyer, have apparently been using this statistic for a while. DaSilva also directed us to a 1999 article in which McClane and Strack are quoted as making the same claim. Strack has repeated the statistic as recently as a 2007 article written to help prosecutors. In each case, there is no indication where the data come from.

We emailed Strack, who is CEO of the Family Justice Center Alliance in San Diego; she told us it came from a paper written by McClane in 1995, which we found intriguing because no McClane research is cited in their 2001 article. Researchers are typically quick to cite their previous work each time they write a paper.

We couldn't get an interview with McClane. The website of the Medical Board of California of the Department of Consumer Affairs said he surrendered his medical license in March after being found guilty of unprofessional conduct. His lawyer did not respond to an email.

So we took another route. DaSilva had also sent us an article from 2007, also in the Journal of Emergency Medicine, saying that national data from 1993 showed that 11.8 percent of women and 1.9 percent of men who died that year were killed by strangulation. It didn't give an overall rate.

So we went to the source: a 2003 article on firearm deaths by David Wiebe of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. It says the strangulation rate that year was 3.4 percent. That's 1 in 29, not 1 in 10.

But that 3.4 percent does not include all violence-related deaths, as DaSilva did. Suicides are excluded. If you include them, as the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control does when it catalogues all ""violence-related injury deaths,"" the rate is even lower -- about 1.4 percent, or 1 in 71.

That same difference is echoed in the most recent federal data, where strangulation accounted for only about 1.2 percent of the violence-related deaths in 2007. If you only look at homicides, the rate rises, but only to 3.5 percent, still far shy of 10 percent.

Only when we focused on women who have been murdered did the 10-percent figure apply. 

Wiebe directed us to the 1998 version of the database, where 448 of the 4,241 female homicide deaths were logged as being due to strangulation. That's 10.6 percent. We calculated a similar number for 2007.

(The actual numbers show that there were not six female strangulation victims for every male, as DaSilva said. Because 448 women and 213 men died of strangulation in 2008, the actual ratio was 2 to 1. To hit a 6-to-1 ratio, you have to compare the percentages of homicide deaths due to strangulation -- 10.6 percent for women and 1.6 percent for men.)

In short, the ""10 percent"" statistic cited by DaSilva has been bandied about at least since the 1990s. As presented, it is false. Federal data from 1993, 1998 and 2007 show that the percentage is significantly lower, whether or not you include suicides.

It may be that the federal statistics are being repeatedly misrepresented, taking numbers that were only meant to apply to female homicides and expanding them to include all violent deaths, regardless of gender.

If DaSilva had said that ""10 percent of all homicide deaths among women are due to strangulation"" and that ""women who are murdered are six times more likely to die of strangulation than men who are murdered,"" he would be on solid ground.

But he didn't.

In his defense, he was quoting sources that should be reliable. The Journal of Emergency Medicine, for one, failed to display adequate rigor by allowing the 10-percent estimate to appear without attribution.

And DaSilva is trying to address what he sees as a serious problem, especially in domestic assaults on women. Deborah DeBare, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said her organization has been concerned for a few years that strangulation assaults are not being aggressively prosecuted, even though they ""are one of the most dangerous ways of attacking someone.""

And because they are often carried out by a coldly calculating assailant, she said, the hope is that the stronger threat of jail time might be a deterrent for some men. 

But we make our rulings based on whether a statement is actually true or false. Motive doesn't enter into it unless we're considering a Pants On Fire.

In this case, we rate DaSilva's claim as Barely True.

Randi Shade says Kathie Tovo believes Austin invests too much in cops, firefighters and paramedics
","
Randi Shade, the Austin City Council member in a June 18 runoff, says in a mailer sent voters after the May general election that her challenger, Kathie Tovo, ""believes that Austin invests too much in the cops, firefighters and paramedics that protect our families and neighborhoods.""

In the mailer, Shade traces her characterization to Tovo’s answer on a questionnaire presented to candidates by the Austin Neighborhoods Council.

Asked if the city's public safety contracts ""put an undue burden on the city budget,"" Tovo replied: ""Yes, Austin’s public safety budget makes up more than 65 percent of the general fund. The continuing growth of (the) public safety budget is limiting the ability of the city to deliver other services that are important to maintaining a high quality of life. Escalating public safety contracts are financially unsustainable and must be addressed for the long-term health of the city.""

We can’t divine what anyone believes. For this fact check, we looked into positions Tovo has taken in her campaign. Specifically, we wondered if her criticism of escalating public-safety contracts as ""unsustainable"" amounts to saying the city spends too much on its police officers, firefighters and the like.

We asked Tovo’s campaign to elaborate and also reviewed news accounts on her position on public safety spending.

On May 19, Austin’s KVUE-TV quoted Tovo saying: ""I am very supportive of public safety, fire, and EMS.""

A May 20 Austin American-Statesman news story quoted Tovo saying she would look for ways to reduce waste in all city departments but would not cut the number of police, firefighters or paramedics. ""If we can save money in other ways, we can have more (public safety employees) on the street,"" she said.

And in an interview by the Austin Chronicle, posted online June 3, Tovo said she favors ""safe and secure neighborhoods, and so a big part of that is making sure we have police and EMS and firefighters out on the streets. I certainly don't support making cuts to those.""

By email, Tovo spokesman Jim Wick said Tovo’s response to the questionnaire was ""intended to address the growing gap in the (city’s) general fund between spending on public safety contracts and spending on everything else. With the way the public safety contracts are structured right now, the spending is unsustainable without either cutting spending or raising taxes,"" Wick said.

Wick noted that City Council Member Bill Spelman was quoted in a Sept. 19, 2010, Austin Chronicle story saying that adjusted for inflation, per-resident public safety spending had increased nearly 50 percent since 2000, while spending from the general fund on every other part of the budget increased 2 percent. Spelman is also quoted saying: ""We've taken all the new money we've gotten from property taxes, sales taxes, and what have you, and put it all into public safety. And none of it into parks, libraries, health and human services, development services, and so on.""

Wick said in an interview that Tovo’s questionnaire answer speaks to ""the future, not the present"" and  ""there is no place anywhere"" that Tovo has said she’d cut public-safety jobs. Tovo says in a more recent campaign mailer: ""I will not cut police, paramedics or firefighters.""

So, Tovo seeks to corral public-safety contracts, but would not cut police, paramedics or firefighter jobs. That’s like having it both ways. Then again, by basing her claim solely on Tovo’s questionnaire, Shade ignores her opponent’s subsequent comments.

"['Public Safety', 'Transportation', 'Virginia', 'Peter Pantuso']","
Bus association head says buses safest mode of commercial transportation
","
A May 31 bus crash north of Richmond that left four dead and more than 50 injured has prompted a re-examination of bus safety.

The bus was traveling from North Carolina to New York City’s Chinatown district when it swerved off I-95, struck an embankment and flipped over in Caroline County. Driver Kin Yiu Cheung faces charges of involuntary manslaughter. Virginia State Police say driver fatigue contributed to the crash.

Peter Pantuso, president and CEO of the American Bus Association, a lobbying group, said the tragedy should not overshadow an excellent safety record by the U.S. bus industry.

Buses travel the country ""with a stellar safety record, a safety record that exceeds that of any other commercial mode or surface transportation mode,"" he said at a June 7 press conference in Richmond.

Pantuso made two claims about safety: 1) That buses are safer than any other commercial  mode, and; 2)  That buses are the safest surface transportation mode. We checked out both.

The Department of Transportation keeps safety statistics, but you have to go to a lot of offices to collect them. Different data -- often hard to compare -- is kept by the various agencies that oversee planes, trains and automobiles.

We started by looking at highway safety. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 33,808 people were killed in automobile accidents during 2009, the latest year statistics are available. Of those people, 26 were bus passengers -- less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the total fatalities.

In 2008, according to the NHTSA, 37,423 people died in U.S. vehicle accidents. That year, 67 of those killed, or about two-tenths of one percent, were bus passengers. Data going back to 2005 show bus passengers accounted for a similar percentage of vehicle deaths in other years.  

Airlines are safer than buses. In 2010, there were no fatalities in commercial U.S. airline travel. During the past decade, there has not been a single year when more than 100 people were killed in airline crashes, with the exception of 2001. That year airline deaths were high because of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Though fatalities are very low among airlines, there are several hundred air-travel deaths each year, primarily when private or chartered planes crash.  

All of these raw statistics, though, don’t give us a good ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the safety of different transportation modes. So we turned to the National Safety Council, which focuses on improving workplace and transportation safety.  

Each year, the NSC produces a book of injury facts. The book’s transportation section determines how many deaths occur per passenger mile. Here’s how the statistic is calculated: If four friends leave Richmond and drive 100 miles to Norfolk, that’s 400 passenger miles. The return trip is another 400 passenger miles. The same principle applies to air or train travel.

The NSC, using Department of Transportation data on fatalities and miles traveled, computes fatality rates for travel by plane, bus, train and automobile, The agency’s 2011 report contains average fatality rates for 2006 through 2008. Each rate is per 100 million passenger miles:

* Scheduled airlines: 0.003

* Commercial buses: 0.05

* Passenger trains: 0.06

* Automobiles, including taxis: 0.61

Similar results emerge if you look at a 10-year average, from 1998 through 2007. Airlines have the lowest fatality rate, at 0.01 deaths per 100 million passenger miles. Buses and trains both have a rate of 0.04 deaths, and automobiles have a rate of 0.75 deaths.

Statistics show that private auto fatalities have declined over the past 15 years, even as the number of drivers and amount of miles traveled has increased. The number of bus deaths has remained roughly constant, though far below the fatality rate for private auto travel.

Let’s review our findings.

Pantuso, the industry lobbyist, said buses have ""a safety record that exceeds that of any other commercial mode or surface transportation mode.""

According to a wealth of transportation data, buses have been the safest mode of surface transportation in recent years, narrowly edging trains when fatalities are measured per 100 million miles. Passengers are far less likely to die in a bus crash than a car crash. So buses have a strong claim as the safest mode of surface transportation.

But when it comes to moving passengers safely, nothing tops commercial air travel. The death rate of airlines is much lower than that of commercial buses.

Pantuso was right about buses being the safest form of surface transportation, but wrong about them being the safest form of all commercial transportation. We’ll split the difference and rate his claim Half True.  ",/factchecks/2011/jun/11/peter-pantuso/bus-association-head-says-buses-safest-mode-commer/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Pundits', 'Paul Krugman']","
Paul Krugman says average unemployed worker has been jobless for nearly 40 weeks
","In a recent column, Paul Krugman of the New York Times tried to put into context how bad the current job market is.

""The latest economic data have dashed any hope of a quick end to America’s job drought, which has already gone on so long that the average unemployed American has been out of work for almost 40 weeks,"" he wrote.

We wondered if he was right. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that is the official source of employment statistics.

BLS publishes statistics for ""average weeks unemployed"" for unemployed workers. For the most recent month available, May 2011, the figure was 39.7 weeks -- just as Krugman had said.

We should note that BLS also publishes a second statistic that measures a similar concept -- ""median weeks unemployed."" The terms ""median"" and ""average"" refer to different ways of determining what is a typical case.

Statisticians arrive at a ""median"" by listing all of the numbers by size and then locating the one at the exact midpoint of the list. Half of all examples on the list will be bigger than the median, and half will be smaller. By contrast, an average is determined by adding up all of the numbers on that list and dividing by the total number of items on the list.

As it turns out, the ""median weeks unemployed"" statistic produces a number that’s quite different. The median unemployed worker was out of work for 22 weeks in May 2011 -- a little more than half of the average length of unemployment. This result likely happened because there were a modest number of people with very, very long unemployment spells, as well as a much larger number who had relatively short periods of unemployment. The small number with very long unemployment spells ended up boosting the average duration without moving the median very much.

But does this difference matter in analyzing the accuracy of Krugman’s statement? Not much.

For starters, Krugman’s underlying point -- that long-term unemployment is a serious problem right now -- remains true regardless of which measure you use. The ""average weeks unemployment"" figure hit a record high in May, while the ""median weeks unemployed"" figure hit its fourth-highest level ever.

In fact, prior to the current recession, the average had only surpassed 20 weeks for several months in the early 1980s. And the median only broke into double digits during two prior recessions. Both of these benchmarks are only half the levels we’re seeing today.

Also, the difference between average and median weeks unemployed has been more or less steady over the years -- pretty close to the same two-to-one ratio we see today. So today’s divergence between the two statistics is nothing unusual by historical standards.

So, Krugman could have used a similar statistic that’s shows a much shorter duration for unemployment. But he was careful in his wording, referring to the ""average unemployed American"" rather than, say, the ""typical unemployed American."" And the two statistics tend to move in tandem, so we don’t think that either one is inherently better for describing the situation. We think he’s on safe ground using the 39.7 weeks figure, so we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/10/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-says-average-unemployed-worker-has-be/

Mike Haridopolos takes on health care bill in newspaper op-ed
","
The federal health care law returned to the news June 8, 2011, when a trio of federal judges heard oral arguments over whether Congress can force people to either buy health insurance or pay penalties.

Which means for us ... more claims about the health care law.

This one comes from Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos, a Republican running for Bill Nelson's seat in the U.S. Senate in 2012. Haridopolos published an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel on June 9 titled ""More need protection under Medicare reform.""

Here are the first 200 words or so:

Liberal politicians and media pundits in Washington have repeatedly sold us a false paradigm that we can either reform government spending, or we can protect the promise we've made to Americans in need, including seniors.

What if I told you we could do both?

Everyone should start from the position that no one will be helped if America falls into bankruptcy.

That's why I worked with Florida legislators during the 2011 session to pass a resolution rejecting Obamacare, countering the dangerous cuts this new government entitlement made to current programs, including Medicare, in order to fund new ones.

It's not a political ploy. It's a question of government making promises and breaking them at a time when millions of Americans are counting on them most.

Here's what I mean: Obamacare funds welfare for able adults on the backs of seniors that have already paid their dues. Obamacare cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding in order to fund the new constitutionally questionable government mandate, even going so far as to scuttle Medicare's most popular (and successful) part, Medicare Advantage.

Strip aside the derisive references to Obamacare and you have an interesting two-part claim. One, that the federal health care law ""cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding."" And two, that it ""scuttle(s) Medicare's most popular (and successful) part, Medicare Advantage."" 
PolitiFact has addressed the $500 billion in Medicare ""cuts"" several times, but since the topic keeps reappearing, we think it's time for a refresher course.

By way of introduction, Medicare serves as the health insurance program for 39 million seniors and another eight million people under 65 receiving Social Security. Medicare makes up 12 percent of the federal budget. Medicare reforms were part of the 2010 health care legislation.

Some reforms increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage, said Tricia Neuman, who is vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation -- a trusted independent source. For instance, the health care law adds $5 billion to help cover prevention services and $43 billion to help fill in a gap for enrollees purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program (sometimes called the doughnut hole). 
Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help pay for coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation, Neuman said. And yet other provisions are designed to improve the delivery and quality of care. (Neuman explains the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website. It's the best non-ideological explanation we've seen.)

The key for us is noting that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending increases over the next 10 years.

Medicare spending will still increase.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. So while the health care law reduces the amount of future spending increases in Medicare, the law doesn't cut Medicare.

Haridopolos' wording is better than similar claims we've seen. Again, he wrote that the health care law ""cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding."" It would have been better, though, had he added the word ""increased"" somewhere, and referred to Medicare spending rather than funding.

The spending reductions to Medicare are intended to offset, to some extent, the overall cost of the new health care law, which applies to everyone. So where does the $500 billion in savings come from? 
Nearly $220 billion comes from reducing annual increases in payments that health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. Other savings include $36 billion from increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion from administrative changes. A new national board will be tasked to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. 
None of those are cuts in the traditional sense.  
Then there's another $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.

A perfect segue to Haridopolos' second claim: The health care bill will ""scuttle"" Medicare Advantage.

There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out-of-pocket costs. Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (they include drug plans), which are run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage programs typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage. Some plans even pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100.

The Medicare Advantage program was intended to bring more efficiency from the private sector to the Medicare program, but it hasn't worked as planned. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said that the Advantage programs cost taxpayers an average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that the Medicare Advantage plan wastes public money that could be put to better use.

The health care law phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs, starting modestly in 2012, to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare. The change is expected to result in fewer extra benefits offered by providers and higher out-of-pocket costs for enrollees, though the exact changes will fluctuate across the country. 
Actuaries with The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services said in October 2010 that the estimated out-of-pocket expenses to Medicare Advantage participants will increase by $873 in 2019, when the law is fully implemented. Remember, though, Medicare Advantage participants often get benefits traditional Medicare enrollees do not. 
The same actuaries also said the number of Medicare Advantage enrollees may be cut in half by 2017 under terms of the law. Those who drop out of Medicare Advantage are still eligible to opt back into traditional Medicare. 
But since that study, the impact of the Medicare Advantage cuts has been softened. 
The health care law included bonuses to high-performing plans -- plans that receive four or five stars on a five-star scale. The idea was to keep the most cost-effective plans in business. 
But in April 2011, the government decided to expand the pool of Medicare Advantage plans eligible for the bonuses, saying that average-quality plans with just three or three-and-a-half stars would also get bonuses. The change infuses an additional $6.7 billion into Medicare Advantage.

According to the Associated Press, four out of five Medicare Advantage enrollees are in plans that are now eligible for a bonus. Without the changes, only one in four would have been in plans getting the extra payments. The bonuses are only temporary, however, and cuts will resume in 2015.

To recap: In a Sentinel op-ed, Haridopolos made two claims about the federal health care law. He said it ""cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding"" and would ""scuttle Medicare's most popular (and successful) part, Medicare Advantage.""

There are elements of truth in each claim. The $500 billion in ""cuts"" are actually cuts to future increased spending, so we give Haridopolos some credit for not simply calling it cuts to Medicare as so many others have done. And Medicare Advantage isn't going away as part of the new health care law. Instead, the law tries to put Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare programs on even-footing with respect to costs to the taxpayer.

Alison Lundergan Grimes charges that Mitch McConnell says ""it's not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky”
","President Barack Obama's recently announced plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants 30 percent by 2030 isn’t going over so well in coal states. Both senate candidates in Kentucky -- the country’s third-largest coal producer -- are speaking out against the plan and the danger it poses to Kentucky jobs. Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes jumped at the opportunity to remind voters of a comment by her opponent, incumbent and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., about bringing jobs to Kentucky. In a 60-second radio ad, Grimes first chastises Obama for the emissions plan, then turns to her competitor. ""Coal supplies 92 percent of our state's electricity,"" the narrator says. ""(Obama's) new regulations will lead to severe rate increases, shortages of power and the loss of even more coal jobs. Kentucky already has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country. It's bad enough we've lost 18,000 jobs since Mitch McConnell became senator. It's even worse that Senator McConnell says it's not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky."" With jobs and unemployment the most important issues for many Americans -- and with Kentucky experiencing 7.7 percent unemployment, which is well above the national average -- we wondered whether McConnell really said this. It turns out that the claim references an interview McConnell gave to The Beattyville Enterprise, a weekly newspaper in Lee County, Ky., with a circulation of about 1,200 and no website, back in April. The six-paragraph-long story ran with the headline, ""McConnell says not his job to bring jobs."" The Grimes campaign pounced on the headline and ran, giving the comment far more attention than the paper’s original circulation. Here’s the full text of the story: U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell said Friday that it is not his responsibility to bring jobs to Kentucky. Appearing in Beattyville, McConnell was asked by The Beattyville Enterprise what he was going to do to bring jobs to Lee County. ""Economic development is a Frankfort issue,"" McConnell said. ""That is not my job. It is the primary responsibility of the state Commerce Cabinet."" Asked about public works projects, McConnell said he is interested in bringing public works to the state. ""Most comes from the state, though,"" he said. He did say that he is responsible for protecting jobs by ""pushing back"" against the Obama Administration's restrictions on the coal industry. ""Oil and gas are big here,"" he said of Lee County. ""They (the Obama Administration) are making it hard on them, too,"" he said. In an interview with PolitiFact, Edmund Shelby -- the reporter, as well as the paper’s editor and general manager -- said the interview was quick, taking place in a hallway before McConnell spoke at a luncheon at the town's community center. McConnell’s point, Shelby said, was that the responsibility for creating Kentucky jobs lies with the state government in Frankfort and the Commerce Cabinet (which is actually now known as the Cabinet for Economic Development). So, while McConnell did say the phrase, ""that is not my job,"" in response to a question about bringing jobs to his home state, he said his comments were taken out of context. At a May press conference, McConnell said he thought Shelby was asking him about specific industries in Lee County that are ""obviously a job of the state Commerce Department."" ""This April, I visited Lee County to talk about a top priority of mine: jobs,"" McConnell said in an April statement. ""Unfortunately, it seems my message got lost in translation, and I was surprised to see a headline about my visit that sent the exact opposite message to the one I was trying to convey."" Shelby didn't electronically record the exchange, and he didn't stay for the luncheon -- where McConnell made remarks about the economy and jobs. However, Shelby stands by his story and said it is impossible that the comments were taken out of context because the interview was only long enough for the questions included in the article. The Grimes campaign has shrugged off McConnell’s ""out of context"" defense and has sought to make hay of what McConnell was reported to have said. ""Clearly McConnell made a major error and used the ‘lost in translation’ excuse to blame a local news editor for accurately reporting on his comments,"" the Grimes campaign said. However, the ""not my job"" statement isn’t the only comment McConnell makes in the piece. His later comment that part of his responsibility is to protect Kentucky's jobs from the threat of over-regulation from the federal government and the Obama administration is an argument he often makes in his campaign. ""In my travels across the Commonwealth, I hear too often how government is blocking job creation,"" he said in the April statement. ""It’s up to all of us -- at the federal, state and local levels -- to fix that. We must ensure that our utility and tax rates remain low and we must enact a right to work law. The better the atmosphere the state sets for job creators, the more effectively Kentucky can compete against other states to add and retain jobs."" Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky, said McConnell can point to a record to support his view. McConnell has a ""long history of doing earmarks and other legislation that helps create and preserve jobs in the state,"" he said. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart pointed to several pieces of job-protecting legislation that McConnell has sponsored or supported, such as the 2013 Freedom to Fish Act, which supported tourism and hospitality jobs in the Barkley Lake region, which he said brings in $3 million in fishing-related tourism to the state each year. In fiscal year 2010, McConnell was one of the top-10 solo earmarkers in the Senate, securing more than $60 million for 38 projects, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington-based advocacy group. Congress banned earmarks soon after the 2010 election. Grimes has used McConnell’s Beattyville Enterprise comments to promote her own jobs plan, in which she devotes significant attention to criticizing McConnell’s record. Shelby said he thinks McConnell was saying what he actually thought. It’s possible that McConnell thought he was talking to a ""small-town, bumbling editor,"" which Shelby is not, he said. ""In my opinion, Sen. McConnell committed the cardinal sin of career politicians by giving an honest answer to a reporter,"" said Shelby, a former president of the Kentucky Press Association. Our ruling Grimes said, ""Sen. McConnell said it’s not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky."" She took this comment from a brief interview McConnell gave to a small-town newspaper in April. We have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the news report, but while the Grimes campaign has a point that McConnell used that particular phrase, they are glossing over some nuances in what he said by selectively quoting the report. McConnell also told the paper that he has a responsibility to protect jobs, and that some of his work in Congress has led to job creation in Kentucky. In addition, McConnell’s legislative record shows a concern for local employment.

"['New Hampshire', 'Guns', 'Jim Rubens']","
Jim Rubens says armed civilians drastically reduce casualties during mass shootings
","As a longtime gun owner, New Hampshire Republican Jim Rubens made his support for Second Amendment rights one of the early themes of his campaign for U.S. Senate. Rubens launched a ""2nd Amendment Protection Tour"" earlier this year, traveling to gun shops around the state to pledge his support for firearms owners. It was a move that invited comparisons between himself and the man he views as his strongest challenger in the GOP primary, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown. Brown has voiced support for increased gun control after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., and has since faced blowback from gun owners in New Hampshire. During a stop at Lee’s Gun Shop in Hudson, Rubens said he would oppose a ban on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines if voters send him to Washington to replace Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Rubens also provided recommendations to address gun violence and mass shootings, such as encouraging schools to hire armed security personnel. The presence of armed civilians would send the message that shooters won’t achieve their aims, he said. ""In mass shooting incidents where you had a person inside the premises during the incident, you have an average of 2.5 people killed if there is someone with a firearm able to stop the crime in progress,"" he said. ""In similar instances where there’s no such person with a firearm, you have an average of 18 people killed and dead as a result of it."" This seemed like a sharp contrast, so we asked Rubens to back up his claim about shooting deaths. His campaign pointed us to an article by Davi Barker, who runs a website called Daily Anarchist. In July 2012, Barker wrote that he studied several mass shootings and determined the average number of people killed in mass shootings when the shooter is stopped by police is 18.25. ""I based it on 10 shootings I found listed on some timeline somewhere,"" he wrote. ""I honestly don’t even remember where."" Barker was challenged when he posted these statistics on Facebook, leading him to conduct a more thorough study, according to his website. After reviewing 100 ""rampage shooting"" incidents, Barker revised his calculations, claiming that the number of people killed when the shooter is stopped by police is really closer to 14.29. He pegged the average for incidents in which civilians stop the shooter at 2.33. The Rubens campaign acknowledged that the figures he provided were incorrect, saying that Rubens now stands behind Barker’s latest figures. ""Bottom line remains: an on-premises armed citizen saves lives in a shooting rampage in a public place,"" communications director Brian Tilton wrote in an email. We looked for a separate analysis of shooting incidents to determine whether those casualty figures are accurate. One of the best sources we found is an academic study published in January in an FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin by Dr. Pete Blair, director of research for the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center (ALERRT) and an associate professor of criminal justice at Texas State University. Blair and two other researchers examined more than 100 shootings between 2000 and 2012, investigating factors such as the average response time of law enforcement and the outcomes based on the actions taken by civilians at the scene. Looking at ""active shooter"" incidents, the study found the median number of people shot is five (excluding the perpetrator). Blair said shooting incidents that lead to deaths in the range of 18 people -- the number Rubens initially offered -- are rare. ""Eighteen would be really out there,"" he said. The study documented only nine incidents in which the number of people killed or wounded was 14 or higher. Blair also pointed out problems with the terminology Rubens used in his statement. The term ""mass shooting"" is widely understood to mean an incident in which four or more people are shot, he said. Therefore, incidents in which only two or three people are shot -- the average Rubens offered when civilians take action -- would generally be excluded from the category of mass shootings. Blair said it’s logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Roughly half of all active shooter events Blair studied ended before law enforcement officers arrived. The most common occurrence was that the shooter stopped the attack spontaneously on their own. The decision was often made after an initial burst of violence, in which the shooter attacked everyone who was in the immediate area, Blair said. When those who remained either ran away or barricaded themselves in secure areas, shooters often made the decision to leave the attack site or commit suicide, he said. Blair said he also documented cases in which civilians took direct action. Civilians stopped about one out of every six active shooter events, but their actions rarely involved the use of firearms, he said. The most common method was tackling the attacker, as was the case during a campus shooting in Seattle this week. Blair said he found only three cases in which an armed civilian shot the attacker, and in two of those incidents, the civilian who took action was an off-duty police officer. Blair said it would be difficult to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of armed civilians in stopping active shooter events based on the limited data that exists. In general though, Blair said, fewer people were killed or injured in the events that ended before police showed up at the scene -- either because civilians took action, or because the shooter spontaneously stopped or committed suicide. Data suggests the best course of action for civilians is first to avoid the attacker, and if that’s not possible, to deny access by barricading themselves in locked rooms or other secure areas. Blair teaches training courses for law enforcement and civilians on how to respond to active shooter events through ALERRT, which receives funding from the Bureau of Justice Administration at the U.S. Department of Justice and from the Texas governor’s office. Blair said he encourages civilians to take physical action to defend themselves only when it’s impossible to escape. ""We see the firearm as being an adjunct to that part,"" he said. Blair said there are pros and cons to having armed civilians at the scene of a shooting. Confronting the shooter with a gun would likely provide the fastest resolution, he said. But if multiple civilians are wielding guns at the scene, it could also create confusion about who the shooter is -- particularly for police who are arriving to render aid. Our ruling Rubens said when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2.5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die. One of the most comprehensive studies of recent active shooter events suggests the average of 18 deaths when police stop the shooter is far too high. The study of more than 100 incidents determined the median number of people killed or wounded in all active shooter situations was five. The study documented only nine incidents out of dozens in which the number of people shot was 14 or higher. Conclusions about the number of deaths when an armed civilian takes action are also problematic because very limited data exists. The author of the study agrees it’s logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Finally, both Rubens and the internet blogger who first offered the statistics that Rubens cited have acknowledged the figures were incorrect. Rubens has since revised his estimate to be in the range of 2.33 and 14. Overall, this statement is not accurate. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/06/jim-rubens/jim-rubens-says-when-armed-civilians-stop-mass-sho/

Few Hispanic residents elected to Austin City Council through history
","Austin City Council member Mike Martinez, who declared his candidacy for mayor in April 2014, says he could be part of historic changes in the November 2014 elections. We didn’t catch Martinez’s precise remarks at the May 28, 2014, HABLA Platica gathering in East Austin. Asked later to repeat himself, Martinez said in a voice-mail message: ""I think we’ve had four Latinos in the designated ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ seat"" on the council,"" plus, he said, another council member who says he was Latino, the late Robert Barnstone. ""That would be five total,"" Martinez said, adding he speculated at the event that up to five Hispanic residents could be elevated to the council all at once in the November elections. For the first time, voters are poised to fill 10 council seats from within geographic districts with the mayor’s job filled, as before, by citywide balloting. And has Austin, which was incorporated in 1839, only had a few Hispanic council members? News organizations including the Austin American-Statesman have noted the ""gentlemen’s agreement"" mentioned by Martinez as explaining why the seven-member council, elected citywide, has rarely had more than a black and an Hispanic member. Under the so-called agreement, certain seats on the council were seen among many as reserved for members of those minority groups to seek. The results: A ""Milestones"" web page created by the city says John Treviño was the first Hispanic citizen elected to the council; he won Place 5 on May 3, 1975. Voters had made Beryl Handcox the council’s first African American in May 1971, according to the page. An Aug. 20, 2010, Statesman news feature story on local Mexican American pioneers called Treviño the first Hispanic on the council and further said Gus Garcia, a former Austin school board trustee, later won election to the council before winning election in 2000 as mayor. Garcia, who like Treviño initially won Place 5 on the council, said Treviño and Richard Moya, the first Mexican American elected to the Travis County Commissioners Court, were ""young Turks"" who sought to break free from a long-standing system in which a handful of Hispanic leaders and businessmen had access to Anglo leaders, the story said. ""We wanted to make it more democratic,"" Garcia said then. ""None of us thought about doing this so we could be recognized. We did it because there was a need in the (Mexican American) community."" To our request for detail, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean guided us to the Austin History Center where researcher Jeff Carrillo pointed out city election results through history, posted online. This enabled us to build a chart indicating four Spanish-surnamed winners of council seats. In 2000, environmental activist Raul Alvarez won election to Place 2 on the council, to which Garcia didn’t seek re-election, our chart indicates. Alvarez was re-elected in 2003 but didn’t seek another term in 2006, when Martinez initially won the seat. This leaves Barnstone, who succeeded Treviño in Place 5 in 1988. Garcia, asked for his recollections, told us by email that in Austin’s Mexican-American community, Barnstone wasn’t considered ""one of us.""

Democratic group says Ileana Ros-Lehtinen voted against VA backlog fixes
","As President Barack Obama faced attacks over long waits for appointments at Veterans Administration health centers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the House Democrats’ campaign arm -- engaged in some finger-pointing. The DCCC sent out press releases claiming that Republican House members Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Miami, Sean Duffy of Wisconsin and Erik Paulsen of Minnesota voted against fixing the VA backlog. Here is part of the June 2, 2014, press release about Ros-Lehtinen headlined ""Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes."" ""As House Republicans shamelessly try to score political points over the crisis in veterans care, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen’s votes tell the true story of her record: when she had a chance to fix this problem, she voted against the fixes."" The release went on to quote DCCC spokesman Josh Schwerin saying, ""It’s a shame that when Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen had a chance to do something to help shorten the wait time at the VA she voted no. Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen voted against a commonsense solution to this problem and our heroes deserve better."" We put those votes under a microscope to see whether Ros-Lehtinen has a ""long record of voting against VA backlog fixes."" VA backlog We should start by distinguishing between two related, but separate, issues relating to veterans. One concerns longstanding problems with handling benefits claims from veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die as a result of their service. The other concerns long waits for service at VA hospitals. On the first issue -- benefits -- the backlog refers to requests that go unaddressed by the government for at least 125 days. PolitiFact found that the backlog nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in the summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012. In April 2014, the Obama administration released numbers suggesting the backlog was shrinking, but veterans groups said they had serious doubts about the numbers. The second issue -- the wait for health care -- stemmed from news reports that revealed secret waiting lists at VA hospitals, and that some veterans died while awaiting care. This is what ultimately led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki on May 30. The DCCC essentially conflates the two issues in the quest to highlight any vote that portrays Ros-Lehtinen as voting against veterans’ interests. We’ll also offer a general word of warning about how political groups tend to cherry-pick the records of their opponent. It’s possible to dig up a vote made by virtually any member of Congress of either party and claim that the politician is for -- or against -- anything, including veterans benefits. So, just as the Democrats were able to find some votes in which Ros-Lehtinen voted against a service for veterans, spokespersons for Ros-Lehtinen and the National Congressional Campaign Committee were able to point to separate votes in which she voted for veterans’ services. Many of the votes that the DCCC cited were procedural moves or one particular vote out of a series of votes. In most of the instances, the votes broke down overwhelmingly on party lines, with Ros-Lehtinen joining her Republican colleagues. That said, let’s start with the votes that are directly about the backlog: The votes • Veterans Backlog Reduction Act: A bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. William Enyart, D-Ill., ordered the VA to provisionally pay any disability claim if the VA didn’t respond within 125 days. Enyart introduced the bill in April 2013 and it was referred to the House committee on Veterans Affairs. It never received a vote. The DCCC said Ros-Lehtinen voted against considering that bill by pointing to a vote on the ""previous question"" -- a parliamentary move to force a vote. During a debate about a higher education bill, Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. stated ""if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that will allow the House to vote on the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act."" Enyart then explained his veterans’ bill and urged a ""no"" vote. His fellow Democrats complied and all voted ""no"" while the Republicans voted ""yes,"" which defeated his effort. Something the DCCC omitted is that in October 2013, Ros-Lehtinen had voted to establish a commission or task force to evaluate the backlog of disability claims of the Department of Veterans Affairs. That measure passed, 404-1. • Increasing funds to reduce the backlog in disability claims: The DCCC said Ros-Lehtinen voted no, along with nearly every Republican, on a motion that would have added $9.2 million to hire an additional 94 VA claims processors tasked with reducing the disability claims backlog. The June 2013 motion was a ""motion to recommit"" on an appropriations bill to fund military construction and veterans affairs. A ""motion to recommit"" in the House refers to a last-ditch attempt by the minority party to amend a bill before it passes. Left unsaid: The overall bill, which did pass, provided money to address the backlog, just not as much as Democrats proposed. • Mental health funds: On June 2, 2011, Congress agreed in a voice vote to set aside $20 million for suicide prevention for veterans. On June 14, 2011, Ros-Lehtinen voted against a Democratic motion to recommit that would add $20 million for veterans’ suicide prevention. The GOP argued that such services were already funded, and the motion failed. Ros-Lehtinen, along with nearly every member of Congress, voted for the overall bill, which increased money for the military. The bill included an additional $20 million for suicide prevention outreach, according to Congressional Quarterly. • Medical and prosthetic research: In May 2012, Ros-Lehtinen joined all but three Republicans in voting against a motion to recommit that would have increased funding for veterans’ medical and prosthetic research by $28.3 million. Here too, Ros-Lehtinen joined the overwhelming majority in passing the overall bill. The bill provided a $1.7 million increase for medical, rehabilitative, health services and prosthetic research -- an amount equal to the Obama administration’s request, according to CQ. The DCCC also cited votes Ros-Lehtinen took leading up to the October 2013 federal shutdown. In August, she voted for a House Republican ""continuing resolution"" -- a stopgap funding bill -- that the Associated Press reported would ""likely result"" in the shutdown of the federal government. The bill passed 230-189. The shutdown led to a delay in death benefits for veterans among other delayed services, the Washington Post reported. DCCC also cited a pair of votes Ros-Lehtinen took in September, including one on a motion to commit to H.J. Res. 59, to make continuing appropriations that would have ensured veterans benefits wouldn’t be delayed during a shutdown. All but one Republican voted ""no."" However, left out of the DCCC’s account is that Ros-Lehtinen voted for in favor of H.J. Res. 72, the ""Veterans Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution"" -- a mini-funding resolution favored by House Republicans to reopen slices of the government. The measure passed the House with unanimous Republican support and overwhelming Democratic opposition. (Showing how both sides play this game, the RNC plucked out that vote to attack DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a claim we rated False.) Democrats also cited multiple other votes including a few that related to housing for veterans but Republicans could point to other votes on bills that did provide housing assistance. Veterans’ groups’ report cards Meanwhile, we found two veterans’ organizations that issue voting ""report cards"" for members of Congress: • American Veterans (Amvets) gave Ros-Lehtinen an A in 2013, based on eight pieces of legislation. (Ros-Lehtinen didn’t participate in a vote for one.) • Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) Action Fund gave Ros-Lehtinen a C in 2010. The report card looked at 14 votes, plus whether lawmakers cosponsored certain bills. The group gave her an A in 2008. (Overall, the group gave Congress lower marks in 2010 than 2008.) Contacted by PoilitiFact, DCCC spokeswoman Emily Bittner said, ""These Republicans’ votes speak for themselves. Taken in their totality, they show an unfortunate pattern of refusing to cross party lines and vote for commonsense fixes to the problems at the VA."" However, we don't think the votes chosen show the ""totality"" of Ros-Lehtinen's record. Our ruling The DCCC said ""Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes."" The DCCC points to some votes that went against funding certain veterans’ services or addressing the backlog. However, the DCCC ignores that Ros-Lehtinen took other votes in favor of increasing funding for veterans’ services -- just not as much as Democratic proposals would have offered. The bigger issue is that most of these votes came within elaborate games of tit-for-tat, in which each side offers proposals that they expect will fail, just to get lawmakers on the other side to take votes that look superficially bad. The reality of Ros-Lehtinen’s voting record is much more nuanced than the DCCC’s cherry-picked account would suggest. This, combined with the ""A"" ratings she's earned from veterans' advocacy groups, undercut the DCCC's claim that she has a ""long"" voting record of voting against the interests of veterans. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/06/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/ileana-ros-lehtinen-voted-against-va-backlog-fixes/

Not all veteran suicides can be tied to VA care
","The controversy over lengthy delays at several of the nation’s Veterans Affairs medical facilities, including the Atlanta VA Medical Center in DeKalb County, has drawn significant criticism that those waits may have contributed to veterans’ deaths. One such voice is U.S. Rep. David Scott, a Democrat who represents portions of metro Atlanta. Scott was among lawmakers from both parties calling for Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki’s removal before the secretary resigned last Friday. In an interview with WABE just before that resignation, Scott tried to draw attention to the specific concern of mental health treatment in the scandal, which is compounded by allegations of efforts to cover up the delays. ""We’ve got an average of 5,600 soldiers committing suicide,"" Scott said. ""That’s about 20 a day."" Back-of-a-napkin math shows an immediate miscalculation. That annual rate of suicides would mean 15 daily suicides. But even with the math blunder, those daily rates seemed striking enough for PolitiFact to want to get to the bottom of the matter. A spokesman for the congressman said he was first drawn to the issue of mental health services for veterans after reading an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation last year. In his WABE interview, Scott blamed Shinseki in particular and the VA in general, saying, ""Nobody has been held accountable for all of those suicides."" The AJC probe of the VA facility in DeKalb found that more than 500 veterans were on a waiting list to receive mental health care in 2010. Sixteen attempted suicide. The Atlanta VA tried to solve the problem by referring more veterans to outside treatment. But by 2012, that decision created long waiting lists at those outside clinics, according to the AJC investigation. Last year, federal audits tied the deaths of three veterans in Atlanta to poor oversight by hospital staff, including some who had been referred to outside facilities. It was later revealed that a fourth veteran committed suicide in a VA hospital bathroom, prompting the replacement of both the head of the hospital and the mental health director. ""His big concern is for veterans who need help and can’t get it,"" said Scott’s chief of staff, Michael Andel. ""It’s about the delay, especially in getting care in mental health needs."" Andel referred us to an advocacy and support group, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, or IAVA, and a 2013 newspaper story about a VA study on suicide data. Both cite the daily estimate of 22 suicides by veterans. A closer look at the VA study, however, slightly complicates the issue. Based on the most extensive data ever collected by the VA on suicide, the report does calculate that 22 veterans die each day from suicide. But the estimate applies to all veterans, not soldiers who are on active or reserve services as Scott describes. The estimate relies on state data that identify the dead as veterans. It therefore includes those with or without any history of accessing VA care. A spokeswoman for the VA in Washington confirmed that the report also cites recent increases in the rates of suicide in the general population among middle-age adults between 35 and 64 years of age. The report found the majority of veteran suicides, about 70 percent, were by those age 50 and older. The report found that veterans make up a smaller percentage of the country’s suicides than a previous study in 2007. That suggests that an effort to improve suicide prevention programs at the VA had an effect, the report concludes, while also recommending additional improvements. ""VA must continue to provide a high level of care, and recognize that there is still much more work to do,"" according to the study’s executive summary. ""As long as Veterans die by suicide, we must continue to improve and provide even better services and care."" Andel said Scott’s statement was a part of the congressman’s effort to use the study’s findings to push for change. Scott supports a proposal from U.S. Rep. Larry Bucshon, a Republican from Indiana, to offer employment incentives to psychiatrists who agree to work for the VA to help with the shortage of services. The IAVA has lobbied for a separate bill, the Senate’s Suicide Prevention for America's Veterans Act. Among other things, it calls for recruiting more health care workers to the VA and Department of Defense and reviewing those agencies’ suicide prevention programs. ""We feel the system fails veterans, and that takes us to a point where unfortunately veterans are considering and committing suicide,"" said Nick McCormick, a legislative associate with the IAVA. ""We want to get that information out so there can be change."" To sum it up, though Scott is a little off on his math, he’s close enough on the daily rates for us. He has a point to drive home, that a lot of veterans are dying by their own hands. The problem is when he attempts to link the daily suicide rates of all military veterans, who may never have visited a VA center, with the current scandal. The study offers no evidence to back up the implication that blame lies with the VA on those deaths. With that context, we rate Scott’s statements as Half True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/06/david-scott/not-all-veteran-suicides-can-be-tied-va-care/

Maddow: Pentagon made up story of Jessica Lynch's heroism
","As controversy swells surrounding the decision to swap five dangerous Taliban commanders for POW Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, liberal MSNBC host Rachel Maddow is trying to defend the prisoner exchange by comparing it to the rescue of Iraq POW Jessica Lynch. On her June 3, 2014, show, Maddow explained Lynch’s story -- how her convoy had taken wrong turns in Nasiriyah, Iraq, in 2003 and was ambushed. And Maddow cited dramatic details in a Washington Post report that Lynch ""fought fiercely and shot several enemy soldiers after Iraqi forces ambushed the Army's 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company, firing her weapon until she ran out of ammunition."" But Lynch has since said that description is incorrect, saying her gun jammed in the chaos. Maddow highlighted the navigational mistakes of U.S. troops and the inaccurate story of Lynch’s heroics to draw a comparison to Bergdahl. ""If the heroics that the Pentagon made up about her (Lynch) didn't really happen, and they didn’t, maybe the U.S. special forces who rescued her and the other Americans … maybe they shouldn’t have bothered,"" Maddow said, sarcastically. ""After all, maybe it was sort of their own screw up that got them ambushed and hurt and captured in the first place. Is that how we think about these things now?"" Some people who saw Maddow’s reporting questioned her assertion that ""the Pentagon made up"" Lynch’s heroism. The Pentagon is the building that houses the U.S. Defense Department and a quasi-official way to reference the Defense Department. Saying the Pentagon ""made up"" something is the equivalent of accusing George W. Bush's Defense Department.  We decided to dig into Maddow's claim further. (We reached out to Maddow through an MSNBC spokeswoman but did not hear back by our deadline.) Genesis of the inaccurate stories There is no question that much of the original Washington Post report, dated April 3, 2003, (Lynch was captured March 23 and rescued April 1) is inaccurate. There were two main inaccuracies in the original Post report: The story said Lynch suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was stabbed. But doctors found no evidence of either. Lynch ""was fighting to the death,"" a U.S. official told the Post, and she killed several Iraqis. But Lynch’s weaponed was jammed, and she killed no Iraqis. The Post reporting became the genesis ""of a spate of stories that accepted the Post sequence of events,"" journalist Dante Chinni, who researched the issue, wrote for the Pew Research Journalism Project. ""Many articles focused on the Rambo-like firefight Lynch reportedly engaged in — some even cited her valiant fighting as proof that women belonged in combat zones."" Within a few weeks, however, the story had all but fallen apart. Chinni provides a good timeline: April 15, 2003: The Washington Post runs a piece questioning its earlier account. A physician from the Iraqi hospital that treated Lynch said, ""There were no bullets or shrapnel or anything like that."" April 18: An Associated Press story backs off earlier accounts. The AP quotes a military official who says the Lynch gunfight ""has not been confirmed."" May 15: A BBC News piece calls the Lynch story ""one of the most stunning pieces of news management ever conceived."" May 26: The Chicago Tribune continues to debunk the story of Lynch’s heroics. ""The story of Jessica Lynch is the tale of how a modern war icon is made, and perhaps how easily officials and journalists with different agendas accepted contradictory, self-serving versions of what happened to her,"" the Tribune wrote. Source of the bad information The Post relied on anonymous sources only described as ""U.S. officials"" in its initial report. Maddow claimed the ""Pentagon"" made the story up. Actually, the story itself said the Pentagon couldn’t confirm the story. The original Post report, written by Susan Schmidt and Vernon Loeb, said that Pentagon officials ""had heard ‘rumors’ of Lynch's heroics but had had no confirmation."" Loeb provided many more details about the source of his reporting during a Dec. 15, 2003, NPR interview. (The Lynch talk starts about 30 minutes in.) Loeb described his sources as ""some really good intelligence sources here in Washington."" He said that after the information was proven to be false, the Post went back to reconstruct what happened. They found that the intelligence was coming from the battlefield and that U.S. officials had picked up on Iraqi ""intercepts talking about a blind American firing back."" Intelligence officials, who could include a number of people working at a host of different agencies, interpreted that blind American to be Lynch. Loeb was asked if he thought he was given the reports as part of an effort to mythologize Lynch. ""No not at all,"" said Loeb, who is now managing editor of the Houston Chronicle. ""I’ve been asked this over and over again. Our sources for that story were not Pentagon sources. In fact, I could not get anybody from the Pentagon to talk about those reports at all. I got indications that they had in fact received those intelligence reports, but the Pentagon was completely unwilling to comment on those reports at all. They wouldn’t say anything about Jessica Lynch. ""I’ve never believed that, as least as the story we wrote goes, that it was a Pentagon attempt to create a hero there,"" Loeb said. (The Pentagon also was accused of romanticizing Lynch’s rescue for PR purposes, a separate charge Loeb also says he does not believe.) CNN's former senior Pentagon reporter, Jamie McIntyre, largely corroborated Loeb's account in a 2007 interview with Howard Kurtz. ""Nobody in the Army could figure out where the information was coming from,"" McIntyre said. ""There were no official statements that ever portrayed Jessica Lynch as going down fighting, and it appeared that the Post story was based on a single source who in retrospect may have confused the actions of other soldiers with Jessica Lynch.  ""Even in that original story it said that the Pentagon ... had heard rumors of this but couldn't confirm it.""  Our ruling Maddow said, ""the Pentagon made up"" the heroics of POW Jessica Lynch as she tried to avoid capture in Iraq. Maddow was making the point that the United States should have rescued Lynch whether or not she was a hero, just like it was right to bring Bergdahl home. That may be a popular opinion, but Maddow missed on the details of Lynch’s now-debunked story. First, the original report Maddow pointed to -- an article in the Washington Post -- specifically said that the Pentagon couldn’t confirm the story. And later, the author of the Post report made clear that his source was not the Pentagon. Loeb, the author, went further to say he does not believe he was fed false information ""to create a hero."" The reality is we don’t know who provided the information to Loeb; he and his colleague Schmidt won’t say. Maddow fails to have the evidence to back up her claim. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/05/rachel-maddow/maddow-pentagon-made-story-jessica-lynchs-heroism/

Is Burger King quitting its military-base outlets because of Barack Obama's policies?
","A reader recently forwarded us an email that bore some bad news for military families. ""The Burger King national headquarters,"" the email said, ""announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases."" The email continued, ""Soon to follow will be Popeye's chicken, pizza franchises and the chain of barber and beauty shops which operates inside the gates of our military facilities. Reason? Obama's mandate that all companies who do business with the federal Government pay a $10.10 per hour minimum wage. … Alas, as with all things Obama, every time he does something to please his socialist friends, someone suffers. In this case it will be our military."" (See the full text of the email here.) When we looked into it, we found that the email -- despite some over-the-top anti-Obama rhetoric -- was referencing a real issue. However, its most eye-catching claim -- that Burger King had announced it will be pulling its outlets from military bases -- was flat wrong. Let’s start with some background. Various fast-food restaurants operate at military bases in the United States and all over the world. The concerns raised in the email, which had been publicized by Republican lawmakers this spring, stem from two actions taken by the Obama administration that could affect how fast-food workers are compensated on some military bases. The first change is a 2013 determination by the Labor Department -- subsequently put on hold -- that fast food workers under federal contracts were due a $3.81-an-hour bump in compensation, something they had not qualified for previously. The second is a February 2014 executive order by Obama that mandated a $10.10 minimum wage for workers on federal contracts. Obama issued the order -- which doesn’t require congressional approval -- as a partial step after seeing his proposal for a $10.10 national minimum wage blocked in Congress. For technical reasons, fast-food workers on Army and Air Force bases are not affected. (Most Army and Air Force concessions are directly operated by the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, so fast-food workers on those bases are not under a federal contract.) However, outlets on Navy and Marine bases do operate by contract, and employers stand to be hit with significant pay increases for their lowest-paid workers (or put another way, workers stand to get a raise). The prospect that fast-food outlets could look at rising employee costs and choose to shutter their stores moved Russell Beland, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for military manpower and personnel, to officially request a waiver of the compensation bump from the Labor Department. In addition, 40 Republican lawmakers, led by House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel Chairman Joe Wilson of South Carolina, wrote a letter in April warning Labor Secretary Tom Perez of the potential fallout. The lawmakers wrote, ""Should these policy changes be fully implemented, we are concerned they will eliminate jobs, negatively impact recreational services on military bases, and limit the dining options for servicemen and women on military installations. … In addition, we understand that restaurants facing these additional labor costs have already determined that it would be cost prohibitive to offer military personnel these dining options and some may consider not renewing contracts and operations shutting down."" A big part of the problem is that fast-food companies face a Catch-22. On the one hand, they would be forced to raise wages above what surrounding fast-food outlets pay. On the other hand, by law, they could not raise their prices above what those same surrounding fast-food outlets charge. So, unable to pass along the higher labor costs to customers, fast-food outlets would find their profits squeezed. The department appears to be listening. According to Military Times, a trade publication that covers the armed services, the Labor Department is ""re-evaluating"" wage determinations for fast-food workers and expects to ""reissue industry-specific fast food wage determinations in the near future."" (That would ease but not eliminate the problem -- it doesn’t appear that Obama’s $10.10 wage would be lifted under such an action.) How bad could the fallout be? Beland wrote that, without relief on the compensation increases, ""up to 390 fast food concession operations would close on installations across the U.S. and its territories, with a loss of nearly 5,750 jobs, many held by military family members and veterans."" This is a worst-case scenario. So far, the impact appears to be far more limited. Military Times reported that, according to the Pentagon, McDonald’s locations closed on three Navy bases in March, and Marine Corps officials said that another on a Marine base was slated to close. Another eatery, ""I Love Country,"" closed at Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. That said, it’s not clear whether even these more limited closures were the direct result of the compensation increases (which hadn’t yet taken effect), or, for that matter, whether this rate of turnover is significantly higher than ordinary rates of closure on bases. ""The specter of mass layoffs being raised is an illusion,"" George Faraday, policy director for Change to Win, a workers’ rights group, told the Fiscal Times. ""If they care about the welfare of military spouses they should care about whether military spouses are making a living wage."" Indeed, a 2013 survey by the National Employment Law Center, which supports higher wages, found that of 567 federal contract workers, 74 percent earned less than $10 an hour, and of these, nearly a quarter said they depended on Medicaid and one in seven said they used food stamps. So here’s what we have so far: Changes by the Obama administration could raise labor costs for fast-food restaurants on Navy and Marine bases (though not Army and Air Force bases). This could prompt some restaurants to leave, but there’s no sign of a mass exodus yet, and the Labor Department has pressed the pause button on a key part of the compensation increase. So what about the claim about Burger King picking up stakes? This part of the chain email is simply wrong. ""No Burger King restaurants on military bases are being closed as part of a planned process or program,"" the company said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""In the course of normal business, however, we and our franchisees continuously review the worldwide restaurant portfolio and make strategic decisions based on many factors including development opportunities, market conditions, restaurant profitability, lease length, overall brand presence and, in the case of military bases, troop movements."" Our ruling The email said that due to actions by Obama, ""the Burger King national headquarters announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases."" There is a legitimate question about whether compensation changes made by the administration could squeeze the profits of fast-food restaurants on Navy and Marine bases to the point where they feel the need to shutter their outlets. But the impact of such changes is speculative, and as far as the specific claim about Burger King is concerned, it’s pure fiction that the company announced a sweeping departure from military bases. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/05/chain-email/burger-king-quitting-its-military-base-outlets-bec/

Texas law permits long rifles to be toted in public
","Meanwhile in Texas, there’s been talk of gun-rights delegates to the state convention of the Republican Party of Texas strolling around its Fort Worth gathering place with long rifles in hand. Not so fast, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said in a news story posted online May 31, 2014. The story quoted city officials as saying those weapons could legally be toted outside the Fort Worth Convention Center but inside, ""it’s a different matter because there’s a Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission license. ""State officials have been reminding Texans that any business with a state permit to serve alcohol may not knowingly let people carry long guns,"" the paper said. Broadly a few days later, Mike Hashimoto, an editorial columnist for the Dallas Morning News, took exception to Texans strolling around with rifles in a commentary, describing them as ""chuckleheads strapping on their long rifles and marching into the local Chipotle or Chili’s or Home Depot. Whatever point they may have about gun-owner rights or Texas law they drown in look-at-me stupidity."" Hashimoto kicked us into action with this factual claim: ""Public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in Texas."" Really? Up front, we recognized numerous news accounts have said the same, including a June 2, 2014, Austin American-Statesman story stating: ""Texas law allows owners to openly carry rifles but not sidearms in most situations."" Similarly, the National Rifle Association brought up what the law permits in a May 30, 2014, blog post questioning the ""unneighborly"" actions of individuals trying to make Second Amendment points by hauling rifles into coffee shops and restaurants. ""Texas, independent-minded and liberty-loving place that it is, doesn't ban the carrying of loaded long guns in public, nor does it require a permit for this activity,"" the association said. Seeking statutory detail, we reached the legislative director of the Texas State Rifle Association, Alice Gene Tripp, who told us the Texas penal code restricts handguns, but it’s silent per toting long rifles and shotguns. Tripp pointed us to Section 46.02 of the code. By email, Hashimoto also singled out that section, saying it put limits on handguns, illegal knives and clubs, among specific weapons, not mentioning long rifles or shotguns. ""From discussing this over the years with law enforcement officials, my understanding is that rifles and shotguns, therefore, were legal for open carry in Texas,"" Hashimoto said. ""I've not questioned that understanding recently, as open-carry demonstrations have become more common, yet demonstrators, generally, have not been arrested for unlawfully carrying weapons."" Section 46.02 states it’s at least a Class A misdemeanor if a person ""intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly carries on or about his or her person a handgun, illegal knife, or club if the person is not on the person’s own premises or premises under the person’s control or in or directly en route to a motor vehicle""(including a recreational vehicle ""or boat they own or control."" Finally, we contacted Jerry Patterson, the state land commissioner who as a state senator authored the 1995 law enabling Texans to carry concealed handguns with state permits. By email, Patterson said: ""Long gun ‘open carry’ has never been unlawful in Texas to my knowledge. How do you use a shotgun or rifle if you can't carry it openly?‎ Would you have to wrap it up if you placed it in your pickup gun rack?"" Still, he pointed out  out section 42.01 (a) (8) of the penal code, which states a person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly ""displays a firearm or other deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm."" Our ruling Hashimoto wrote: ""Public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in Texas."" Texas law explicitly restricts handguns and some other weapons from being openly carried around.

The post appears to track back to a satirical group called ""Christians for Michele Bachmann."" Bachmann did extol Franklin in a high-profile address, but she did not refer to him as a president. She referenced Franklin twice in a speech announcing that she was abandoning her 2012 presidential bid. Bachmann alluded to a painting by Howard Chandler Christy of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, which hangs in a stairway in the Capitol’s House wing. She remembers seeing the painting, with its reminder of the ""connection we have to the principles of freedom and justice,"" on the night she decided to seek the Oval Office.

Paul Ryan says Medicare going broke
","Generally speaking, 7.65 percent of your paycheck is withheld for FICA -- 6.2 percent for Social Security and 1.45 percent for Medicare. If your annual pay is $46,000, the average for full-time-working Americans, the Medicare portion of those Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes approaches $700 per year. It’s not enough, according to U.S. House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan. Not that the Wisconsin Republican is angling for a tax increase. Ryan’s point, made at a WisPolitics.com event on May 5, 2014, is that Medicare must be reformed because it is ""going broke. The trust fund goes bankrupt in 2026."" We've long heard that the nation’s largest health insurance program faces future trouble as health care expenditures continue to rise and the Baby Boom generation continues to gray. Indeed, retirees can expect to receive $3 in Medicare benefits for every $1 they paid in Medicare taxes. But is the program really headed for the rocks? Medicare primer Medicare, which pays for medical care for senior citizens, as well as for younger people with certain disabilities, covers 51 million people. At a cost approaching $500 billion per year, it accounts for about 14 percent of all federal outlays -- third behind defense spending and Social Security. Medicare has two main components: Part A -- Hospital Insurance. Helps pay for hospital, home health following hospital stays, skilled nursing facilities and hospice care. Most people pay no premiums. The primary source of financing for Part A is the FICA payroll withholding. In other words, it’s pay-as-you-go: the contributions of current workers (and their employers) finance the care for current beneficiaries. If revenue exceeds expenditures in a given year, the extra money goes into the Part A trust fund. And when expenditures are higher, the trust fund gets tapped. Part B -- Supplementary Medical Insurance. Helps pay for physician, outpatient hospital, home health and other services. Medicare recipients can opt for these benefits and they pay premiums. Most of the costs for Part B are covered by the government’s general fund and, to a lesser extent, premiums paid by beneficiaries. Part B also has a trust fund. But it’s different from Part A in that whenever expenditures exceed revenue, the difference is automatically covered by transfers from the general fund. So, as structured, it can’t go broke, though it could draw an increasing amount from the general fund. There is also a Part C -- Medicare Advantage, which is a private-insurance alternative to Part A and has no trust fund. And there is Part D, a prescription drug benefit included in Part B. Regarding Ryan’s claim, we’re concerned only with Parts A and Part B. Ryan’s evidence Ryan advocates reforming Medicare into a ""premium support"" program in which retirees, starting in 2024, would get money to pay toward the cost of traditional Medicare or competing private plans. To back his claim about Medicare’s financial condition, Ryan cited four excerpts from the latest annual report of the Medicare trustees, published in May 2013. The excerpts address the trust fund for Part A, which is a common way -- albeit an incomplete one -- of measuring Medicare’s overall financial health. One excerpt says: ""Payment of expenditures in full and on time will continue to require redemption of trust fund assets most years until the (Part A) trust fund’s depletion in 2026."" In other words, it's projected that in 2026, not only will expenditures exceed revenues for Part A (hospital care), but the trust fund available to cover the difference -- $220 billion, according to the report -- will be zero. So, what to make of Ryan's characterization of Medicare going broke or bankrupt? More to consider The trustees’ report concludes that ""Congress and the executive branch must work closely together with a sense of urgency to address the depletion"" of the Part A trust fund and the projected growth in expenditures throughout the Medicare program. But PolitiFact, FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker have all rated claims similar Ryan’s (including some previously made by Ryan) and have all concluded that saying Medicare is going bankrupt goes too far. PolitiFact Ohio, for example, rated as False a 2012 claim by singer Pat Boone, a spokesman for the conservative 60 Plus Association, that Medicare would be bankrupt in nine years. Some key points: Since 1970, five years after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare into law, there have repeatedly been projections of the Part A trust fund running out of money. Over the years, Congress repeatedly changed legislation to lower spending to keep the fund from going dry. Even if the Part A (hospitals) trust fund ran out, the report Ryan cites projects that revenue would still be enough to pay 87 percent of the Part A expenses. Not a good situation, perhaps, but also not Medicare being bankrupt or shutting down. The projected depletion of the Part A trust fund in 2026 is nine years later than what the Medicare trustees projected in 2009, the year before the adoption of the Affordable Care Act, according to Medicare expert Paul Van de Water of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare under President George H.W. Bush, agreed that Part B is not projected to run out of money and that Part A would continue operating, though providing fewer benefits, even if it’s trust fund becomes depleted. But she said that Ryan’s claim underscores the overall point that Medicare’s current structure is not financially viable. Our rating Ryan said: Medicare is ""going broke. The trust fund goes bankrupt in 2026."" The trust fund for Medicare Part A (primarily hospitals) is projected to be exhausted in 2026, but that doesn’t mean the program would be bankrupt or stop operating. Part A would continue to receive revenue and continue to operate, albeit at a reduced level, if Congress doesn’t make any changes in Medicare -- even though, since 1970, Congress has always made changes to keep the trust fund solvent. Meanwhile, there is no projection that the other parts of Medicare will run out of money. For a statement that contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Ryan a Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/05/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-medicare-going-bankrupt/
"['Oregon', 'Drugs', 'Marijuana', 'Earl Blumenauer']","
Is marijuana less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco?
","Marijuana use, both recreationally and medicinally, is a glowing dot on the nation’s political radar screen. Two states, Washington and Colorado, voted to legalize recreational use of the drug last year, and other states are contemplating following. The same is true in Oregon, where as many as three marijuana-related initiatives may be heading toward the November ballot. The claim: U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, on his official website, makes clear where he stands. The Oregon Democrat supports legislation that would allow states to enact marijuana laws without federal interference, remove the ban on industrial hemp and ""allow the marijuana industry to operate in a normal business environment."" Among the claims tucked under the heading ""The Facts about Marijuana"" is this: ""Marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco."" Plenty has been written about all three substances, but with Oregon possibly facing one or more pot measures on the ballot this November, we decided to see if Blumenauer is right about marijuana’s addictive qualities. The analysis: We emailed Blumenauer’s office to ask about its sources for the claim. Spokesman Patrick Malone responded with a statement saying in part, ""We certainly always need more research on marijuana and its medicinal properties,"" but he offered no sourcing. Next we dug into PolitiFact’s database and found several claims that, while not precisely on point, added to our understanding. In one, John Morgan, the high-profile Florida attorney leading an effort to legalize medical marijuana in the Sunshine State, said ""nobody’s addicted"" to marijuana. When contacted by PolitiFact, Morgan corrected himself, saying, ""It was a huge mistake. I’m sorry and I messed up."" Experts contacted for that story agreed that marijuana can be addictive. Morgan’s claim was rated False. In another, a pro-pot group, also in Florida, claimed marijuana is ""less toxic"" than alcohol. The claim was rated Mostly True. Finally, there was a claim in Massachusetts that ""today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear."" It was rated True. So, yes, marijuana can be addictive; yes, it’s less toxic than alcohol; and, yes, it’s far stronger than previous strains of the drug. We called Dr. J. Wesley Boyd, a faculty member at Harvard Medical School and a recognized expert on addiction issues. Narrowly construed, he said, what Blumenauer posted on his website is correct -- marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco. ""But like a lot of things,"" Boyd added, ""the question is much more complicated than that. There are a lot of gray areas to all of this."" First, there’s the definition of ""addictive,"" since that’s the key to Blumenauer’s claim. ""For me,"" Boyd said, ""when someone is addicted to something, they feel a strong compulsion to use that substance even in the face of known harms that the substance causes them."" And marijuana is addictive, he said. Boyd cited research from the National Institute on Drug Abuse showing that about 9 percent of those who use marijuana become addicted. (Estimates from research suggest that 32 percent of tobacco users and 15 percent of alcohol users become addicted, according to the NIDA.) However, when it comes to withdrawal, alcohol is by far the worst of the three, he said. If someone is truly addicted to alcohol and tries to stop, Boyd said, the symptoms can be profound: heart and pulse rates through the roof, overwhelming anxiety, seizures and, in rare instances, ""a slim but possible chance of dying."" What about tobacco? ""It’s far closer to marijuana in terms of physical effects,"" he said. ""In both instances, regular users can feel, from a psychological standpoint, remarkably uncomfortable. Cravings, sleep disturbances and depression are common."" Other research confirmed what most people already know about the toll tobacco exacts on health. Smoking costs society at least $289 billion annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the lead federal agency for comprehensive tobacco prevention and control. There are no comparable figures for marijuana. We consulted three other sources, all of which agreed that marijuana is the lesser of addictive evils when compared with tobacco. In addition to a 2008 report issued by a British research foundation, both Dr. Neal L. Benowitz of the University of California at San Francisco and Dr. Jack E. Henningfield of the National Institute on Drug Abuse ranked marijuana below nicotine when it comes to withdrawal, dependence, tolerance and intoxication. Both Benowitz and Henningfield, in their rankings, determined that users get hooked on alcohol and tobacco faster than marijuana, and that, when it comes to quitting, marijuana is far easier to put down than either a cigarette or a bottle. The ruling: U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., posts a ""drug fact"" on his official website asserting that ""marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco."" Though Blumenauer’s office provided no sourcing for the claim, the congressman’s website provides links to a number of studies. A Harvard Medical School psychiatrist agreed that of the three, alcohol is the most addictive in terms of withdrawal. He and other experts we contacted also agreed that alcohol and tobacco are more difficult to give up than marijuana, and said it’s easier to become dependent on alcohol and tobacco in the first place.

Claire McCaskill credits Hillary Clinton for 'groundwork' in Syria chemical weapons deal
","Despite a rocky past with the Clintons, Sen. Claire McCaskill was one of the first Democrats to jump on the 2016 Hillary for President bandwagon. And she sits on the Senate Armed Services and Homeland Security committees. So when Fox News Sunday was looking for someone to defend Hillary Clinton’s record as Secretary of State, who better than the Missouri Democrat? Host Chris Wallace contended that Clinton has a less-than-impressive resume from her time at the State Department. Wallace said Clinton ""defended Syria President Bashar al-Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war."" (Our partners at PunditFact rated that Half True.) McCaskill later retorted that Clinton actually played a key role in the Syrian conflict. ""We're getting the chemical weapons out of Syria,"" McCaskill said. ""She laid the groundwork for that."" The agreement the United States reached with Assad to turn over Syria’s stockpile of chemical weapons came in September 2013 — seven months after Clinton stepped down as Secretary of State. As we suspected, McCaskill’s claim is rather dubious. Civil war Antigovernment protests in Syria began in March 2011. At the time, Clinton was Secretary of State. In the early stages of the conflict, Clinton and the administration called for a peaceful transition to democracy, and in August 2011, Obama said Assad should step down. But the Syrian conflict continued to escalate into an all-out civil war. Throughout the crisis, the United States was concerned about the chemical weapons in Syria — not only Assad’s use of them on his own people but protecting them from falling into the wrong hands if Assad should be overthrown. In August 2012, President Barack Obama spoke to reporters in the White House and first used the term ""red line"" regarding Assad’s chemical weapons. ""A red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized,"" he said, later adding there would be ""enormous consequences."" McCaskill’s office noted that Clinton met with Russian and United Nations officials in December 2012 about the conflict. Before the meeting, she spoke with reporters and said ""we’ve made it very clear what our position is with respect to chemical weapons,"" reiterating Obama’s red line. McCaskill spokesman John LaBombard added that ""the current efforts to remove chemical weapons benefited from her hard work."" That ""may or may not be true,"" said Anthony Arend, cofounder of the Institute for International Law & Politics at Georgetown, ""but, in any case, it's not the same as laying a foundation for the current agreement."" The December 2012 meeting with Clinton and Russia did not result in any accord with Syria, nor did her negotiations prevent Assad from using chemical weapons. She left two months later in February 2014, when Sen. John Kerry won confirmation for the position from the Senate. And a lot happened after Clinton’s departure that make it hard to link her to the eventual weapons deal, experts told us. For starters, the administration’s position on what the ""red line"" actually meant continued to change after Clinton left office. When he first said it, Obama did not explain what the ""enormous consequences"" would be. In April 2013, the White House first told senators that the international community had evidence of chemical weapons use. By June, the Obama administration concluded Assad’s regimes used chemical weapons and authorized the military to provide light arms and ammunition to Syrian rebels. It wasn’t until Aug. 31, 2013, that Obama, citing Assad’s use of chemical weapons, called for congressional authority to take military action against Syria. ""If anything, this red line that the Obama administration proclaimed was very fluid. It kept moving,"" said Danny Postel, associate director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver. ""It wasn’t until the critical weeks of the big chemical weapons attack that finally triggered the Obama administration to threaten actual military strikes on the Assad regime. Hillary Clinton was already gone by this point."" It was that policy shift and threat of military action that ultimately seemed to move Assad to take action. The accidental agreement Experts also noted how quickly and spontaneously the deal to remove Assad’s chemical weapons was reached between the U.S., Syria and Russia. In many ways, Kerry almost ""stumbled"" into the agreement, said Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at Oklahoma University and author of the Syria Comment blog. During a visit to London, a reporter asked Kerry about Assad’s interview with PBS’ Charlie Rose, where the leader would not even admit to having chemical weapons. ""Is there anything at this point that his government could do or offer that would stop an attack?"" the reporter asked. Kerry responded: ""Sure. He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week. Turn it over, all of it, without delay, and allow a full and total accounting for that. But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously."" A State Department spokesman even said later that day that the offer was made ""rhetorically."" But within hours of Kerry’s remarks, Russia responded that Syria was receptive to such an agreement. On Sept. 10, Syria admitted to its chemical weapons stockpile and four days later joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and agreed to eliminate its weapons. About 90 percent of those weapons have been turned over since then. We took this analysis to McCaskill for rebuttal but they didn’t respond on the record. A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment, and Clinton’s spokesman did not respond to repeated emails. Our ruling McCaskill said Clinton ""laid the groundwork"" to remove Syria’s chemical weapons. The connection to the eventual deal seems to be Clinton’s ongoing discussions with Russia, who eventually helped broker the agreement, and the administration’s red line on chemical weapons, which eventually led to the threat of military action that forced Assad’s hand. Experts we spoke with said that was a pretty flimsy case. Obama’s red line changed meaning from Clinton to Kerry. At first it was a rather ambiguous threat. Later, crossing it meant helping rebels obtain weapons and finally the announcement of military action. Further, the eventual agreement itself came quickly and almost unintentionally after Kerry made a rhetorical offer that Russia and Assad accepted. Clinton had been out of the Secretary of State job for seven months at that point. Prior to Kerry’s offer, an agreement seemed out of reach. Given all of that, we rate McCaskill’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/04/claire-mccaskill/claire-mccaskill-says-hillary-clinton-secretary-st/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says Charlie Crist let college tuition increase up to 15 percent every year
","Education spending is a weapon of choice for both sides of the battle lines in this year’s Florida gubernatorial election. This time around, Gov. Rick Scott is again lobbing an incendiary charge at his presumptive Democratic challenger. ""Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year,"" Scott’s political committee Let’s Get to Work said in a statewide campaign ad, which launched June 2, 2014. It then goes on to say Scott repealed the increase. This attack is worded a bit differently from a claim we checked a couple months ago and found Mostly False. Let’s check the report card on this one again. Calculating costs Scott for Florida told us the commercial refers to the 2009 plan to set tuition rates for Florida universities. Before Crist took office in 2007, the state Legislature set undergraduate rates with no cap on how much the price could go up. The university system’s Board of Governors set graduate and out-of-state rates, capped at 15 percent. That system changed later that year, when the Legislature let the largest state research universities raise rates up 15 percent per year. Crist opposed raising tuition in 2007, and vetoed a 5 percent increase set by lawmakers. He reversed himself later that year, and the 5 percent hike took effect. The Legislature’s increase was 6 percent in 2008, with the state’s five largest universities getting additional tuition bumps. Crist signed that year’s budget without challenging the changes. But in 2009, the Legislature approved a new plan that allowed the Board of Governors to raise undergraduate tuition rates past whatever the Legislature approved. As long as the total increase didn’t exceed 15 percent per year, they were allowed to do this until tuition reached the national average, which was $8,893 in 2012-13. Crist advocated for this plan, and signed off on it when the Legislature approved it. That’s the basis of the ad’s attack. At the time, universities argued the system needed to raise tuition to pay for scholarships, keep top professors and compete with other states. (Florida was 45th in tuition costs in 2011, and 43rd by 2013.) The need only increased after the Legislature starting slashing post-secondary education funding following the Great Recession, some university officials argued. How did the process work? Stick with us here. It’s a little complicated, because under tuition differential rules, both the Legislature and the Board of Governors had a role in raising tuition. The Legislature set its base tuition increase each year (it would go up by the rate of inflation if no budget action was taken). Then individual universities would ask the Board of Governors for another increase, called tuition differential. Those two numbers, the base increase and the differential, couldn’t add up to more than 15 percent. It can be less, but has been 15 percent a few times -- notably when both Crist and Scott were governor. The governor could veto the Legislature's increase, but not the Board of Governors increase. He appoints the Board’s members, but has no official say in their decisions. Here’s how the tuition increases played out under both Crist and Scott: Year 
(Governor in office) Legislative increase Board of Governors increase Total 2007 (Crist) 5 percent N/A 5 percent 2008 (Crist) 6 percent N/A 6 percent 2009 (Crist)* 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2010 (Crist) 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2011 (Scott) 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2012 (Scott) 0 percent Varied by university Varied by university 2013 (Scott) 3 percent (vetoed) 0 percent 1.7 percent (indexed to inflation) * Tuition differential law takes effect Scott definitely used his veto power to stop the Legislature in 2013, but it was his influence on the Board of Governors that kept last year’s hike so low. The governor may not be able to veto the board, but he certainly can express an opinion to its members, which he did. Now that we’ve gone through all this for purposes of fact-checking the ad, you can forget about it for future tuition increases: The entire tuition differential process was scrapped by the Legislature during the 2014 session as part of a bill allowing children of illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition. Now automatic tuition increases are gone, even for inflation; the Legislature can vote for one, and only the University of Florida and Florida State can lobby the Board for a differential increase, up to a maximum of 6 percent. Our ruling Scott for Florida’s new ad about education costs said, ""Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year."" Tuition did go up 15 percent in 2009 and 2010. But the ad downplays the fact that tuition increased 5 and 6 percent the two years prior to that. (It also neglects to mention it went up 15 percent under Gov. Scott one year, as well.) We should also note that Crist wasn’t the only actor here. The Legislature approved increases, as did the state Board of Governors. Still, tuition did go up each year, and as high as 15 percent for two years. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/04/rick-scott/charlie-crist-allowed-college-tuition-increase-15-/

Pundit claims Redskins historically used as 'term of respect'
","In the early years of the National Football League, the owner of the Boston Redskins asked his coach to don a headdress on the sideline. The players wore war paint, and a marching band played the fight song ""Hail to the Redskins,"" with broken English lyrics that referenced scalping. Today, the team plays in the nation’s capital, the headdress and war paint long gone. But contention over the team’s ""Indian"" identity has never been greater. In May, 50 U.S. senators signed a letter urging the Washington Redskins to change its name. Team owner Daniel Snyder isn’t budging, even as colleges and high schools dropped ""redskin"" mascots over the years and other professional teams abandoned traditions like the Atlanta Braves’ Chief Noc-A-Homa (Knock-A-Homer). Why? Dumping the brand of a storied franchise carries an obvious cost. Still, people who support the nickname offer another defense. ""When’s the last time you heard someone use that as a racial slur?"" asked Pete Hegseth, a guest panelist on the Fox News show Outnumbered. ""It’s not used commonly at all as a racial slur. It’s used historically to refer to — a term of respect to people."" In this fact-check, PunditFact will explore the roots of the word redskin, the origins of the team’s name and whether the term was meant as a show of respect. ‘The red people’ How the word formed and evolved is ripe for academic debate, with scholars probing documents, speeches, literature and news articles for its earliest mentions. Redskins team president Bruce Allen cites the work of Ives Goddard, senior linguist emeritus at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History. Allen isolated a line from a 2005 academic journal article that aimed to knock down ""unfounded"" claims that the word refers to bloody ""red skins,"" or dead American Indians, as proof for bounties. Goddard said the word’s origin is ""entirely benign and reflects more positive aspects of relations between Indians and whites."" It was not disrespectful, he told us, and originated from the French translation of a Native American idiom to designate racial differences with Europeans. The earliest verified uses of ""redskins"" come in the mid 18th century in colonial dealings with tribes in Illinois Country. The first recorded public use in English was when President James Madison spoke to a delegation of Indian tribes at President’s House in Washington at the onset of the War of 1812. Madison talked about ""the red people who live on the same great island with the white people."" Two tribal leaders referred to themselves as ""redskins"" in response. Goddard further traced the term to an 1815 speech by Meskwaki chief Black Thunder amid peace treaty negotiations. Addressing the governor of the Missouri Territory, Black Thunder said, ""I have never injured you, and innocence can feel no fear. I turn to all, redskins and white skins, and challenge an accusation against me."" The point of Goddard’s research: The term ""redskins"" was born as a neutral description of American Indians during a limited, positive time between colonials and some tribal nations. Hegseth went further, though, describing its use as a ""a term of respect."" Hollywood western culture Nancy Shoemaker, a University of Connecticut history professor who studied the etymology of ""red"" references to Indians, said she considers Goddard’s work thorough but wished he had tracked the word post-1826. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, she said, the term was deployed by whites in acts of violence against Native Americans. The Redskins team name ""was not harking back to French-Meskwaki treaty councils,"" Shoemaker said. ""It was harking back to 19th century use of the word."" Some tribes occasionally referred to themselves as ""red people,"" she said, such as Cherokees claiming ""red"" as a way to differentiate themselves from the whites ""they saw as greedy and grasping."" Other experts said ""red men"" was used to reference red body paint worn by tribes. The word’s evolution over the 19th century is not as well researched, though Shoemaker says historians find its disparaging use ""kind of obvious."" The term carried a negative connotation -- that people of darker skin were inferior -- over the past two centuries, said Sherry L. Smith, a Southern Methodist University history professor. ""Pete Hegseth seems to have taken the argument that teams selected Native American sports mascots as a sign of respect for ‘Indians’ and shifted that over to the use of the word ‘redskins’ as a sign of respect,"" Smith said. ""He is simply wrong."" The term came up in some 19th century literature, and experts debate whether references are sympathetic or condescending. James Fenimore Cooper used ""red men"" and ""red-skin"" throughout his 1820s novels The Pioneers and The Last of the Mohicans to describe Native Americans.  To Goddard, the terms are an ""affectless designation,"" an earnest attempt to use the more accurate term compared to ""Indian."" To others, Cooper is romanticizing native characters in a racist way, treating them as ""living relics"" doomed to extinction, said Philip J. Deloria, a University of Michigan professor of history and American culture. Clearer derogatory portrayals emerged in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz author Frank Baum invoked the word in 1890 and 1891 newspaper editorials calling for the extermination of Native Americans. Baum wrote of Sioux leader Sitting Bull’s death in 1890 that ""with his fall the nobility of the Redskin is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them."" 20th century depictions of war-like, primitive redskins endured in early Hollywood westerns and the 1932 Tom and Jerry cartoon ""Redskin Blues,"" in which the title characters escape an attack on their wagon by Indians (some, for example, appear chubby but are revealed to be Indian women in skimpy dress) thanks to the U.S. military. The ""Indian"" caricature persisted as American Indians were pushed onto reservations and dealt with a law that banned outward practice of their religions. Experts we consulted were hard-pressed to find ""redskin"" used in a cut-and-dried show of respect. ""That's not to say one might not be able to find an instance of it someplace,"" Deloria said. ""I’d say there's no evidence that it was a common form of discourse, widely understood as a word of value and respect."" ‘Hail to the Redskins’ Despite the prevailing depictions of American Indians as ""redskins"" in the early 20th century, the football team says it chose its name out of respect. ""It is a symbol of everything we stand for: strength, courage, pride, and respect -- the same values we know guide Native Americans and which are embedded throughout their rich history as the original Americans,"" Snyder, the owner, wrote in a 2013 letter to season ticket holders. The team played as the Boston Braves in its first season in 1932. Owner George Preston Marshall chose the Redskins name in 1933 with the team’s move into Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox. Marshall’s motivations remain uncertain, though it’s clear he loved to exploit Native American imagery for games. A known racist, his team was the last to integrate. Team officials have claimed throughout the ongoing legal battle over the team’s trademark that Marshall was honoring its coach, William ""Lone Star"" Dietz, who claimed Sioux heritage, and the early American Indian players recruited for the team. But Dietz’s heritage is another sore subject, with evidence suggesting he was a German American who assumed a Native American identity. Another theory is Marshall was likely choosing a synonym for ""Braves."" Indian names had already proliferated throughout sports, chosen to reference hometowns or states, express patriotism or warrior-like strength, or touch on enthusiasm for American Indian athletes like Jim Thorpe, said J. Gordon Hylton, a law professor at Marquette University and University of Virginia and a sports historian. Our ruling This fact-check isn’t about whether the Redskins owner believes his football team’s name is meant to be respectful (that’s his opinion). It’s also not about whether the Redskins name has a place in the 21st century (that’s your opinion). We’re evaluating a claim by a defender of the nickname that the word itself was used as a term of respect. It’s a stretch. Its earliest use was as a racial designation before being used in derogatory portrayals of American Indians in literature, movies and newspapers, and in 19th century clashes between whites and tribal nations. That sentiment extended into 20th century culture. Hegseth’s talking point suggests ""redskins"" was used as an honorific and doesn’t tell the full story about the word’s historical usage. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/04/pete-hegseth/pundit-claims-redskins-historically-used-term-resp/

Tammy Baldwin claims college students graduate with $30,000 in student loan debt
","Tammy Baldwin has the younger generation’s future in her sights as she looks to the burden of student loan debt weighing on college graduates. ""This generation, on average, is starting their careers, if they’ve been to a four-year college, with just under $30,000 in debt. And it’s going to impact our economy, our future,"" Baldwin said May 8, 2014 on the Devil’s Advocate show on Madison radio. A week later, Baldwin announced her support for a bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) that would allow borrowers to refinance student loans at an interest rate of 3.86 percent, much lower than most federal loan options. With graduation season in full swing, we thought we’d take a look. Studies show seven out of every 10 college graduates has student loan debt, but is Baldwin right about the $30,000 figure and that it affects an entire generation? Spokesman John Kraus said Baldwin’s source was a December 2013 report from the Institute for College Access & Success, an independent, nonprofit group that tracks student loan debt by state. The California-based group advocates for more available and affordable higher education. Various funders support its efforts, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Ford Foundation. To complete its 2012 report, the institute relied on federal data and a survey sent to colleges through Peterson’s, a college guide publishing company. The report says the average debt nationally for those 2012 graduates who took out loans was $29,400. Among Wisconsin graduates, the average debt was $28,102, the nation’s 14th highest. So Baldwin’s claim was pretty on target for both national and state levels. The debt itself, however, varies widely by state, from $18,000 to $33,650, and even more so by college, from $4,450 to $49,450. The likelihood for graduating seniors to have debt after college also stretches from 41 percent to 78 percent depending on the state. But the report itself notes its data offers an incomplete picture because only about half of all public and private nonprofit four-year colleges reported their student-loan debt figures 2012. That can skew the results. Additionally, the figures don’t differentiate between federal or private loans. Private loans make up one fifth of overall student loan debt, which colleges cannot document as easily. And no for-profit colleges are included because none reported their debt figures, while the report shows they have the most borrowers at 88 percent. They also rack up the highest debt at an average of $39,950 per borrower. ""Colleges that accurately calculate and report each year’s debt figures rightfully complain that colleges may have students with higher average debt but fail to update their figures, under-report actual debt levels, or never report figures at all,"" the report says. What it means for the Class of 2014 Other studies show a slightly different picture. A study released in May 2014 by the National Conference on State Legislatures concluded that 2014 graduates with student loans will owe an average of $26,500, somewhat lower than what Baldwin cited. Another study released in May 2014 by Edvisors, a network of websites that offer insight on ways to pay for college, analyzed data from the National Center for Education Statistics to conclude that borrowers would graduate with an average of $33,000 in debt. This led a Wall Street Journal article on the study to call the class of 2014 : ""the most indebted class ever.""   State legislatures instituted tuition freezes and increased funding last year that have slowed down the rise in tuition that began in the early 1980s, which another NCSL study shows is a major factor in a decrease in student loan debt. Outstanding student loan debt also totaled $1.7 trillion in the third quarter of last year to surpass credit card, mortgage, and auto debt as the fastest growing portion of debt since 2008, according to a recent study from the Federal Reserve of New York. The study shows students struggle to pay back these loans that also have the highest delinquency rate -- 11.5 percent of loan balances are more than 90 days delinquent or in default. A final note: while the amount of student loan debt continues to soar, its rate of growth decreased from 12 percent in early 2012 to 8.25 percent in late 2013, according to the Federal Reserve. This led them to conclude that ""the more-rapid expansion"" of student loan debt in early 2012 has not been as fast this past year. All this research undermines Baldwin’s point. The level of college debt is a moving target. While Baldwin painted the $30,000 figure as affecting a generation of students, the data she cited is limited to a specific graduating class. And studies show three of every 10 graduates finish without student loan debt. Our rating Baldwin claimed that ""this generation, on average, is starting their careers, if they’ve been to a four-year college, with just under $30,000 in debt."" While she cites a figure from a legitimate source, that data has limitations that are not acknowledged. Notably, about half of the colleges were not included in the data used to create the state-by-state breakdown. Additionally, the national figure is for 2012 and more recent studies show a more mixed picture and in some cases suggest the level may be lower. We rate her statement Half True. (Note: This item was changed June 5, 2014 to clarify the source of data used to calculate the average student-loan debt and that additional, more recent studies show the debt level may be lower, not decreasing.)",/factchecks/2014/jun/04/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-claims-college-students-graduate-300/

Sonny Perdue even began his automated call by apologizing for ringing voters’ phones at dinnertime on election eve. Perdue said he just had to make a last-minute pitch for his cousin David Perdue, who went on to finish first in the crowded GOP race for the U.S. Senate. For many people, the automated campaign calls aren’t just annoying, they also are irrelevant. For the primary, more than 239,000 voters went to the polls in advance of Election Day to cast ballots for U.S. senator, governor, and a long list of state and local officeholders. An additional 772,643 followed on Election Day. Secretary of State Brian Kemp said the numbers ""make clear that Georgia voters are increasingly taking advantage of early-voting opportunities."" Kemp was specifically comparing early votes from the primaries in 2010 (at 19 percent) to 2014 (at 24.2 percent), Kemp spokesman Jared Thomas said. We decided to see whether Kemp is right. Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have early voting -- Georgia included. ""We were one of the later states to come to the table. By that time, it had already become a pretty accepted practice,"" former Secretary of State Cathy Cox recalled. ""It just makes such common sense in a busy world."" The Georgia General Assembly passed legislation in 2003, allowing a one-week early-voting period, the Monday through Friday before Election Day. By the 2004 general election, when Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat John Kerry for president, 13 percent of Georgia voters cast ballots early. Since then, the number of voters who have cast their ballots early has generally risen steadily, according to data from the Secretary of State’s Office. They soared to the highest level  -- 53 percent -- in the 2008 election, when Barack Obama was elected president, the data show. Last month, they accounted for 24.2 percent of votes in the GOP and Democratic primaries. Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University, said looking at the presidential elections in 2004, 2008 and 2012 and the midterm elections for governor in 2006 and 2010, ""it’s clear that early voting is now quite common."" ""The fact that more than a third of Georgia voters cast early ballots in 2012 is impressive,"" Gillespie said.

Before 2008, much of the research suggested that early voting did not raise the overall level of voter participation in presidential contests over several decades. But that year in Obama’s run to become the first African-American president, and in major elections since, prominent researchers have detected a small turnout increase due to early voting, especially among black voters. Some top researchers say the increase is not significant. ""Our take on this is that instead of increasing turnout, it just makes it easier for those who would have voted on Election Day to show up at other times to vote,"" Jan E. Leighley, a co-author with Jonathan Nagler of ""Who Votes Now? Demographics, Issues, Inequality and Turnout in the United States,"" told PolitiFact earlier this year. Cox said Georgia officials had hoped early voting would boost overall voter participation. But Maxine Daniels, who runs elections in DeKalb County, said she hasn’t seen that result. ""It’s not an uptick in voting. It’s basically a shift in when people vote,"" Daniels said. ""It just made it easier for the people who were going to vote anyway."" There have been other benefits, Daniels and Cox said. Election Day lines are shorter, and counties have been spared the costs of adding more voting machines and ramping up staffing of the polls on Election Day, they said. Georgia has changed its rules on early voting more than once. After having early voting for one week in advance of the elections in 2003 and 2004, the law was amended in 2005 to allow a voter to request an absentee mail-in ballot without giving a reason up to 45 days ahead of a federal or state election or 21 days ahead of a special election. They could still vote in person in the week before the election. In 2010, the law was amended to in-person early voting for seven weeks without giving a reason. In 2011, early voting was reduced to 21 days, ending the Friday before the election and including at least one Saturday of early voting. To sum up, there’s plenty of evidence that Georgia voters are taking advantage of the chance to cast their ballots early. In the 2012 presidential election, 1.9 million early votes were cast. That’s up from about 420,000 in 2004, the first time Georgians could vote early in a presidential election.

David Frum: U.S. executions have dropped by 'nearly two-thirds'
","The botched execution of an Oklahoma man has again put a focus on the death penalty in the United States. Bill Maher added his mix of humor and seriousness to the discussion on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher. ""Why can’t we just kill people? If you want to kill them, and you want to do it humanely, you can definitely put them out. We’ve all been under,"" Maher said on his May 23, 2014, show. ""Then when you’re under … guillotine, shoot them, leave them in a room with a toddler with a gun, anything. It’s just so easy to take human life. It’s ridiculous."" David Frum of The Atlantic tried to bring the conversation back toward seriousness, saying ""we’ve seen a remarkable reduction in the number of Americans being executed -- it’s down nearly two-thirds over the past generation."" Maher jumped right back in. ""We're fifth in the world,"" Maher said. ""Behind China, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia."" Here, we’re looking at Frum’s claim. (In another fact-check we took up Maher’s retort.) The best information to consider Frum’s claim comes from the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit organization set up to provide information and statistics about the death penalty. The center tracks the number of executions in the United States each year. The death penalty in the United States was suspended in 1972 after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Furman vs. Georgia. The court in that case found that a lack of standards in enforcing the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The death penalty was reinstated four years later after the court approved more specific sentencing guidelines. Executions started slowly after the death penalty was reinstated then climbed steadily in the 1990s. The number of executions peaked in 1999 at 98 and has been generally declining since. In 2013, there were a total of 39 executions. 
(Death Penalty Information Center) Compared to the peak year of 1999, the number of executions in 2013 were down by 60 percent. That’s not exactly the figure Frum cited, but it’s close, and Frum hedged his statement by adding ""nearly."" As for the other part of Frum’s claim, he said the drop happened ""over the past generation."" That’s right in some instances -- namely from 1999 to 2013 -- but wrong in others. A generation is most often defined as a period of time between 20 and 30 years. From 1993-2013, a period of about 20 years, the number of executions have increased by one (or up 2.6 percent). From 1983-2013, about 30 years, the number of executions have increased by 34 (or up 680 percent). Still, the broader trend line appears clear, and that’s what Frum ultimately was getting at. ""The overall trend has been consistently downward over the last 15 years,"" the Death Penalty Information Center said in a statement. What explains the drop? Part of it is that more states are abolishing the death penalty. Six states have abolished the death penalty since 2007 (New York, Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, New Mexico and Illinois). Part of it is a drop off in states that use the death penalty most frequently. Texas executed 40 people in 2000 but has averaged less than 15 executions per year in the past three years. Richard Dieter, executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, says the drop-off in Texas may be explained by a 2005 change in the law that gave juries the choice of sentencing murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Before, according to the Los Angeles Times, jurors had to sentence a murderer to die to be assured he would never go free. In Florida, the number of executions has swung with the governor. Jeb Bush presided over 21 executions in eight years in office (1999-2007) while Charlie Crist saw five executions in his one four-year term (2007-11). Rick Scott has overseen 17 executions since taking office in January 2011. ""Twenty years ago, use of the death penalty was increasing. Now it is declining by almost every measure,"" said Dieter, who authored a Death Penalty Information Center year-end report. ""The recurrent problems of the death penalty have made its application rare, isolated, and often delayed for decades."" Our ruling Frum said, ""We’ve seen a remarkable reduction in the number of Americans being executed -- it’s down nearly two-thirds over the past generation."" Statistics show that executions in the United States have been generally decreasing since 1999 and are down about 60 percent from 1999 to 2013. Frum could have been more specific on his timeframe, but his point is largely on the mark.
