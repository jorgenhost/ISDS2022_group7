No proof that Rubio's religious tweet was related to Trump rally
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s tweet about a New Testament verse was an attack on Floridians who support President Donald Trump, according to an article on Facebook that lacked evidence. ""Marco Rubio just publicly shamed his own constituents for flocking to Trump rally,"" stated a Dec. 9 headline on verifiedpolitics.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that this article jumped to a conclusion about what prompted Rubio’s tweet. Trump held a rally in Pensacola the night of Dec. 8, when he called on Alabama residents to vote for Republican Roy Moore. A few days later, Moore lost the U.S. Senate election to Democrat Doug Jones. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. Verifiedpolitics.com wrote that the crowd in Pensacola, composed largely of Floridians, cheered for Trump. ""It was this display that moved the normally mild mannered Senator from Miami to lash out on Twitter and throw Republicans from his own state under the bus,"" the website stated. The article then cited Rubio’s tweet on the morning of Dec. 9: ""At the sight of the crowds his heart was moved with pity 4 them b/c they were troubled & abandoned like sheep without a shepherd.Matthew 9:36."" At the sight of the crowds his heart was moved with pity 4 them b/c they were troubled & abandoned like sheep without a shepherd.Matthew9:36 The tweet drew hundreds of replies. While some on Twitter replied with a photo of Trump’s Pensacola rally, a correspondent for the Eternal World Television Network replied that the verse was part of the Roman Catholic daily Mass. ""Once again, @marcorubio quotes the daily Gospel for Mass, and Twitter can’t handle it,"" Jason Calvi tweeted. In his autobiography An American Son, Rubio wrote that he attends services at Christ Fellowship, his wife’s evangelical church, on most Saturday nights and then mass at St. Louis Catholic Church on Sundays. We sent emails to Rubio’s spokeswoman to ask if his tweet related to Trump’s speech or Moore and did not get a reply. Rubio had no tweets Dec. 8 or 9 that mentioned Trump or Moore. He tweeted about tax reform, Army vs. Navy football and Venezuela. But Rubio had made previous statements critical of Moore. In November, Rubio said on Fox & Friends that Moore’s accusers are ""very credible"" and that the charges are ""very serious"" and could be problematic for Moore if elected. However, the implication of the verifiedpolitics.com article is that Rubio used his tweet to shame his own Florida constituents for attending the Trump rally. Rubio’s criticism of Moore had been directed at Moore himself -- not Floridians who support Trump. And while Rubio at times has appeared critical of Trump or his administration, on other issues, such as Cuba policy, the two politicians have partnered together. Rubio regularly tweets verses For several months, Rubio has regularly tweeted lines from the Bible, drawing attention from the media, religious experts and others In an October interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Rubio defended his practice of tweeting out verses most mornings. ""I'll continue to do it,"" he told the network. ""If they don't like it, they don't have to follow me."" We interviewed two experts about the religious meaning of the verse that Rubio quoted: Candida Moss, a theology professor at the University of Birmingham, and Christopher R. Matthews, Research Professor of New Testament at Boston College. ""The surface meaning of the verse is rather clear: sheep do not organize themselves (they're not the brightest), so in the absence of a shepherd/leader there is the potential for confusion and chaos,"" Matthews said. The verse comes within the context of several stories about Jesus healing the sick, teaching people in the synagogues and proclaiming the good news, Moss said. ""In its immediate context this verse is quite clearly about the people needing spiritual leadership and practical assistance (in the form of what we would call health care),"" she said. ""Taken out of context, however, that meaning is expanded so that it becomes a broader statement about people lacking moral and spiritual guidance, and how this state of affairs is distressing to God.   Founded in 2017, Verified Politics describes itself as a political news website that it is for readers who are tired of fake news. We emailed the website and asked if they had any evidence that Rubio tweeted a New Testament verse to shame his own constituents for flocking to a Trump rally, and we did not get a response. Rubio, a regular at Sunday mass, provided no explanation for his tweet so it’s merely speculation to conclude that his point was commentary on Trump’s Pensacola rally the previous night. The verse from Matthew that Rubio tweeted was part of the daily Mass for that Sunday. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7AE200>],/factchecks/2017/dec/18/verified-politics/no-proof-rubios-religious-tweet-was-related-trump-/

Seating Alabama Sen.-elect Doug Jones - does a delay break Senate rules?
","Alabama Democrat Doug Jones might have won a Senate seat, but according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Jones won’t officially take that seat until early January. With Republicans pushing hard to pass their $1.5 trillion tax bill before Christmas, their opponents cast McConnell’s move as a pure political play. ""This is a flagrant violation of Senate policy, which requires Jones assume office the instant one of them wins the election,"" said an article on the website Verified Politics. ""But the craven majority leader doesn’t want a moral Democrat sabotaging his precious tax scam that steals from the poor to give to the rich."" We looked at the Senate rules, the Senate schedule and the history of special elections. The argument that any delay represents a violation of Senate policy doesn’t hold up. In fact, when we reached out to Verified Politics, they apologized for the error and changed their article. It now reads, ""This is a flagrant violation of the spirit of Senate rules."" That’s quite a shift. While we welcome the correction, our policy is to rate claims as originally stated and to share our research with readers. McConnell teed up this controversy early on the day of the Dec. 12 special election when he told reporters that no winner would be sworn in before January. ""Sen. (Luther) Strange is going to be here through the end of this session,"" McConnell said. Typically, the session ends in December, although it has come as late as Jan. 3. Right now, the plan is to end in December.   Under the Standing Rules of the Senate, a new senator takes the oath of office after the governor and secretary of state from the state certifies the election. That oath takes place during ""open Senate."" Both the timeline in Alabama and the holidays work against seating Jones immediately. Alabama law says each county has until the second Friday after a special election to certify the outcome. In this case, that falls on Dec. 22. After that, the law gives the governor and secretary of state another 10 days to certify the statewide outcome. With Christmas and New Year’s Day as official holidays, that would push the deadline to Jan. 3, 2018. That said, the spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State told us certification would likely take place around Dec. 28, although the exact timing is uncertain. So for starters, the delay is on the Alabama end, not in the U.S. Senate. After that, Jones runs into the problem of the holidays. In theory, the Senate could remain in session between Christmas and New Year’s. Typically, it’s in recess. While some last-minute turmoil could change that -- involving the tax bill or keeping the government running -- at the moment, it looks like lawmakers will be home for the holidays. That means lawmakers come back in the first week of January. If Jones weren’t seated at that point, then Democrats would have plenty of reason to object, but that isn’t what McConnell laid out. There have been 11 special elections since World War II that match Jones’ situation. A speedy placement happened twice. It took one day to seat William Proxmire, D-Wis., in 1957, and two days for John Durkin, D-N.H., in 1975. The longest delay was 41 days for Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., in 1960. On average, the wait was 15 days. Even if Alabama certified Jones that fast, it would still fall on Dec. 27. Recent special elections have not run into the holiday recess issue. In February 2010, Scott Brown, R-Mass., was seated 16 days after his election. It took 21 days for Ed Markey, D-Mass., to take the oath of office in July 2013. Cory Booker, D-N.J., waited 15 days in October 2013. An article in Verified Politics said that anything other than instantly seating Jones would be a flagrant violation of Senate policy. That is incorrect, and when we brought this to the website’s attention, they dialed back their claim to say seating Jones in January violated the spirit of Senate rules. Senate rules rely on states to certify election results. Alabama’s process puts certification into the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day. If the Senate is in recess, as it nearly always is, then Jones would have to wait until the first week of January. On average, the delay in seating senators who win special elections is 15 days. The statement is not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCF8940>],/factchecks/2017/dec/18/verified-politics/seating-doug-jones-does-delay-break-senate-rules/

Fake news says Chuck Schumer had affair with teenage cheerleader
","U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer was busted by his own daughter for having an affair with a teenager, according to a fake news story making the rounds on Facebook. ""Update: Chuck Schumer’s steamy affair with a high school cheerleader confirmed,"" stated a headline in USA In Front Dec. 10. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This fake story had been shared more than 30,000 times on Facebook within just a few days. Schumer’s spokesman declined to comment to PolitiFact, and no one from the website responded to our email. The story stated that Schumer, a New York Democrat, had an affair with his daughter Lisa’s best friend from high school, a 16-year-old who later committed suicide. Schumer’s wife, Kaitlyn, paid the girl’s mother $2 million, the article stated. In reality, Schumer’s wife is named Iris and his daughters are Jessica and Alison. USA In Front claims proof via the cheerleader’s mother and Planned Parenthood records, but offers no actual evidence. The article portrays Schumer as a hypocrite for opposing the candidacy of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, who lost the Alabama race Dec. 12. In November, the Washington Post reported that Moore, while he was in his 30s, had pursued relationships with teenage girls, according to the women. Several fake news stories have made up claims related to Moore. This article appears to be a rip off of an earlier version on Last Line of Defense, a notorious fake news website that identifies itself as satire. That version had some more fictional details such as that Schumer spent a ton of money on the girl at Steak and Shake and Victoria’s Secret. These fake news stories about Schumer having an affair with a teenage teenager were posted a few days before an unrelated story in the New York Times about false allegations by a former Schumer staff member of sexual harassment by Schumer. Schumer’s staff filed a report to the Capitol Police that a fraudulent document that resembled a court filing described false allegations. The former staff member told the New York Times that the harassment claims were ""completely false."" The former staff member spoke to the New York Times on the condition of anonymity.

Paul Ryan claims 1986 tax reform, like the current one, had low public support just before passage
","U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan says not to worry that polls show most Americans don’t support supporting the historic tax reform he and other Republicans are pushing toward a final vote. At this stage prior to the last major tax reform, in 1986, the Wisconsin Republican says, support was low, too. Let’s see if Ryan -- suddenly in the spotlight over whether he might retire -- is right on his history. Ryan’s claim Ryan made his claim during a Dec. 13, 2017 interview with Jay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Ryan referred to the 1986 reform, signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan, during this exchange: Weber: Are you losing the messaging war, though, with these polls showing half of the country doesn’t like this plan? They clearly don’t understand it. Ryan: Yeah, I think that’s right. You know, we went back and took solace in this. Gosh, everybody looks at the Reagan tax reform as such a phenomenal success ….And guess what: The thing was polling at about 18 percent right before they passed it. ""Polling at about 18 percent"" is a bit vague, but let’s see what the evidence shows. The polls As Weber indicated, December 2017 polls about the current tax reform show not only that support is low, but that opposition is high. Three examples: Only 25 percent approved of the way Republicans ""are handling"" tax reform and 63 percent disapproved (Marist); 26 percent approved ""of the Republican tax plan"" and 55 percent disapproved (Quinnipiac); and, among those who said they were aware of the tax plan, 31 percent said they supported it and 49 percent were opposed (Reuters/Ipsos). Let’s be clear on the timing in terms of weighing Ryan’s claim. On the same morning of Ryan’s interview, Republicans in Congress announced that House and Senate leaders had reached a deal on reconciling separate tax reform bills that had been approved in the House and the Senate. Details of the agreement had not been released. It was expected that the final bill would be ready for votes in the House and Senate the following week, with a goal of getting the bill to President Donald Trump before Christmas. It’s difficult to pinpoint when the 1986 tax reform effort was at the same stage as the current effort. But mid- to late-1986 would be roughly the time frame. According to a New York Times chronology, on July 17, 1986, ""in a room overflowing with lobbyists from every conceivable commercial interest, 11 senators and 11 representatives (began) the conference to write the final version of the legislation."" The final version was approved by the House and Senate in late-September 1986. Reagan signed the bill Oct. 22, 1986. Polling experts told us they were surprised, after looking back, how relatively little polling was done about support for the 1986 tax reform at this stage in the process. Ryan’s office cited to us one result from a September 1986 Gallup Poll: 18 percent said they thought their taxes would decrease under the plan. But that question isn’t on point in terms of support or approval. More importantly, that poll was taken after the House-Senate conference committee had approved the 1986 bill. That step hadn’t yet occurred when Ryan made his statement about the current reform. We found four polls taken before that stage. Two polls with results near Ryan’s 18 percent claim Poll Date Question Results ABC News/Washington Post Poll June 1986 From what you have read or heard, do you favor or oppose this tax bill, or don't you know enough about it to say? Favor: 22% Oppose: 15% Don’t Know/No opinion: 63% ABC News/Washington Post Poll Sept. 1986 From what you have read or heard, do you favor or oppose this tax bill, or don’t you know enough about it to say? Favor: 22% Oppose: 15% Don’t know enough about it to say: 63% So, with identical results in both polls, the 22 percent Favor, which is seven points higher than Oppose, is close to Ryan’s 18 percent claim -- even though a strong majority didn’t choose either response. Two polls with higher support -- and opposition The other two polls, however, showed much higher support for the bill than Ryan indicated -- but also much higher opposition, as fewer respondents were on the fence: Gallup Poll June 1986 From what you’ve heard or read about it, would you say approve or disapprove of the latest tax reform proposal? Approve: 38% Disapprove: 36% Don’t Know: 26% Gallup Poll Aug. 1986 From what you’ve heard or read about it, would you say approve or disapprove of the latest tax reform proposal? Approve: 40% Disapprove 34% Don’t Know: 26% The 38 percent and 40 percent approval rates in those two polls are much higher than Ryan’s 18 percent claim. Moreover, the disapproval rates show in polls on the current reform are much higher than those shown in the four 1986 polls. In that respect, the comparison Ryan draws is not entirely on point. Our rating Ryan said the 1986 tax reform approved under Reagan ""was polling at about 18 percent right before they passed it."" Two national polls, taken at roughly the stage of where the current tax reform effort is, showed 22 percent favored the legislation. That’s close to Ryan’s 18 percent claim. But two other polls showed approval of the bill at or near 40 percent, as more respondents were willing to choose Approve or Disapprove, rather than Don’t Know. Moreover, the disapproval rates in polls on the current tax reform are much higher than they were in the 1986 polls. For a statement that is partially accurate, we rate Ryan’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB84CB80>],/factchecks/2017/dec/18/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-claims-1986-tax-reform-current-one-had-l/

Fake news spreads about Doug Jones and votes in fictional town ""Bordalama""
","It’s not true that Democrat Doug Jones got more than 5,000 votes in a town of less than 3,000 people in the Alabama Senate race. Unofficial results from the Dec. 12 special election show that overall, Jones beat his Republican contender Roy Moore by 1.5 percentage points, or about 20,000 more votes. Moore’s election loss in deep-red Alabama prompted false stories of voter fraud, including a post from a website called Ladies of Liberty, headlined ""UPDATE: ‘Thousands’ voted for Doug Jones in Alabama town with population of 2,256."" Ladies of Liberty describes itself as ""a whimsical playland of conservative satire."" It’s About page says that everything on the website is fiction.

Here’s what the post claims: ""The State Election Board of Voting Integrity said early on that ‘more than a third’ of Jones’ votes up to 11 a.m. looked suspicious — and with good reason. Many of them came from the small town of Bordalama, a rural community about 20 miles outside Birmingham. According to official tallies, Roy Moore received 953 votes in the small town. Doug Jones received 5,327. If the disparity in numbers isn’t enough to give you reason to smell something fishy, the population of the town should. There are 2,256 residents there and only 1,867 registered voters. In other words, more people voted for Doug Jones than even live in Bordalama."" The quick facts: The name of the purported board is a variation of the ""State Election Integrity Board"" named in other fake news items, which a spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State previously told PolitiFact does no exist. Bordalama? Doesn’t exist either. No mention of it in the U.S. Census’ list of places in Alabama. As of 2 p.m. Dec. 15, Moore had not conceded the race, arguing that military and provisional ballots had not been counted yet and that the Alabama secretary of state still hadn’t certified the race.

Trump misses mark on Missouri unemployment rate
","When President Donald Trump traveled to Missouri last month to promote tax cuts, he also touted the state’s low unemployment. ""Thirteen states this year have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state. And I hate to tell you, but Missouri happens to be one of them,"" he told a crowd in St. Charles on Nov. 29, 12 days after the October preliminary unemployment rates were released. So is it true that Missouri is one of ""13 states this year (that) have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state""? We decided to find out. Missouri unemployment The White House didn’t respond to a request for evidence, so we don’t know how they got their numbers. But the usual way of looking at this question is to use data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official tabulator of employment statistics. The bureau compiles the seasonally adjusted highs and lows for states, which can be found on its website. It lists 13 states that have hit historic lows this year. Not included: Missouri. We looked at seasonally adjusted data, which is the way economists prefer to compare numbers in various months of the year. For example, during the holidays, there’s typically a bump in temporary or seasonal workers. So if employment grows by 2 percent every November due to seasonal workers, seasonal adjustment takes that 2 percent out of the equation. The seasonally adjusted preliminary unemployment rate for October is 3.5 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The historic low was from October 1999 through January 2000 when the unemployment rate was 3.1. Our Ruling In a visit to St. Charles, Trump said that Missouri is one of ""13 states this year have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state.""

Missouri has competitive Hyperloop route, but maybe not 'one of the best they've ever seen'

If Hyperloop One builds a routein Missouri, that’d be a reality. Hyperloop is a transportation system that functions like a high-tech train, moving people in tubes from city to city at speeds similar to air travel. Patrick McKenna, director of the Missouri Department of Transportation, said Missouri is an appealing candidate for a Hyperloop route. ""Officials at Hyperloop One have referred to the route as one of the best they’ve ever seen,"" he told the Kansas City Business Journal on Oct. 19. But did Hyperloop One officials say the St. Louis-Kansas City route is one of the best they’ve seen? What is Hyperloop? Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, published a white paper for Hyperloop in 2013, which was presented to former President Barack Obama later that year. According to its website, Hyperloop Technologies Inc. was established in Los Angeles in 2014. Earlier this year, the company successfully tested its propulsion system with the car in the tube, and the company projects three Hyperloop systems will be completed by 2021. Essentially, Hyperloop utilizes magnetic accelerators in a low-pressure tube system in order to propel rotors in individual capsules. The vehicles hover slightly off the track in the tube through magnetic levitation. This special environment allows a blazing top speed of 670 mph. Missouri efforts In May 2016, Hyperloop One opened its Global Challenge, urging cities and regions around the world to submit their pitches for a Hyperloop network. More than 2,600 proposals were sent to Hyperloop. Missouri submitted its application that fall, and was named as one of the 35 semifinalists in February 2017. We reached out to Hyperloop One officials, who didn’t respond, and to the Missouri Department of Transportation. Special assignment coordinator Robert Brendel directed us to links about the challenge. On Sept. 14, 2017, Hyperloop announced its winners via a press release. Even though it didn’t win, the Missouri route was designated as one of 11 finalists invited to continue developing the proposal. In response to being named a finalist, state officials established the Missouri Hyperloop Coalition in October to continue the conversation. The coalition includes MoDOT, the University of Missouri System, St. Louis Regional Chamber and the KC Tech Council. Dan Katz, Hyperloop’s director of global public policy, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the creation of the coalition helped the Missouri route’s future chances. ""They were on the edge in that competition,"" Katz told the newspaper. Now, he said, ""they are as competitive"" as any on the initial list. The company had previously weighed in as part of Missouri’s aggressive pitch for attracting Amazon to either St. Louis or Kansas City for its second headquarters. Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd is featured in a short video about the potential for the transportation system in the state, which is available on the state’s Amazon HQ pitch website.

Sen. Roy Blunt mostly right about health care progress in Missouri
","Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt has been on a mission to expand access to mental health and behavioral health patients. He believes it should be treated the same way as physical health. Blunt spoke recently in Springfield about the importance of the Excellence in Mental Health Act, which he first introduced in 2014. ""After visiting community health centers and certified community behavioral health clinics across Missouri, I’m proud to see firsthand how our state is leading the country when it comes to improving services for mental and behavioral health. Innovation is happening right here,"" Blunt said Oct. 13. Access is improving, but has Missouri become the leader in championing this cause? Steps taken We reached out to Blunt’s office, which referred us to a press release from Missouri Coalition for Community Behavioral Healthcare. Download PDF Missouri was one of the eight states initially selected to participate in the pilot program of the Excellence in Mental Health Act. This is a demonstration program that would implement a Medicaid prospective payment system for community behavioral health services. Being one of the few selected for this pilot program already puts Missouri ahead in the nationwide effort to improve mental and behavioral health services. Debra Walker, director of the Office of Public and Legislative Affairs for the Missouri Department of Mental Health, agrees with Blunt. She believes Missouri has become a national leader in the expansion of mental and behavioral health services, pointing to many of the new initiatives taking place in the state. Others shared this view. ""Sen. Blunt has truly been an asset in representing the state of Missouri in areas relating to mental health services and has historically been a strong advocate for our most vulnerable population,"" said Denise Mills, vice president of corporate relations for Burrell Behavioral Health. Brent McGinty, president of the Missouri Coalition, agrees, stating that Missouri is paving the way in ""whole-person"" health. ""Our health care home program is leading the nation in results around cost reduction and physical health improvement among the 25,000 Missourians we serve,"" McGinty said. As a representative of all of the Missouri Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers, McGinty said Missouri is currently working with law enforcement and developing a statewide system to better address behavioral health crises. ""It’s hard to really say which state, if any, is leading the country for providing services for mental and behavioral health,"" said Ronald Honberg, senior policy advisor for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Honberg points out that there is no system in place for measuring this. ""It’s fair to say that Missouri has been innovative,"" said Honberg, pointing to Senator Blunt and Joe Parks as champions in the cause in improving coordination between mental and behavioral health. Parks is the Medicaid director for the Missouri Department of Social Services and a member of the National Council for Behavioral Health. Some of the innovative work Missouri has been doing is with Emergency Departments and Mental Health First Aid, which are considered cutting edge across the country. Future of mental and behavioral health Currently there are no statistics to show where Missouri stands in improving services for mental and behavioral health as part of the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic demonstration, but measures are to be reported to the federal government according to McGinty, president of the Missouri Coalition. ""Under the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic demonstration, sponsored by Senator Blunt, we will finally start reporting to the federal government real behavioral health measures,"" McGinty said. Recently, Sens. Blunt and Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, along with Reps. Leonard Lance, R-New Jersey, and Doris Matsui, D-California, announced this would be expanded to 11 more states. With the inclusion of more states it will more likely create distinctions in who is and is not leading the nation in regard to improving services for mental and behavioral health. As of now, Missouri is implementing new measures to address whole-person care. Some of these initiatives include a partnership for Hope Waiver for Developmental Disabilities and the construction of a new, state-of-the-art, high security facility at Fulton State Hospital. ""The state that actually is moving ahead fastest, gets the most done, where access and quality are both being addressed, the state that not only comes to my mind but everyone in the field’s mind, is Missouri,"" said Linda Rosenberg, CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health in a 2016 press release. Our ruling Blunt said Missouri ""is leading the country when it comes to improving services for mental and behavioral health."" Under the demonstration program sponsored by Blunt, Missouri will start reporting real behavioral health measures to the federal government.

GOP lawmaker claims FBI purged training documents. Here's what we found
","Did the Barack Obama administration ditch FBI material used to train counterterrorism agents? At a House committee hearing on worldwide terror threats, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., claimed the former administration purged information that could ""allow us to see in totality the threat that faces America."" ""Just curious if you can tell me if the FBI has taken any steps to reverse the previous administration's purge of training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood,"" Perry asked FBI director Christopher Wray at the Nov. 30 hearing. Wray said he was not aware of efforts to purge training material. ""They were purged in the last administration,"" Perry told him. Is that true? Perry's office did not respond to our requests for information. We found the FBI did rescind training material during the Obama administration — but it was less than 1 percent of 160,000 pages of training documents that were found to contain information that was factually inaccurate, imprecise or used stereotypes. The review came after media reports show that training material included claims identifying ""mainstream"" American Muslims as ""likely to be terrorist sympathizers."" The Arab American Institute said the documents ""crudely"" depicted Arab Americans and American Muslims ""as threatening, irrational, or otherwise abnormal."" Here’s what we know about the FBI’s review and rescinded documents. Wired in July 2011 reported that part of a January 2009 presentation for new FBI recruits said that Islam ""transforms (a) country's culture into 7th-century Arabian ways."" Additional Wired reporting in September 2011 found that during a training session at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., agents were told that ""mainstream"" American Muslims were ""likely to be terrorist sympathizers; that the Prophet Mohammed was a ‘cult leader’; and that the Islamic practice of giving charity is no more than a ‘funding mechanism for combat’."" A chart in the presentation contended that the more ""devout"" Muslims are, the likelier they are to be violent, Wired reported. The FBI distanced itself from the messages in the training. It told Wired that the presentation had a disclaimer saying the views expressed were of the author and ""do not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. government."" An FBI press release issued a day after Wired’s report said the training segment was presented only one time and quickly discontinued. At a November 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked then-Attorney General Eric Holder about the training material, presenting among examples a claim that ‘‘the Arabic mind is swayed more by ideas than facts."" ""It is regrettable that that information was, in fact, a part of a training program,"" Holder said, adding that there was an ongoing review of training material ""to ensure that that kind of misinformation"" was not being used, because it could undermine and negatively impact outreach efforts. The FBI reviewed 160,000 pages of material and eventually removed hundreds of pages from its training. Less than 1 percent of the material reviewed had ""factually inaccurate or imprecise information or used stereotypes,"" the FBI told Wired in February 2012. A March 2012 letter from Durbin to then-FBI Director Robert Mueller expressed disappointment that the FBI would not produce a written report on the material deemed inappropriate, and that it would not be publicly shared or given to Congress. Durbin’s letter said FBI briefers shared copies of ""a handful"" of the material with Senate Judiciary Committee staff, but were not allowed to keep the copies. The FBI did not confirm to PolitiFact if it eliminated such material, but referred us to public source material and 2012 congressional testimony. At a May 2012 House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the FBI, Mueller said 876 inappropriate training documents had been removed after a review of 160,000 documents and over 1,000 videos, but did not specify what the material said. Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues, said documents it obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit showed that reasons cited for the removal of material included: ""Article is highly inflammatory and inaccurately argues the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization,"" and ""author seems to conflate ‘Islamic Militancy’ with ‘terrorism’ and needs to define the difference and use it in their analysis."" ""The excised material included references linking the Muslim Brotherhood to terrorism, tying al Qaeda to the 1993 World Trade Center and Khobar Towers bombings, and suggesting that ‘young male immigrants of Middle Eastern appearance … may fit the terrorist profile best’,"" Judicial Watch said. Perry said the Obama administration purged ""training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood."" The FBI removed nearly 900 training documents containing information that was inaccurate, imprecise or depicted stereotypes, after a review of 160,000 pages and more than 1,000 videos. The review came after 2011 media reports about training material portraying Muslims stereotypically and prone to violence. Though the FBI did not publicly disclose the material it rescinded, Judicial Watch said that through a lawsuit for information, it found that removed material included references to the Muslim Brotherhood. Perry’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

House tax plan: Permanent tax cuts for the rich, eventually tax hikes for all middle-class families?
","U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore took to the House floor on Nov. 29, 2017, to criticize the House tax bill that Republicans hope will become law before the end of the year. The Milwaukee Democrat started with a sarcastic reference to a book authored by Donald Trump before he became president, saying: Mr. Speaker, I proudly present the ""art of the deal."" The tax deal before us would provide permanent tax cuts for individuals who are multi-millionaires and billionaires. With this deal, all middle-class families will eventually face a tax increase, since tax relief for them expires. We’ve rated as Half True a claim by the biggest backer of the House tax bill, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. We found that savings for some middle-class Wisconsin households would reach $2,000 in 2018 but would get smaller each year after that. So, what about Moore’s claim about the tax bill’s impact nationally? Would multimillionaires and billionaires get permanent tax cuts, while all middle-class families would initially see a tax cut, but later get a tax increase? The bill To support Moore’s claim, her office pointed us to a Washington Post Wonkblog analysis that summarized the House bill this way: Big businesses get a large, permanent tax cut, while American families receive only temporary tax relief that expires"" in 2023. The tax increase would mostly hit moderate and middle-income families because a credit designed to help them expires after five years. A $300-per-parent family credit that would be created with the House bill does expire in 2023. But the credit would be available to all families, not just the middle class, though arguably it means more to middle-class families than to higher-income ones. Let’s dig a little deeper. Here’s what we know from a PolitiFact National article and our own reporting. The rich: The House bill makes changes that benefit higher-income earners more than the middle class, even if there aren’t specifically provisions for millionaires or billionaires. Those include permanent reductions to the corporate income tax rate, a lower pass-through business income tax rate and repeal of the estate tax, which is only paid by the ultra wealthy. The net tax cuts going to the richest 1 percent increases from about 34 percent in 2019 to 47 percent in 2027 under the House bill, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. That’s partly because the tax cuts titled to the wealthiest are permanent. The middle class: The Tax Foundation found that, comparing the House bill to current law, the average taxpayer in the middle class would see an increase in their after-tax income -- that is, a tax cut -- in each year from 2018 through 2027. But just because the average taxpayer would get a cut doesn’t mean that all taxpayers would. The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center says that by 2027, roughly 25 to 30 percent of middle-class households would face a tax increase relative to current law. That’s because a family tax credit created by the bill would expire after 2022 and the because law uses a slower-growing measure of inflation for things such as the standard deduction, which has the effect of raising taxes over time. Two notes: While the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center are respected for their research, there isn’t a universal definition of ""middle class."" It’s not clear which provisions in the tax bill approved by the House will be in the final version of the legislation to be considered by both the House and the Senate. Our rating Moore says the House tax plan ""would provide permanent tax cuts for individuals who are multi-millionaires and billionaires,"" but ""all middle-class families will eventually face a tax increase, since tax relief for them expires."" The richest do benefit from tax cuts that are permanent, but most in the middle class also would see lower taxes each year from 2018 through 2027. It’s estimated that only 25 to 30 percent of middle-class households, not all of them, would see a tax increase by 2027. We rate Moore’s statement Half True.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC688600>],/factchecks/2017/dec/15/gwen-moore/house-tax-plan-permanent-tax-cuts-rich-eventually-/

Travis Allen’s Mostly False claim on the California gas tax
","Top Republicans in California have strongly opposed the state’s gas tax increase, saying it’s a costly burden on drivers. Orange County Assemblyman Travis Allen is a GOP candidate for governor and a leading critic of the 12 cent per gallon tax hike. He claimed in a June 15, 2017 article on the Repeal the Gas Tax campaign website that the increase does nothing to solve California’s notorious traffic woes: ""This new gas tax does not increase (road) capacity anywhere in the state. It will build no new lanes of freeways. If Californians didn’t like their traffic before, they’re going to like it even less when they’re stuck in the exact same traffic and paying more for their gas."" The repeal campaign, led by Allen, is one of two efforts to eliminate the tax increase. Other Republicans have made similar claims. ""Practically none of the new money raised by the gas tax will build new lanes,"" Assemblyman Chad Mayes said in November 2017. ""There was no clear creation of more capacity,"" said John Cox, a San Diego businessman who is also running for governor and leads the other repeal effort, speaking at a forum in December.  Both repeal campaigns are working to qualify their initiatives for the November 2018 ballot. Since Allen’s statement goes the furthest in claiming the tax increase builds no new lanes and won’t ease traffic, we decided to hit the gas on a fact check. Did he get his facts right? And did he accurately frame the goals of the tax increase?  File photo / Capital Public Radio A tax to build new roads or repair them?  The gas tax increase is a key part of The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017. It was signed by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown in April, with the goal of raising $52 billion over the next decade largely for road repairs. It passed the Legislature and with a Democratic majority and the help of one Republican state senator. From the start, supporters pitched the measure as way to address California’s massive road repair and maintenance backlog -- not to necessarily build bigger freeways as Allen and other Republicans have implied. Democratic Sen. Jim Beall of San Jose introduced the legislation in December 2016 saying in a news release: ""Without action soon, our crumbling roads will severely affect California’s economy,’’ while suggesting repairs could reduce commute times. Beall didn’t mention anything about expanding freeways. The package includes an initial 12 cent per gallon gasoline tax increase and a 20 cent per gallon diesel tax hike, both of which started on Nov. 1, 2017. It also includes a new ""transportation improvement fee"" ranging from $25 to $175 per year, depending on the value of one’s vehicle. We wrote this summer about how the law will affect the state's already high gas tax rate and gas prices. In common speech, some politicians simply call this whole package ""the gas tax."" Allen’s specific claims Given the repair goals of the legislation, Allen’s framing of the measure is misleading. But we also examined his specific assertions that it won’t build new road lanes or ease traffic gridlock. We found these are also problematic. The bulk of the new tax money, 65 percent, goes to repair projects. But 35 percent can be spent on ""expanded capacity,"" including highway and transit improvements, according to Mark Dinger, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation. The biggest pot of money for those projects is the $250 million that will be available each year to improve congested corridors across the state. Dinger said that money can be used to make freeways more efficient by improving ramp meters and adding real-time electronic message boards showing precise travel times. Efficiency measures alone, he said, can improve traffic flow by 25 percent. Dinger said the money can also pay for new freeway lanes, though he estimated those projects would not start until 2019 or 2020. State and regional agencies would need to submit applications for the money. Type of new lanes limited Here’s where Allen has a point: His spokeswoman pointed out that the congested corridor program can not fund general purpose freeway lanes, which are the main lanes used by most drivers. The legislation does, in fact, prohibit spending this money on those ""to mitigate increases in vehicle miles traveled, greenhouse gases, and air pollution,"" the text of the law reads. Still, the measure does allow for spending on new carpool and toll lanes, plus auxiliary lanes which can ease the flow of traffic at backed up freeway interchanges. The state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office found the tax measure also pays for new local roads. ""The funding package includes about $1.8 billion annually specifically for local streets and roads,"" the LAO reported in June 2017. It specified that about $100 million annually would be set aside for ""capacity expansion,"" primarily on local roads and streets, though some could be used for transit projects. Dinger said the tax measure, which also funds bicycle and pedestrian projects, reflects the state’s more holistic approach to solving traffic. ""Just adding lanes is simply not the way out of traffic congestion. That’s the old way of thinking in terms of transportation planning. You have to offer multi-modal choices and reduce people’s dependency on their cars,"" the Caltrans spokesman said. Our ruling Republican Assemblyman and candidate for governor Travis Allen claimed California’s gas tax increase won’t build new roads or freeway lanes nor will it ease traffic congestion. His statement distorts the goal of the gas tax increase. Its purpose was to tackle the state’s backlog of transportation repairs -- not to build bigger roads and highways. Allen also misses the mark on the details. It’s correct to say one of the measure’s big pots of money prohibits spending on general purpose freeway lanes. But it allows funding for freeway carpool and toll lanes along with efficiency projects that can ease up bottlenecks. Additionally, the measure sets aside $100 million annually for the expansion of local roads. Allen’s claim balances on a sliver of truth, but has a freeway full of problems. We rate it Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Several prominent Democrats are also competing in 2018 to succeed Jerry Brown as governor.

Infowars' Alex Jones wrong about Alabama Senate recount
","Infowars.com's Alex Jones suspects foul play in the recent Alabama Senate race. Democrat Doug Jones won in one of the safest of Republican states in the country, defeating Republican Roy Moore by 1.5 percentage points or about 20,000 votes. The next day, Alex Jones said his calculations told him Moore should have come out on top. Jones made much of a court ruling that allowed digital copies of paper ballots to be erased. ""Notice the Democrat judge said, ‘Oh, we’re going to erase all the computer files after tonight, on Wednesday morning,’ "" Jones said. ""So there’s going to be no recount."" Jones is wrong on his facts. The digital files he’s talking about might help spot problems in vote tallies, but they aren’t necessary for a recount. The reason is simple. Across the entire state of Alabama, voters vote on paper ballots. Those ballots are scanned and tallied, which creates the digital images Jones was talking about. But he overlooked that the original paper ballots are preserved. Alabama law is very specific on this point. ""The voted ballot containers and records of election containers shall remain sealed for the time provided by law,"" state law says. The time provided is nearly two years. If a recount is necessary (a recount is automatic if the margin is less than one-half of one percent of the vote), the ballot containers go to the inspector in charge of the recount. ""The recount shall consist of reading the ballots through the counter,"" the law says. ""Any ballot that was counted in the original election, but is rejected by the counter in the recount, shall be counted by hand."" Verified Voting, a national organization focused on promoting accurate vote tallies, said Alabama ""has the built-in, fail-safe resilience that paper ballots provide."" So without a shadow of a doubt, a recount in Alabama could be done. Jones is feeding off a legal move to preserve the digital image files that sprang up right before the election. A handful of people asked a judge to order the state to save the image files as a way to detect any election hacking that might take place. At first, a judge agreed, but that ruling was overturned in hours by the entire State Supreme Court. It's unclear why Jones spoke of a Democratic judge having made the decision. The state’s highest court has nine justices. All of them are Republican. We emailed Jones through the Infowars website and did not hear back. Jones said that a recount in the Alabama Senate election was not possible because a Democrat judge allowed the state to erase computer files. The one tidbit Jones got right is that a court ruling cleared the way for erasing digital images of ballots. In every other respect, he was wrong. It wasn’t one Democratic judge, but nine Republican ones that issued the ruling. A recount not only is possible without the image files, state law requires that a recount use the original paper ballots, which are kept in sealed containers for nearly two years. Jones took a bare scrap of data and turned it into the stuff of conspiracy. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7F1A40>],/factchecks/2017/dec/14/alex-jones/infowars-jones-wrong-about-alabama-recount/

New Jersey police chief said black people have 'no value' and that he'd like to be on firing squad
","A former New Jersey police chief made a series of alarming racist comments about African-Americans, according to an article on Facebook. ""New Jersey police chief says black people ‘have no value’ and should all be executed,"" stated a Nov. 2 headline by Truth Examiner, a clickbait liberal website that largely posts articles critical of Republicans, including President Donald Trump. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. But in this case, the information is based on actual federal criminal hate crime charge against Frank Nucera, Jr., a former police chief of Bordentown, a New Jersey township. The website attributes the information to CNN, which reported about the case against Nucera. Here’s a summary of the case, according to the federal criminal complaint filed Oct. 31. Nucera frequently used racial epithets against African-Americans and called for violence against them. In or about November 2015, when Nucera suspected that a previously arrested African- American individual had slashed the tires of a police vehicle, Nucera stated to a subordinate officer: ""I wish that n----- would come back from Trenton and give me a reason to put my hands on him, I'm tired of them. These n------ are like ISIS, they have no value. They should line them all up and mow them down. I'd like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I'm tired of it."" The incident that led to the charges occurred Sept. 1, 2016, when the Ramada Hotel called to report to police that two individuals had failed to pay for a hotel room the night before and had been swimming in the hotel pool that afternoon. The suspects, both African-Americans, were an 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old woman. The suspects resisted arrest, and one of the officers used pepper spray, but the suspects were ultimately subdued and handcuffed. While the male suspect was no longer resisting, Nucera grabbed his head and slammed it into a metal doorjamb. Nucera also used his arm to strike the suspect’s neck or head. Within hours of the alleged assault, a police officer recorded Nucera making racially hostile statements regarding the suspects and African-Americans in general. Nucera retired as chief shortly after the federal government informed the New Jersey attorney general of the pending investigation. Nucera appeared in court in November 2017. A federal grand jury indicted Nucera on Dec. 7 for allegedly violating a man’s civil rights by using excessive force during an arrest.  We contacted Nucera’s lawyer and did not get a reply. In a Dec. 22, 2016 interview with FBI agents, Nucera denied touching the male suspect, according to the indictment. The headline stated, ""New Jersey police chief says black people ‘have no value’ and should all be executed."" A federal criminal complaint states that Nucera expressed those opinions; the case is pending. Because there hasn't been a final determination made by a court, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9B09C0>],/factchecks/2017/dec/14/truth-examiner/new-jersey-police-chief-said-black-people-have-no-/

Jeb Bush touts education gains in 'Wall Street Journal' piece
","
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is taking to the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal to offer some unsolicited advice to the nation's new crop of governors.

Tend to the economy, he says, but don't ignore education.

In an opinion article published on Jan. 3, 2011, Bush wrote that states need to better hold teachers and students accountable, and discussed Florida's successes in implementing standardized testing and expanding school options for some students through voucher programs. Bush said the programs are showing results.

""In 1998, nearly half of Florida's fourth-graders were functionally illiterate,"" he wrote. ""Today, 72% of them can read.""

In this fact check, we're seeing whether Bush is right.

Bush made education issues a hallmark of his two terms as governor, and has continued to push education reforms since leaving office. He founded the Foundation for Florida's Future, an education think tank that supports increased school options for students through voucher programs and holding schools and teacher more responsible for student outcomes. The foundation was a vocal supporter of SB 6, the controversial ""teacher tenure"" bill that Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed in 2010.

Foundation spokeswoman Jaryn Emhoff said Bush's statistics come from the National Center for Education Statistics, a data-collecting arm of the U.S. Department of Education.

The center each year charts students' progress in different subject areas through a National Assessment of Educational Progress, which measures students periodically in mathematics, reading, science, writing, the arts, civics, economics, geography and U.S. history. Which students are tested and in what subject varies each year. 
Fourth-graders were tested in reading in 1998, like Bush said.

Their most recent test was in 2009.

The test groups students into one of four performance levels -- ""Advanced,"" ""Proficient,"" ""Basic"" or ""Below Basic.""

In 1998, Florida had one of the lowest average reading scores for fourth-graders in the country (Only Hawaii and the District of Columbia had scores that were significantly lower), according to the assessment.

Only 23 percent of students received scores that rated ""Proficient"" or ""Advanced,"" while 31 percent of test takers received a score on the test that rated ""Basic."" The rest of the test takers, 46 percent, received a score of ""Below Basic.""

Now contrast that with 2009. That year, only 27 percent of test takers received a score of ""Below Basic"" -- a 19 percentage point improvement. That means 73 percent scored ""Basic,"" ""Advanced"" or ""Proficient."" And the average test score in Florida in 2009 was among the top 10, according to the assessment. The average nationwide score also improved since 1998, but not as much.

Bush's numbers are backed up by education department statistics, but we also have to check his characterization that fourth-graders who receive a rating of ""Below Basic"" are ""functionally illiterate.""

What is ""functionally illiterate?""

This gets a little confusing -- whether you're literate or not.

First, there is no definition of ""Below Basic"" that accompanies the National Assessment of Education Progress. Instead, the assessment has definitions for only the other three ratings. See for yourself here.

Andrew J. Kolstad, a senior technical adviser for the assessment division at the National Center for Education Statistics, said the rating is simply meant to indicate that a tester is less than ""Basic.""

Here's an explanation of what a ""Basic"" rating means:
  
Kolstad said, for instance, that a student can be able to decode the words of a text, or ""read,"" but not be able to make obvious connections between the text and their own experiences. That wouldn't make them illiterate, Kolstad said, but would mean they receive a ""Below Basic"" rating on the assessment.

Emhoff, with Bush's foundation, said she believes that ""Below Basic"" is defined as functionally illiterate, while ""Basic"" is reading at grade level. And so on.

That leaves us with trying to define functionally illiterate, which isn't so easy either, especially for a fourth-grader. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines a functionally illiterate person as ""one who cannot engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective functioning of his group and community and also for enabling him to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his own and the community's development.""

That doesn't mean they can't read, necessarily.

Our ruling

All this may seem like semantics, but the definitions here are important.

Here's what Bush wrote: ""In 1998, nearly half of Florida's fourth-graders were functionally illiterate. Today, 72% of them can read."" The contrast here can be read to mean that nearly half of Florida's fourth-graders couldn't read in 1998, and now, 72 percent can read.

But that's not true.

Close to half of fourth-grade students in Florida failed to meet a ""Basic"" level of reading as defined by the federal government in 1998. In 2009, that number fell to 27 percent -- meaning 73 percent of test takers were able to make the ""Basic"" reading level.

Those are more complex definitions compared to being functionally illiterate and being able to read.

That said, Bush's column also makes the broader point that reading scores in Florida have improved dramatically since 1998. And there's no question about that. Florida has gone from almost the worst to one of the best.

In trying to boil down a complicated topic for a mainstream audience, Bush probably picked the wrong words. But his point is valid. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC809280>],/factchecks/2011/jan/03/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-touts-education-gains-wall-street-journal/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'Pat Toomey']","
Pat Toomey says U.S. has highest corporate tax rates in the world
","On the Jan. 2, 2011, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Sen.-elect Pat Toomey, R-Pa., cited a striking statistic in urging the United States to lower its corporate tax rates.

Asked by host David Gregory about possible areas where President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans can work together, Toomey suggested several areas, including taxes.

""I think tax policy is a possible area, one with plenty of landmines but plenty of opportunities,"" Toomey said. ""Simplify the code, lower rates. We should be lowering corporate tax rates because we have the highest in the world right now."" (Later in the roundtable discussion, Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter repeated the statistic, but we'll check Toomey's quote here.)

We wondered whether the U.S. really has the highest corporate tax rates in the world.

Using the most straightforward definition of ""corporate tax rates,"" Toomey is right. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, ranks the ""combined corporate income tax rate"" in its member nations. That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income, excluding taxes levied on specific products or services.

For 2010, the U.S ranks second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point -- 39.54 percent for Japan to 39.21 percent for the U.S. But that figure is already outdated: Japan has recently moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points, leaving the U.S. with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations.

But before we declare Toomey's statement True, let's dig a little deeper.

The OECD rate is the ""statutory"" rate -- that is, the top corporate tax rate on the books. But many companies pay considerably less than that, due to deductions and other exclusions. Adjusting for these factors produces a statistic called the ""effective tax rate.""

The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates. By this measurement, the U.S. rate is considerably lower than the published rate -- 27.6 percent. But in a comparative sense, that's still pretty high: Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand produced a higher effective rate in the World Bank study. And Japan's number should fall by the time next year's study comes out.

The World Bank also produces another -- and broader -- statistic. This measure factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses, including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer. When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest, the U.S. ranked 124th out of 183 -- meaning corporate taxes were relatively high. A number of other large and/or democratic countries were higher, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain and Sweden.

This last measure provides a wider snapshot of U.S. tax policy toward businesses, but it also introduces some complications. Factoring in the employer-paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes, while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code. So making apples-to-apples comparisons can be tricky.

There's also broader context that Toomey doesn't get into. In a previous item, we noted that when all taxes, including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes -- not just corporate taxes -- are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product, the U.S. doesn't rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden.

Still, if you rate Toomey on his specific wording by looking at ""corporate tax rates,"" he's right that the U.S. does now have the highest corporate tax rates on the books, at least among the biggest industrialized democracies, which is most economists' typical yardstick. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7E31C0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/03/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-says-us-has-highest-corporate-tax-rates/

U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore says her district is fourth poorest in the nation
","
Poverty seems to be as much a part of Milwaukee as wind chills in winter.

In 2009, the city’s poverty rate was fourth-highest among the nation’s big cities, according to census figures released in September 2010.

But in an interview published Dec. 15, 2010, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a four-term Democrat who represents the city, told a Milwaukee weekly newspaper she represents the fourth-poorest congressional district in the country.

Could that also be true?

Moore made the comment in response to a question from the Shepherd Express about whether there was a rift between congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama:

""I’m a congressional Democrat and I don’t have any rift with President Obama at all,"" Moore said. ""I think that he is operating in an entirely different arena than I’m dealing in. I represent my constituents in the Fourth Congressional District. I’m looking out admittedly for much more narrow interests. I represent the fourth-poorest district (in the nation).""

While the Fourth Congressional District encompasses Milwaukee, it also covers a middle-class swath of Milwaukee County that includes West Allis and Cudahy.

Is it really the fourth-poorest district in the nation?

Moore spokesman, David Frey, gave us two replies when we asked for evidence to back up Moore’s statement.

Initially, Frey said Moore based her comment on a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article about the census figures released in September. They showed 27 percent of Milwaukee residents lived below the federal poverty level in 2009.

The headline on that story called Milwaukee the nation’s fourth-poorest city. However, the first two paragraphs of the article, and a chart that appeared with it, made it clear Milwaukee was the fourth-poorest among big cities -- those with populations above 250,000.

Frey later said Moore misspoke in the Shepherd Express interview, and had meant to say she represents America’s fourth-poorest city, not its fourth-poorest congressional district. Frey said Moore has called Milwaukee the nation’s fourth-poorest city a number of times.

That explanation doesn’t quite stack up, either.

As noted, the city ranked fourth among large cities, behind Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo. Among all cities covered by the census data -- the comparison Frey said Moore was making -- Milwaukee ranked 46th in poverty.

As for the 2009 poverty rates among the nation’s 435 congressional districts, Moore’s Milwaukee-based district -- at 25.6 percent -- ranked 18th. The highest rate was 38 percent, in the New York City congressional district that includes the Bronx. That district is represented by Democrat Jose Serrano.

It’s daunting to describe how devastating poverty is in Milwaukee; this item is not aimed at downplaying the city’s ranking. But exaggerating it doesn’t help, either.

Milwaukee Ald. Michael Murphy recently claimed the income disparity between the city and suburban Mequon is the highest in the country; and former acting mayor Marvin Pratt, claimed that black male unemployment in Milwaukee is above 50 percent. We found both assertions False.

Moore also overstates the case.

Her spokesman said Moore meant to say Milwaukee is the nation’s fourth-poorest city, not that her district is the nation’s fourth-poorest congressional district. But even that ranking is correct only when considering the nation’s largest cities.

We rate Moore’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC887B00>],/factchecks/2011/jan/03/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-says-her-district-fourth-poorest/

Gov. Ted Strickland correct about improvements in Ohio's jobless numbers
","
Gov. Ted Strickland said he figures at some point over the next few years voters will compare his leadership with that of incoming governor John Kasich, once Kasich has spent some time in office.

""I don’t fear that comparison,"" Strickland said.

Why?

Because the Democratic leader insists that while he lost his bid for re-election in November to Kasich, he believes he has laid the foundation for Kasich to reap some success off of Strickland’s work.

Take for example, joblessness.

Kasich hammered Strickland during the campaign for the state’s double-digit, above-the-national-average unemployment rate. But in an exit interview with The Plain Dealer, Strickland said that his administration had begun to reverse that negative trend just in time for Kasich to now claim the credit.

""We are one of only two states to have eight consecutive months of declining unemployment,"" Strickland said in the interview on Dec. 20. ""Twenty-one states had increased unemployment last month. Ours went down.""

Politifact Ohio wanted to know if the outgoing governor had his facts right, particularly given how hard Kasich and the Republicans hammered him for the economy during the election.

As it turns out, the governor is right on both accounts, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the U.S. Department of Labor.

Ohio and Illinois are the only two states that have shown a drop in unemployment — typically by one-tenth of a percentage point, but a drop nonetheless — for every month from April through November. December figures are not yet available.

And, indeed, unemployment increased in 21 states in November compared to October, according to the labor statistics seasonally adjusted figures, further highlighting Ohio’s gains.

In fact, Ohio’s unemployment rate in November was 9.8 percent, drawing even with instead of hovering above the national average for the first time since December 2002, according Ohio Department of Job & Family Services Director Douglas Lumpkin.
  
The national average increased in November from 9.6 to 9.8 percent.

Five other states also have either shown a decline or stagnation since April from month to month but no increases in its unemployment rate: Michigan, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin.

But only Ohio and Illinois have produced consistent drops. Strickland said the lower unemployment figures mean more people are finding work, a testament to his leadership.

""Its not an accident,"" he told The Plain Dealer. ""It is because I and my administration have managed the affairs of this state carefully and conservatively.""

Only time will tell whether the trend continues. If it does, will Strickland get the credit for laying the foundation, as he says, or will Kasich get the political clout from an improving jobs picture in Ohio?

"['Georgia', 'Environment', 'DeKalb County']","
DeKalb ""greenest county in nation"" claim gets muddy
","
In metro Atlanta, the land of smog alerts and farmland-turned-to-suburbs, one local county makes a bold claim about its efforts to be environmentally conscious.

DeKalb County, its website says, is ""the greenest county in America.""

Let's put that on some recycled paper and send it to each of the county's estimated 750,000 residents.

DeKalb's communications director, Burke Brennan, sent PolitiFact Georgia an e-mail making the case for the county. It includes:
  

""In DeKalb County, we are taking the lead on sustainability ...  we are one step closer to being the greenest county in America,"" DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Burrell Ellis said in 2009 when the county was honored by the ARC.

Many folks we discussed this claim with used phrases like ""bold"" or ""ambitious"" to describe DeKalb's audacity, not willing to publicly dismiss it. Some were willing to criticize the claim.

""That's all a good case for them to be one of the greenest counties in Georgia,"" said Mark Woodall, Georgia chapter chairman of the Sierra Club, which claims to be the largest grassroots environmental organization in the state. ""DeKalb being the greenest county in America seems pretty unthinkable.""

Being ""green,"" means many things these days. Some organizations have occasionally released surveys rankings America's greenest cities, but we found few similar rankings of counties. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a non-profit organization that works to improve health and health care for Americans, earlier this year looked at the environmental health of each U.S. county. One category was physical health. The foundation used data put together by researchers from the EPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the physical health of each county. The criteria included how many days the air was unhealthy, the number of days the air was unhealthy due to ozone, access to healthy foods and how many liquor stores were in a county. DeKalb ranked near the bottom of Georgia counties, 153rd, in terms of physical health.

Some categories that DeKalb is bragging about are difficult to compare.

In other areas, such as the number of LEED-certified buildings, Dekalb has competition. Gwinnett had three LEED-certifiied structures, according to the U.S. Green Building Council. DeKalb is an Energy Star partner -- a federal effort to protect the environment through energy-efficient practices -- but so are Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta.

On hiking and biking trails, DeKalb may run into some argument about having the most in Georgia. Cobb County, for example, lists about 75 miles of trails within its cities and unincorporated areas.

It was suggested we look at Arlington County, Va. to find another county that could make a case it is greener than DeKalb. The county has a page on its website with more than a dozen awards and recognition for its sustainable community and environmental efforts. Arlington won two National Association of Counties Achievement Awards this year for its recycling efforts. That organization also named Arlington its Outstanding Civil Engineering Project award in 2006 for its Green Building Program.

Other counties, like Boulder, Colo., have goals such as reducing outdoor water use by 50 percent by using indigenous plants and recycling 50 percent of construction waste.

DeKalb's case was muddied in December when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fined $453,000 for 836 sewage spills over the last five years. The EPA estimates there are about 40,000 spills from the nation's 25,000 sewage systems a year. California officials reported about 2,000 spills into the San Francisco Bay in 2008.

Brennan noted the day after the fine was announced, county commissioners voted 6-1 to spend $1.345 billion to make repairs to its water and sewer system, nearly twice as much money as the EPA recommended. DeKalb taxpayers will pay higher water and sewer bills to help fund the work.

Despite the fine, Brennan stuck by DeKalb's claim.

""Nobody here is claiming perfection, but based on the programs, awards, designations and initiatives DeKalb has in place and ongoing, I am sticking with the motto 'DeKalb is the greenest county in America,' "" Brennan told us in an e-mail.

""After all, 'Cowboy Capital of the World' was already taken,"" added Brennan, referring to Oakdale, Calif.

DeKalb has certainly tried to make its mark as an environmentally conscious county. But DeKalb's claim of being the ""greenest county"" in the nation ignores critical facts that would give a visitor to its web site a different impression. We rate the county's claim as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBCDCC0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/03/dekalb-county/dekalb-greenest-county-nation-claim-gets-muddy/

Austin activist Dean Wright says Michael Williams has attended more than 150 tea party events
","
In a Nov. 30 article about the 2012 U.S. Senate race in Texas, a Capitol Hill newspaper quotes a conservative activist rating Texas Railroad Commissioner Michael Williams an early favorite of the tea party movement for the GOP nomination.

The Hill story further quotes Dean Wright of Austin saying that Williams has appeared at more than 150 tea party gatherings across Texas.

That's a whole lot of tea-sipping -- and a worthy claim to stir the Truth-O-Meter pot.

Right fast, we found ample evidence Williams has embraced the tea party movement.

In December 2009, The Weekly Standard noted that Williams had recently come to Washington to accept the endorsement of U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint's Senate Conservatives Fund. The magazine quoted DeMint telling reporters: ""Millions of people who've spoken out at town halls and tea parties .  .  . are looking for common sense mainstream leaders who believe in the principles of our Constitution. He's one of the most inspiring people I've heard talk about those principles in a long time.""

And in an April 2010 interview with Neil Cavuto of the Fox News Channel, Williams said he'd spoken at about a dozen tea party events, attended by as few as 100 and as many as 5,000 people. According to a transcript, Williams said, ""That energy, that fervor you see at the tea party movement, that fight for -- for constitutional limits on the national... government, all of that, I agree with. And, so, I would like to think that I was a tea party candidate.""

Williams added that he doesn't think most tea partiers are looking to create a third political party. ""But I think what they`re looking to is to inform the two dominant parties and to have us about be respectful of the notions of limited government, small government, controlling spending,"" Williams told Cavuto. ""And they want us to return to a constitutional form of government. They don`t want the national government reaching into what should be the responsibility of the states and local governments, and even the private and civic communities.""

A dozen events is a small fraction of 150, though.

We contacted Wright, founder and president of New Revolution Now, which describes itself as a party-agnostic organization created to harness the ""core conservative values of mainstream Americans to elect the state and U.S. congressional representatives who will return the country to its founding values of limited government, low taxation, states rights and constitutional constructionism."" Wright told us that he'd told The Hill that Williams had ""probably"" attended 150 tea party events, but he conceded that the real number was less than that. ""I'm just trying to get the point out that he's really engaging with the tea parties,"" Wright said. ""Just in the Central Texas region, I've been to five or six events where (Williams) has spoken at a tea party function.""

He suggested we check with Williams.

Done: Williams' campaign consultant, Corbin Casteel, told us that Williams' past stump schedules are incomplete due to a computer glitch, but those that remain indicate that Williams spoke at eight tea party events from April 2009 through June 2010. Casteel said Williams estimates he's attended eight to 10 more. The events reflected in Williams' records were in Travis County (April 15, 2009); Weatherford (July 4, 2009); Granbury (Aug. 29, 2009); Waco (Sept. 3, 2009); Collin County (Sept. 7); Rowlett (Sept. 12, 2009); Wichita Falls (April 15); and Bastrop County (June 26, 2010).

Finally, Williams told us in an interview he's been to 12 to 15 tea party events in Texas, and he expects more rallies to occur. ""I'll have to see if I still get invitations; it's their party,"" Williams said.

He said he was pleased by Wright's count. ""He thinks I'm spreading more than I am,"" Williams said.

The commissioner's got that right. We rate Wright's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFBA480>],/factchecks/2011/jan/03/dean-wright/austin-activist-says-michael-williams-has-attended/
"['Transportation', 'Virginia', 'William Howell']","
Speaker Bill Howell says proposed federal regulations would affect every street sign
","
The federal government wants to seize control of the street sign on your corner, warns William Howell, speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates.

""The Federal Highway Administration has a proposed new regulation that would unify every street sign in the country,"" Howell, R-Stafford, said during a Dec. 21 speech to Tertium Quids, a conservative Virginia group advocating small government.

""Every street sign -- Main Street, Elm Street -- would have to be the same size,"" Howell said. ""The initial letter could be capital, but all the others would have to be in lower case. The city of Milwaukee said, `To comply will cost us $2 million to put in new street signs.’""

In other words, all those signs that say ""BROAD STREET"" would have to be replaced with ones that say ""Broad Street.""

Howell brought up the signs to promote his pet cause: Passage of a U.S. constitutional amendment that would give states the collective right to repeal any law or regulation approved by the U.S. Congress. Under the proposed amendment, which Howell will ask the Virginia General Assembly to endorse this winter, a federal act would be nullified if two-thirds of the states passed resolutions demanding so.

""What business is it of the federal government what Milwaukee or Richmond...how they want to design their street signs?"" Howell said.

We wondered if the speaker had his facts right.

Howell, who has been trying to build national support for the repeal amendment, said he learned about the regulations from acquaintances.

We went to the Internet and found tons of information.

The Federal Highway Administration, in an effort that began during George W. Bush’s presidency, proposed new rules for street sign lettering in 2009. They were included in an 864-page volume of proposed and existing regulations for road signs, markings and traffic lights called the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

In addition to retiring signs posted in all caps, the regulations in 2012 would increase the mandated size of sign letters -- from the current four inches to six inches -- on roads with speed limits over 25 miles an hour. In 2018, new standards would require signs to be more reflective to enhance their night visibility.

The goal, according to the highway administration, is to improve traffic safety. Studies show it is harder to read all-cap signs, and those extra micro-seconds spent looking away from the road increase the odds of accidents, especially for older drivers.

Controversy over the regulations began this fall. The New York Post reported it will cost the Big Apple $27.6 million to replace signs. ABC News aired a national report saying it will cost Milwaukee $2 million to change its signs -- the same figure cited by Howell.

The Virginia Department of Transportation is studying the impact of proposed regulations and plans to issue a mid-year report.

In late November, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood opened a new round of public comment on the proposals and distanced himself from them. ""I believe that this regulation makes no sense,"" he said. ""It does not properly take into account the high costs that local governments would have to bear. States, cities and towns should not be required to spend money that they don’t have to replace perfectly good street signs.""

Let’s review.

Howell says proposed federal regulations would require all street signs to be the same size and use capital and lower-case letters.

He’s right about the letters, which is the seed of a growing controversy. He’s a bit wrong about the size. The regulations would not require all street signs to be the same size, although they do offer guidelines. But that doesn’t detract from his main point, that Washington is considering regulations affecting every street sign.

We find Howell’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE0B800>],/factchecks/2011/jan/01/william-howell/speaker-bill-howell-says-proposed-federal-regulati/

Veterans commission representative says one in three homeless men is a veteran
","
Times are especially tough for new veterans, a state official said in a Dec. 5 news article in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. 
Ericka Walmsley, a Texas Veterans Commission employment representative, is quoted saying: ""When their term is up and they get out, there’s almost nothing for them now."" One of three homeless men in the United States is a veteran, the newspaper quotes Walmsley saying. 
One in three? 
We asked Walmsley for background on that figure; she pointed us to a Web page kept by HelpUSA, a group that says its mission is to provide housing and the supportive services necessary for the homeless and people in need to become and remain self-reliant. The page has this statement: ""While the causes are many, the singular reality is staggering: 1 out of every 3 homeless men you see on the street is a veteran."" 
At the commission’s Austin headquarters, spokesman Duncan McGhee pointed us to a chapter in a report posted online by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development stating: ""Among homeless men, 33 percent report being veterans, and a very high proportion (98 percent) of homeless veterans are men."" 
Case closed? We weren’t sure, considering the posted chapter doesn’t indicate when or how that ratio was reached and the data appeared to have been collected in 1996. 
While seeking elaboration on the statistic from HUD, we ran the reported ratio by Neil Donovan, executive director of the Washington-based National Coalition for the Homeless, which describes itself as a national network of groups and individuals committed to ending homelessness. 
Donovan said the latest research indicates the share of homeless men who are veterans is not 1 in 3. HUD has completed an Annual Homeless Assessment Report since 2005; its latest rendition, issued in June 2010, says veterans accounted for 11 percent of the nation’s 1.2 million sheltered homeless adults in 2009 — or about 132,000 people — down from 13 percent in 2007. That percentage is derived from data collected on adults who used an emergency shelter or transitional housing program from October 2008 through September 2009. 
The report says too that a check of homeless, in shelters and not, on one night in January 2009 suggests that 13 percent were veterans, compared to 15 percent the three previous years. 
""Many veterans confront the same issues that lead others into homelessness, such (as) lack of affordable housing and inadequate income and savings,"" the report says. ""But they also have barriers that can be particularly acute among service-men and -women returning from active duty, such as the lingering effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse. These issues can make it difficult for veterans to find and maintain gainful employment, which in turn can make it difficult to pay for housing."" 
Veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts ""have not yet become homeless in great numbers,"" the report says, ""perhaps because it takes some years for the mental disabilities associated with war to become acute."" A forthcoming companion report focused on homeless veterans will provide a baseline understanding of homelessness among veterans, the report says. 
Separately, an online search led us to a Dec. 7 speech by Eric Shinseki, the U.S. secretary of veterans affairs, in which Shinseki estimates the number of homeless veterans at 107,000 — down, he said, from 131,000 two years earlier and 250,000 a decade ago. 
In his posted remarks, Shinseki says that when he became secretary in January 2009, he taught himself to say, ""Veterans lead the nation in homelessness, depression, substance abuse, and suicides. And they rank right up there in joblessness as well. It was a punch in the gut for me, and I repeated that line until it sunk in. I didn’t want to become inured to its impact by letting it become part of the day-to-day background noise."" 
Next, we heard from Brian Sullivan, a HUD public affairs officer, who said the 1-in-3 ratio is outdated; it comes from a 1999 report drawing on 1996 data that depended on a count of homeless men identified as veterans in 76 different communities, Sullivan said via e-mail. ""By today's data collection and reporting standards, it's not considered terribly relevant,"" his e-mail said. 
In an interview, Sullivan said the 1999 study was based on a one-day snapshot of the homeless and a smaller sample size than more recent HUD assessments. The latest HUD tally draws on data from more than 3,000 communities, tabulating the homeless on a single day and also counting those using emergency shelters or transitional housing programs during the year. 
Sullivan suggested we check for updated counts with Dennis Culhane, a University of Pennsylvania professor who helped lead the latest HUD assessment. Culhane replied by e-mail that he’s comfortable with the 13 percent figure. ""I cannot vouch for the (1-in-3) estimate and am not sure it was ever correct,"" Culhane wrote. 
When we queried Mary Cunningham, a researcher who specializes in homeless issues for the Washington-based Urban Institute, she said the 1-in-3 figure is outdated but added that all ""of these numbers should be treated as rough estimates. In general, it’s important to remember that there are far too many homeless who are veterans."" 
McGhee of the Texas commission pointed us to a March 2010 report by Project CHALENG, a federal effort to enhance the continuum of care for homeless veterans. The report says that homeless veterans are under-counted, but there also are fewer veterans, period. ""In 1990, there were 27.5 million veterans, a total that has decreased to 23 million today. Similarly, there has been a substantial reduction in the number of poor veterans, decreasing from 3 million in 1990 to 1.8 million in 2000. Since most homeless veterans are poor, it is believed that there has been a corresponding drop in the number of homeless veterans as well... it does appear that a significant, long-term reduction in the numbers of homeless veterans has occurred,"" the report says. 
We also reached Lawrence Cann of HelpUSA, whose Web page was the Texas commission employee’s source for the 1-in-3 figure. ""Given that many veterans do not report themselves as veterans or even seek services or shelters, we have not revised our 1-in-3 number,"" Cann’s e-mail says, though in response to our inquiry he said the group would add Web links to other sources for homeless counts. When we looked at the HelpUSA site again, the 1-in-3 reference had been changed to 1-in-4. 
McGhee stood by the 1-in-3 ratio. To shore up his position with more recent data, he led us to the 2010 strategic plan adopted by the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, which advises President Barack Obama and Congress on that issue. The plan terms the 107,000 count of homeless veterans nationwide (cited by Shinseki) ""a reasonable figure."" Using U.S. Census Bureau statistics to extrapolate the percentage of males among veterans (93 percent), McGhee comes up with a figure of 99,720 homeless male veterans — slightly more than one-third of the total number of adult homeless people calculated from the January 2009 one-night survey. 
Bottom line: Experts outside Texas agree the claim that one-third of homeless men are veterans is based on obsolete data, though some cautioned that it’s hard to pinpoint how many homeless men are veterans and one sorting of the data appears to justify the claim. We rate the statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBCD280>],/factchecks/2011/jan/01/texas-veterans-commission/veterans-commission-representative-says-one-three-/

Does Clackamas County plan to turn a $5 a year vehicle registration fee into a $40 fee in the future?
","
People opposed to the new $5 vehicle registration fee in Clackamas County are buzzing over an under-the-radar plan that would increase the fee to $40 to fund more than the Sellwood Bridge in a few years.

Lake Oswego City Councilwoman Mary Olson is one of them. In her testimony before the Clackamas County Board of Commissioners, she said: ""This is not about the Sellwood Bridge. This is about a new revenue stream for Clackamas County by means of what is essentially a new tax without a vote. There is a plan formulated by (County) Chair (Lynn) Peterson and the cities in Clackamas County to further increase this fee in three years and split it up on projects between the county and cities.""

The Clackamas County branch of the state Republican Party has also posted an opinion on its site warning against the fee: ""In an earlier meeting held on September 20th, 2010, between the cities and the county, it was stated that the Sellwood Bridge was only a part of the county’s vehicle registration fee plan, and that the fee could be as high as $40 per vehicle per year.""

PolitiFact Oregon hates when fees for one thing balloon into larger fees for other things. So we decided to check out the claim.

Olson points to a Sept. 20 meeting hosted by Clackamas County, where city and county bureaucrats were invited to start talking about transportation funding needs and the availability of a new county-only vehicle registration fee. Eugene Schoenheit was the only member of the public present.

But first we need to back up to 2009. That year the Oregon Legislature approved House Bill 2001 as a way to update Oregon’s highways and roads, including the Sellwood Bridge. The proposal included a provision allowing counties with more than 350,000 people -- that would be Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington counties -- to pass their own vehicle registration fees without a vote to pay for the bridge. The law also allows for those counties to implement another registration fee after July 2013 to pay for non-bridge projects.

Multnomah County drivers this year started paying an extra $19 a year, or $38 for the two-year period of a vehicle tag. On Dec. 9, Clackamas County commissioners approved a fee that is $5 a year, or $10 for the two-year period. A county press release stated the additional fee would start in 2012 and end as soon the county had collected $22 million for its share of the bridge. The funds would be used only for bridge work.

But what about a so-called plan to increase the registration fee and split the goods among cities and the county? Did people at the Sept. 20 meeting agree to such a thing more or less?

""Heavens to Betsy, no,"" said Ellen Rogalin, community relations specialist for Clackamas County transportation and development.

Tim Heider, spokesman for Clackamas County, added,  ""There is no plan. Its was just a discussion. It was a discussion about how to meet future transportation needs.""

About two dozen people attended the meeting, including the mayors of Molalla and Oregon City and the city managers of Canby, Happy Valley, Lake Oswego, Sandy, West Linn and Tualatin, according to a meeting summary provided by the county. The meeting was not advertised. Peterson welcomed people and led some of the discussion. ""It was an initial informational discussion among cities and the county on this new law,"" Rogalin said.

But there were specific questions, and general consensus on those specific questions that point to more than mere discussion of a new law: 
1. Do you have a way to pay for unmet transportation needs in your city? General consensus: No. 
2. Is there interest among the cities to have the Board of County Commissioners consider enactment of a vehicle registration fee as a source of revenue to address transportation needs? General consensus: Yes. 
3. If there is agreement  that a vehicle registration fee should be looked at, what are your thoughts about entering into a memorandum of understanding with the county to record this agreement? General consensus: Yes, jurisdictions would like to explore this further. 

Oh, and there was a handout charting how much money would be raised at $5, $10, $15, and so on, to $40 a year per vehicle. Sample memorandums were to be drafted and sent out by early November. No memorandums have been drafted and there is no date for a next meeting, Rogalin said.

Again, none of this adds up to a definitive plan. But it’s fair to say that there was a definite agenda and definite movement toward tackling new fees at this meeting.

The $10 two-year county bridge fee does not mean an automatic pass to ever-higher tag fees and a host of expensive new projects. According to state law, county commissioners would have to vote again on any vehicle fee increase after July 2013 for projects other than the Sellwood Bridge. While there isn’t ""a plan,"" there clearly is planning. We find the claim Half True.

U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith says border death toll is 28,000
","
Reacting to the fatal shooting of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Arizona, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith of San Antonio said in a Dec. 15 news release that Brian Terry's death ""is a sad reminder of the real-life dangers that Americans and our law enforcement agents face"" in the southwestern United States. 
""In the last five years, 28,000 people have been killed along the U.S.-Mexico border,"" said Smith, a Republican who is the incoming chairman of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee. 
That tally has been mentioned by Smith before. In an opinion column that his office distributed Dec. 9, Smith wrote: ""In the past five years, more than 28,000 people have been killed along the border because of drug-related violence."" 
Smith did not say that ""along the border"" meant the Mexican side. But Texas Gov. Rick Perry did when he wrote in an article on his campaign website Nov. 30 that ""the region of Mexico directly across the border from Texas has become one of the most dangerous places in the world, with more than 28,000 people killed since 2006."" 
Where did this oft-repeated stat originate? The Mexican government, according to an Aug. 3 Associated Press news story that Smith's office sent us. ""Mexico says more than 28,000 people have been killed in drug violence since President Felipe Calderón launched a crackdown against cartels in 2006,"" the AP reported. 
From a story CNN posted online the same day, we learned the number had been mentioned by Mexico's director of national intelligence during a summit hosted by Calderón. 
Soon after becoming president in December 2006, Calderón sent tens of thousands of soldiers and federal police to take on Mexico's drug organizations as they battle over territory and power, according to a New York Times Web page on ""Mexican Drug Trafficking."" Since then, drug-related violence has surged. 
While waiting for Mexican officials to respond to our inquiries about the 28,000 figure, we turned to the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute, which keeps tabs on the violence in Mexico. According to a January 2010 institute report, it's difficult to obtain definitive numbers on violence related to criminal activity by Mexican drug-trafficking groups. 
David Shirk, the institute's director, told us the Mexican government collects its data on drug-related violence from local prosecutors, who are asked to report any homicides associated with organized crime. Shirk said that the institute and others have requested access to the data but that Mexican officials have declined to release it. Regardless, Shirk said he knows Smith's statement that 28,000 people have been killed along the border is incorrect because that ""is the total number of homicides associated with organized crime in all of Mexico, according to figures released by the Mexican government."" 
Later, Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington, confirmed Shirk's assessment, telling us that all 28,000 deaths had not occurred in the border region. Alday did not offer further details. 
So, how many slayings did take place in border areas? 
Because the government won't share the bulk of its data on drug-related violence, the institute uses a different source for tracking the slayings: the Mexican media. Shirk and his colleagues analyze numbers from Reforma, a newspaper that keeps a running count of homicides related to drug trafficking broken down by state. 
The institute's January report says Reforma classifies killings as drug-related based on factors such as ""use of high-caliber and automatic weapons typical of organized crime groups""; ""execution-style and mass casualty shootings""; decapitation or dismemberment of corpses; markings or written messages on a body; and presence of large quantities of illicit drugs, cash or weapons. Shirk said killings of law enforcement personnel are included in Reforma's tally. 
According to the institute's data, there were about 25,000 drug-related killings in Mexico from 2007 through Dec. 17, 2010. Of those, about 45 percent occurred in the six states that border the United States: Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Sonora and Tamaulipas. 
Among all the states, Chihuahua, which the institute describes as home to the ""traditionally lucrative smuggling corridor of El Paso-Ciudad Juárez,"" had the most killings in the period, 6,966. Sinaloa, a Pacific coast state that does not border the United States, came in second, with 3,752 slayings. 
Those numbers from the institute cover drug-related homicides that have occurred since Calderón's crackdown began four years ago, the point at which the Mexican government starts its tally. In his statement, though, Smith specifies ""the last five years,"" which begins in late 2005, a year before Calderon took office. We wondered whether adding the 2006 deaths would bring the border-area toll closer to 28,000. 
Nope, according to the institute's information. The data for 2006 through Dec. 17, 2010 put the drug-related homicide total for the six Mexican border states at about 12,000; that's less than half of Smith's figure. 
For another estimate of deaths related to the drug war in Mexico, we turned to Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company that tracks the drug violence. According to a Stratfor chart, 27,240 people died in Mexico in drug-related killings from 2006 through Dec. 13, 2010. Scott Stewart, a Stratfor vice president, said the company does not break down its numbers by location. He also said that the company collects its information from a number of sources, which it declines to name. 
Meanwhile, as we researched the 28,000 figure, the Mexican attorney general, Arturo Chávez Chávez, announced an updated number of drug-related slayings in Mexico since Calderón's crackdown began. According to a Dec. 16 BBC news report sent to us by Smith's office, Chávez ""said 12,456 people had been registered killed in drug-related violence so far this year, compared to 9,600 in 2009, bringing the total to 30,196 since President Calderón took office in December 2006."" 
In a statement sent to us by e-mail, Smith cited the fresh number and pointed to a section of the BBC article that says ""most of the killings are concentrated in certain regions, particularly the northern border states."" 
""We should be concerned when drug-related violence takes the lives of more than 30,000 people in a neighboring country like Mexico, regardless of whether the killings are on the border or in the interior,"" Smith said. 
Then that's what Smith should have said in the first place. Instead, his statement that 28,000 people have been killed along the U.S.-Mexico border in the past five years fails a truth-test in a couple of ways. 
First, he misleads by failing to specify that all the deaths he is talking about were on the Mexican side of the border. Second, he claims the drug-related homicides took place in the border region, when the Mexican government says they occurred in other parts of the country as well. 
We rate Smith's statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCDF340>],/factchecks/2010/dec/31/lamar-smith/us-rep-lamar-smith-says-border-death-toll-28000/
"['Transportation', 'Virginia', 'Ward Armstrong']","
Del. Ward Armstrong does half-flip on borrowing for roads
","
Drive back with us to 2007 on the rickety road of state transportation plans.

We stop on April 4 when the General Assembly, after months of angry debate, passed a bill that empowered unelected authorities to impose regional taxes to build roads in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, established a $1,050 fine for going 20 miles over the speed limit, and authorized $3 billion in state borrowing to improve transportation.

The legislation passed the House 85-15. It was a delicate compromise between Democrats who insisted Virginia dedicate new revenues to transportation and Republicans who opposed any statewide tax increase.

Newly-installed Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry, was among a number of House Democrats who voted for the final bill. He had opposed earlier versions but voted ‘aye’ in the end  because he said the legislation was ""the best we could do given the political parameters we all face.""

""We felt we had to pass a transportation bill, and this was the only thing before us,"" Armstrong said.

Now, let’s inch forward on the road, carefully navigating two sink holes that all but destroyed the transportation plan. In January, 2008, public protests forced the General Assembly to rescind the $1,050 speeding tickets and a host of other steep driving penalties enacted the previous year. A month later, the state Supreme Court ruled the legislature cannot delegate taxing authority to unelected bodies, crashing hopes for road improvements in congested Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads.

We’re back, now, where we started. It’s December, 2010. The only tangible lane still open from the 2007 transportation bill is authorization for the state to borrow up to $3.18 billion over 10 years to improve roads. The loans would be paid back by earmarking a third of the state’s tax receipts on insurance premiums. That portion, which now comes to $132 million a year, was formerly used for general services such as education, health care and public safety.

Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, wants to compress the $3 billion borrowing period to as little as five years, saying transportation needs are urgent and interest rates are the lowest in decades.

Armstrong is strongly criticizing the proposal. ""A mere month after an election when the voters said we must stop deficit spending, Bob McDonnell has announced a multi-billion dollar deficit spending plan to fund transportation,"" Armstrong said in a Dec. 9 news release. ""...Unfortunately, the governor’s lack of leadership has resulted in a plan that amounts to a back door tax increase on our children.""

McDonnell’s office is accusing Armstrong of flip flopping, saying the Democrat doesn’t want to issue bonds to build roads that he ""voted for and applauded just three short years ago.""

""All that’s changed since then is the governor is now a Republican,"" the administration wrote in ""talking points"" distributed to GOP lawmakers earlier this month. ""...That’s just the definition of partisan politics and it would be laughable if it wasn’t so irresponsible.""

Armstrong, who is exploring a run for statewide office, has amped his rhetoric this year. But we have a hard time concluding he’s made a u-turn on borrowing to build roads. Although McDonnell is correct that Armstrong voted for the 2007 bill, it’s a stretch to say the minority leader ""applauded"" the bill.

This year as in 2007, Armstrong is saying the state should dedicate a new, reliable revenue stream to fund transportation but has stopped short of suggesting a specific source -- such as an increased gas tax.

As in 2007, Armstrong says he may wind up voting unenthusiastically for the borrowing plan. Here’s the hitch: The 2007  bill essentially limited the state to about $318 million a year in road borrowing over a decade; McDonnell would put the cap at about $618 million over five years.

Armstrong says he wants to make sure the source earmarked by the General Assembly in 2007 to repay the road bonds -- one-third of the state’s receipts on insurance tax premiums -- can cover the increased immediate debt costs that would come with McDonnell’s plan.

If it does, Armstrong said he could support the governor. If it doesn’t, Armstrong said he is concerned lawmakers will cover the increased borrowing cost by taking money from vital services.

But Armstrong voted to do just that when he supported the 2007 transportation bill that designated one-third of the tax receipts on insurance premiums to pay back the bonds. The legislation moved that money from the general fund -- used for education, public safety and health -- to a separate transportation budget. So we can’t say Armstrong has been consistent.

Nor can we say he’s flipped like a leaf in the wind. A check of 2007 newspaper stories showed Armstrong sounded the same alarm about ""raiding the general fund"" to pay for roads that he’s issuing today. And just like in 2007, Armstrong says he’s keeping his voting options open.

All things considered, we find it a Half Flip. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB25E00>],/factchecks/2010/dec/30/ward-armstrong/del-ward-armstrong-does-half-flip-borrowing-roads/
"['Social Security', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says employees in three counties left Social Security for alternate savings plans and are faring very well
","
Promoting his book, Texas Gov. Rick Perry bemoaned a failure  in Washington to confront Social Security's financial shakiness and praised three Texas counties that quit Social Security nearly 30 years ago. Perry said on CNN's Nov. 4 Parker Spitzer: ""Here's what I think would be a very wise thing. In 1981, Matagorda, Brazoria, and Galveston Counties all opted out of the Social Security program for their employees. Today, their program is very, very well-funded and there is no question about whether it’s going to be funded in"" years to come.

Perry said one option going forward would be to let states decide whether to stay in Social Security or take a different approach to retirement savings.

A reader asked us if Perry recapped the Texas experience correctly.

Last month, we rated False Perry's statement that Social Security, the federal program that provides old-age and disability payments, is a Ponzi scheme. The program may be fiscally shaky, but it's not a fraudulent criminal enterprise.

In Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, Perry prefaces a reference to the Texas counties by saying Americans would fare better if they had the choice of making contributions to a private investment plan rather than Social Security. ""Employees in those private plans, having exercised their liberty at Washington's sufferance, are reaping the benefits,"" Perry writes.

A footnote points to an April 2005 article on Galveston County's experiences published by a conservative think tank, the National Center for Policy Analysis. That article, co-authored by Ray Holbrook, a former Galveston County judge, says Galveston's county employees ""sought a secure, risk-free alternative to the Social Security system, and it has worked very well for nearly a quarter-century. Our retirees have prospered, and our working people have had the security of generous disability and accidental death benefits.""

According to the article, county employees committed to investing their payroll contributions in fixed-rate guaranteed annuities rather than fluctuating stocks, bonds or mutual funds. The result: Annual rates of return of 6.5 percent averaged over 24 years, the article says, plus substantially better benefits in three Social Security pay-out categories: retirement, survivorship and disability.

""To be sure, our plan wasn't perfect, and we have made some adjustments,"" the article says. ""For instance, a few of our retired county workers are critical of the plan today because they say they are making less money than they would have on Social Security. This is because our plan allowed workers to make 'hardship' withdrawals from the retirement plan during their working years. Some workers withdrew funds for current financial problems and consequently robbed their own future benefits. We closed that option (in January 2005).""

We learned from Rick Gornto, the certified financial planner who helped start and still oversees the alternate plans, that plan participants can take their accumulated earnings in a lump sum or in regular installments once they retire. ""They do have an opportunity to take it out and squander it,"" Gornto said, adding that the lump-sum option might be eliminated in the future. Gornto said the reason that hasn't happened yet is that the annuities began as a supplement to county employees' primary retirement program -- fixed payments through pension plans managed by the Texas County and District Retirement System, which is based in Austin. Perry didn't mention this plan in his book or on CNN.

Gornto said the safety net of the county and district retirement plan made it possible to design the alternate plan with its lump-sum feature. If the other pension plan wasn't in place, Gornto said, he probably would have proposed a plan without a lump-sum feature and offering regular post-retirement payments along with the leeway to invest earnings.

The 2005 article mentions 1999 reviews of the Galveston plan by the U.S. General Accounting Office and the Social Security Administration.

We turned to them next. Among points the agencies raised:

+Low-paid workers stood to get less in monthly retirement payments under the alternate plan than they would under Social Security. In response, the 2005 article says the studies assumed a low 4 percent return on the plans' annuities; actual returns have been substantially higher.

+Workers with higher earnings and fewer or no dependents who qualify for Social Security generally fare better under the Galveston plan, particularly in the near term, but workers with lower earnings and more dependents tend to receive more money under Social Security, the report says.

+Galveston's retirement funds are invested at the county's discretion and employees do not control investment decisions. During 1981-97, annual interest earned on the plan's fixed annuity contracts averaged an inflation-adjusted 4.62 percent. During the period, annual interest earned on Social Security's investments averaged 4.88 percent, the administration report says.

On the plus side, the GAO review notes: ""The alternate plans' benefits are fully funded, while Social Security's promised benefits cannot be met without increasing program revenues.""

Finally, we chased up-to-date information per the Texas plans' health.

The county treasurers for Brazoria and Matagorda counties, Amy Perez and Sharon Reynolds, respectively, told us their plans work well. Like a Galveston County official, Perez and Reynolds suggested we gather particulars from Gornto.

Gornto said in an interview that a key to the alternate plans' appeal is their guaranteed annual return, now at least 3.75 percent. He added that unlike Social Security, which needs changes to remain financially viable in the long term, the counties' plans don't confront a money-gone date: ""We don't have an 'out-year' question issue because people put their money in, they match it, and whatever it grows to is what they get.""

He said up-front contributions to the plans will remain stable so long as the counties don't go broke, while pay-outs to beneficiaries are certain unless the United States completely devalues its currency. ""The money will be there,"" Gornto said.

Gornto forwarded a summary of his firm's review of the Galveston County plan for October 2008 through September 2009. In an interview, he noted that by the end of that year, the plan had $54.1 million available to be paid employees in deferred (or retirement) compensation. Employees and the county combined pitched in about $6 million in payroll contributions through the year.

""The county has adopted this program to replace Social Security,"" Gornto said. ""Until they make a decision to disband the plan, it will always be there.""

For outside expertise, we talked to Keith Brainard, who's the research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. After reviewing the materials Gornto shared with us, Brainard explained that the alternate plan is a defined-contribution plan, similar to a 401k plan, in which benefits are determined solely based on contributions and investment earnings. ""By definition, the plan is always fully funded because the plan pays out only as much as it collects,"" Brainard said in an e-mail. 

That said, Brainard wrote, the plan lacks three features that are part of Social Security: a minimum benefit for lower-income workers; protection from inflation; and required annuitization, meaning that participants must receive at least some of their benefit as a lifetime income stream, rather than as a single lump-sum. On the other hand, he said, the long-term cost of the Texas plan is clear and certain. Also, unlike Social Security, plan participants own their retirement assets, rather than being entitled only to a monthly benefit for the remainder of their lives.

The basic difference between the Texas plan and Social Security, Brainard said, is that the Texas plan is a ""retirement savings plan that provides benefits based on contributions and investment performance, while Social Security is an insurance plan intended chiefly to prevent stark poverty in old age. Social Security promises a certain level of benefits based on salary and other factors, with a minimum benefit for lower-income workers and a maximum for higher-income workers. Both plans present relative advantages and disadvantages, and an argument could be made for providing elements of both plan types for all working Americans.""

And how does Perry's statement fare?

Far as we can tell, the alternate plans are healthy and should remain so. But the Texas plans serve employees also eligible, depending on years of service, for the Austin-based pension plan. Perry's larger point, that Americans stand to benefit from swapping out Social Security for alternate plans, doesn't acknowledge this pre-existing safety net in the Texas counties.

We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB5AC40>],/factchecks/2010/dec/29/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-employees-three-counties-left-soci/
"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Stimulus', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Bobby  Scott']","
Rep. Bobby Scott says tax deal costs same as health care reform, exceeds price of Stimulus and TARP
","
Rep. Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott was not among the members of Congress cheering the recent tax-cut deal.

Scott, D-3rd, vehemently opposed any extension of the Bush-era tax cuts. Congress passed a two-year extension of all of them.

In a statement, Scott said the tax deal will keep deficits high.

""However popular these tax cuts may be today, that popularity will pale in comparison to the anger at the deep cuts in popular programs we will need to make in order to pay for this bill,"" he wrote.

Scott added: ""This bill adds more than $800 billion to the deficit over two years -- more than the cost of TARP and more than the cost of the Recovery Act. It costs about the same over two years as the 10-year cost of the Health Care Reform bill, which we paid for.""

That’s a lot to tackle, but we’re up to it.

First, is the $800 billion for the tax cuts continuation correct?

Yup, the Congressional Budget Office score of the tax compromise for just the next two years -- 2011 and 2012 -- is $797 billion.

""The 10-year cost is a bit higher due to some residual effects even though the compromise itself only lasts for two years,"" notes Nick Kasprak, an analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.

Next, let’s check TARP, or the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It passed under President George W. Bush in 2008 to address the subprime mortgage crisis.

Scott’s OK there, too. TARP authorized $700 billion in spending, much of which has been paid back. The Treasury now estimatesthat the true cost (minus what’s paid back) will be about $30 billion.

Next up, The Recovery Act, also known as The Stimulus. Here’s where Scott runs into a bit of trouble.

The most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate of the Stimulus bill’s 10-year cost is $814 billion. That’s $17 billion more than the estimated cost of the tax compromise.

Given that the new estimate was just released last month, perhaps Scott’s was relying on an older projection. The original Congressional Budget Office estimate was $787 billion, $10 billion less than the two-year tax cuts estimate.

Let’s move to health care reform.

Turning back to the CBO, the health care bill is projected to cost $788 billion over 10 years.

As Kasprak notes, that is, in theory, to be paid for with $931 billion in increased revenue, for a net deficit reduction of $143 billion.

""There are lots of assumptions and simplifications that go into a ten year score, and there is by no means universal agreement that the bill would actually reduce the deficit. But that is the official score,"" Kasprak said.

Regardless, Scott’s more than safe on the cost alone.

So, let’s review.

Scott’s said the tax compromise will cost more than TARP, more than the Stimulus and about the same as close to the 10-year cost of the Health Care Reform bill.  

He’s right on TARP, right on health care reform, and off by a tad on the Stimulus -- perhaps because the cost estimate of the act recently changed.

We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8F3840>],/factchecks/2010/dec/27/bobby-scott/rep-bobby-scott-says-tax-deal-costs-same-health-ca/
"['Education', 'Texas', 'Mike Villarreal']","
Rep. Mike Villarreal says that Texas students may have a teacher who has never practiced teaching
","
In the flurry to pre-file legislation before the Texas legislative session starts in January, state Rep. Mike Villarreal, D-San Antonio, announced a proposal he said ""would end the practice of Texas schools hiring full-time teachers with no classroom teaching experience.""

""Parents are shocked when I tell them that their children may have a teacher who never spent one minute practicing teaching but is now responsible for educating a classroom full of kids,"" Villarreal said in a Nov. 30 press release. ""If we are serious about improving education, we need to listen to the research about the importance of student teaching. We shouldn't hand the classroom over to a teacher who has never stood in front of a class and taught a lesson.""

Any questions? We decided to check how much practical experience is required of newly-minted Texas schoolteachers.

On its website, the State Board for Educator Certification lists the basic requirements for becoming a Texas teacher: a bachelor's degree, teacher training through an approved program (universities and ""other entities"" such as for-profit programs) and completion of state teacher certification tests. Texas has 177 teacher preparation programs, run by providers including universities, school districts and for-profit companies, according to a November 2009 Houston Chronicle news story.

Traditional university programs include a student-teaching component prior to graduation. For aspiring teachers who already have a college degree, SBEC suggests ""alternative certification and post-baccalaureate programs."" According to the website, ""many of these programs can be completed in a year, during which time you may have a paid teaching position in a public school classroom.""

According to the Texas Education Agency, 7,500 new teachers during the 2010 academic school year were certified through university programs, and 11,567 were certified via alternative programs.

Asked to back up Villarreal's statement, Peter Clark, his legislative director, pointed to those teachers who are in alternative programs. ""They do not receive their full certification until the end of that first year teaching,"" he said in an e-mail. ""But during that full school year they are the teacher of record responsible for a classroom, and they may have started that year without ever standing in front of a classroom of students and delivering a lesson plan.""

According to state law, teacher candidates who serve a year-long internship have a ""probationary certificate"" until they complete the year, but during that time they're classified as a ""teacher"" on school campuses.

Does that mean they haven't had any teaching practice before entering the classroom?

Karen Loonam, a TEA deputy associate commissioner, told us that it ""is possible"" for someone to start teaching without any practice teaching ""but highly unlikely since our rules require 30 clock-hours of field experience in the classroom and 80 hours of training prior to entering the classroom."" According to state law, 15 of those 30 hours of field experience must be spent performing ""professional educator activities"" while interacting with students, teachers and faculty in a school setting ""that is part of regular classroom instruction.""

According to Villarreal's press release, his legislation ""would require a teacher candidate to undertake 15 hours of practice teaching to become full-time teachers... this legislation would ensure that the 15 hours on campus are spent delivering lesson plans rather than merely observing, assisting with administrative functions or attending school events.""

In an interview, Janice Lopez, the education agency's director of educator standards, told us the law doesn't require that those 15 hours in the classroom are spent teaching. ""We require that they go through training and hopefully that training is interactive — interacting with students while observing a certified teacher,"" Lopez said.

Loonam told us that usually the field experience is ""a combination of activities for an individual to see the realities of the complex job of teaching — how does the teacher develop lesson plans... observing students... classroom management. We've tried to put in our rules some requirements to help these people get prepared before entering the classroom,"" she said.

Loonam also told us that school districts' ""late hires"" may start teaching in the classroom without having those 15 classroom hours.

""If a principal finds out on a Thursday — and school's going to start Monday — that she just lost a teacher for whatever reason, she needs to find someone to fill that vacancy,"" she said. If there's a teacher shortage in that particular district, the district may hire a prospective teacher who knows about the subject to be taught but doesn't have the required training. The new teacher is then assigned a certified teacher as a mentor and completes training throughout the school year.

Ed Fuller, a researcher for the University Council for Educational Administration, an interstate consortium of higher-ed institutions, called the Texas education code's practice-teaching requirement ""vague.""

""Teachers are not, in fact, required to complete any practice teaching or student teaching before becoming a teacher of record"" — a teacher who has sole responsibility for a class, he said. Fuller said teachers without any experience come largely from alternative certification programs that don't offer student-teaching training.

But according to Vernon Reaser, who heads an alternative teacher-certification program based in Houston, the alternate route is more demanding than the single semester of student-teaching required by university programs. Alternate-route teacher candidates must first complete a year of professional teaching — the internship — as a real teacher before the principal decides whether the teacher should be certified, said Reaser, president of A+ Texas Teachers. He told us most prospective teachers who are certified through the program do practice teach, ""and those that don't will get it anyway in the first few months.

""This is the person's career, not just a temporary assignment like student teaching is,"" he said. ""They have to perform well that year just like every other teacher does in order to keep their job.""

We also consulted Pamela Hall, a personnel administrator for the Austin Independent School District, who told us the district rarely hires individuals without teaching experience, but when it does, it's through the state's alternate certification programs. Such teachers are on probation for their first year, she said.

Debbie Ratcliffe, a TEA spokeswoman, told us the agency does not keep information on how many individuals never taught before becoming classroom teachers. She said that information is kept by each certification program.

Time to grade Villarreal's statement.

We did not find a precise count of teachers in Austin or Texas public schools who started without teaching practice, though, significantly, it's undisputed that schools can — and do — hire teachers lacking even a minute of experience teaching a class.

"['Rhode Island', 'Civil Rights', 'LGBTQ', 'Marriage', 'Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci']","
Cianci says polls support the idea that more than 80 percent of Rhode Island voters want to make the decision whether to approve same-sex marriage
","
The question of whether same-sex marriage should be legal in Rhode Island could be answered in the coming year. There's growing support in the General Assembly to passing it and Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee has vowed to support it.

One group opposed to gay marriage, the National Organization for Marriage -- Rhode Island (NOM-RI), however, has been advocating for a binding referendum on the matter instead of a legislative vote, arguing that polls prove the people want the right to make the decision.

Talk-radio host and former Providence Mayor Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci repeatedly cited the 80-percent figure during the Dec. 12, 2010, ""6 News On The Record"" program on WLNE-TV.

""One of the things I do know from seeing polls that I see every day is that over 80 percent of the people want the shot to vote for it,"" he said.

""The polls that I've seen show that 80 percent of Rhode Islanders want the opportunity to vote,"" he said at another point in the program. ""I'm not saying that they're against gay marriage or same-sex marriage, but they say they want the opportunity to vote on it.""

We were curious about whether public sentiment was that strong against having the legislature and the governor decide the question.

It turns out that the polls in question were commissioned by NOM-RI, the group opposing same-sex marriage. Christopher C. Plante, the group's executive director, said there were three surveys done by Quest Research, which is based in Rhode Island.

Here at PolitiFact, we know that opinion polls can be tricky things. The answers you get often depend on the precise wording of the question and, in some cases, the questions or comments leading up to the question.

""When any interest group puts forward a poll, one has to be careful in judging the results because the question's wording may reflect the axe they want to grind,"" said John Geer, professor of political science at Vanderbilt University and author of ""From Tea Leaves to Opinion Polls.""

So we wanted to see the full poll questions and responses. We found a report on a June 2009 poll on the NOM-RI website. Plante sent us the questions and answers from of the group's December 2009 survey. The group also did a poll in August 2010, but Plante declined to release those results. However, one question from that 2010 survey does appear on a NOM-RI web page. All three polls surveyed about 400 people and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percent.

The question that directly addressed the issue was asked in both 2009 polls. It mentions that some people want to legalize gay marriage and asks whether this issue ""should be decided by a vote of the Legislature or should it be decided by voters in a statewide election?"" In June of that year, 74 percent said it should be the people. By December that percentage had jumped to 80.

The rate of support was even higher -- 82 percent in June and 84 percent in December -- when the question was worded this way: ""Voters in thirty states in America have had the opportunity to decide whether gay marriage would be legalized in their state. Do you think Rhode Island voters should also have an opportunity to vote on this issue?""

The two independent polling experts we consulted said the reference to those 30 other states made this a loaded question because it encourages Rhode Islanders to follow the trend.

""That's totally loading it. That's a classic example of generating a higher number,"" Geer said.

The phrasing added 10 percentage points to the let-the-people-decide category when the question was asked in the June survey; 2 points in December.

The only question released by NOM-RI in its August 2010 poll, which also shows strong support for letting the people decide, asked likely voters whether they agreed or disagreed with this statement: ""The people of Rhode Island themselves should decide the question of marriage, not judges or backroom politicians.""

The reference to ""backroom politicians"" (as opposed to ""frontroom politicians""?) ""is clearly a negative cue in the question. That's clearly designed to elicit a particular response,"" said James Henson, co-director, University of Texas / Texas Tribune Poll.

For that question, 77 percent ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" agreed.

""I suspect the 'backroom politician' phrase is getting the 'strongly agree' to go up quite substantially,"" said Geer.

Although NOM-RI cites Quest as the polling organization, Victor Profughi of Quest said he did not design the questions in all the polls, particularly the survey that used the ""backroom politicians"" phrase.

""The last questionnaire I didn't even see until we went into the field,"" he  said. ""My agreement with them was to draw the sample, make sure the survey itself was professionally undertaken and then I wrote a report based on the data, which I gave to them.""

Despite some biased questions, the two independent pollsters we consulted said the 80 percent figure is probably close to the truth, judging from the responses when the query was unbiased query. (We also asked Cianci to weigh in on this, but he didn't respond to our e-mail.)

""The numbers are overwhelming that the public wants to make that choice,"" said Geer. ""Questionable wording can bias a poll when people don't have a lot of information and don't have any strong set of prior opinions about a topic.""

Because a lot of people have a strong opinions on gay marriage, ""you probably can't move the numbers very much,"" he said.

But there's another phenomenon at work here, Geer and Henson said.

When asked, voters ALWAYS want to be the ones to decide hot-button issues.

""Of course they're going to say yes,"" said Geer. ""If you ask parents whether they or teachers should make decisions about their child, of course everybody's going to say themselves. So the numbers [in the NOM-RI poll] are hardly surprising.""

What's more revealing is how voters answered some of the other questions in the two 2009 surveys that NOM-RI made available.

From June to December, support for same-sex marriage seemed to rise significantly, going from 36 percent in June to 43 percent in December.

That December, only 32 percent said they opposed gay marriage, yet 44 percent expressed support for an anti-gay marriage proposal declaring that ""Only marriage between a man and a woman will be valid or recognized in Rhode Island.""

Again, it's all about how you word the question.

""If you ask people across the country, 'Do you think marriage should be an institution between a man and a woman,' you'd probably get 75 percent of the people saying yes. But if you say, 'Should we deny gay couples the opportunities afforded other couples,' then all of a sudden there's a lot more support for gay rights,"" said Geer.

In the end, none of the questions we saw directly ask Rhode Islanders whether they want the General Assembly to stay out of the same-sex marriage issue.

But it appears that, when the question is posed in a neutral way, a hefty majority wants voters to determine the issue.

Cianci didn't mention that support for a referendum on same-sex marriage fell below 80 percent in some polls. Nor did he mention that the polling was being done by a special interest group. And we believe the former mayor -- who eats, drinks and breathes politics, and currently serves as a political consultant for Channel 6 -- knows loaded questions when he sees them.

Those are important elements for people to know. Yet Cianci simply kept repeating the 80 percent figure as it were a consistent, reliable number.

Because of that omission, the Truth-O-Meter drops a notch and we'll rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E9BF4F80>],/factchecks/2010/dec/26/vincent-buddy-cianci/cianci-says-polls-support-idea-more-80-percent-rho/

Sen. John Cornyn says 49 states have a balanced budget amendment in their state constitutions
","
Advocating for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would require Congress to balance the budget, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, calls the proposal a ""good idea, but certainly not a new one.""

""All but one of the 50 states already have some form of a balanced budget amendment in their state constitutions,"" he said in an op-ed published in The Dallas Morning News on Dec. 1. ""We can draw from the experience of the states in drafting an amendment appropriate for the federal government.""

Forty-nine out of 50? 
Cornyn spokeswoman Jessica Sandlin pointed us to a report by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), a bipartisan organization that advocates for the interests of state governments before Congress and federal agencies.

Sandlin also pointed out a flaw in the senator's statement: ""Upon further review, it would seem you might have us on a technicality on this one. While it is true that 49 states are required to have balanced budgets, four of them are required by statute, not a Constitutional amendment.""

She said that they ""stand by the spirit of the statement"" but that ""an important clarifying clause"" was cut during editing. The line should have been: ""All but one of the 50 states have some form of a balanced budget amendment in their state constitutions or state statutes,"" she said in an e-mail.

According to an October NCSL report on states' balanced-budget provisions, the group ""has traditionally reported that 49 states must balance their budgets, with Vermont being the exception.""

An appendix in the report lists 45 states, including Texas, with a constitutional citation concerning a balanced budget requirement, and four states that have a statutory requirement. Vermont is the only state with neither. The information comes from the legislative fiscal staff in each state, said Ron Snell, director of state services at NCSL.

But it's not that simple, Snell said, who noted that Cornyn incorrectly called all the state constitutional citations ""amendments."" According to the appendix, only two states have constitutional amendments dealing with balanced budgets, which means the provisions were added to their original constitutions. For the remaining 43, the provisions have always been part of their constitutions.

More substantively, the report notes that there's no consensus on which states have or do not have balanced-budget laws. That is, not every state has an explicit requirement that state expenditures not exceed projected revenue. The report names Wyoming, North Dakota and Alaska as states whose balanced-budget requirements are debated.

""In some states that lack explicit language requiring a balanced budget, a generally observed practice of doing so is based on a limitation of state debt, interpretation of other statues or traditional practice,"" the report says. The report adds that ""two points can be made with certainty. Most states have formal balanced-budget requirements with some degree of stringency, and state political cultures reinforce the requirements.""

The report also shows a tabulation of states' balanced-budget provisions kept by the National Association of State Budget Officers that takes a narrower view of which states require a balanced budget.

According to the NCSL report, the association surveyed balanced-budget requirements in 2008, tallying which states require the governor to submit a balanced budget (43 total) and which require the legislature to pass a balanced budget (40). Thirty-eight states prohibit carrying deficits from one year to the next. We found 41 states have constitutional provisions requiring the governor to submit a balanced budget or the legislature to pass one, and five states that have a statutory requirement.

So that's 46 states, by the National Association of State Budget Officers' count, that have balanced budget requirements as a matter of law. However, as Snell said, ""it's almost impossible to say"" for how many states the balanced budget mandate is ""an absolutely binding requirement.""

Where does that leave us?

Only two states — not 49, as Cornyn says — have amended their constitutions to require balanced budgets. Counting amendments plus provisions tucked into original constitutions, however, 45 states have balanced-budget stipulations, according to NCSL's count. NASBO considers 46 states to have constitutional or statutory balanced-budget requirements.

Also, despite the letters of those statutory and constitutional strictures, they aren't universally viewed as mandatory.

"['Oregon', 'Education', 'Rees Lloyd']","
Portland Public Schools invites all adults for a cheap $1.75 breakfast?
","
Making the rounds on the World Wide Web is this entry from Rees Lloyd, an attorney who contributes to the blog of talk-radio host Victoria Taft. Lloyd is livid that West Sylvan Middle School (Portland Public Schools) is advertising low-cost breakfasts for students ($1) and adults ($1.75) regardless of their ability to pay. Students eligible for free or reduced-price meals don’t pay anything for breakfast.

In his post, Lloyd says he’s OK with offering free or reduced-price meals to genuinely poor students. But he’s not OK extending meals to everyone else within walking distance of the school.

""It is quite another thing, and a wrongful thing, to invite well-paid, well-fed school bureaucrats, administrators, teachers, other staff, non-needy students, affluent parents of students, and other adults, including on the other extreme the adult homeless, illegal aliens, fanatical Muslim terrorists, or drug addicted street people, to enjoy cheap breakfasts in taxpayer-paid school facilities amidst school children.""

Wow. That’s quite a range of adults eating for cheap on the taxpayer dime. We asked Portland Public Schools to explain, one, whether Lloyd had his facts correct, and two, if so, more about the program.

Matt Shelby, spokesman for the school district, confirms that a Dec. 9 school e-mail re-posted on Taft’s blog is correct. In it, district nutrition services program manager Kristin Palmer reminds ""West Sylvan parents and staff"" that hot and cold breakfasts start up again in the new year.

The memo reads: ""Breakfast is only $1.00 for students, $1.75 for adults and free for all students on reduced or free priced meals. Your breakfast will meet ¼ of the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for children for many vitamins and nutrients and will include a juice, milk and entree, so come hungry! Please remember you can put money on your child’s account at mylunchmoney.com or bring a check or cash to the cafeteria.""

Clearly, the breakfast offer is not intended for the general public, which means no drug addicts, homeless or suspected terrorists, domestic or otherwise, get to mingle with the kids unless they happen to be staff or parents at the well-to-do school.

Adults unaffiliated with the school need to sign in to get on campus, so the idea of an undocumented worker dropping ""in at West Sylvan School for a $1.75 breakfast on their way to a job ‘Americans don’t want’"" is pretty far-fetched (contrary to Lloyd’s musings). Strike this part as a Pants on Fire claim.

(By the way, Lloyd doesn’t buy it. He interprets the e-mail as a more sweeping invitation, despite it being addressed to ""West Sylvan parents and staff."" ""That’s what makes it so stupid, inviting adults to come in for $1.75. It’s without limitation and they know damn well we don’t want people walking into schools, what in the hell are they thinking? If they’re not inviting everyone in there, they should know how to say so."")

But what about the broader gripe behind Lloyd’s post? Are taxpayers being cheated because schools such as West Sylvan offer high-quality, low-cost breakfasts to children and adults who can afford to eat at home?

A bit of history first. Like the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program is housed under the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Shelby says the USDA reimburses the district $1.76 for every free breakfast, $1.46 for every reduced-price breakfast and 26 cents for every fully paid breakfast. The district is not reimbursed for adult meals, which is why adults pay $1.75 to cover the cost of labor and food. The total districtwide budget for school lunches and breakfasts is $17.5 million, sustained by sales of meals to students and reimbursements from the federal government.

Which gets us back to Sylvan, where adults pay $1.75 for a meal; the 8.3 percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals pay nothing; and the rest of students pay $1 for breakfast.  

First, the adults. Only two adults have eaten breakfast at Sylvan since the school year started in September. Of 623,563 breakfasts served this year districtwide, 1,783 have gone to adults. That’s 0.3 percent of meals. In other words, not a lot of adults eat a low-cost breakfast at school.

Now what about the kids? In 46 school days, West Sylvan has served 2,949 breakfasts to students. Of those, the bulk -- 2,276 -- went to children who paid $1 for every meal.

So why does Portland Public Schools subsidize meals for children and provide meals to adults who clearly can afford to pay more? The answer given by the district is that it’s more cost-effective in the end to sell more meals, since there is a minimum anyway for labor and supplies. ""You’re still going to have a staff member there administering meals to students,"" Shelby said. ""Three meals or 30, it takes at least one staff member to do it.""

There are other reasons for offering breakfast at school. Sometimes kids don’t want to eat first thing in the morning. Or they don’t have time to eat. Sometimes, they don’t have food to eat at home. School districts and educational experts argue that breakfast helps students to concentrate.

Lloyd is wise to question government use of taxpayer money. But the claim that breakfast is truly open to anyone and everyone is Barely True. Only students and adults allowed on campus can partake of school breakfasts.
