Wall Street businesses have returned money to Ohio, but Richard Cordray overstates the total
","
It’s good politics to present yourself as fighting for the little guy against the corrupt corporate behemoths of Wall Street.

Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray is doing just that, using Wall Street as a punching bag. He has made his fight against financial businesses—or ""holding Wall Street accountable"" in his words — a central theme of his 2010 campaign.

On Cordray’s campaign website, the Democrat trumpets the ""major cases"" against ""the big Wall Street banks and financial institutions"" that have ""caused widespread financial damage to Ohioans.""

Cordray’s most eye-popping claim of reining in fat cat financiers is that ""his office has already recovered over $2 billion from Wall Street for the workers, retirees, and investors who were harmed.""

That’s a mountain of money — and the kind of thing we at PolitiFact like to check out.

Cordray reaches his ""recovered over $2 billion"" figure by totaling the settlements relating to lawsuits against UnitedHealth ($922 million), Merrill Lynch ($475 million), Marsh & McLennan Cos. ($400 million) and secondary defendants in a case against AIG ($284.5 million). Do the math and you get a tad over $2 billion — $2,081,500,000 if you want to get specific.  

Because Cordray has only been in office since January 2009, his claim to have ""recovered"" $97.5 million from accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the secondary defendants in the AIG case, is on the shakiest ground. That’s because the settlement was reached on Oct. 3, 2008, when the Ohio Attorney General was Nancy Rogers. She even sent out a news release praising the settlement.

Cordray’s campaign argues that it still should count because the primary case against AIG was still being litigated -- his office on July 16 announced a final, $725 million settlement in the case -- and there is a contested appeal that could affect the PricewaterhouseCoopers settlement. Frankly, we aren’t convinced, and drop Cordray’s total from just above $2 billion to just below $2 billion for adding in that settlement.

However, that isn’t the only quibble we have with Corday’s $2 billion figure. A more basic question is what exactly does ""Wall Street"" mean?

We thought of traders on the crowded floors of stock exchanges and the famous statue of the Merrill Lynch bull in lower Manhattan.

Cordray’s campaign says they used a broad definition that includes ""any publicly traded companies that negatively affected the value of their stock"" and harmed Ohio workers, retirees and investors.

That somewhat elastic definition can be stretched so that Wall Street includes UnitedHealth, a health care giant whose main corporate offices are in Minneapolis — a 20-hour drive from New York’s Wall Street financial district.

We think that a reasonable person would find that more than a bit of stretch to say that a health care company based more than 1,200 miles from Manhattan is a ""Wall Street"" company. Put another way: What would you say to a friend who claimed to work on Wall Street, if they were employed by United Health in Minneapolis?

Beyond just the location and United Health’s industry, Cordray’s use of the $922 million settlement for UnitedHealth has another issue — the $922 million isn’t money that United Health executives forked over to the state of Ohio. Instead, it’s $804 million worth of improperly granted stock options to corporate executives at United Health Care that were canceled as part of the settlement, as well as $126 million from pulled back cash bonuses, retirement packages and health care packages for the executives. (We know that adds up to $930 million, but for whatever reason Cordray has used a $922 million figure for this settlement.)   

While Cordray’s campaign says that’s money being returned back into the company’s bottom line, Washington and Lee Professor Lymon Johnson, a nationally recognized expert in stock options and corporate law, said that’s not exactly the case.

""By canceling out those stock options, you are stopping them (the executives) from taking greater advantage of the company, but that’s not the same thing as money going back into the corporate till,"" Johnson said. However, he does say that if the stock options were exercised by the United Health executives that it would have affected the company’s stock price by ""diluting"" the value of the stock held by others.

Still, Johnson asserts, ""I don’t know that I would use the term recover.""

""Recovery suggests that the thief got away and that you chased him down and got what he stole back,"" he said. ""In this case, it’s more like you prevented it from happening—he didn’t really get away with the theft.""

Because Cordray is taking credit for a $97.5 million settlement done by his predecessor and because $804 million worth of canceled stock options from a Minneapolis-based health care company account for almost half of his ""over $2 billion recovered"" from ""Wall Street,"" we find his claim to be Half True.

"['Immigration', 'Census', 'Texas', 'John King']","
CNN's John King says Latinos will outnumber Anglos in Texas in five to 10 years
","
Setting up a question to San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, CNN reporter John King mentioned the changing population of Texas. 
""Sometime in the next decade, there will be more Latinos in the state of Texas than there are Anglos,"" King said on the July 13 edition of ""John King, USA."" ""That will happen sometime in the next five to eight to 10 years."" 
So cable news reporters are now demographers? 
Meryl Conant, senior publicist for CNN Washington, told us King based his prediction on information from a San Antonio Express-News news article and the San Antonio-based Texas State Data Center, home to the state demographer, Dr. Lloyd Potter. We'd already contacted Potter, who told us the data center’s population projections suggest various timelines for the state's Latinos to outnumber Anglos. 
According to the data center, it ""is anticipated that the number of Hispanics will exceed the number of Anglos in the state at some point in the coming decade. This benchmark might be achieved a little sooner or a little later if migration is respectively more rapid or more slow than that utilized for this projection."" 
King's forecast could prove correct ""assuming most of our migration, fertility and mortality assumptions hold true,"" Potter said in an e-mail. ""The only concern I have is (King’s) statement indicating such certainty."" 
His e-mail continues: ""The variable with the most uncertainty is migration. Under our most conservative migration scenario, we project this threshold will occur at about 2020 give or take a year. Under the most aggressive scenario, the threshold would occur around 2014 or 2015. Under the 'unlikely' no-migration scenario, it won’t occur until almost 2035."" 
Assuming conservative migration numbers, the data center projects a population of 28 million by 2020, including more than 11.8 million Hispanics and slightly fewer Anglos. 
The trend has been seen in census numbers. In the 2000 Census, 52 percent of Texans were Anglo, and 32 percent identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino (of any race). By 2008, according to the Census Bureau, Texas’ Hispanic proportion had grown to 37 percent, and its Anglo proportion had shrunk to 47 percent. 
Potter said the ethnicity projections could change. ""If the borders closed to international migration, that would slow it considerably. If Texas’ economy slumped, that would slow the trend. When looking into the projections crystal ball, keeping these limitations of uncertainty in mind is healthy."" 
Still, King's prediction -- a majority Hispanic population within 5 to 10 years -- has enough wiggle room to fit all the data center's migration forecasts, except the no-migration scenario. 
We rate King’s statement True.

"['Abortion', 'Georgia', 'Melanie Crozier']","
Group says GOP candidate Karen Handel would be OK aborting child with Down syndrome
","
Now that the Republican gubernatorial runoff is on, some Georgia abortion foes are taking aim at front-runner Karen Handel.

Handel placed first in the GOP primary despite Georgia Right to Life's criticisms that she's not pro-life enough. A late endorsement by conservative darling Sarah Palin helped her rocket ahead of opponents.

And that's what concerns Melanie Crozier, the director of the Georgia Right to Life's Political Action Committee, Crozier said in a recent article for Politico, an online news site. 

""[Palin] has a son with Down syndrome, and under Karen Handel’s laws, Handel would have felt like it was OK to go in and abort that child,"" said Crozier.

Crozier added that they plan to back Nathan Deal, Handel's opponent in the GOP runoff.

We did a double take. Handel is fine with aborting a fetus that tests positive for Down syndrome?

No, she's not, Handel said. Her campaign called Crozier's statement a ""cruel and revolting lie."" She called on Crozier and GRTL President Dan Becker to step down. 

We requested to speak with Crozier. Instead, GRTL sent us a press release on their opposition to Handel's views on in vitro fertilization. 

But Crozier did talk with WSB-TV. In the interview, she apologized for making a statement that was unclear and said she was really criticizing Handel's views on in vitro fertilization. GRTL thinks doctors should create only as many embryos as they plan to implant. Handel thinks that if any are left over, they should be considered for adoption.   

Crozier has not asked for a correction or clarification on the Politico story, according to its author. 

GRTL and Handel have tangled before. She, like other GOP candidates, has declared herself ""pro-life,"" but some claim she's not ""pro-life"" enough.

In statewide runs, Handel has consistently opposed abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at stake.

GRTL supports only one exception: the life of the mother.

Handel has taken hits from GRTL for her views for years, but she has stood her ground.

When Handel ran for secretary of state in 2006, GRTL sent out a postcard naming her primary runoff opponent as the race's only true right-to-life candidate. Handel won without the organization's support.

GRTL and Handel were at loggerheads again in June, after Becker used the word ""barren"" to talk about Handel's struggles with fertility and her position on abortion. She has previously talked publicly about how she tried unsuccessfully to have a child for 10 years.

And when Palin announced her endorsement of Handel on July 12, GRTL issued a press release to say they were ""stunned"" because Handel's views on abortion showed she did not cherish the lives of children with genetic disorders as much as she should.    

Palin's son Trig was born in 2008 with Down syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes physical problems and cognitive delays.

In a July 22 interview with Lori Geary on WSB-TV, Crozier tried to clarify the statement she made to Politico.

Crozier: ""What I’m saying is, if a baby who is created through the process of in vitro fertilization ...""

Geary: ""Which again, Palin’s was not ...""

Crozier: ""But we’re saying, if this was the case, and was found to have Down syndrome, Karen Handel is OK with that life being exterminated.""

Handel's campaign denies this claim as well.

""They're making a series of reaches beyond anything Karen believes,"" said her campaign spokesman Dan McLagan.

What Crozier told Politico doesn't stand up to to scrutiny. Neither does her clarification.

GRTL failed to provide any evidence whatsoever for the statement that Handel thinks it is fine to abort a child because it has Down syndrome. And the organization failed to explain how it came to its conclusion.

The group should have known that they were misrepresenting Handel's beliefs. They've been quibbling with her stances for years.

After Handel called for the resignation of GRTL's leadership, the group backed so far off its statement that Crozier claimed she wasn't really talking about aborting children with Down syndrome. Instead, she told WSB-TV, she was really talking about in vitro fertilization. 

But, as Geary pointed out, Trig wasn't conceived in a test tube. How could the subject apply to him?

Crozier made a baseless and outrageous statement.

She earns PolitiFact's lowest rating, Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097202FC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/26/melanie-crozier/abortion-group-says-gop-gubernatorial-hopeful-kare/
"['Ohio', 'Crime', 'Guns', 'Rob Portman']","
Portman incorrect that Fisher once said ""I never met a gun control bill I didn't like.""
","
It’s a quote that keeps on giving, campaign after campaign. It’s even slightly plausible, if you’ve followed Lee Fisher’s positions on gun control. The quote, cited since at least 1994 by gun-rights advocates, political opponents (including the campaign of at least one Democrat), blogs and websites:

""I never met a gun control bill I didn’t like.""

But did Fisher really say it?

We turned to groups that have used the quote against Fisher, including the Buckeye Firearms Association, the Ohio Republican Party and the campaign of Rob Portman, the Republican running against Fisher for U.S. Senate. They all suggest his support for the Second Amendment runs from weak to nonexistent. We spoke with people who dealt with Fisher two decades ago and opposed him on issues in the Ohio Senate. We asked the National Rifle Association -- twice -- to dig into its research archives, although the NRA didn’t follow up either time. We checked decades worth of of newspaper clippings and websites, and asked those who keep using the quote to check their records in case they’ve found it.

No one has.

This has been an ongoing examination ever since the Buckeye Firearms Association and an operative in the campaign of Jennifer Brunner, a Democrat, separately cited the quote during Ohio’s Democratic primary. Fisher won that primary against Brunner, who is Ohio’s secretary of state.

They and others noted earlier references to the quote, and not just from this year. The quote was a piece of political folklore, and Fisher had not appeared to do anything to tamp it down until recently.  We won’t speculate why, although it’s clear that any discussion of Fisher and guns can get sticky when he says he’s a Second Amendment supporter. Fisher has tried repeatedly to regulate guns, whether from his perch as a former board member of Handgun Control, Inc., or from his service in the Ohio Senate, or from his time as Ohio attorney general.

Fisher says that Americans have the right to own guns for protection and sport. But as he said in May on a radio program, ""we should do background checks to make it harder for bad guys, or people who have a serious mental illness to get a gun.""  He embraced assault-weapons bans. Prior to 1993, when Congress passed the so-called Brady Bill to require background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases, Fisher tried repeatedly to get a similar law passed in Ohio.

Second Amendment absolutists and many other law-abiding sportsmen disagree with Fisher.  Critics cite other statements he has made in support of gun regulation, such as this, from a 1993 memo when Fisher was Ohio attorney general: ''The right to bear arms is a very limited right...""

That’s how the Portman campaign characterizes Fisher’s statement, anyway, although the full quote was actually: ''The right to bear arms is a very limited right and the state and its political subdivisions have the authority to regulate the possession and use of assault weapons.""

So we can stipulate that no matter what Fisher says about his support for the Second Amendment, he and the gun rights lobby are going to be far apart. But what of the ""never met"" quote?

When a Brunner operative and the Buckeye Firearms Association used it during the spring primary, The Plain Dealer mentioned it, writing, ""Gun rights advocates as well as Brunner loyalists like to cite Fisher's famous quote from 1994: ‘I never met a gun control bill I didn't like.’""

Fisher’s campaign then said it wasn’t sure of the quote’s origin or whether Fisher actually uttered those words. But the Ohio Republican Party used the quote in an online video attack ad in June. Shortly after, Portman used the quote in a campaign news release. Told that The Plain Dealer was looking into the quote’s origins and questioned its authenticity, a Portman spokeswoman defended its usage, saying the quote had been in circulation for years without any record of Fisher disputing it.

But Fisher’s campaign refutes the quote now. Fisher never said it, according to spokesman John Collins. We have searched and asked around widely and find nothing that contradicts him, nor did the Buckeye Firearms Association, which turned to its own sources and traced its usage to at least 1994.

So where did the quote come from?

That’s not entirely clear, but a 1989 column in the Columbus Dispatch sheds some light. Fisher was a state senator then, trying for the fifth time to pass a statewide  gun-control law. This time, Fisher’s proposal was getting a second look, and then-state Sen. Paul Pfeifer, the Republican who chaired the Judiciary Committee, indicated he would give Fisher a hearing.

Pfeifer, describing the political climate for gun control, told the Dispatch then that Fisher had a reputation of having ""never met a gun-control bill he didn’t like."" Those were Pfeifer’s words, however, not Fisher’s.

Pfeifer, now an Ohio Supreme Court justice, told The Plain Dealer he doesn’t recall details of what he may have said in 1989, but ""if you found the quote, then I probably said it.""

Pfeifer added, ""It’s tough enough being responsible for the things you did say"" in a long political career. ""And it’s hell being blamed for something you never did say.""

Seems fair enough to us. That’s why we find this claim False.

"['Georgia', 'Energy', 'Georgia politicians ']","
Politicians claim Georgia is to pine trees what Saudi Arabia is to oil
","
Some phrases just seem to take on a life of their own in Georgia politics. 
Take a catchphrase of the just-ended primary election cycle. Republicans tossed it about. Democrats dished it out. It was used by failed GOP gubernatorial hopeful Eric Johnson. And Roy Barnes used it in a campaign video in his successful bid for the Democratic Party’s nomination for governor. 
And don't be surprised if you hear it again as the election cycle moves forward. 
Georgia, politicians have proclaimed, ""is the Saudi Arabia of pine trees."" The implication is that Georgia's pines could have a major impact on our nation's fuel needs, perhaps substantially reducing our dependence on foreign oil. 
Georgia has been called many things through the years -- Empire State of the South, the Peach State and the Goober State (this one owing to its prowess growing peanuts, not producing politicians). 
But the Saudi Arabia of Pine Trees? And where did that new moniker-in-the-making originate? 
Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest producer and exporter of petroleum liquids. It is the world’s second largest crude oil producer behind Russia. It has one-fifth of the world’s proven petroleum reserves. 
Georgia, meanwhile, certainly has a lot of pine trees. And pines are one of the things being looked at by the fledgling ethanol industry, which hopes to produce fuel from a variety of sustainable crops. There have also been proposals to use pine pellets to produce electricity. 
A massive 2007 study by the U.S. Forest Service found Georgia had about 16 billion cubic feet of pines growing within its borders. That included longleaf and slash pines, loblolly and short-leaf pines, ""other"" yellow pines and even a few white and red pines. 
The 350-page report showed Georgia comes in ahead of other Southern states in pine production. And those Southern states top other states in pine production. 
Nathan McClure, director of forest energy for the Georgia Forestry Commission, said the state has about 24.4 million acres of ""commercial timberland."" He estimated that about half that is planted in pines. 
The state’s forest industry is huge, producing a direct economic impact of about $18 billion in 2008, McClure said. The indirect impact pushes that figure to about $28 billion, he estimated. 
McClure, however, said his agency has tried to steer clear of the Saudi Arabia comparison that is getting bandied about by politicians.   
""We don’t like that statement because of the inference about the Mideast at the same time we are in the middle of a war in the Mideast,"" McClure said. 
In November 2008, Range Fuels broke ground for the nation’s first cellulosic ethanol plant at a site in rural Treutlen County, just outside Soperton. That facility will use pine trees to produce ethanol. 
Jill Stuckey, who directs the alternative fuels program for the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, said the state is second only to Oregon when it comes to trees. 
""And Oregon’s forests are old-growth and slow-growing compared to Georgia’s,"" Stuckey said. ""We grow trees like Iowa grows corn."" 
But like Saudi Arabia produces oil? 
We had to drill a little deeper for that connection, all the way back to April 2008 and an article in Georgia Trend magazine. In that issue, Susan Varlamoff, director of the Office of Environmental Sciences at the University of Georgia, talked about Georgia’s potential to produce fuel from various agricultural products, items referred to by scientists as ""biomass."" 
The article noted that Varlamoff  ""has coined a now well-worn phrase, calling Georgia 'the Saudi Arabia of biomass.' "" 
Varlamoff, as it turns out, was very careful to use the term ""biomass"" and not pine trees. And there’s a good reason. She was talking about a variety of items that could be used to produce alternative fuels. Pine trees are certainly included in that equation, she told PolitiFact Georgia. But so are paper pulp, peanut shells, pecan shells and about a billion pounds of chicken fat and grease from the poultry processing industry.  
""We are the Saudi Arabia of biomass,"" Varlamoff reiterated to PolitiFact Georgia. 
Varlamoff, however, said she never limited her statement to pine trees. The politicians and their handlers took care of that rhetorical flourish. 
""Honestly, somebody just decided to make that change,"" she said.  
Georgia does have a lot of pine trees. And they could play a vital role in the development of any alternative fuel industry in the state. But so will a lot of other agricultural products. And there are still many questions about the viability of the alternative fuels industry. 
The Saudi Arabia of pine trees? Well, Georgia is at least the Kuwait of conifers. We give this one a Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D3DDC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/25/georgia-politicians/politicans-claim-georgia-pine-trees-what-saudi-ara/
"['Ohio', 'Bush Administration', 'Economy', 'Sherrod Brown']","
Sherrod Brown touts job growth during Clinton presidency vs. Bush’s jobs record
","
Politicians can slice and dice monthly job reports expertly, a useful skill for scoring economic talking points. Include a few months’ worth of job losses here, exclude some job gains there, or do it in reverse, and pretty soon it’s all some scoundrel’s fault. (Never mind whom that scoundrel is.)

So U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown caught our attention when he took a broader historical look while appearing July 14 on Rachel Maddow’s program on MSNBC.

""We saw jobs created, 22 million in the Clinton years,"" said Brown, a Democrat who’s not up for reelection until 2012. ""Because they were responsible about cutting taxes selectively and increasing taxes selectively and they were responsible about what government programs they formed and they dismantled. Twenty-two million jobs created and incomes went up in those eight years for the average American. And in the next eight years, the eight Bush years, only 3 million jobs created and that wasn`t even enough to keep up with population growth.""

The quantitative claims seemed worth checking out, and in doing so we found a surprise: Brown is wrong – but not in a way he’ll likely mind. No fan of President George W. Bush, Brown grossly understated the poor job growth that occurred on Bush’s watch.

The comparison should have been this: Job growth through Clinton two terms was 22.7 million. Through Bush’s two terms, it was 1.1 million.

Brown isn’t alone in making this error. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee used the 3 million figure in a news release on July 20 when trying to use Bush’s record on jobs as a weapon against one of his former top aides, Rob Portman. Portman is the Republican in the U.S. Senate race to succeed George Voinovich, who is retiring.

Brown’s office wasn’t sure where the senator got his figures, but we did some tracing and concluded it probably came from a Wall Street Journal online story of Jan. 9, 2009. That’s where the Democratic committee says it got its numbers, too. The Wall Street Journal examined net job growth for more than half a century and declared that Bush had the ""worst track record on record.""

That doesn’t mean it’s the worst ever. It’s just the worst since the Labor Department started keeping payroll records in 1939. Said the Journal:

""The Bush administration created about three million jobs (net) over its eight years, a fraction of the 23 million jobs created under President Bill Clinton’s administration and only slightly better than President George H.W. Bush did in his four years in office.""

We wanted to look at those numbers ourselves, so we turned to the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS. Getting guidance on the data from BLS and using Excel spreadsheets, we discovered not only that Brown and the Democrats have been wrong, but also why.

It was a matter of timing.

BLS had only preliminary data on Bush’s final performance at the close of his second term, when the Wall Street Journal was doing its story. BLS subsequently updated the data. It turned out that things were way worse than the preliminary numbers showed.

We shared this assessment with the Journal reporter, who agreed. It’s not a matter of whose numbers were better. It’s a matter of what was known and when.

You, too, can do the math. The jobs numbers are based on a monthly survey of employers for the 12th of each month, but the initial reports are revised as more employers complete their survey over the following couple of months. A fuller census of employment and wages is conducted quarterly and is considered more accurate, so BLS eventually adjusts the monthly numbers to reflect that accuracy. Here are the latest numbers:
  


Now for Bush, who succeeded Clinton in the White House. As already noted, the nation had 132.469 million jobs as he was taking office. 


OK, but what about Brown’s claim that incomes went up under Clinton?

The numbers bear this out, too. BLS data, adjusted for inflation, show that average weekly wages grew by 21 percent from the start of Clinton’s first term to the end of his second term. They grew by only 2 percent under Bush’s two terms.

Is it fair to compare job growth under these presidents? Just in case we were missing some context – because these numbers seemed to turn conventional wisdom of its head -- we ran this by Dan Mitchell, an economist and fan of fiscal restraint who works as a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-oriented think tank. Mitchell said he didn’t find the numbers surprising. Luck and the economic cycle played a role in both presidencies, but the officeholders’ policies played bigger roles, he said. Citing free-trade agreements, welfare reform and deregulation in the telecommunications and agriculture industries, Mitchell said that Clinton’s economic policies were actually geared more to free markets than Bush’s, and the results speak for themselves.

But that’s for others to argue. Bush, while insisting on tax cuts, faced a national security crisis unparalleled in the last half-century, and his response – including wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – had serious economic consequences.  Political values, including those of Sen. Brown, shape the debate on whether the president took the right or wrong approach. As for us, we’re sticking to the factual claims.

Brown’s numbers on Bush were off, but his point was right on target. We rate his statement True.

Wendy Davis says the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) lied about air quality tests in the Barnett Shale
","
Speaking at the Texas Democratic convention last month, Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, lambasted the state agency responsible for approving permits to pollute the air. 
""The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality — what a joke,"" she said during a speech to delegates June 26. ""In my district, we caught them lying to us about the results of air quality studies in the Barnett Shale. They are playing with the health and safety of our communities, and we are going to tell them that is not acceptable."" 
First, the basics: When we contacted Davis to elaborate on her statement, Davis said that ""we"" meant the public. 
But was TCEQ lying? The answer to that question is more complicated. 
From Dec. 15-17, TCEQ tested air samples collected at 126 natural gas production sites in Fort Worth for toxic pollutants. Natural gas drilling creates pollution from a couple sources, according to the Star-Telegram: the tank batteries that store wastewater and condensate — a light form of crude oil that often vents into the atmosphere — and the motors that drive pipeline compressors. Plus, drillers vent natural gas into the atmosphere when they complete a well. Fort Worth covers about 6 percent of the Barnett Shale, a natural gas field that covers more than 20 counties, according to the Star-Telegram. 
On Jan. 12, John Sadlier, deputy director of the office of compliance and enforcement at TCEQ, presented the results to the Fort Worth City Council. ""Based on this study, the air is safe,"" he said, reporting that the agency didn't find pollutants at levels that could cause health problems. 
Eight slides accompanying the presentation had a red disclaimer noting that the samples had not been collected, analyzed or reviewed following specific protocol for quality control. TCEQ spokesman Terry Clawson told us that the city had asked TCEQ to perform tests ""as quickly as possible"" using the agency's mobile laboratory. (The request came on the heels of testing in DISH, a nearby town, that revealed high levels of benzene and other compounds.) While the mobile lab enables results to be produced within hours after samples are taken, Clawson said, the testing didn't meet national standards. 
Davis pointed out that the slides shown to the city council clearly said that benzene didn't exceed the levels considered safe for both short-term and long-term health, instead of noting that the data to prove that wasn't available. 
On Feb. 3, someone filed a fraud complaint with the TCEQ chief auditor's office, alleging the agency's monitoring operation had knowingly reported ""inaccurate and misleading"" information based on inadequate testing methods for butadiene, isoprene and benzene. The office initiated an audit, reporting the results on March 25. 
According to the audit memo, shortly after the council presentation, Sadlier questioned the validity of the data and ordered further tests. TCEQ sent the air samples to its lab using a more sensitive analysis. On Jan. 22, those tests showed that several samples measured benzene, a byproduct of gas drilling known to cause cancer in humans, at levels that exceeded those considered safe for people's long-term health. TCEQ did not report the new results to council members. 
The memo said Sadlier ordered more tests in February. Once more, TCEQ detected benzene, but not at levels that exceeded state standards. Clawson told us those results were published in a report dated April 26. The report was shared with the city of Fort Worth and posted on the agency's website on May 21. Davis said that it was ""buried,"" so that someone visiting the site wouldn't know it was there unless they were looking for it. 
Still with us? On June 1, TCEQ released results from samples taken at two sites in late April — that would be the fourth round of tests — that again showed levels of benzene exceeding the state's long-term health standard. ""State officials have said the level is not enough to cause immediate health problems, but it could make people sick if they were exposed continually for several years. It also serves as an indication that more testing in the area is needed,"" according to a June 2 Star-Telegram article. 
Clawson told us that TCEQ later collected more samples at the two facilities and did not find benzene that exceeded short-term or long-term exposure levels. That report was published and distributed to the City of Fort Worth on July 7, he said. 
Clawson told us that the agency regrets ""the failure to communicate the results to the city in a more timely fashion."" However, he also said that during presentation to the Fort Worth City Council, ""we stated that tests found 'no cause for concern.' This statement was true then, and it is true today."" 
As for the fraud complaint against the agency, the March 25 auditor's report concluded that the information provided to Sadlier from the first round of tests ""while technically correct, could be considered to be misleading."" It did not find evidence that Monitoring Operation's management knew the information was misleading. Sadlier said he didn't know the equipment couldn't detect lower levels of benzene when he talked to city officials, according to a May 28 Dallas Morning News article. 
Just a few days after TCEQ posted the toxicology report online May 21, the Texas Observer broke the story about the fraud complaint and audit, prompting Davis to issue a press release blasting the agency for waiting ""four months to reveal these disturbing test results. The agency had determined the public had been exposed to elevated levels of benzene, and yet the public and their elected officials were not made aware of these exposures."" 
On May 28 Davis filed a 30-point open-records request, asking for all TCEQ documents and communications related to benzene and other potentially harmful chemicals that may, could be, or are found in the air above the Barnett Shale. 
In our conversation with Davis last week, she said that Mark Vickery, executive director of the TCEQ, had called her to apologize. ""He was very contrite, expressed great apology for not having revealed to me the information before,"" she said, adding that Vickery told her TCEQ didn't think the January test results posed ""a serious health risk and therefore did not disclose it."" 
Where does that leave us? 
First, TCEQ reported data that backed up the agency's claim that emissions from the Barnett Shale sites in Fort Worth were safe, but those tests could not measure lower levels of toxic chemicals. Subsequently, more sensitive tests have gone back and forth: some showed benzene levels exceeding the standard for long-term health effects and some did not. Until recently, the agency has not reported the results promptly. To Davis' point: TCEQ waited four months to alert officials of the January tests that detected elevated levels of benzene. 
Did the agency lie, as Davis claimed? Or simply fail to disclose — by TCEQ's own admission — in a timely fashion? 
""Hiding the truth is lying,"" Davis said. However, absent proof of an intent to deceive, we rate her statement Half True. Should her open-records request yield new information that shows the TCEQ knowingly lied to the public, we'll reconsider our rating.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975B93C0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/25/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-commission-environmental-qu/
"['Rhode Island', 'John  Robitaille']","
Robitaille says union rules allowed cooks helpers to get DMV jobs
","
No Rhode Island state agency is more reviled than the Division of Motor Vehicles.

And let's face it, with waits that have stretched to seven hours, branch closures and antiquated computing systems, there's not much to like.

Seems like we've heard all the complaints. But Republican candidate for governor John Robitaille, speaking on WPRI Channel 12's weekly Newsmakers show earlier this month, offered a new one.

Former attorney general Arlene Violet, one of the panelists, asked Robitaille about the Carcieri administration's role in the problems at the DMV. (Before launching his own bid for governor, Robitaille had served as Carcieri's communications director.)

In recalling his frustrations with the registry, Robitaille told the Newsmakers panel: ""We had cook's helpers that, because of their union status and seniority in other parts of state government, had the right to move into the DMV, not trained for the jobs.""

It was not surprising to hear Robitaille make this sort of claim. The Carcieri administration has long maintained that union personnel rules have hampered its ability to rejigger state agencies and realign staff.

But when we asked Robitaille to back it up, he didn't offer much help. Citing what he said was data from the state's Department of Administration, he told us there was one former cook's helper now working as a DMV customer service representative.

He then insisted there are many more former cook's helpers working within the registry. But he said the Human Resources department couldn't confirm that without a time-consuming manual search and he refused to request such a search or provide additional proof.

""They have more important things to do. I stand by the information I was given by former members of the administration that there were in fact several employees who bumped into the DMV from cook's helpers positions in the recent past,"" he wrote in an email.

The problem is, he refused to provide us with any evidence.

So we filed our own public records request.  The data we received revealed that there are three former cook's helpers currently working at the DMV.

Despite what Robitaille said, none is a customer service representative. The list shows that one is a senior clerk and one a Spanish interpreter, both of whom previously worked as cook's helpers at Rhode Island College. The third, a senior teller, worked as a cook's helper at what is now known as the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals.

There was some truth to the first part of Robitaille's statement. But what about the second part, that the transfers of cook's helpers to the DMV were connected to their ""union status or seniority"" and that they arrived at the DMV ""not trained for the jobs.""

According to Melanie Marcaccio, deputy personnel administrator for the Department of Administration, applicants for these jobs would have to meet education and experience requirements, regardless of their union status.

The official job descriptions all require a high school degree and related experience. For the senior clerk, that means clerical experience. For the senior teller it's supervisory experience, with involvement in payment and accounting practices. And for the interpreter it means ""the ability to speak, read and write Spanish.""

For most job classifications, a civil service examination is also required. Candidates who score high enough are placed on a list to be given preference if a job opens up.

Maureen Tripp, president of the union representing DMV workers, defended her members' training. ""They had to take the civil service test, receive a score, had a ranking and were interviewed,"" she said. ""They were deemed qualified at the time they applied.""

But there's a complication. The state only administers these tests periodically, if at all, depending on job classification, according to Marcaccio. Those who have not yet taken the test are therefore considered temporary, pending their scores on the exam. When and if the test is eventually given, they must do well enough, or risk losing their jobs.

The three former cook's helpers now at the DMV have not taken the test, she said.

However that doesn't automatically make them unqualified. They'd still have to have the necessary education and experience.

It's that background that deems them qualified for appointment to the job, regardless of their union seniority, Marcaccio confirmed. Once it is determined who meets the specifications, preference is given to those with the most seniority.

While Robitaille's statement that there are a handful of former cook's helpers among the almost 150 DMV employees is correct, he couldn't support his claim that they weren't qualified.

We all know the registry needs an overhaul, but it's important to focus on the facts. We rate this Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2B03C0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/25/john-robitaille/robitaille-says-union-rules-allowed-cooks-helpers-/
"['Immigration', 'Ohio', 'Tom Ganley']","
Congressional candidate Tom Ganley says Arizona’s new immigration law ""basically parrots the federal immigration law.""
","
The Obama administration’s decision to sue Arizona over its newly adopted immigration law provoked howls of outrage from Republicans around the country.

While the Justice Department said the lawsuit was needed to avoid racial profiling and stake out the federal government’s role in setting immigration policy, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele called it ""another instance of hollow, political gamesmanship from a White House unwilling to take the bold action necessary to solve one of the country’s most pressing issues."" House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio opined that border violence is ""out of control,"" and that states have ""a right and responsibility to ensure order and the safety of their citizens, especially when the federal government is asleep at the wheel.""

Even 13th District Congressional Candidate Tom Ganley of Brecksville got into the act, authoring a column on his campaign website blog that asks: ""Why is the Obama Administration Suing Arizona?""

Like Boehner, Ganley said states should step in if the federal government isn’t enforcing immigration laws.

""Interestingly, the Arizona law basically parrots the federal immigration law,"" Ganley continued. ""I wonder what part of the federal law the Obama Administration doesn’t like?""

Ganley’s claim about the Arizona law parroting federal immigration law itself parrots statements that conservatives have made since the Arizona law was adopted.

We looked at a version of the claim that that columnist George Will floated on an April 25th talk show.

""What the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is a crime, a federal crime,"" Will opined on ABC This Week.

Legal scholars we talked to highlighted two key sections of Title 8 of the U.S. Code, which duplicate the ""meat"" of the new Arizona law.

Section 1304e of the federal law requires that ""every alien, 18 years of age and over, shall at all times carry with him and have in his personal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to him."" Those who fail to comply will be guilty of a misdemeanor and will be fined $100 and can be imprisoned up to 30 days.

Section 1306a of the federal law says that, ""Any alien required to apply for registration and to be fingerprinted in the United States who willfully fails or refuses to make such application or to be fingerprinted, and any parent or legal guardian required to apply for the registration of any alien who willfully fails or refuses to file application for the registration of such alien shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not to exceed $1,000 or be imprisoned not more than six months, or both.""

The new Arizona law makes it a state crime if immigrants are in violation of either of those codes.

Gabriel Chin, a professor of law at the University of Arizona, said that the claim is generally correct, but those sections of the law are ""among the least prosecuted in the U.S. Code.""

""For the relevant offense at issue here, failure of a non-citizen to register in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1306(a), there were five convictions across the U.S. in FY 2008,"" Chin said in an email to PolitiFact. ""So to be precise, the statement would be 'What the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is . . . a federal crime that the federal authorities have chosen not to enforce except in rare circumstances.'""

In fact, proponents of the Arizona law have argued that's why new state immigration rules are needed; federal authorities are not doing a consistent job of enforcing immigration laws that are already on the books.

So, in the two cases above, the bill does make what are already federal crimes state crimes.

There are other parts of the new law that also overlap with federal statute. For instance, section 5 of the Arizona law, which deals with the transportation of non-citizens, is nearly identical to section 1324 of Title 8 of the U.S. Code.

However, the Arizona law does break new ground. For example, Section 5 also would make it illegal to pick up day laborers on the street for hire, ""which has nothing to do with federal law. It's essentially a traffic law,"" Chin wrote. Those violating this section are guilty of a misdemeanor. And it also makes it a crime for an illegal immigrant to solicit work.

Mary Giovagnoli, director of the Immigration Policy Center, pointed out another aspect of the bill that she finds particularly troubling: Section 2 of the Arizona law would allow citizens to sue local and state authorities if they do not believe the new law is being enforced effectively. State and local authorities could be fined between $1,000 and $5,000 a day for each day the policy remains in effect.

The bill also includes new language about how the law applies to employers and specifies the circumstances under which an officer can question and arrest someone he or she thinks is in violation of the law.

When it comes to some of the most talked about parts of the law, having to do with aliens who fail to carry proper paperwork and failing to register, Ganley is correct about the core of the law; federal statutes already makes those two provisions a crime. But the law also includes a new prohibition barring picking up day laborers on the street for hire and soliciting for work. That's not in the federal code. As a result, we find the claim to be Mostly True.

Lieutenant governor candidate McGee Brown boasts Ohio’s education system is fifth-best in nation
","
In her first campaign speech as a candidate for Ohio lieutenant governor, Yvette McGee Brown, running mate of Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, highlighted Strickland’s focus on primary education during his first term in office.

She noted that the governor increased school funding by 5.5 percent (a claim that we rated as false) and that he committed the state to focus on science, technology, engineering and math — or STEM. She then said this focus on education is bringing Ohio national recognition.

""The critics have spoken and every Ohioan should hear what they have to say about our schools,"" she said. ""The Education Commission of the States gave Ohio its award for the most innovative education reform plan in the nation. Education Week rates Ohio schools in the top five in the nation.""

Indeed, in Education Week’s Quality Counts 2010 report, Ohio’s education system was ranked fifth best in the nation, with an overall grade of B-. But a deeper look behind Education Week’s grading system reveals some less-flattering findings.

To calculate the overall rankings, the trade publication graded each state on four primary areas.  Ohio’s rating in some of those areas belies its lofty overall ranking:
  

  
  

  


Brown’s statement is correct about the overall ranking. But we believe it is important to add context to that overall ranking by noting that Ohio received C+ ratings, or barely average, in three of the four areas graded. We rate this statement True.

House candidate Bob Gibbs touts coal's role for power generation in Ohio’s 18th District
","State Sen. Bob Gibbs wants to make sure you know coal is important in Ohio’s 18th Congressional District and that he doesn’t like efforts to shrink the district’s carbon footprint.

Gibbs is the Republican candidate in the 18th, which includes all or parts of 15 counties in Ohio’s Appalachian region. On his campaign website he argues that efforts to restrict carbon emissions, commonly known as Cap and Trade, would increase energy costs and be bad for the district.

""In the 18th Congressional District, 100% of electric generation comes from coal. That means that every single household in this district will see a huge increase in their energy bills if Cap-and-Trade would become law.""

It’s true that all electricity generated in the 18th is produced at coal-fired power plants, but that doesn’t mean when residents flick on their lights they are not also using electricity from other sources.

Much of the district gets power from rural electric cooperatives. Other areas, though, are serviced by FirstEnergy Corp.’s Ohio Edison and AEP Ohio’s Columbus Southern Power Co. and Ohio Power Co.

First Energy has ownership stakes in two nuclear power plants in Ohio and a third in Pennsylvania. AEP Ohio has two plants in Ohio that burn natural gas to generate power and a hydro-electric plant on the Ohio River.

Still, all power generating plants actually located within the district are coal-fired. So while the statement is not completely illuminating, we rate it as True.

"['Elections', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Perry debated in 2002 even though his opponent didn't release his complete income tax returns per Perry's request
","
Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee for governor, issued a press release July 21 calling Gov. Rick Perry's campaign approach to debating ""dramatically different from what it was in 2002,"" when he ran for governor against Laredo businessman Tony Sanchez. 
""If two debates are good, 12 will be great,"" Perry said in a Sept. 9, 2002, press release titled ""Texans deserve more than two urban debates."" 
""Voters in East and West Texas deserve to have their voices heard and their questions answered at gubernatorial debates,"" he said. At that point, Sanchez had committed to two debates in October in Dallas and Houston. According to the press release, Perry had accepted a dozen invitations to debate. 
Has Perry changed his tune? 
""Not at all,"" said Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Perry's campaign. ""Gov. Perry looks forward to the opportunity to debate Bill White as soon as he releases his tax returns from his years in public service."" 
In April, Perry said he wouldn't debate White until the Democrat released returns for the six years he served as Houston's mayor and the two years he served as a deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration. ""Once he releases his income taxes and tells the public how he made his money in public service and as a business person, we'll be more than happy to discuss debates,"" Perry spokesman Mark Miner said, according to an April 26 story on WFAA.com. 
In the same story, White countered: ""We'll take in consideration releasing tax returns or parts of those tax returns. We've been providing information from them to journalists as time goes on. I just want there to be a standard that's applicable to all candidates."" White had already released his 2009 returns, and said he'd release returns for the years he runs for or holds statewide office. On June 8, he released his returns dating back to 2004, when he took office as Houston's mayor. 
But Perry's campaign said it wasn't enough, and pushed White to release more records. ""By withholding tax returns for his years in public service dating back to the 1990s, Bill White has not matched Governor Perry’s level of transparency,"" said Perry spokesman Mark Miner in statement. ""Questions remain concerning income Bill White received while Deputy Secretary of Energy under President Clinton and as chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, and how he has profited from those positions."" Leaving aside the question of whether an unpaid partisan political post constitutes ""public service,"" we found that White's Washington service was from 1993 to 1995, and he led the party from 1995 to 1998. 
Perry has made public his own returns going back to 1991, when he first became a statewide officeholder. The documents don't reveal everything because he's placed many of his assets in a blind trust, which means the details of those assets are unavailable. In 2001, Perry's tax return showed that the trust earned $14,790 in interest and $2,958 in dividends. In September 2009, his spokeswoman told The Associated Press his trust was worth about $896,000. 
What do tax returns have to do with debates? Nothing that we can think of — and Perry has not linked them in his previous gubernatorial campaigns. Which is not to say he hasn't talked about them. 
Flashback: In December 2001, both Perry and Sanchez released information about their 2000 income taxes. While Perry released the accompanying tax schedules that detailed how he made his money, Sanchez only revealed what he made ($6.4 million) and paid ($852,000 in income taxes), according to a Dec. 14, 2001, Austin American-Statesman report. 
By March 2002, when Sanchez had secured the Democratic nomination, Perry was calling on him to release the rest of his tax information, plus ""his complete tax returns for the years that he served on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission (1985-91) and the University of Texas System Board of Regents (1997-present),"" according to a March 30, 2002, Statesman article. After Sanchez released a limited amount of information dating back to 1991, Perry was still pushing Sanchez to release his complete income tax returns so voters could know whether his financial holdings posed a conflict of interest. 
At the time, Sanchez's campaign manager, Glenn Smith, sounded a lot like the White campaign when he said that ""it's very easy for a career politician who has always been on the public payroll to do what Perry's doing."" 
Sanchez, a wealthy oilman and banker from Laredo, had never held an elected office. For many years, White was a private practice attorney in Houston. 
But for all of the candidates' huffing and puffing about income tax returns during the 2002 election, we couldn't find any evidence that Perry had made a debate conditional upon a full release of Sanchez's financial information. We also found no evidence that the Sanchez campaign ever complied with Perry's request to provide more details, and Smith told us that he didn't recall ever releasing the in-depth returns. 
Meanwhile, the two debates between Perry and Sanchez were held as planned. 
Instead of financial transparency, the sticking point for the two candidates was whether to sit (Sanchez) or stand (Perry) during the debates, according to an Oct. 9, 2002, Fort Worth Star-Telegram article. Perry, 6 feet tall, said he thought Sanchez, 5 feet seven inches, was insecure about his height. Sanchez said he just wanted to be comfortable. (They agreed to sit at one, stand at the other.) 
In his last run for election in 2006, Perry seemed less enthusiastic to debate his challengers, including Democrat Chris Bell and independents Kinky Friedman and Carole Keeton Strayhorn. The four faced off only once, in October. A month before, Perry told the Houston Chronicle editorial board that one debate was enough because the scheduled event, with its multiple participants, would be a ""circus."" 
Apparently height was still an issue, though. The campaigns decided that the 5-foot, 1-inch Strayhorn could stand on a riser for the event. 
Where do we stand? 
In 2002, Perry pushed Sanchez to release his complete income tax returns for the years he was on the UT board of regents and on the Parks and Wildlife Commission, but never made it a condition to debate. Indeed, Perry not only debated him twice, but goaded him to participate in 12 debates. 
To date, Perry has refused to debate White until he releases all of his income tax returns for the years he served the Clinton administration in Washington and the state Democratic party chairman. 
We didn't hear back from the Perry campaign when we asked whether he has ever set a precondition on a debate before. Since we found no evidence that Perry has ever made a debate conditional upon his opponent's release of tax returns, we call that a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C137400>],/factchecks/2010/jul/24/rick-perry/perry-debated-2002-even-though-his-opponent-didnt-/

O'Reilly blames Obama admin. for not pursuing criminal charges in New Black Panther Party case
","For several weeks, Fox News pundits have been hammering the Obama administration for its handling of the New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case. The gist of the argument is that the Obama administration backed off a slam-dunk case because it has no stomach for going after minorities for civil rights violations. At issue is an incident on Nov. 4, 2008 -- the day of the presidential election -- when New Black Pather Party members Jerry Jackson and King Samir Shabazz stood outside a Philadelphia polling place dressed in black military-style uniforms. Shabazz held a nightstick, and the two men were accused of making intimidating remarks to both white and black voters. Be one of the 1.5 million people to view the video on YouTube by clicking here. In the video, the men are asking a camera man why he is taping them. On January 7, 2009, a couple weeks before Obama took office, the Department of Justice filed a civil action in federal court accusing the two men, as well as the New Black Panther Party and its leader Malik Zulu Shabazz, of engaging in voter intimidation. Although none of the defendants responded to the complaint, the Department decided last year to drop its case against all but King Samir Shabazz, the one with the nightstick. The department asked for, and got, an injunction prohibiting Shabazz from displaying a weapon within 100 feet of a Philadelphia polling location until 2012. Many Fox News pundits decried the government's position as outrageously lenient, and evidence of an Obama administration double standard on race issues. On July 6, 2010, Fox News' Bill O'Reilly asked Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl whether the Justice Department should have prosecuted the Panthers. ""Of course,"" Wiehl said. ""I mean, there's absolutely no reason. Just take a look at the video that they didn't prosecute. And it's interesting you use the word prosecute, because all that the department did was file a civil complaint, which they won by default judgment. They dropped that afterwards, because, oh, one of the Black Panthers has said, oh, I'm not going to show up for three years at that particular polling area with a night stick. And that's all they wanted. They never pursued criminal charges, Bill. And they could have done that."" ""Okay, but you say they should have done that?"" O'Reilly asked. ""Oh, absolutely,"" Wiehl said. Later, OReilly asked Fox News legal analyst Kimberly Guilfoyle if the matter should have been prosecuted. ""You've got a video,"" Guilfoyle said. ""Yes, they absolutely should have proceeded full on this case...I have to tell you, this bothers me because I believe that they are not being race neutral in their enforcement of the Voting Rights Act."" O'Reilly expanded on this point very clearly in a July 19, 2010, column. ""If it were just about the Panthers, the story would be meaningless,"" O'Reilly wrote. ""But because Attorney General Eric Holder is involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges, the situation takes on some importance."" We're fact-checking the claim that the Obama administration made the call not to pursue a criminal civil rights case against the New Black Panther Party, because we think the answer puts the entire issue into a clearer context. Let's take a walk through the timeline to see who decided what and when. The 2008 election day incident was reported in the media immediately, and the Department of Justice decided to investigate. Officials weighed a number of prosecution options -- both criminal and civil. On Jan. 7, 2009, the Bush Administration Justice Department announced that it filed a civil lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party and three of its members. Specifically, they were alleged to have violated Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits intimidation, coercion or threats against ""any person for voting or attempting to vote."" The aims of the lawsuit were fairly limited: ""The Department seeks an injunction preventing any future deployment of, or display of weapons by, New Black Panther Party members at the entrance to polling locations."" In other words, the aim was to make sure they didn't do something similar again in the future. This section of the law does not subject violators to criminal penalties (fines or jail time, for example). The Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, which handles all racially motivated voter intimidation offenses, determined that ""the facts did not constitute a prosecutable violation of the federal criminal civil rights statutes,"" according to testimony provided by Thomas E. Perez , Assistant Attorney General, on May 14, 2010. Justice spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler confirmed to PolitiFact that that determination not to file criminal charges was made prior to the filing of the civil case. In other words, the decision not to pursue criminal charges was made by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division prior to the Obama administration. Perez also noted, ""In July 2009, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania declined prosecution in the matter. Our understanding is that local law enforcement officials also declined to pursue state criminal charges."" Again, none of the defendants responded to the civil complaint, so it's fair to say this was a slam-dunk case for the prosecution. But according to Perez, ""that did not absolve the Department of its legal and ethical obligations to ensure that any relief sought was consistent with the law and supported by the evidence."" And upon deeper review, the Justice Department decided to dismiss the cases against the New Black Panther Party, its leader Malik Shabazz, and Jackson (the guy without the nightstick at the polling place that day). In order to have violated the statute in question, the New Black Panther Party (which is not affiliated with the original Black Panther Party) would have had to ""direct a campaign of intimidation,"" and Perez noted that while the organization had posted a notice that 300 members of the party would be deployed at polling places on election day, the Philadelphia location where King Samir Shabazz was stationed was the only one where an incident occurred. Perez further noted that the group posted a message on its website -- prior to the civil action being filed -- which stated, ""Specifically, in the case of Philadelphia, the New Black Panther Party wishes to express that the actions of people purported to be members do not represent the official views of the New Black Panther Party and are not connected nor in keeping with our official position as a party."" The Justice Department, did, however, follow through with its case against King Samir Shabazz, concluding that his display of a nightstick at the polling place ""supported the allegation of voter intimidation."" The Department asked for, and got, an injunction prohibiting Shabazz from displaying a weapon within 100 feet of a Philadelphia polling location until 2012. Some may say the government was too lenient, that the case should not have been dropped against the three other defendants, or that the injunction against Shabazz should have extended nationwide -- not just in Philadelphia -- and for a much longer time (not just until 2012). Those decisions were made during the Obama administration. But the pundits have often blurred the distinction between the civil and criminal cases. O'Reilly and other Fox commentators have confused the issue by suggesting Holder and the Obama administration made the call not to pursue more serious charges against the New Black Panther Party members. Perez stated that the Civil Rights Division decided pre-Obama not to pursue more serious, criminal charges. So when O'Reilly brings on legal analysts who paint it as an outrage that the Justice Department did not pursue a criminal case, and the only person condemned by O'Reilly is Holder for not ""representing the United States in a fair and balanced way,"" that's misleading and misplaced. We think it's fair to hold Holder accountable for the decision to limit the civil case, but not the criminal one. We rate O'Reilly's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFCB5700>],/factchecks/2010/jul/23/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-blames-obama-administration-not-pursu/

Are Monica Wehby and Jason Conger 'causing devastating consequences' for unemployed Oregonians?
","One of the most contentious issues that Congress has faced since before Christmas break is whether to extend unemployment benefits for an estimated 1.6 million Americans. Lawmakers in Washington, D.C., have yet to agree on a plan. Senate Democrats generally favor an extension, while Republicans insist that any extension be offset by spending cuts elsewhere. The temporary extended benefits, meanwhile, expired Dec. 28, 2013. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, a D.C.-based group dedicated to maintaining Democratic control of the upper chamber, waded into the issue. In a Jan. 15, 2014, news release, Justin Barasky, the group’s national press secretary, blamed the lack of extension, in part, on two Oregon Republican senatorial candidates -- Portland physician Monica Wehby and state Rep. Jason Conger, R-Bend. Both hope to oppose the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Jeff Merkley, in the November general election. ""Monica Wehby and Jason Conger’s reckless refusal to support the renewal of unemployment benefits is causing devastating consequences for nearly 23,000 Oregonians looking for work and hurting the state’s economy more each day,"" Barasky wrote. Are Wehby and Conger ""causing devastating consequences"" for unemployed Oregonians? PolitiFact Oregon wondered how that could be, since neither candidate is even in the Senate. We contacted the Wehby and Conger campaigns. Conger, now in his second term in the Oregon House, confirmed on KXL’s ""The Lars Larson Show"" on Jan. 8, 2014, that he would not vote to extend unemployment benefits if he were in Congress. He told PolitiFact Oregon: ""I don’t think another extension of benefits will actually help people who have been long-term unemployed and already extended multiple times."" Wehby, in a statement, said she supports a temporary extension of benefits, but added, ""We need to find a way to pay for these extensions by cutting government waste."" However, representatives of both campaigns noted that neither candidate is in the U.S. Senate, so neither has any direct say on the issue. We contacted Barasky, who defended his assertions in an email. Regarding the candidates’ positions on benefits extensions, he referred to the original news release. It underscored Conger’s statements to Larson, which Conger confirmed. It also cited a Jan. 14, 2014, news story that ran on mycolumbiabasin.com that said that Wehby, following a swing through the state to meet with business owners, indicated ""she’s not so sure it’s the right way to go."" Barasky said another quote in the story demonstrates Wehby’s opposition to an extension. The story said U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., disputes the idea that long-term benefits dissuade workers from returning to work. It then added, ""Wehby thinks Wyden is wrong."" ""How is that anything but opposition?"" he wrote us. In our reading, however, Wehby was disputing Wyden’s take only on the effect of unemployment extensions. The question of an unemployment benefits extension did not come up at a debate last Saturday among GOP candidates, including Conger and Wehby, hoping to take on Merkley. If it had, Conger said he would have said no, but told us he commiserates with those looking for work. Wehby said she would have answered yes -- with the qualifier that any extension be paid for through spending offsets elsewhere. That pokes a hole in Barasky’s assertion that both candidates oppose an extension. On the larger question of whether the candidates are ""causing devastating consequences"" to unemployed Oregonians, Barasky said, ""We know they aren’t in the Senate, and our release doesn’t pretend they are. We are saying, if they were in the Senate, this is how they’d be voting and those votes would be hurting unemployed Oregonians."" But that’s not what his statement says. It accuses Conger and Wehby, through ""reckless refusal,"" of ""causing devastating consequences"" -- present tense -- for Oregon’s unemployed workers. That’s just wrong; neither is in a position to cast a vote on the issue, let alone cause ""devastating consequences"" for Oregonians. Even if one is elected to the Senate, he or she won’t be sworn in for nearly a year. Barasky, given the chance to revise the claim, doubled down, saying he was on ""solid ground."" We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A46C040>],/factchecks/2014/jan/28/justin-barasky/are-monica-wehby-and-jason-conger-causing-devastat/

Texas’ change in highway miles not No. 1 when adjusted for state size, population
","Gov. Rick Perry recently tweeted that his state outpaced others in new highways on his watch. ""Texas has added more than 6,600 new highway miles from 2001-2012, more than any other state over that time,"" Perry said Jan. 7, 2014, the same day he spoke at the Texas Transportation Forum about the importance of such infrastructure. A major reason that matters, according to a Perry press release issued that day, is that ""investments in roads and infrastructure directly impact Texas' economic competitiveness and companies' ability to do business in the state."" We wondered whether Texas outpaced every other state in the dozen years after Perry became governor in late 2000. The state Legislative Budget Board’s 2012-13 ""Fiscal Size-Up"" says Texas had about 80,000 miles of highway in 2012, specifically 28,441 miles of U.S. and state highways, 3,231 miles of interstate, 7,031 miles of frontage road, 40,939 miles of farm-to-market roads and ranch-to-market roads, and 331 miles of park roads. Those measurements are in ""centerline"" miles, the length of a highway. Another transportation measure is ""lane"" miles, which multiplies centerline miles by the number of lanes; a four-mile stretch of six-lane highway has 24 lane miles. Lane miles would reflect, for example, the widening of an older highway to ease congestion. Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed emailed web links to statistics from the Federal Highway Administration on lane miles of highway owned by state highway agencies in 2001 and 2012, to show how Perry reached his conclusion. Texas had the largest increase in highway lane miles in raw terms with 6,660 -- about 3 percent of Texas’ total 194,954 lane miles of state highway in 2012. Montana and Missouri were close behind in raw numbers, with 6,536 and 6,270 new lane miles, respectively. In centerline miles over those years, Texas’ state-owned highways gained 922, which ranked it fourth among the states. National commuting expert Alan Pisarski told us by phone that he thought Perry’s statistic sounded right and that other measures to check would be how mileage changed over time in relation to states’ size and population. Always worth remembering: Texas is real big. When we examine questions of which state has the most high school graduates or the most coal-fired plants, it’s important to take that bigness into account to get a real sense of how Texas is faring compared with other states with widely different populations and geographic areas. So, using U.S. Census Bureau data, we did a bit more math. Texas gained about 2/10 of a lane mile per square mile of area, ranking 21st in both 2001 and 2012. As its population ballooned, Texas’ lane miles of state-owned highway per 100,000 residents fell to 155, dropping it from 19th in 2001 to 23rd in 2012. Running those calculations for all 50 states suggests that Texas’ 2001-2012 change fell considerably shy of No. 1. Looking at the amount of change each state experienced, Texas had the 16th-largest gain in lane miles per square mile. Going by the change in highway lane miles per 100,000 residents, Texas’ drop placed it 42nd. Only six states gained ground in the population category -- ending up in 2012 with more lane miles per person than they had in 2001 -- and one of those was Michigan, the only state that lost population during this time. Over the same years, Texas saw the 12th largest increase in residents per square mile. Separately, we noted some oddities in our spreadsheet. Several states’ changes in lane mileage showed as negative numbers. As it turned out, the tables reflected changes that occurred when roads were reclassified -- say, when a state took over a county road or vice versa. Iowa, for example, apparently ""lost"" 1,266 lane miles from 2001 through 2012. Iowa Department of Transportation spokeswoman Andrea Henry told us by email that in 2002-03, her agency and Iowa cities and counties reevaluated the appropriate jurisdiction of public roads. ""Through a series of individual agreements and legislation, well over 700 miles of state roads were transferred from the Iowa DOT to individual cities and counties,"" she said, probably reducing the number of state lane miles by about 2,000. Together with lane miles added by new construction, she said, ""the net difference of a 1,266 mile reduction in lane miles is reasonable."" Texas Department of Transportation spokeswoman Veronica Beyer told us by email that according to that agency, the state gained 6,634 lane miles from 2001 through 2012, ""with the overwhelmingly vast majority of that being due to new construction (and not transfer of ownership)."" The federal agency didn’t record how many miles of new construction took place in each state. Without such a statistic, we can’t tell whether Texas’ lane miles were the most in the nation because Texas built the most state highways or because other states reclassified a lot of miles. In response to our findings, Nashed said, ""Given that we had to choose a number that represented the growth of the system, thus lane miles makes more sense than centerline miles (this way it incorporates taking a road from 2 to 3 lanes for example). ""The state to state miles per square mile or population comparison would not have made sense, to me, in this case,"" she said, noting how Michigan’s drop in population made it appear that ""their state system per capita actually shows significant growth over time even though they added just 6 new lane miles. Our ruling Perry tweeted, ""Texas has added more than 6,600 new highway miles from 2001-2012, more than any other state over that time."" This raw calculation stands up; Texas was No. 1 in total lane miles added.  But Texas is also nearly the biggest state. Adjusting for states’ differences in population and geographic area shows Texas’ change in highway miles was the 16th largest gain per square mile of area and the state came in 42nd when ranked on the change in highway miles per resident. We rate his statement as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Americans for Prosperity's Florida chapter says 3 GOP lawmakers got a 'failing grade' from conservatives
","It’s no surprise when a conservative advocacy group like Americans for Prosperity targets Democrats. But last month the Florida chapter launched a $250,000 media blitz against three veteran Republican state legislators. Their beef: The senators weren’t conservative enough on the group’s top policy priorities. The advertising campaign was directed at state Sens. Nancy Detert, R-Venice, Charlie Dean, R-Inverness, and Greg Evers, R-Baker, and it included YouTube videos, mailers, TV advertising and social media. In the videos, Americans for Prosperity said that each of the three legislators ""got a failing grade from conservatives."" The group says this claim referred to the organization’s ""Economic Freedom Scorecard"" for 2013, which grades state legislators on how they voted on 20 amendments and bills. While the ads make identical statements about Detert, Dean and Evers, Detert is the only one of those legislators to receive an actual F on the organization’s scorecard. The group gave Dean and Evers D's. (The AFP also gave D’s to Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, and Sen. Miguel de la Portilla, R-Coral Gables, although they weren’t targeted in the AFP blitz.) The fact that only one of the three targeted legislators got an F raised an immediate question for us. We also wondered whether there were other vote ratings from conservative groups that might have come to different conclusions. So we took a closer look. First, some background. Americans for Prosperity, or AFP, was started in 2004 partly by the billionaire libertarian industrialists, David and Charles Koch. David Koch is the chairman of the board for the AFP Foundation. The ad blast comes nearly a year before the November elections; so far, Detert and Evers are running unopposed, while Dean is termed out in 2016. Slade O’Brien, AFP’s Florida director, told the Tampa Bay Times in November, that ""we’re not going to make much progress with these three. But we’re putting the rest of the Legislature on notice. We’re letting them know that there is a group in Florida that is holding them accountable."" The AFP scorecard gave legislators a point for each vote in support of its position and extra votes for actions like sponsoring a bill, rather than just voting for it. Points were deducted for sponsorship of a bill the group opposed. The voting scorecard weighed such issues as the Internet sales tax, reduced regulation of agricultural lands and local regulatory transparency. But the AFP’s media blast focused on a few specific legislative votes by Dean, Detert and Evers -- on pension reform, professional sports facilities and parent empowerment for ailing schools, which is also known as the parent trigger bill. When we looked into other conservative, free-market or pro-business groups that had rated Florida legislators, we found that only AFP issued a failing grade to any of these three senators. The clearest example of a conservative vote scorecard in Florida comes from the American Conservative Union, which gave Detert, Dean and Evers each a score of 70 percent on nine issues that included pension reform, medical malpractice reform and the parent trigger bill. Several pro-business groups also gave the three legislators ratings that were well above ""failing."" While these groups are officially nonpartisan, their positions are often in tune with conservative priorities. • The Florida Chamber of Commerce gave Detert an 85, Dean a 90 and Evers an 82. • The Associated Industries of Florida, which promotes business and free enterprise, gave Dean 98 percent, Detert 93 percent and Evers 94 percent. • The Foundation for Florida's Future, which supported the parent trigger or parent empowerment bill and was founded by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, gave Detert and Evers 78 percent and Dean 83 percent. Our ruling AFP said that Sens. Evers, Detert and Dean ""got a failing grade from conservatives."" Detert did receive an F from the group, but the others received Ds -- a grade that, while not very good, usually suggests barely passing rather than ""failing."" Meanwhile, the American Conservative Union gave all three a rating higher than F. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280F5E936C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/28/americans-prosperity-florida/americans-prosperitys-florida-chapter-says-three-g/

Rand Paul says more than half of students at medical, dental and law schools are females
","Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee’s attempt to speak on women’s issues at a meeting of the Republican National Committee last week drew as much attention, if not more, than the party’s official business. At the meeting, Huckabee accused Democrats of believing that women ""cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government."" On CNN’s State of the Union, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a possible 2016 presidential hopeful, was asked to weigh in on Huckabee’s comments. He turned the question to female advancement in education and the workplace. ""I've seen the women in my family and how well they're doing,"" Paul said. ""My niece is in Cornell Vet School, and 85 percent of the people in vet school right now are women. Over half of the young people in medical school and dental school are women. Law school, the same way. I think women are doing very well, and I'm proud of how well we've come and how far we've come, and I think that some of the victimology and all this other stuff is trumped up."" Host Candy Crowley didn’t press Paul on his comment about women and advanced degrees, but we decided to weigh in. By the numbers Women are indeed seeking advanced degrees at rates that far outpace men — in fact, that has been the case for many years. In 1990, males made up 53 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds with an advanced degree (that is, a master’s degree or higher). By 2000, the percentages had flipped, with women holding 58 percent of post-bachelor’s degrees among the same demographic, according to the U.S. Census. The breakdown remained similar in 2009. Paul’s problem was that he happened to choose specific fields — medicine, dentistry and law — where the statistics tell a different story. Let’s start with medicine. In 2013, 83,472 individuals were enrolled in medical schools across the United States, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. About 38,950 were women, or 46.7 percent. That’s close to half, but not quite. And the percentage of women in med school actually dropped over the past decade. In 2004, women made up 48.2 percent of the 70,816 med school enrollees. Now let’s move on to dental school. As it turns out, dentistry numbers are pretty similar to medical colleges. According to an American Dental Association education survey, there were 11,613 men in dental schools in 2010-11, and 10,240 women, or about 46.9 percent of enrollees. Unlike what happened in med school, the gender gap has shrunk in dental school over the past 10 years. In 2001-02, the dental school population was 40 percent female and 60 percent male. Finally, we turn to the law. In law school, men make up the majority, as well, and at rates similar to medicine and dentistry. According to the American Bar Association, there were 146,288 people enrolled in a juris doctorate program in 2011-12 and 68,262, or 46.7 percent, were women. Participation rates among women in law schools are far higher than they were in 1950, when they made up just 3 percent of enrollees. By 1980, females made up 35 percent of all law school campuses. But as was the case with medical school, the share of women in law school has actually declined somewhat in recent years. In 1992-93, women were a slight majority of law school students, at 50.4 percent of enrollees. From 2002 to 2004, they were close at 49.0 percent. Since 2006, they have hovered around 47 percent. So Paul’s claim is 0-for-3. We reached out to Paul’s office and they pointed us to an American Enterprise Institute study. The research backed up the overall trend in higher education we already pointed out — women are earning more advanced degrees than men — but it didn’t weigh on the specific fields Paul singled out. We checked out one more possibility: Were women a minority of enrollees, but a majority of those who ultimately earned degrees, because more men were washing out before graduation? We found that’s not the case either. In 2011-12, more men than women finished their medical, dental and law school programs, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. For the record, there are three fields that require specific advanced degrees where women do outnumber men. Of the degrees earned in optometry and pharmacy in 2012, two-thirds went to women, and about 78 percent of veterinary degrees went to females. In the others — dentistry, medicine, osteopathic medicine, podiatry, chiropractic, law and theology — men were the majority. Our ruling Paul said more than half of the enrollees in medical, dentistry and law schools are female. While women are close to 50 percent of enrollees in all three fields, they’re not a majority in any of them. And in both law and medicine, the trendlines for female enrollment have actually fallen in recent years. We rate Paul’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BF4740>],/factchecks/2014/jan/28/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-more-half-students-medical-dental-a/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Steve Stockman']","
John Cornyn was neutral in 2012 U.S. Senate race until Ted Cruz won Republican nomination
","An occasionally out-of-pocket Republican challenger to U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas has leveled eye-catching charges about the second-term senator, calling Cornyn liberal and also suggesting he’s been supportive of the Obamacare law that Cornyn initially voted against in late 2009. Cornyn’s campaign spokesman, Drew Brandewie, emailed us this month asking us to look into another claim by U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Friendswood. On a Stockman campaign web page, Stockman said Cornyn supported Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the 2012 Senate election won by Tea Party favorite Ted Cruz, who started the race as a longshot. Stockman’s words: ""And while John Cornyn backed his pal David Dewhurst, I back Ted Cruz."" We're not sure how to pin whether Stockman now backs Cruz; the state's junior senator isn't on a ballot in 2014. We focused, instead, on whether Cornyn backed Dewhurst over Cruz in 2012. Stockman, whom we were unable to reach, did not elaborate on his claim on his website. During the 2012 race, Dewhurst, lieutenant governor since 2003, was the early favorite as an established statewide officeholder; Cruz hadn't previously run for office. And along the way there was a hint of grit between Cruz and Cornyn, whom Cruz publicly declined to endorse for a Senate party leadership post. On March 5, 2012, we rated as Half True a Dewhurst claim that Cruz had slurred Republican senators including Cornyn as ""graybeards"" and ""spineless jellyfish."" Cruz used those descriptives when talking about Republican candidates, conceivably including senators whom he viewed as insufficiently conservative. Yet it wasn’t clear Cruz was referring to Cornyn. But Brandewie pointed out news accounts indicating Cornyn was neutral in the race until Cruz won their party’s nomination. These included a news blog post by the Dallas Morning News on the night of the Senate runoff July 31, 2012, stating that Cornyn—""who remained neutral in the race, despite Cruz’s reluctance to back him in… his bid for Senate GOP whip—praised Cruz for a ‘well-deserved and well-earned victory.’"" The post quoted Cornyn as saying in a statement: ""This has been a hard-fought and spirited primary battle and the people of Texas would have been fortunate to have any one of these well-qualified candidates as their next U.S. senator."" Separately, we spotted a July 27, 2012, news blog post by the Austin American-Statesman stating that Cornyn had cast his Senate runoff ballot that morning without announcing a preferred aspirant. The post quoted Cornyn as saying: ""I’m not picking sides for a very practical reason. I’m going to have to work — it will be my pleasure to work — with whoever the Republican nominee is. We are looking forward to an ally and reinforcements to help us fight the battle for the free-enterprise system and help turn the country around."" A July 29, 2012, Statesman news story noted that Cornyn that year was chairing the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps Republicans in Senate races. Cornyn, the story said, ""has kept mum about his home state race and instead has focused on getting other Republicans elected across the country."" We found no news stories saying Cornyn was backing Dewhurst in the race. Our ruling Stockman said Cornyn supported Dewhurst over Cruz for the U.S. Senate in 2012. There’s no evidence of that. In contrast, news reports say Cornyn revealed no preference before congratulating Cruz for winning the Republican nomination, making Stockman's claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['Georgia', 'Financial Regulation', 'Rick Allen']","
Past votes contradict candidate's claim
","A tweet has some feathers flyin’ between a Georgia congressman and a candidate who wants his job. At issue, U.S. Rep. John Barrow’s position on auditing the Federal Reserve. Rick Allen, a Republican running against the Augusta Democrat, posted a message on his Twitter page about Barrow. ""You want to #AuditTheFED? @RepJohnBarrow doesn't,"" the tweet read. True? ""This is probably as big a lie as you can get from Rick Allen,"" Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo said in one email. "" ‘Audit the Fed’ is yet another example of John Barrow trying to be on both sides of the issue,"" said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Allen. Barrow represents one of the few swing congressional districts in Georgia, and Republicans have been unsuccessful in beating him despite great efforts in recent election cycles. Barrow is the only white Democrat from the Deep South currently serving in the House. So who’s right here? PolitiFact Georgia decided to find out. First, a little background. The Federal Reserve helps set national monetary policy, and its decisions have great influence on Wall Street and the world economy. A movement to audit the Federal Reserve, commonly called the Fed, gained momentum in 2009 after the financial crisis a year earlier. Lawmakers wanted to examine the Fed’s emergency lending to financial institutions in the months leading up to and after the crisis. At its peak, the Fed's lending totaled $1.16 trillion, according to news accounts. One of the leaders of the Audit the Fed movement was U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, a now-retired House member from Texas who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008 and 2012. Paul introduced a bill in February 2009 to conduct an audit. Called the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009, House Resolution 1207 would politicize their work, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke countered. ""(W)hat is so outrageous is that the Federal Reserve can literally deal in trillions of dollars,"" Paul said on the House floor in May 2010. ""They don't get the money authorized. They don't get the money appropriated. They just create it, and they get involved in bailing out their friends."" Paul’s legislation had been inserted into a House version of a bill involving the regulating of Wall Street that he boasted at the time had more than 300 sponsors. One of those co-sponsors was Barrow, McLagan noted. McLagan pointed to a vote by Barrow on the bill on June 30, 2010, to support his candidate’s claim. Barrow voted against what is described in federal records as ""a motion to recommit a conference report with instructions."" ""(Barrow) co-sponsored the bill, then voted against it. That is John Barrow in a nutshell -- everything is half true because he supports both sides of every issue,"" McLagan said. ""He is tailor-made for PolitiFact."" Congress defines a motion to recommit with instructions as one final chance to amend a bill before it is passed by the full House of Representatives. The motion included language to audit the Fed that was similar to what Paul had proposed a year earlier, according to a pro-Ron Paul website. Eight minutes later, the House passed, with Barrow’s support, a financial industry bill that had been agreed upon a day earlier by House and Senate lawmakers. Paul supporters said the 2,000-page bill had a ""watered-down audit provision"" limited to loans made by the Fed during the height of the economic crisis. Carbo, Barrow’s spokesman, explained the vote against the motion to recommit. ""[T]he main purpose of an MTR is to send the bill back to the Committee of jurisdiction, effectively killing the bill. Mr. Barrow, was already in support of the bill (which included audit language), so it would have been counterproductive to send it back to Committee when negotiators had already come to an agreement,"" Carbo said via email. ""The MTR, in addition to ‘killing’ the underlying bill, made some other changes that weren't clear at the moment of the vote."" Two years later, Paul tried again. In July 2012, the House voted 327-98 in favor of a bill he titled the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2012. Barrow had signed on to the bill as a co-sponsor in July 2011, and he voted in favor of the legislation. The bill was forwarded to the Senate, but no vote was taken there, records show. In January 2013, another Georgia House member philosophically tied to Paul introduce another bill to audit the Fed. This was one filed by U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican from Athens. Barrow is one of 181 House members who co-sponsored the bill. The legislation, though, has not come up for a vote in the House. McLagan insisted his candidate’s Twitter post was correct, citing the 2010 vote. McLagan said Barrow was slow in co-sponsoring the subsequent legislation to audit the Federal Reserve. In short, McLagan said, Barrow is not truly committed to auditing the Fed. ""He’s on both sides of every issue,"" McLagan said repeatedly of Barrow. To sum up, Allen’s Twitter page posted a claim that Barrow does not want to audit the Federal Reserve. Barrow, though, has co-sponsored and voted for legislation in favor of an audit. We rate Allen’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B11BC0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/28/rick-allen/past-votes-contradict-candidates-claim/

Alex Sink supported 'more taxes on water and TV,' Republicans say
","Democrats and Republicans have drawn the battle lines for Pinellas County’s open U.S. House seat, with candidates’ backgrounds serving as ammunition. While Democrats go after David Jolly’s history as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C., the GOP is attacking Alex Sink’s record on issues in Florida. One oft-repeated charge is that Sink is a ""tax and spender Florida can’t afford."" In a TV commercial released on Jan. 22, 2014, the National Republican Congressional Committee charges that Sink supports Obamacare, then adds charges about her stance on taxes. ""Sink has supported higher taxes, too,"" the ad says. ""Higher property taxes. Higher sales taxes. More taxes on water and TV too."" Sink, a former banking executive, only held one elected office -- Florida’s chief financial officer from 2007 to 2010 -- so we weren’t sure whether it was accurate that she supported higher taxes ""on water and TV."" And since both are important to her prospective constituents, we decided to tune in focus on that claim in this item. An old problem The NRCC’s claim stems from Sink’s tenure on the Governor's Commission on Education, back in 1997. The bipartisan group of educators, business leaders and lawmakers was co-chaired by Democratic Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, a Democrat, and Jack Critchfield, a Republican and chairman of Florida Progress Corp. Sink, then president of the Florida Banking Group for NationsBank, was joined on the board by executives of such companies as Walt Disney Attractions, Eckerd Corp. and CSX Transportation. The group, appointed by Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles in 1996, had no legislative power, but it did make recommendations about how to pay for school construction at a time when overcrowding was plaguing some districts. Faced with full schools and outdated facilities, one topic that drew the board’s attention was searching for ways to build more classroom space. One of the commission’s potential solutions was unveiled in February 1997: Expand a 2.5 percent utilities tax on the gross receipts of electricity, natural and manufactured gas and telecommunication services to include water, sewer, cable and solid waste utilities. The group proposed instituting the new tax on those utilities in 0.5 percent increments over five years, which would eventually cost the average household $24 per year, and would raise millions for school construction. Sink was in favor of instituting the entire tax all at once, rather than over the course of five years. Lawmakers opposed this, especially House Republicans, who in 1997 held a majority in that wing of the Legislature for the first time in 122 years. ""We ought to say we have a crisis, and this is what we really think should happen,"" Sink said. ""If the politics go the other way, so be it."" The idea of instituting the tax all at once failed in a vote by the commissioners, 18-12. The group spent the rest of the year looking for other solutions, including a video lottery and a variety of local taxes. Ultimately, all was for naught, as the divided Legislature debated new taxes without coming to an agreement during the regular session. Chiles called a special session in the fall to deal with the school construction issue, with lawmakers eventually agreeing to use Florida lottery profits for $2.5 billion in bonds, plus $200 million from surplus revenues. That lottery money amounted to $180 million per year over 30 years. The deal was considered a victory by both Democrats and Republicans, since it built new schools without relying on new taxes. Our ruling The NRCC said Alex Sink supported ""more taxes on water and TV"" in the past. She did indeed support such taxes, though that happened during her tenure on an advisory panel 17 years ago. Sink didn’t have any control over the state’s tax structure, either then or in her future job as the state’s chief financial officer. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4C8800>],/factchecks/2014/jan/27/national-republican-congressional-committee/alex-sink-supported-more-taxes-water-and-tv-nrcc-s/

Coulter: Fox News broke Bush drunk driving story in 2000
","In the world of cable television news, most people generally agree that Fox News caters to a more conservative audience and MSNBC a more liberal one. But conservative pundit Ann Coulter cautioned against seeing the news each network produces the same way. In a recent interview with Piers Morgan on CNN, Coulter used the coverage of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and an old story about President George W. Bush to draw a distinction between the two cable networks. ""I don't have a job so all I do is watch TV,"" Coulter said. ""If you watch no station but MSNBC, you have no idea what they're talking about on Fox. On Fox, I promise you, they're reporting the Chris Christie scandal -- maybe not 24 hours a day like the 9/11 attack."" Coulter then pivoted to talking about the run-up to the 2000 presidential election and how reporters found out that Bush had a drunk driving arrest on his record. ""That story hurt George Bush in the 2000 presidential election,"" Coulter said. ""Who broke it? Fox News."" Is Coulter rewriting history or does she have her facts right? We thought we’d check. Bad news at a critical moment Headed into the final week before Election Day, Nov. 7, 2000, polls showed a razor-close contest between Bush and Democratic nominee Vice President Al Gore. With the disputed results in Florida, we know now how accurate those polls were. Just five days before the election, the country learned that in 1976 police in Maine had arrested Bush for drunk driving. His past troubles with drinking were already on the record but until Nov. 2, an arrest was not part of the narrative. The first news organization that ran the story was Fox News. It carried an item at 6 p.m. that day. Once Fox News ran it, the Associated Press spread the story to all the broadcasters and newspapers that subscribe to its service. To Coulter’s point, the broader public first learned about Bush’s arrest through Fox News. Uncovering a story vs. reporting it In the news business, breaking a story has a particular meaning. A reporter breaks a story by being the one who found it first. In the competitive world of journalism, these morsels are precious and newsrooms generally hold their cards close to the chest until they are ready to spring their scoop on the world. The release of the Bush arrest followed a different path. Fox News took this story from a local affiliate. Erin Fehlau, a reporter with the Portland Fox affiliate WPXT, first got wind of the arrest on the afternoon of Nov. 2. While working on another assignment, a police officer mentioned overhearing a conversation about Bush and drunk driving. Fehlau quickly found the case number and began following the paper trail. Back at the station, Fehlau’s news director, who was relatively new, didn’t know if this was old news. Later that afternoon, he called Fox News in New York City to find out. Fox News contacted the Bush campaign where a staffer confirmed that Bush had been arrested. Assistant news director Matt Ledin remembers what happened next. ""I was sitting in my office and I saw Fox reporting our story."" Ledin told PunditFact. ""I think they credited us, but I was surprised."" That was at 6 p.m. At 7 p.m., WPXT had the story in its newscast. At 10 p.m., Fehlau broadcast her report with all the details. Fox News had no hand in doing the digging that brought this story to light. WPXT was an independent news operation in 2000, owned by Pegasus Communications, a Pennsylvania corporation that paid for the rights to run Fox programs. Fehlau was generally credited with breaking the story. Fehlau won the National Clarion Award for her work while the station won the regional Edward R. Murrow Award for investigative journalism. ""CBS, ABC and NBC, all had satellite trucks out in front of our station the next morning,"" Ledin said. ""Fehlau was on all the network shows."" Our ruling Coulter said Fox News broke the story of George W. Bush’s 1976 drunk driving arrest. In terms of being the first to broadcast the story, that is correct. On the other hand, breaking a story has the strong meaning of having made the effort to uncover something that was obscure. In that sense, a local news station that happened to be a Fox affiliate gets the credit. While Fehlau's station was contracted to run Fox programming, it is independetly owned and not part of Fox News, the cable news channel.

Democrats say David Jolly's old firm lobbied for millions in foreign aid for 'a dictator in Pakistan'
","Pinellas Republican congressional candidate David Jolly’s lobbyist past was always going to be a favorite target for his opponents. In the GOP primary, Kathleen Peters tried the ""lobbyist"" attack, attempting to tie Jolly to Obamacare in a claim we rated False. (We’ve done some other checks on his lobbying, too.) But Peters’ loss to Jolly hasn’t stopped Democrats from trying to rap Jolly as a lobbyist ahead of the general election. A new commercial released Jan. 21 by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee focused not on a subject that Jolly himself worked on, but rather on a client represented by his former employer. The ad refers to a quote from Jolly saying ""I’m proud of the work that I’ve done."" It then asks a hypothetical: ""Is Jolly proud of lobbying for special interests that received over $3,000,000 in taxpayer-funded earmarks? Or the firm lobbying for hundreds of millions for a dictator in Pakistan as we face record debt?"" These charges are paired with images of Pervez Musharraf, the former president of Pakistan. One of those claims gave us pause: Did one of Jolly’s firms really have anything to do with ""a dictator in Pakistan""? For the answer, we need to head to K Street. Did Pakistan retain Jolly’s firm? Jolly served as an aide to the late U.S. House Rep. C.W. Bill Young for almost 20 years before leaving his office to work for lobbying firm Van Scoyoc Associates Inc. on Jan. 1, 2007. He worked for Van Scoyoc until the end of 2010, then formed his own firm, Three Bridges Advisors. We are confident that Jolly didn’t ever lobby for anyone in Pakistan. His office denies it, his records confirm it and the DCCC doesn’t claim it. But the DCCC’s claim is carefully worded, implicating Jolly’s firm -- not Jolly personally. And there is plenty of evidence that Van Scoyoc did lobbying work for Pakistan. Van Scoyoc was one of several lobbying firms retained by Pakistan’s government between 2005 and 2008 to lobby for the country’s interests, particularly foreign aid. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Pakistan was viewed as a vital ally in the search for Osama bin Laden and the subsequent war in Afghanistan, making Musharraf an important strategic partner. DCCC national press secretary Joshua Schwerin said the commercial specifically refers to two appropriations that benefited Pakistan -- the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, setting aside millions to train and equip Pakistani armed forces, including the Pakistan Frontier Corps to fight militant Islamic groups; and fiscal year 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act’s Foreign Military Financing Program, to supply the South Asian country’s army, air force and navy. Van Scoyoc confirmed it was employed by the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to discuss defense and economic issues, including the bills the DCCC references. The firm added that dollar amounts attached to those bills weren’t listed in filings, because the filings focus on discussions rather than outcomes. A Foreign Agents Registration Act form listing lobbying activities shows Van Scoyoc engaged in dozens of meetings with members of Congress and congressional staffers, the Department of Defense and media outlets between July 1 and Dec. 31, 2007. Those meetings would have been supportive of the strategic partnership with Musharraf, who was in power until August 2008. Both the NDAA and the appropriations bill were listed as lobbying subjects on the disclosure form. The form also confirms that Pakistan had terminated its relationship with the lobbying firm Cassidy & Associates and hired Ogilvy Public Relations during the same time frame. Records show that the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act ended up paying out $131 million, including $75 million for the Pakistan Frontier Corps. The Pakistani military eventually used $298 million from the Foreign Military Financing Program that year. And that’s just the totals for 2008. Washington continued funding the program at similar levels. (The Pakistan Frontier Corps funding was cut back to $25 million in 2009 and dropped after that.) For its services, Van Scoyoc received between $30,000 to as much as $55,000 a month from Pakistan’s government. The more than $1 billion in total economic and military aid Pakistan received in 2008 is not unusually high for a U.S. ally in a troubled but strategically important region, especially with a war right next door in Afghanistan. That number also doesn’t include more than $1 billion per year the country got through the Pentagon’s Coalition Support Funds, which technically reimburse the nation for allowing American armed forces and their allies to use air bases and similar facilities.  Egypt received about $1.5 billion that same year. Israel took in almost $2.4 billion. In all, foreign aid accounted for about 1.6 percent of the total U.S. budget that year. Despite the country’s strategic importance, continued aid to Pakistan has drawn some criticism within the United States -- even before it became known that Osama bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad. And when the United States learned of his location, President Barack Obama took action without informing Pakistan first, for fear that elements within the Pakistani government or military might tip off the al Qaeda chief, who had managed to live undeterred in Pakistan for a decade. ""In the early years post-9/11, Pakistan’s involvement was essential,"" said Daniel Markey, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""By 2007, there was frustration with Musharraf’s actions … At the very least, he was minimally satisfying needs for the U.S., to put it charitably."" Was Musharraf a dictator? Is it fair to call Musharraf, whose name was not specifically mentioned in the ad, a dictator? It depends whom you ask. In 2007, Congressional Quarterly Weekly quoted Brookings Institution fellow Bruce Riedel, a former Bill Clinton adviser on Near East and South Asian affairs and 30-year CIA veteran, saying that Van Scoyoc was doing a good job ""selling what is essentially a military dictatorship."" Musharraf, a general, was Chief of Army Staff in 1999 when he led a bloodless coup ousting a civilian (albeit ineffectual, to many observers) government led by Nawaz Sharif. Musharraf re-instituted military rule in the country, and his tenure was marked by constitutional disputes, protests, economic hardship, territorial battles, and tensions between Islamist militant and secular factions in the government. Musharraf eventually gave up his Army position in 2007 and resigned after he lost support in 2008 parliamentary elections and faced impeachment. He went into exile in November 2008, only to return last year ahead of May elections. He was arrested, facing a host of charges, including suspicion of conspiring to murder political rivals, and was placed under house arrest. He has been released, but he is barred from leaving the country. Now he’s on trial for treason (largely at the behest of Sharif, who was re-elected last year) for such actions as detaining judges, suspending the constitution and imposing emergency rule in November 2007. Musharraf is currently attempting to leave the country to seek medical attention for a heart problem, but many consider this a ruse to escape trial. When we asked Riedel whether he thought the DCCC’s description of Musharraf was fair, he said it was. ""Musharraf is without question a former dictator,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. ""He took power in a military coup, ruled as a military dictator and was overthrown by the judiciary and popular demonstrations. He is now ... on trial for his abuses of power in Pakistan. He double-dealt the U.S. in power, promising help against al-Qaida while he supported the Afghan Taliban to kill our troops in Afghanistan."" Not everybody is on board with this assessment, however. Khurram Husain, a Karachi-based journalist who is currently at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, said the term isn’t so cut-and-dried. ""I think anyone who seizes power through force, then changes the rules of the game to legitimize his coup, then allows an elected parliament to come into being but retains the power to dissolve that parliament or even individual members of the parliament can be called a dictator,"" Husain said. He added that he calls him a dictator in his own writing. Still, Husain added that during Musharraf’s time, executive power was in the hands of a civilian prime minister, elected by a parliament full of directly elected representatives. That’s different than the way dictators in parts of Africa and the Middle East have ruled, he said. Some say Musharraf ""couldn’t really dictate anything and had to work to build some modicum of consensus before getting his way, and often found the Supreme Court struck down his government’s policies and actions and therefore cannot be called a dictator,"" Husain said. Our ruling The DCCC’s commercial charges that Jolly’s former firm lobbied ""for hundreds of millions (of dollars) for a dictator in Pakistan."" The ad uses guilt by association, leveraging a widespread American distaste for dictators in general -- and uneasiness with the U.S.-Pakistan relationship in particular -- in a quest to damage Jolly, who, in reality, was close to neither. On the other hand, the ad phrases its allegation carefully. It doesn’t claim that Jolly himself lobbied for Pakistan, but rather that his former employer, Van Scoyoc Associates Inc., did. And on that point, the ad is correct. So too, experts say, is the ad’s description of Musharraf as a dictator. This ad treads close to the line, implying Jolly’s firm did something unethical when, so far as we know, it acted lawfully and as other lobbying firms regularly do. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097722040>],/factchecks/2014/jan/27/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-say-david-jollys-old-firm-lobbied-millio/

Rick Scott says it takes two days to get an environmental permit in Florida
","Gov. Rick Scott, who has drawn criticism from environmentalists for his strongly pro-business policies, this week called for an increase in spending for conservation projects on waterways and in the Everglades. At a Jan. 21, 2014, event in Tallahassee to honor 125 Department of Environmental Protection employees, Scott announced a budget request that includes efforts to protect and restore springs. He then made a statement praising the speed at which such employees work: ""Recently, Florida has successfully reduced the environmental permitting time down to just two days. That’s great."" In a press gaggle following the event, DEP Secretary Herschel Vinyard Jr. -- a Scott appointee -- was asked about that two-day timetable. He didn’t back up his boss: ""We're actually at about 32, 33 days is our average permit processing time. So I'm not exactly sure what was mentioned,"" Vinyard said. (Tampa Bay Times reporter Steve Bousquet was at the press gaggle and recorded the comments. We also confirmed Scott’s comments in his written prepared remarks.) Once we started digging, it became clear that Scott was talking about an entirely different type of permit. Let’s go deep into the weeds to discern the differences between these two types of permits. Permitting process at two state agencies There is a license that takes on average two days to obtain -- but it’s not an environmental permit. ""Under Gov. Scott’s administration, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation has reduced professional license processing time by more than 60 percent from an average of six days to two days,"" said Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz in an email. Those professional licenses are for a range of jobs including auctioneers, hair braiders, geologists, realtors and veterinarians. For these permits, it now takes two days to process the application. In some instances, applicants have to complete other steps -- for example, to pass an exam or receive board certification, said Department of Business and Professional Regulation spokeswoman Tajiana Ancora-Brown. It takes longer to process an environmental permit, though the lag time has dropped. It took the Department of Environmental Protection 87.7 days in 2010-11 to produce permits. It’s now 33.7 days on average. This covers permits related to waste, water and air. Typically, the applicants seeking such permits are businesses, though on occasion, homeowners may apply, too. For instance, a resident who wants to build on a wetland on their property would have to file an application, said Patrick Gillespie, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. Officials for both the Department of Business and Professional Regulation and the Department of Environmental Protection told us they had sped up the process in part by emphasizing online applications. At DEP, they also added a ""pre-application meeting"" for applicants to go over the regulations and reduce the chance their application would arrive incomplete. In 2012, Scott signed a bill that reduced the amount of time to approve certain permits -- for example wetlands permits -- from 90 days to 60 days, earning kudos from business groups. In December 2012, DEP employees who improved customer service including speeding up the permitting process received bonuses. But environmentalists have raised concerns. While the department found more than $500,000 for bonuses, it also laid off 58 employees. State Rep. Mark Pafford, D-West Palm Beach, told the Tampa Bay Times that the bonuses sent the wrong message to employees. ""You’re arguably providing an incentive to turn your head,"" Pafford said. ""You’re giving someone a bonus for them not to take the time required when reviewing permits. That’s dangerous for an agency called the Department of Environmental Protection."" Our ruling Scott said, ""Recently, Florida has successfully reduced the environmental permitting time down to just two days."" Scott was mistaken; he was actually referring to the amount of time it takes to get a professional license from the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. During Scott’s tenure, the state has reduced the amount of time it takes to get an environmental permit to about 34 days. However, what he said was incorrect. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AC3980>],/factchecks/2014/jan/27/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-it-takes-two-days-get-environmenta/

Wisconsin Democratic Party says state budget surpluses common nationally
","Why the big surplus predicted in the state budget? Gov. Scott Walker says wise government belt-tightening and reforms, tax cuts and business-friendly deregulation boosted hiring and the economy, promising now to help fill state coffers with extra income-tax revenue. When Walker made that claim in his State of the State address on Jan. 22, 2014, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin begged to differ. ""Scott Walker’s ""surplus"" isn’t built on prudent financial decisions -- it’s built on disinvestments in our future that harm the economic security of the middle class,"" a Democratic news release issued during the speech argued. ""Walker’s first budget cut nearly one billion dollars from public schools and our technical college system that provides critical job training programs."" Then the party added this: ""The national economic recovery has led to higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state in the nation, including Wisconsin."" Before Walker’s speech fades into history, let’s check the claim that Wisconsin is far from alone in enjoying a firmer financial footing. Wisconsin is projected to have a $1 billion surplus at the end of the two-year budget period covering July 2013 to July 2015 -- almost all of it because tax collections are rising faster than expected, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau said in January. The predicted surplus -- expected revenues exceeding planned expenditures -- is a notable switch from shortfalls that forced Wisconsin and other states into emergency changes to keep budgets balanced during the Great Recession and its immediate aftermath. We asked Democratic Party spokesperson Melissa Baldauff to back up the claim of ""higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state."" She cited an Associated Press story from January 2014 that said that ""almost all states will see fairly decent surpluses"" in their 2014 budgets. That story quoted the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO). We followed up with Scott Pattison, executive director of the budget officer’s group. He confirmed the projection. The 2013 stock market surge will goose income tax collections, Pattison said, and many states budgeted conservatively for 2014, not foreseeing the market’s runup. That, he said, means surpluses are in store for fiscal year 2014, which for most states ends by mid-year. And that comes on the heels of the 2013 budget year in which ""37 states exceeded original (revenue) forecasts, six states were on target and seven states ended fiscal 2013 below the original revenue estimate,"" according to the nonpartisan budget association’s December 2013 report, ""The Fiscal Survey of States."" Baldauff also cited that report. The revenue windfalls meant surpluses were common, the report said. So the Democrats’ claim of ""higher than expected tax revenues"" and resulting widespread surpluses was confirmed by the group. We broadened our view, checking with the National Conference of State Legislatures, which also regularly tracks state budgets. ""State fiscal conditions continued to improve in fiscal year (FY) 2013,"" the group said in its ""State Budget Actions FY 2013 and FY 2014.""  General fund revenue growth was notably strong and outpaced projections in most states."" Did that leave states with extra money to play with? Yes, the group said. ""At the same time, expenditures were generally on target,"" its report said. ""The combination of these factors enabled many states to shore up reserves and support supplemental expenditures. Overall, the fiscal situation was solid in almost every state in FY 2013."" In another report, the group noted in January 2014 that ""in a dramatic turn from recent years, California lawmakers will consider how to allocate a potential budget surplus—yes, a surplus."" In its ""State Legislatures Magazine"" in January 2014, the group added: ""Driven by improving revenues and on-target expenditures, states entered fiscal year 2014 in better economic shape than they have been in years."" The revenue collection boost was ""somewhat unexpected,"" it said, and many states used the excess to supplement appropriations or fortify their rainy day funds. Early in fiscal 2014 pointed, state revenue collections were meeting or exceeding targets in most states, the group reported. Few are predicting, though, that revenue gains will be as strong as in 2013. Many states planned for that, said Pattison of the budget officers organization, fearing that the 2013 rise was a one-time event. Our rating The Democratic Party of Wisconsin generated this claim: ""The national economic recovery has led to higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state in the nation, including Wisconsin."" State budget watchers confirm a widespread recovery in tax revenues as the nation continues to edge out of the Great Recession. This fiscal year likely will not match 2013 in tax-revenue growth, but states predicted that and most should see surpluses by mid 2014, as most did in 2013.

Gillespie says Obamacare wouldn't have passed without Warner's vote
","Republican Ed Gillespie opened his bid for the U.S. Senate this month by dropping responsibility for Obamacare on the toes of incumbent Democrat Mark Warner. Gillespie -- a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and former advisor to President George W. Bush -- announced his candidacy on Jan. 16. Five days later, he launched a web ad featuring 2009 video snippets of Gillespie criticizing Obamacare and Warner defending it. The screen turns black and these words appear: ""Obamacare passed by just one vote in the Senate. It wouldn’t have passed without Mark Warner’s vote."" We explored whether Warner’s vote was essential to passage of the health care package. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said the claim is based on a vote Warner cast in 2009 to prevent a Senate filibuster on Obamacare. Under the Senate’s cloture rules, it takes 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to end debate on most types of legislation and allow an up or down vote on the bill. On Dec. 23, 2009, the Senate voted 60-39 to halt debate on Obamacare. Warner joined all of his fellow Democrats and two independents in voting to stop a threatened Republican filibuster. The next day, the Senate passed Obamacare with an identical 60-39 vote. But Warner’s vote wasn’t as important this time because only a simple majority was required to approve the legislation. We should note that Warner is hardly the first Democratic senator to be attacked for his or her vote to end the filibuster. Republicans have charged each of at least four other Democrats with casting ""the deciding vote."" In Virginia last November, then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli claimed Warner cast ""the tie-breaking vote"" to pass Obamacare. PolitiFact’s standard ruling on those claims has been Mostly False. We, and our colleagues in  other states, have said it’s misleading to accuse one senator of casting the pivotal ballot when the same could be said of 59 others who voted to end the filibuster. Our ruling Gillespie says ""Obamacare passed by one vote in the Senate. It wouldn’t have passed without Mark Warner’s vote."" This is an improvement on past Republican efforts to blame Warner for casting the deciding vote to block a filibuster against Obamacare when, in fact, he was joined by 59 colleagues. It casts Warner as part of a collective weight that tipped the scales -- not the final grain of sand. Warner was one of 60 who voted to block the filibuster -- the bare number required under Senate rules. That allowed the Senate the following day to vote on the Obamacare bill and here’s where Gillespie’s statement comes up a little bit short. The bill, with Warner’s support, passed by a 60-39 vote. But since it only required a simple majority in the 100-member Senate to approve the legislation, Warner’s vote was not essential this time around. The actual Obamacare bill would have passed with or without him. So Gillespie’s statement is largely accurate but needs a technical clarification. We rate it Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F0DC0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/27/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-obamacare-wouldnt-have-passed-witho/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'National Republican Senatorial Committee']","
ObamaCare fears spill over into public safety arena
","The National Republican Senatorial Committee tapped into a big fear in a Jan. 9 press release. The committee said cities and towns could be facing financial upheaval because of the often-derided employer mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. That provision requires that employers with more than 50 workers to provide health coverage to those putting in at least 30 hours a week. ""Seventy-seven percent of Georgia's fire departments are volunteer, and it is unfair and unfortunate that those firefighters and the communities they protect are the latest Obamacare victims,"" Brook Hougesen, the committee’s press secretary, said in the statement. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the NRSC had accurately sounded the alarm on yet another problem with the Obamacare rollout. Or was the claim all wet? When we started checking into the statement, it became apparent that people from the local firehouse to the halls of Congress were concerned. Joe O’Conor, Peachtree City’s fire chief, said his city’s full-time employees have an excellent benefits package that could not be replicated for its volunteer firefighters. ""Our annual budget could not possibly allow us to extend comparable health care benefits to part-time and volunteer firefighters,"" he said. Peachtree City Fire and Rescue runs with a blend of full-time, part-time and volunteer firefighters and EMT/paramedics. The volunteers receive a nominal stipend so they don’t have to pull from the family budget to cover costs such as gas, child care or food while they are at the fire station, O’Conor said. It’s much the same across Georgia, where 77 percent to 78 percent of firefighters are volunteers, said Glenn Allen, a spokesman for state Insurance and Fire Safety Commissioner Ralph T. Hudgens. In addition to small stipends, some local governments have workers’ compensation coverage for volunteer firefighters in case of injury at a fire scene or when the firefighters are in transit. But none is paid a salary. ""That’s why they’re called volunteers,"" Allen said. The NRSC statement warned that Obamacare requirements, if forced upon volunteer fire departments, could, among other things, ""result in higher taxes on Georgia families or penalties for the departments, many of which are already struggling financially."" The committee cites an Associated Press report that says volunteer firefighters could be affected by the law. ""Obamacare has been a disaster, and now volunteer firefighers and the communities that rely on them are the latest victims of this terrible law,"" Hougesen said. The committee, which brags that it is ""the only national organization solely devoted to electing Republicans to the U.S. Senate,"" also took a swipe in its statement at Michelle Nunn, the best-known Democrat in Georgia’s U.S. Senate race. The NRSC accused her of being ""adamantly loyal"" to the new health care law and ""prioritizing politics ahead of Georgia’s first responders."" But a day after the NRSC released its statement, Mark Mazur, the U.S. Treasury Department’s assistant secretary for tax policy, appeared to put the matter to rest. He wrote in a blog that the final regulations under Obamacare are going to include an exemption for volunteer emergency workers. Mazur’s blog seemed to ease minds in the fire services community. William Metcalf, president and chairman of the board of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, put out a statement, calling it  ""an important victory for America's fire and emergency services."" The NRSC’s Hougesen defended the committee’s press release, saying it came out ""a full day before Treasury announced its rule on the exemption for volunteer workers such as firemen."" ""So when we said what we said, volunteer firefighters were still in danger,"" she said. But were they really in danger? Members of Congress had already gone to the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service last year, advocating for an exemption for volunteer firefighters. U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., also introduced legislation that would write an exemption for firefighters into law. His bill had 90 co-sponsors and bipartisan support. Our ruling The National Republican Senatorial Committee said that volunteer firefighters and communities they serve in Georgia and elsewhere could be devastated by Obamacare. But fixes to the problem were already under way. Those regulatory fixes, which are set to be put in place by 2015, seem to satisfy the volunteer firefighters in question. At minimum, it was premature for the National Republican Senatorial Committee to declare that firefighters and the communities they protect are ""the latest Obamacare victims.""

Labor force participation is at lowest point since 1978, says Texas Sen. Ted Cruz
","President Barack Obama’s upcoming State of the Union address gave Republicans and Democrats on the Sunday news shows another chance to make their case about the country’s economic performance over the past five years. On Fox News Sunday, Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer pointed out the country has added 8 million jobs since the health care law passed in March 2010. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, offered a different take on the state of the labor force on Face the Nation. ""Why are jobs and economic growth so dismal?"" he asked. ""We’ve got the lowest labor force participation in over three decades, since 1978. And if President Obama wants to give an honest, candid State of the Union address this week, he’ll address the fact that his economic policies are not working."" It's difficult to say how Obama's policies are causing the economy to stall or succeed, but we can examine Cruz's specific claim about labor force participation. Cruz, whose press office did not respond to our request for comment, is correctly breaking down data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The ""labor force participation rate"" is another measurement of the health of the labor market. The unemployment rate is the number of people who are not working as a percent of the labor force. There are multiple lenses through which to view jobs data. Another measure, the labor force participation rate, refers to the percentage of Americans who are considered to be in the labor force as a part of the overall population. To be counted in the labor force, someone must be working or actively looking for work. In December (and also October), the labor force participation rate was 62.8 percent. In January and March of 1978, it was also 62.8 percent. We know what you’re thinking: Cool numbers, PolitiFact, but what do they mean?  Take a look at the trend. The labor force participation rate had been increasing since 1948, the first year the labor force participation rate was calculated. Then, it was 58.6 percent. It peaked in the late 1990s and 2000 to just more than 67 percent, before more recently hitting its lowest point in 36 years. It’s fallen 2.9 percentage points since Obama’s first month on the job in January 2009. What’s happening is the subject of an ongoing debate. There is understandable concern about the country’s long-term unemployed and discouraged workers. The economic recovery from the 2007-09 recession has been slow, which may have propelled people to go back to school, stay at home with their kids or give up on a search altogether when they could not find jobs in their field. Still, many economists attribute at least a portion of the drop to an unsurprising reason: the retirement of baby boomers, which does not exactly qualify as an American horror story. ""The trick is to determine how much of the drop represents the impact of a lagging economy, which is worrisome, and how much is due to non-worrisome factors, such as the aging of the adult population,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, in a 2013 PolitiFact interview. There’s no reason to believe things will change anytime soon. The labor force will become older, slowly add workers as the overall population grows and become more racially diverse in the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS researchers say the labor force participation rate will continue to slowly fall until hitting 61.6 percent in 2022 -- a projected decline of 1.2 percentage points since December 2013. The past decade saw a much more dramatic drop, declining 3.6 percentage points since December 2003. Our ruling Cruz said, ""We’ve got the lowest labor force participation in over three decades, since 1978."" We’re pretty confident Obama isn’t asking Cruz for State of the Union talking points, and he’s especially not interested in one that may suggest today’s economic policies aren’t working. Cruz has his statistics right. But we’ll note at least part of the trend has been years in the making and appears strongly tied to the inevitable aging of the baby boomer population. In other words, it’s not all Obama’s fault, and it’s not going to change the minute he leaves office. We rate Cruz’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972DC940>],/factchecks/2014/jan/26/ted-cruz/labor-force-participation-its-lowest-point-1978-sa/

Mitch McConnell says the minimum wage is for young people in entry-level jobs
","President Barack Obama is expected to take another stab at raising the minimum wage when he delivers his State of the Union speech this week. But Republicans appear ready to stymie that proposal once again. The topic came up Jan. 26, 2014, on Fox News Sunday during a discussion between host Chris Wallace and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""Isn't it reasonable that somebody who's working full time, 40 hours a week, should be able to live above the poverty line?"" Wallace asked McConnell, referring to Obama’s calls to hike the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. ""Yeah. But of course, the minimum wage is mostly an entry-level wage for young people,"" McConnell replied. ""We have a crisis in employment among young people right now."" McConnell went on to say that he believes raising the minimum wage will hurt employment and ""we ought to be doing things that create more jobs."" But what about McConnell’s characterization of minimum wage workers? Is it a workforce mostly made up of young folks? We’ll stick to the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25, since that’s the topic up for debate. As it stands, 21 states and the District of Columbia have set their minimum wage higher than the federal level. A spokesman for McConnell pointed us to a study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics, ""Characterizations of Minimum Wage Workers,"" released in February of last year. We’re familiar with it, having written a couple of fact-checks recently on the minimum wage. According to the report, of the 75 million people making hourly wages in 2012, about 1.6 million earned the minimum wage while another 2 million earned less than $7.25 an hour. (How does one earn less than the minimum wage? Certain exceptions are carved out for ""vocational education students,"" ""full-time students employed by retail or service establishments, agriculture, or institutions of higher education,"" and those ""impaired by a physical or mental disability."") The underlying data in the report largely backs up McConnell’s claim. In fact, the report even says ""Minimum wage workers tend to be young."" How young? Only 20 percent of individuals earning hourly wages are ages 16-24, but that demographic makes up half of all individuals earning at or below the minimum wage. About a quarter of those individuals are teenagers ages 16-19 and another 25 percent are 20 to 24 years old. Broadened to include 25-29 year olds, and nearly two-thirds of all workers making at or below the minimum wage are younger than 30. The older you get, the more likely you’re making more than $7.25. But McConnell also described minimum wage jobs as ""entry-level."" That’s a characterization with which some may take an issue. Entry-level jobs typically indicate positions that, while at the bottom of the totem pole, have potential for growth. Young adults take entry-level jobs at companies hoping to climb the career ladder. And while wages are lower, there is potential to see considerable salary increases and/or career advancement. A majority of minimum-wage jobs don’t really fit that description. According to the report, two-thirds are part-time, and half of all minimum wage jobs are in the leisure or hospitality industry. This includes food service jobs like waiters and cooks, hotel employees or movie theater workers, among other jobs. While many of those jobs are traditionally held by young people, they don’t typically lead to careers in those industries. The same can be said for retail jobs, which make up another 16 percent of all minimum wage-or-less positions. Our ruling McConnell said ""the minimum wage is mostly an entry-level wage for young people."" The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that indeed half of all workers making a minimum wage are 16 to 24, and another 20 percent are in their late 20s or early 30s. That’s a large chunk of the minimum wage workforce, though about 30 percent of people making the minimum wage are 35 and older. McConnell also goes a bit too far in calling these jobs ""entry-level."" For most young people, these are part-time jobs in the food or retail businesses or similar industries with little hope for career advancement. We rate McConnell’s statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3DAB40>],/factchecks/2014/jan/26/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-minimum-wage-young-people-ent/

Chris Christie claims only three “college ready” students graduated in Camden last year
","Holding up three fingers, Gov. Chris Christie wanted the crowd to listen a second time to a statistic about the number of ""college ready"" students in Camden. ""How bad has it been in Camden? How ‘bout this -- Last year, only three students graduated college ready,"" Christie said during his Jan. 14 ""State of the State"" address. ""I want you to listen to that again. In the entire public school system in Camden last year, only three students graduated college ready."" The Republican governor’s claim refers to a statistic recently cited by Camden Superintendent Paymon Rouhanifard in regard to students whose SAT scores met the ""SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark"" developed by the College Board, which administers the standardized test. That benchmark -- a combined score of 1550 -- indicates a 65 percent likelihood of achieving a B- average or higher during a student’s first year at a four-year college, which in turn is associated with a high likelihood of college success, according to the College Board. The highest possible score on the SAT is 2400. Christie said ""three students graduated college ready"" in Camden in 2013, but the actual statistic is related to the number of 12th-graders enrolled in Camden during the 2011-12 school year who took the SATs and hit that benchmark, according to data provided by the school district. Of the 214 students who took the exam, only three students reached that benchmark, the data shows. It’s worth noting that many other Camden students didn’t take the SATs at all. In addition to those 214 test-takers, there were 255 12th-graders enrolled that year who did not take the exam, the data shows. The district does not track how many students take the ACT, district spokesman Kevin Shafer said. Rouhanifard acknowledged how many Camden students go on to college without reaching that SAT benchmark or without taking the SATs. ""A lot more than three students are going to college,"" he said. Still, the superintendent noted how once Camden students begin attending Camden County College, for example, a large number of them need to take remedial courses. The statistic about the SAT benchmark indicates that ""the rigor isn’t always there and students aren’t always prepared,"" he said. But some education experts were divided last week over the value of using that SAT benchmark. Paul Reville, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said the benchmark was a ""useful indicator for policy makers and others to use,"" and he said Christie was making a valid point about the failure to adequately prepare urban youth for college or careers. ""The fact is that overall there are far too many students coming out of Camden and virtually every other urban center who are neither prepared for college nor career, and that’s a crisis,"" Reville said. ""And so in that regard, irrespective of what rhetoric he might be using or facts to support it, I think the governor’s on target in pointing to this as a challenge that we need to deal with,"" he added. But Christopher Tienken, an assistant professor of education administration at Seton Hall University, argued that the benchmark does not account for other factors, such as a student’s grade point average. ""I think we need to use multiple measures,"" Tienken said. ""Putting all your eggs in the standardized testing basket, I think you run the risk of really misidentifying whether students are college ready or not."" In a statement, the College Board said it developed the benchmark to help school officials and others evaluate the effectiveness of academic programs to better prepare students for college, but the group also said falling below that benchmark does not mean students will not be successful. ""If a student does not meet the SAT benchmark score of 1550, it does not mean he or she can’t or won’t be successful in college,"" the statement read. The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling In his ""State of the State"" address, Christie said: ""In the entire public school system in Camden last year, only three students graduated college ready."" But that statistic does not refer to high school graduates in 2013. It refers to the three 12th-graders enrolled during the 2011-12 school year who took the SATs and received a combined score of at least 1550, a benchmark developed by the College Board to measure college readiness. Since Christie’s statement is ""accurate but needs clarification or additional information,"" we rate it Mostly True.

Gun commentator says technique Rhode Island plans to use to hunt deer on Block Island is illegal
","Nothing gets under people's skin like the government engaging in activity that is illegal for everyone else, such as when Congress passes laws and then exempts itself from them. On Jan. 12, 2014, in a letter to The Providence Journal, Richard August, co-host of the WHJJ radio show ""Lock, Stock and Daria,"" asserted that the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management would be doing exactly that if it carries out its plan to hire professional hunters to cull the deer population on Block Island. According to the plan, the hunters would use feeding stations to lure the deer. ""Baiting deer happens to be illegal in Rhode Island,"" August wrote. ""But I guess if you are the state, the laws don’t apply."" We wondered what the law actually said. First, some background. Block Island, officially known as New Shoreham, is overrun by deer -- an estimated 800 to 1,000 on the 9.5-square mile island. The town and the DEM have agreed on a plan to hire a Connecticut firm to reduce the population to 150 or fewer over the next four years. Corn bait will be used to lure deer to 15 to 20 sites on the southwestern part of the island. Sharpshooters perched on raised platforms will shoot the deer. Their goal for this winter is to kill about 200, beginning in the last week of February. The carcasses will be carved into venison using a mobile meat processing service based in Maine. The meat will be offered first to Block Island residents; the rest will be distributed to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank and other hunger programs. Going back to August's claim, the ""Deer Hunting"" section of state law says the DEM can adopt rules and regulations on deer hunting in Rhode Island but, ""In any event, the following prohibitions and restrictions shall always apply to deer hunting:"" Paragraph 6 says, ""No person shall make, set, or use any trap or snare, or salt lick or other device for the purpose of ensnaring, enticing, taking, injuring, or killing a deer."" When we asked the DEM about this, the department released a statement through spokeswoman Gail Mastrati saying that the rule only applies to ""recreational hunting."" That's not what the DEM would be doing, she said. ""The bait and shoot deer reduction project on Block Island, authorized under emergency regulations filed by DEM on Nov. 7, 2013, to address a serious problem on the island, is not a recreational hunting activity,"" her statement said. ""A bait and shoot deer reduction effort is very different from recreational hunting. The knowledge of animal behavior and the discipline and skills in marksmanship are more sophisticated and strategic than those necessary to be a successful recreational deer hunter."" The ""deer hunting"" section of state law does not make any distinction between recreational and non-recreational hunting. We asked the DEM about that. The department responded in an email: ""Hunting regulations do not apply to the deer culling operation because it is not a hunting activity. Rather, it is a wildlife management action authorized under DEM's statutory authority."" We'll leave it up to others to debate whether the culling of the island’s deer herd is really a hunt and, if so, whether the state’s hunting laws should apply to the DEM. (We should note, for example, that most of us have no problem with agents of the state, such as police officers, ignoring traffic signals or speed limits when chasing criminals.) But when Richard August asserts that state law makes it illegal for hunters to use bait to lure deer, which is what the DEM plans to do when it stages a mass shooting of deer, he is correct. We rate the claim True.
