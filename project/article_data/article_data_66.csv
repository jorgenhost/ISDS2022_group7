U.S. dominates global TB research spending (in one key way anyhow)
","Tuberculosis stands second to AIDS as the world’s deadliest infectious disease, killing about 1.5 million people in 2014. Only a small percentage of those deaths took place in the United States, yet the American government is the pre-eminent funder of tuberculosis research. HIV/AIDS activist Marcus Low, policy head for the South African-based Treatment Action Campaign, drove home that point when a United Nations taskforce met in Johannesburg. Low’s group urged the panel to recommend a global research and development treaty that would have governments commit money to tuberculosis -- an infection most often in the lungs -- and other disease research. By the World Health Organization’s estimate, research spending worldwide falls about $1 billion short each year. South Africa’s Business Day cited Low on March 19, 2016, as saying, ""Most funding for tuberculosis research was provided by the U.S. National Institutes for Health."" We asked Low if the paper had quoted him accurately. He offered a clarification. ""A better formulation of that line would have been, ‘the top contributor to TB research and development, according to a report published by Treatment Action Group, is the NIH’,"" Low told us. We’re not sure if that means the reporter got it wrong, or Low misspoke. Whichever it is, Low went on to tell us that the line in the news article is unclear. ""If most is read as more than any other, then it is correct,"" Low said. ""If most is read as more than 50 percent, then it is not correct."" Let us make things crystal clear about the American research effort. The NIH is the single-largest source of TB research money. The best overview of global tuberculosis research comes from the Treatment Action Group, a New York advocacy organization. The group assembled information from over 100 government, foundation and drug company research efforts. It’s most recent report found that the U.S. National Institutes of Health spent over $200 million on tuberculosis research in 2014. That was more than any other single entity, and represented more than 30 percent of the global investment in TB research and development. A bit over $674 million was spent worldwide. The U.S. total grows to nearly a quarter of a billion dollars when you add in the money from the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and assorted other agencies. In raw dollars, the United States government has no match. But the United States is a big country with the world’s largest economy. So we assessed where America stands when you factor in population and Gross Domestic Product. Do that and an unexpected nation earns some bragging rights -- Singapore. While the small Asian nation spends about 3 percent what America does, relative to its size, it comes out on top in both of the relative rankings. The United Kingdom and Switzerland also show up in the top three, depending on the measure. (Methodology note: We adjusted spending by European Union members according to their contributions to the EU. Population data came from the U.S. Census Bureau, and GDP data came from the World Bank.)  Why Singapore? Mike Frick, project officer at the Treatment Action Group, said he’s not exactly sure. It might have its roots in the legacy of the multinational drug company Novartis. ""Novartis's TB research used to be based in Singapore,"" Frick said. ""That has ended, but suggests there is some institutional capacity for TB research already established there."" Certainly, the National University of Singapore is eager to build support there for continued government funding. In a March 24, 2016, webpost, it touted that it is well placed to lead the fight against tuberculosis. ""Singapore is located at the heart of the TB epidemic, being close to Cambodia, Myanmar, Indonesia, China and India -- countries with the highest number of TB cases in the world,"" the posting said. A professor at the university’s school of public health wrote in an op-ed about TB research and ""the breadth of Singapore's growing research infrastructure and human resources."" All of which suggests that at least some Singaporeans see this as a competitive niche that ought be expanded. The drivers behind the spending in the United States are a combination of tradition and political activism tied to AIDS. Audrey Jackson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told us the federal government has put money into health research for decades. ""The U.S. has been a huge funder of science,"" Jackson said. ""Through the National Institutes of Health, it has funded a great deal of basic science and early work to translate findings into clinical applications."" Jackson noted that TB funding at the NIH itself has been flat for the past five years, ""even declining if you factor in inflation,"" but that the latest White House budget calls for an increase. Dick Chaisson, director of the Center for TB Research at Johns Hopkins University, said the AIDS epidemic played a key role in reigniting the tuberculosis research effort in America. ""Back in the 1970s, it was assumed that TB was a done deal, and all the scientific discoveries that were needed had been made, so science moved on to other issues."" Chaisson said. ""It turns out that the discoveries of the past were not good enough to result in TB elimination, and the advent of HIV and the emergence of drug-resistant TB made things even worse."" Around 1990, New York City became ground-zero for the resurgence of tuberculosis. The New England Journal of Medicine reported that ""with 3 percent of the country's population, New York City accounted for a remarkable 61 percent of cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the United States."" Frick said that because the disease hit New York, and in particular, people with AIDS, there was ample political lobbying power to draw in the federal government. By 1992, Congress had made an emergency appropriation of $100 million to combat TB. Of that, $40 million went to New York City. ""That was a time when an institutional will to engage with TB research came together,"" Frick said. ""A lot of young doctors spent their formative years in that effort and now are making decisions."" A ready example supports Frick’s generational point. In 1992, New York City used part of its $40 million to create the Bureau of Tuberculosis Control. The man it picked as founding director was a young CDC doctor named Tom Frieden. Today, Frieden leads the CDC where he makes the case for more federal funding for disease control and oversees the more than $14 million it spends on TB research. Our ruling Low said that most funding for tuberculosis research comes from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Whether he used those exact words is a bit unclear, but in the sense that the NIH is the single-largest funder of research, the statement is correct. The only caveat is that when we factor in the size of the economy, the United States as a whole falls to third and Singapore rises to the top.  We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966ED540>],/factchecks/2016/apr/05/marcus-low/us-dominates-global-tb-research-spending-one-key-w/
"['Agriculture', 'Human Rights', 'Poverty', 'Workers', 'Florida', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Did Bernie Sanders fundamentally improve the lives of tomato pickers in Florida?
","Bernie Sanders says he successfully changed the lives of exploited tomato workers in Florida. In an ad for Sanders, which ran nationally on Univision, U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., praises Sanders for taking up the plight of Immokalee tomato workers. ""He went and visited personally. Then he came back and convinced Ted Kennedy to hold some hearings, and it fundamentally changed the lives of those workers."" There is no dispute that Sanders, a Vermont senator, was a passionate defender of the tomato workers from Central Florida in 2008. A coalition representing those workers successfully reached an agreement with the growers about two years later to improve pay and working conditions. But how much credit does Sanders get, and has the agreement ""fundamentally changed"" the workers’ lives? Sanders’ advocacy on behalf of Immokalee farm workers in 2008 In 2008, Sanders traveled to meet with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which represented thousands of tomato workers. ""The conditions here are a disaster. People are being exploited ruthlessly,"" Sanders said. Since the coalition couldn’t reach an agreement with the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange directly, it negotiated with purchasers of tomatoes, asking them to pay a penny-per-pound increase. Yum Brands -- parent of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC -- signed on in 2005, and McDonald’s in 2007, and more would later follow. Sanders, along with a few other senators, sent letters to food chains and grocery stores urging them to join the campaign, said Warren Gunnels, a spokesman for Sanders’ presidential campaign. Sanders also met with a representative of the growers’ exchange. On March 13, 2008, Sanders held a press conference on the U.S. Capitol grounds to support a nationwide petition drive on behalf of farm workers.   He invited the coalition to testify before a Senate committee in April 2008. ""In the United States of America, millions of workers are being forced into a race to the bottom,"" Sanders testified. ""What we have in the tomato fields of Florida are workers who are living on the lowest rung of the ladder in that race to the bottom."" About two and a half years after the hearing -- in November 2010 -- the coalition and the growers’ exchange reached an agreement. It included the penny-per-pound premium and other steps intended to improve working conditions, such as a system to resolve complaints about sexual abuse as well as a health and safety program. Those involved in the process say Sanders should get some credit for the publicity. The agreement ""probably would have occurred anyway at some point, but we think it is fair to say that Sen. Sanders’ efforts accelerated the process,"" coalition spokesman Steve Hitov told PolitiFact Florida. Reggie Brown, a vice president with the growers’ exchange who met with Sanders in 2008, said, ""I think he can be fairly given some credit for having had a role."" Giev Kashkooli, political and legislative director at United Farm Workers of America, a group which endorsed Hillary Clinton, says that ""it's likely that (Sanders') visit and subsequent work did bring attention to farm workers in Immokalee who deserved support."" Impact of agreement There is evidence that the agreement between the coalition and the growers has led to some improvements for workers, but there are differences of opinion about the extent of those improvements. According to the coalition’s most recent annual report, since 2011 the agreement has resulted in nearly $20 million in premiums paid by buyers. Other gains include efforts to reduce sexual assault, the creation of health and safety committees, and resolution of more than 1,000 worker complaints. ""The Fair Food Program has brought about unprecedented levels of compliance with human rights standards in the fields,"" said Laura Safer Espinoza, a retired New York Supreme Court justice who serves as the executive director of the Fair Food Standards Council, which monitors the agreement and audits the growers. The average bucket rate has increased from 40 cents before the agreement to 55 to 65 cents today. But we found no independent research about what that translates to on average per worker, although the coalition cites a range of $30 to $60 per week. Pay is variable due to changing crop conditions and other factors. Greg Schell, an attorney with the Migrant Farmworker Justice Project, has raised some criticisms of the program. He has sued fast food chains on behalf of pickers who he said didn’t get the premium. Since only some purchasers of Florida tomatoes have agreed to pay the premium, not all of the tomatoes a worker picks will include the premium. ""The short answer is that the hearings changed nothing whatsoever in Immokalee,"" he said. ""The hearings did provide a national forum for the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which has for the past 20 years pressed for higher wages for the tomato workers. However, despite immense publicity for its efforts, the coalition’s efforts have resulted in very minimal wage increases to the workers."" Schell sent us a pay stub of a worker showing the premium was only $1.21 one week while the coalition sent us a pay stub showing $101.06 for another worker. Both are extremes, says coalition attorney Steve Hitov. A reporter from the Naples Daily News described the tough lives of tomato workers in an article in March. She said ""they earn $10 an hour, and that the salaries have changed only a few cents an hour in the past five years."" Workers barely earn enough to support their families and live together in trailers. There is no dispute that picking tomatoes remains a tough job, but ""there is no comparison between what existed before and what exists now,"" says Janice Fine, a labor professor at Rutgers, who has interviewed the workers and has met with the coalition and the growers. ""In my interviews with farmworkers, they talk about a radical transformation in their work lives,"" she told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Sanders’ ad says he ""fundamentally changed the lives"" of Immokalee farm workers in Florida. Sanders helped give national publicity to the struggles of Immokalee tomato pickers in 2008. He visited with the workers, wrote letters to tomato purchasers urging them to join a program to pay workers more, met with a representative from the growers exchange and held a Senate hearing in 2008.  About two years later, the workers reached an agreement with the growers. The coalition and the growers’ exchange both say Sanders should get some credit, although it’s likely that the agreement could have been reached without his efforts. Whether the agreement ""fundamentally changed the lives"" of the workers is difficult to quantify. The agreement included an increase for purchasers which goes toward pickers, but it’s unclear on average how many dollars more each picker earns per week as a result of it. There have been other successes in the agreement, including the resolution of worker complaints. We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DEE980>],/factchecks/2016/apr/05/bernie-sanders/did-bernie-sanders-fundamentally-improve-lives-tom/
"['Ohio', 'Campaign Finance', 'Trusted Leadership PAC']","
No, George Soros is not bankrolling John Kasich's campaign
","There’s a secret, left-wing conspiracy to prop up John Kasich’s presidential candidacy, according to an ad linking the Ohio governor to liberal billionaire and investor George Soros. ""Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling his super PAC,"" the ad’s narrator says of Kasich, as images of Kasich and Soros appear above the words ""Hundreds of thousands of dollars from George Soros."" This idea of Soros controlling a shadowy network of Kasich-backing cronies is also circulating on blogs like DCClothesline.com. The television ads, which were running in Wisconsin ahead of the state’s April 5 primary, are paid for by Trusted Leadership, the super PAC supporting Ted Cruz for president. Could there be any truth to it? The idea that Soros would clandestinely donate to a super PAC is silly based on campaign finance rules, said Tom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University. There is no maximum limit on super PAC donations, and donors are public. ""Soros could give a million to New Day for America,"" said Sutton, referencing the super PAC supporting Kasich. ""He doesn’t have to hide it, why would he do that? If he’s artificially manipulating Kasich’s campaign in the name of other people, just look at the list of donors and explain all these other companies that have given more."" We looked at the list of donors ourselves. There are donations to the New Day for America PAC from two individuals linked to Soros. Scott Bessent is a former chief investment officer for Soros Fund Management who left to start his own hedge fund company last year, with $2 billion in seed money from Soros. Campaign finance records show that he donated $200,000 to New Day for America, as well as $2,700 to Kasich directly. Bessent has donated to other conservative causes since 2015, including the Right to Rise PAC that supported Jeb Bush ($5,000) and to the Republican National Committee ($39,800). But he's donated to Democrats too; in 2013 he gave $25,000 to the Ready for Hillary PAC. Similarly, Stanley Druckenmiller, who managed assets for Soros from 1988 to 2000, gave $450,000 to New Day for America last year. If Druckenmiller shares any of Soros’ political philosophies, they aren’t apparent in his donor history. He has also consistently given money to Republican candidates’ super PACs and the Republican National Committee. A Trusted Leadership PAC spokeswoman confirmed that Bessent and Druckenmiller are the donors that connect Soros to Kasich.  According to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks campaign contributions, Soros has given $7 million this cycle to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC that supports Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He also gave $25,000 to the pro-Clinton Ready PAC, and $1 million to American Bridge 21st Century, which funds opposition research against Republican candidates and causes. There is a ""firewall"" between candidates and the super PACs backing them, said Sutton, and while Kasich may not be happy about contributions from people connected to Soros, he can’t tell them to knock it off. Candidates cannot have any contact with PACs or their donors. For these reasons, Sutton said, ""If there was a conspiracy, it’s the worst conspiracy ever, because it’s not working."" He added: ""Kasich’s people would love to have power at this level, because then they might be able to raise enough money to rival anything near what’s going on in other campaigns."" The most recent campaign finance filing from the pro-Kasich PAC shows nearly $10 million in contributions from individual donors, and $14 million in expenditures. Connie Wehrkamp, spokeswoman for New Day For America, told PolitiFact Ohio that the organization sent station managers in Wisconsin a letter on March 29, reading, ""We demand that your station investigate the false, misleading, and deceptive claims contained in this advertisement and remove it from the air."" So far, three television statements in Green Bay and one station in Wausau have pulled the ad, Wehrkamp said. Our ruling A pro-Cruz ad says, ""Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling his (Kasich’s) super PAC."" Donations totalling $650,000 from two guys who once worked with Soros hardly equate to ""bankrolling"" Kasich. The ad’s on-screen text goes even further to mislead voters with a blatantly false claim that Soros is directly giving to Kasich. Campaign finance records prove otherwise, with Soros donating handsomely to pro-Clinton groups. We rule the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B1A5C0>],/factchecks/2016/apr/04/trusted-leadership-pac/no-george-soros-not-bankrolling-john-kasichs-campa/

Website stirs Zika fears with false claim about 'liquefied brains'
","A claim moving on the Web paints a horrific image of how the Zika virus can damage a fetus. ""Evidence Shows Zika Virus Turns Fetus Brains to Liquid"" blared the headline on the website Weekly Observer, which is based in England. At least two other websites ran similar stories April 3 and 4, 2016. The claim is completely wrong, and has the barest connection to any actual research. Seeing as it showed up in quick succession in Australia and the United Kingdom, we thought we should move quickly to squash it. The Weekly Observer piece has the gloss of authentic reporting. A recent study published by the New England Journal of Medicine shows that the Zika virus kills developing fetal brain cells. According to the doctors, the study was performed on a woman who got infected by the virus while she was 3 months pregnant. Her fetus was monitored through blood tests and MRIs, and the doctors watched as the baby’s brain was basically liquefied within 9 weeks. The woman underwent an abortion at 21 weeks. The Australia Network website was equally somber. In a (sic) recent research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers tracked the development of a foetus whose mother contracted the virus on a trip to Central America, when she was 3 months pregnant. The blood tests and the magnetic resonance images showed that the virus was slowly turning the baby’s brain into liquid over a course of nine weeks. At 21 weeks the woman aborted the foetus. The New England Journal of Medicine did publish an article on March 30, 2016, about a 33-year-old Finnish woman who was with her husband in Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize in November 2015 when she was 11 weeks pregnant. Ultrasound examinations up until the 17th week of the pregnancy showed no abnormalities. That changed by the 19th week. Basic structures in the cranium were not as they should be. That combined with proof that the mother was infected with the Zika virus and a more detailed view using MRI led the parents to terminate the pregnancy at 21 weeks. An autopsy found Zika virus in the fetal brain tissue. Areas of the brain had dead cells and some that had begun to break down. But did the researchers say that the brain had been liquefied? ""This is absolutely NOT what we said,"" wrote Adre du Plessis, one of the lead authors and director of the Fetal Medicine Institute at the Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C. A second author, Rita Drigger, a professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, called the description a ""false interpretation"" of  the case. A third author, Olli Vapalahti at the Department of Virology at the University of Helsinki, Finland, told us some reporter might have misunderstood him during an interview. ""I may have tried to explain -- perhaps in too simple terms -- that there was thinning of the cortex and enlargement of the ventricles in the brain, meaning that some of the brain tissue had been replaced by cerebrospinal fluid,"" Vapalahti said. ""I can now see that this has emerged to some hype message which certainly I have not intended to deliver."" In other words, it wasn’t that brain tissue was turned to liquid. Rather, space where brain cells would normally be found contained fluid instead. In a conference call with reporters on March 30, du Plessis said the main point of the article was to caution doctors and parents that an extremely small head might not be the sole indicator of brain damage associated with the Zika virus. In this case, the brain was small but the head was still within the normal range. ""What this says is that the current criteria may be falsely reassuring,"" du Plessis said. Further, while the presence of the Zika virus in fetal brain tissue strongly indicated that the virus caused the harm, the researchers stopped short of saying this case proved a causal connection. Several news organizations, including the Washington Post, NBC News and Reuters, reported the story accurately. We reached out to the Weekly Observer and so far have not heard back. Our ruling The Weekly Observer and other websites said that researchers had found that the Zika virus turned a fetal brain into liquid. The Observer referred to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. The three lead researchers for that study declared the Observer's version was wholly inaccurate. They found signs of dead brain cells and cerebrospinal fluid where it shouldn’t be. They never said that the virus liquefied brain cells. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. Update (April 5, 2016): After we published, we heard from the staff of the Weekly Observer.  Elise Bou Malham, chief content officer, emailed us, apologized for the mistake and explained that she had first seen the article on another website. ""In no way was it meant to 'stir fears' or promote any false claims,"" Malham said. ""We assure you the article was deleted as soon as we received your email. I offer my sincere apologies on behalf of the entire editorial team."" While the article was not deleted, it was eventually updated. The new version reads. ""Claims about Zika Virus Turning Fetus Brains to ‘Liquid’ Completely FALSE"" It then explains its original error. ""Earlier this week, The Weekly Observer aggregated an article from various sources online, saying that Zika Virus is responsible for turning Fetus brain into liquid. ""The original article on Uproxx.com  ‘New Data Shows That The Zika Virus Can Turn Fetal Brain Into Liquid’, as well as several others, turned out to contain false claims as the study was misinterpreted by various sources.""",[<zip object at 0x0000028097042B80>],/factchecks/2016/apr/04/blog-posting/website-stirs-zika-fears-false-claim-about-liquefi/

Terrorists from groups besides ISIS crossing U.S.-Mexico border, U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis says
","Instead of worrying about ISIS infiltrating the country, U.S. Senate candidate and Rep. Ron DeSantis is concerned that members of other terrorist groups have already been caught trying to sneak across the border from Mexico. The Ponte Vedra Beach Republican called a hearing of the House Oversight Committee’s National Security subcommittee to discuss what to do about what he considered a growing threat. ""Recent reports state that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years,"" he said March 23, 2016. DeSantis has made terrorism a central issue in his campaign. On April 4, 2016, he embarked on a series of town hall-style events in Florida he dubbed the ""Defeat the Jihad Tour."" We’ve checked hyperbole by politicians that ISIS is invading via the southern border time and time and time again. Because there’s no hard evidence it is happening, those claims range from Mostly False to Pants On Fire! But we don’t often hear politicians warn about about immigrants with ties to other terrorist organizations being caught secretly heading into the United States. According to some reports, those apprehensions do happen, although experts told us any true threat may be a bit exaggerated. More than ISIS When we contacted DeSantis’ office, a spokeswoman pointed us to a 2015 article from the Houston Chronicle as the source of his statement. The newspaper published a report for elected officials from the Texas Department of Public Safety that said shifting law enforcement sources to protect the border led to crime problems in other parts of the state. But the report also said that authorities had detained several people with ties to Islamist terrorist organizations, a point the Washington Post highlighted in a follow-up. The Texas agency told the Post that the Chronicle had not properly obtained the report, which they said wasn’t meant for the public. Along with human traffickers, drug-cartel and gang members, law enforcement personnel in recent years had several run-ins with so-called ""special interest aliens."" These are people coming into the United States from 35 Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries associated with terrorist groups.   Texas reported 439 cases of people from these countries — including Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Pakistan and Syria — either caught crossing the border or presenting themselves at ports of entry without permission to enter. The report also said authorities had reported 143 ""land border crossing encounters with watch-listed individuals in southwest border states between November 2013 and July 2014."" These encounters included one with an alleged member of al-Shabaab, the Somalia-based group responsible for the 2013 mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya. In June 2014, he said he had been trained for a suicide attack in Mogadishu but escaped and surrendered to African Union troops, who stopped the attack. That account was unverified and the person sought immigration benefits from the United States, the report said. The report also noted the 2008 apprehension of a Somali named Ahmed Muhammed Dhakane, whom the government said had ties to terrorist groups al-Shabaab, al-Itihaad al-Islamiya and al-Barakat. Dhakane had crossed into Texas and helped move an unknown number of suspected Somali terrorists, as well, although he had claimed he was seeking asylum for religious persecution in Somalia. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2011. It further said one U.S. citizen had smuggled 272 Somalis into the United States through Cuba and Mexico until January 2010. Although he claimed he had been approached by al-Shabaab members for help smuggling people, he said he’d refused, the report said. Also detained were three Sri Lankans, one of whom said he was a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and was on his way to Canada. There are many more instances than what was detailed by Texas officials, too. A  2006 House Committee on Homeland Security report said that ""each year, hundreds of illegal aliens from countries known to harbor terrorists or promote terrorism"" are found trying to cross the border along the Rio Grande Valley. It said members of Hezbollah ""have already entered the United States"" across the border prior to 2005. A Government Accountability Office report from August 2009 said Border Patrol apprehended three people with ""links to terrorism"" at southwest border checkpoints in fiscal year 2008. An updated 2012 report from the House Committee on Homeland Security said 1,918 ""special interest aliens"" were stopped at the border from fiscal years 2006 to 2011. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the common thread in these types of reports is not so much that notorious terrorists had been arrested, but that immigrants with ties to terrorist organizations had been caught. ""I haven’t seen this as a method that terrorists have regularly used,"" he said of infiltrating the southern border. ""There are more efficient ways to get in where you don’t have to violate U.S. law."" That’s not to say the border isn’t porous, because immigrants from other countries continue to arrive via Mexico. Five Pakistanis and one Afghan were caught by Border Patrol agents near the Arizona border in November 2015. U.S. Customs and Border Protection records checks didn’t turn up any ""derogatory information."" That same month, eight Syrians — two sets of parents and four children — were stopped at the Texas border, but Homeland Security said they were regular migrants who weren’t evading authorities. Rand Corporation political scientist Colin Clarke said there are many challenges to enforcing border security beyond domestic policy. He noted places like Ecuador, which in 2008 dropped its visa requirements for admission. Lax policies make it much easier for groups to attempt getting into the United States. In 2011, three Pakistani citizens pleaded guilty to trying to smuggle in a member of the Pakistani Taliban from Ecuador. It is possible and plausible that terrorists would cross the Mexican border, Clarke said. But while it’s a problem worth addressing, it’s not something Americans should panic about. Unlike Europe, which has extensive, hidden support systems that could assist infiltrators, a terrorist coming to the United States wouldn’t easily live off the grid for long. ""Getting across the border is one thing, having a network of logistics in place to put together what's needed to conduct an effective attack is another altogether,"" he said. Our ruling DeSantis said, ""Recent reports state that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years."" There have been several reported incidents along the U.S.-Mexico border of several agencies encountering people on terrorism watch lists or with ties (or suspected ties) to terrorist groups. There also have been a number of people from countries associated with terror groups stopped by authorities, although that’s not an indication they’re terrorist infiltrators. Experts noted that while border security is always a concern, this issue is far from a pressing crisis. The statement is accurate but needs some clarification about the threat involved. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809696C8C0>],/factchecks/2016/apr/04/ron-desantis/terrorists-groups-besides-isis-crossing-us-mexico-/

Donald Trump weighs in on China's island-building in the South China Sea
","Donald Trump warned of China’s military might in a recent interview with the New York Times. ""We have rebuilt China, and yet they will go in the South China Sea and build a military fortress the likes of which perhaps the world has not seen,"" Trump said. ""Amazing, actually. They do that, and they do that at will because they have no respect for our president and they have no respect for our country."" We looked at Trump’s that the United States ""rebuilt"" China in a separate fact-check. But we were curious about Trump’s claim that China is now building a groundbreaking fortress in the South China Sea. The Trump campaign didn’t get back to us about his claim, which is exaggerated. While China is expanding aggressively in the South China Sea, it is not constructing a floating Death Star by any means.  Take me to the South China Sea Before we delve into the South China Sea, let’s go through some basics. Several Asian nations have been fighting over hundreds of small islands, reefs, atolls and sandbanks in the South China Sea for centuries. Though largely uninhabitable, the area is a potential treasure trove of oil and gas. The waters are also home to some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, where $5 trillion of trade passes through every year.   China and Taiwan both claim the good majority of the area and contend their sovereignty dates back, at the very latest, to Kublai Khan in 1293. Vietnam disputes this and says it’s ruled the key island chains, the Spratlys and the Paracels, since the 17th century. The Philippines’ claim for the Spratlys and the Scarborough Shoal is one of geographical proximity. Malaysia and Brunei, meanwhile, say parts of the waters fall within their United Nations-defined economic exclusion zones. The United States, for its part, has no claim on the territories, but it has significant interests at stake. Assistant Defense Secretary David Shear, in congressional testimony last year, listed ""peaceful resolution of disputes, freedom of navigation and overflight, and other internationally lawful uses of the sea related to these freedoms, unimpeded lawful commerce, respect for international law, and the maintenance of peace and stability."" Of particular concern to the United States is China’s ambitions to militarize the South China Sea and achieve ""hegemony in East Asia,"" in the words of Navy Adm. Harry Harris Jr. China retorted that it’s the United States that’s militarizing in the region and escalating tensions. As a show of force, the Obama administration is sending Navy patrols to the region. According to the New York Times, Pentagon officials said these exercises were meant to convey the message that the ""United States is the dominant military power in the region."" In response, a spokesperson for Beijing’s defense ministry warned the United States to ""be careful,"" according to the AFP. Historical and legal arguments aside, the grab for the islands didn’t really begin until the 20th century, with military clashes and diplomatic stand-offs springing up every couple of years. And to assert their claims, all of the countries except Brunei have been building outposts and artificial islands in the South China Sea for decades. We’ll explain how an island can be artificial in a bit. Vietnam and the Philippines were the most active in island-building in the early 2000s, and they, along with Taiwan, have stationed military forces on some outposts, according to Reuters. But in recent years, however, China has been the dominant player. Since 2014, China has staked out about 2,000 acres in the South China Sea and built seven artificial islands and three airstrips in the Spratlys. This is ""more land than all other claimants combined over the history of their claims,"" Shear told Congress. Experts say Trump has a point that this reclamation and level of assertiveness is unprecedented.  Larry Wortzel, a member of the congressional United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, noted that China’s buildup this time around is significantly improved in technical capacity, scope and modernity. The artificial islands themselves, however, are not ""the likes of which the world has never seen."" Floating but not exactly fortified Artificial islands are made by building concrete platforms, docks, airtrips and other landmass structures onto reefs and sand cays in the Spratlys. For example, China created about 114,000 square meters (about the size of 20 football fields) of new land in the Spratlys by constructing a large supply platform on a reef, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. (Photo from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative) Though many in the media have taken to calling these artificial islands ""fortresses"" — a term that typically refers to a stronghold that can defend against attacks — they don’t quite live up to the name yet. ""It seems a bit premature to say that China is building a military fortress,"" said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. For one, while Beijing will likely use the islands for military purposes, it’s been deliberately unclear about its intentions and hasn’t deployed any aircraft or missiles yet, Glaser told PolitiFact. Thus far, these outposts only have radars and dual-use equipment, according to Patrick Cronin, the senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. ""A military fortress would be more obvious than China’s preferred exploitation of grey-zone situations and use of incremental tactics — salami-slicing incremental moves to improve China’s position,"" Cronin said. For another, the military infrastructure China has built is far from unbreachable and, in fact, pretty vulnerable to attack. ""These facilities are quite limited and though they offer a headache to the region in peacetime, they would not be a major threat to U.S. or allied forces in a conflict,"" said Gregory Poling, the director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump may have been referring to the military base on Hainan Island or the surface-to-air missiles deployed on Woody Island in the Paracels. But the two are different from the recently constructed artificial islands. Hainan Island, which is roughly the size of Belgium, is not one of the contested territories. Woody Island, though contested and becoming increasingly fortified, has been under Chinese control since 1946. Cronin noted that some analysts have speculated that China may be looking to form a triangle of bases to fortify its position — perhaps the closest thing to a ""military fortress"" — but ""this is more of a long-term idea than a reality China can defend."" Our ruling Trump said, China is ""in the South China Sea and (building) a military fortress the likes of which perhaps the world has not seen."" China made large land grabs in the South China Sea and has constructed several artificial islands in the region. However, it's a stretch for Trump to say these outposts that could be used for military purposes amount to a fortress.

Donald Trump says China's economic growth is thanks to the United States
","China is doing all the winning as the United States continue to lose in global trade, says Donald Trump, and it’s all thanks to us. Trump, who admires China’s GDP growth and Great Wall but considers it a master manipulator of the world, railed against the country that’s become one of his favorite targets in an interview with the New York Times. ""You know, we’ve rebuilt China,"" Trump said. ""The money they’ve drained out of the United States has rebuilt China. And they’ve done it through monetary manipulation, by devaluations. And very sophisticated. I mean, they’re grand chess players at devaluation."" We were curious about Trump’s claim that the United States is responsible for China’s rapid economic growth. He made the point several times in the New York Times interview alone. (We also fact-checked two others claim from the interview about China’s import tax and its activity in the South China Sea.) According to Trump in the New York Times, China’s transition from one of the poorest countries in the world to its second-largest economy was possible through ""bad trade deals"" with the United States. This is an overly simplistic casting of the economic relationship between the two countries. Experts disagree over the extent of the United State’s impact in the Chinese economy, but they say Trump’s claim ignores many other factors at play. ""In one tiny sense, Trump is correct,"" said Scott Lincicome, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute who specializes in international trade politics. ""Trade with all countries, including the United States, has been part of a major market reform that’s lifted millions out of poverty in China. Reforms to property and taxation have been much more fundamental."" Economists point to the opening up of China in the late 1970s and early 1980s as the beginning of its meteoric growth. Following the death of Mao Zedong, the Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping introduced economic reforms and open trade with the West in 1979. From then to 2014, China saw double-digit growth in GDP every year, effectively doubling its economy every eight years, according to the Congressional Research Service. Arguably, China’s economic liberalization, and subsequent prosperity, was prompted by years of U.S. efforts at rapprochement through Henry Kissinger’s secret visits, Richard Nixon’s historic trip and, of course, ping pong. In 2000, the United States also lobbied for China’s inclusion in the World Trade Organization (as Trump mentions on his website), further embedding Beijing in the world economy. Today, the United States and China are each other’s largest trading partners. Trump has argued that the United States is ""losing"" given the trade imbalance between the two countries, but whether this benefits or hurts the United States is up for debate. ""I would not say that American deficits rebuilt China, but they probably allowed China to rebuild itself at a much lower domestic political cost than otherwise,"" said Michael Pettis, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and professor at Peking University. ""Our consumption has benefitted the Chinese people, just like how the consumption of Europe and everyone has,"" said Lincicome.  ""American demand has helped Chinese companies, so there’s a nugget of truth to that, but we’re not the only ones."" By Trump’s logic, you could argue that China has also rebuilt America by providing America with cheaper goods and thus more savings, pointed out Zhiwu Chen, a Yale University economics and finance professor who specializes in the Chinese economy. ""Without those savings or Chinese financing of American government debt and corporate investments, the U.S. would not have been able to sustain the kind of growth in real estate, defense and business for so many years,"" Chen said. ""In an interlinked globalized world, it is really hard to say who is rebuilding whom."" Our ruling Trump said, ""We’ve rebuilt China."" China’s economic growth can largely be attributed to its in-house reforms and inclusion in global trade. The United States can take some, but certainly not all, of the credit for the latter.

John Whitbeck misfires on Merrick Garland's gun record
","Gun rights are ""hanging by a thread,"" Republican Party of Virginia chairman John Whitbeck wrote recently in an email urging the rejection of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. ""When Justice Antonin Scalia wrote his watershed opinion in D.C. v. Heller, it marked the first time that an individual right to keep and bear arms was recognized by the Supreme Court by a razor thin 5-4 vote,"" Whitbeck wrote. ""Now President (Barack) Obama is attempting to replace Justice Scalia with Judge Merrick Garland, an avowed opponent of our Second Amendment rights. While Justice Scalia voted to overturn D.C.’s draconian gun laws, Judge Garland voted to uphold them,"" the chairman added, emphasizing the second sentence with bold type. Whitbeck concluded his email by asking Republicans to sign an Internet petition telling Virginia’s U.S. senators - Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine - that Merrick ""must not be confirmed to the Supreme Court!"" Scalia, who died Feb. 13, did write the majority opinion in the Supreme Court’s landmark 2008 ruling on District of Columbia vs. Heller. By a 5-4 vote, the high court found that Washington’s gun regulations - essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home - were unconstitutional. This Truth-O-Meter will focus on Whitbeck’s claim that Garland, who has been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1997, ""voted to uphold"" the handgun ban. A number of conservative organizations and individuals, including Fox News commentator Bill O’Reilly, have made similar statements.   The D.C. law  The Supreme Court’s decision in Heller was significant because it was the first time justices ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to own a firearm for self-defense. Until Heller, the widespread understanding was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service. Before the case went to the Supreme Court, though, it was heard in the federal appeals court where Garland serves. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of D.C. appeals judges came to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional. Based on Whitbeck’s claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion. Garland didn’t vote on the case at all. He was not part of the three-judge panel that heard it. After the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the city of Washington asked the court to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the court’s judges would reconsider the case and not just the three-judge panel. The court ended up denying the city’s petition, but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who voted to rehear the case. It’s misleading to say Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider Heller, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is generally used when a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case. D.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a well-known conservative, joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the George W. Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual gun rights, filed an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to send Heller back to the lower court for broader definition - for example, what type of gun-ownership restrictions should remain constitutional.   ""Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law,"" Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School, recently told PolitiFact National when it was fact-checking a statement by O’Reilly. ""Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment."" Our ruling Whitbeck said Garland ""voted to uphold"" D.C.’s ban on handguns. Garland never heard the case about Washington’s gun law from the bench. It was ruled unconstitutional by a panel of three other judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where Garland serves. Garland voted in favor of having the full court reconsider the case en banc - not an unusual step when a major decision bucks precedent. Randolph, a conservative judge on the appeals court who didn’t sit on the three-member panel, also voted to have the decision reconsidered en banc. It’s simply inaccurate to say Garland’s vote to reconsider the case is tantamount to a vote to uphold D.C.’s gun restriction or to extrapolate from it the nominee’s position on the case. So we rate Whitbeck’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A412440>],/factchecks/2016/apr/04/john-whitbeck/john-whitbeck-misfires-merrick-garlands-gun-record/
"['National', 'Education', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders says Wall Street tax would pay for his free tuition plan
","One proposal boosting Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders’ support among college-aged voters is his promise of free tuition at public colleges and universities. In an interview with Sanders, CNN’s Erin Burnett asked about some of the issues Sanders’ critics bring up about the proposal, like the large cost of such a program and persuading states to get on board. But Sanders said he has a way to pay for it: Wall Street. ""I think the idea is sound,"" Sanders said in the March 30 interview. ""It is paid for, Erin, by a tax on Wall Street's speculation. When Wall Street's illegal behavior destroyed our economy, the middle class bailed them out. It is now time for them to help the middle class."" Sanders’ assertion that the Wall Street speculation tax pays for his college tuition plan is only part of the story. Two-thirds, to be exact. Sanders estimates that his plan to make undergraduate tuition at public colleges and universities free would cost about $75 billion annually. Based on his proposed College for All Act, the federal government would fund two-thirds of that cost using a tax on Wall Street trading, but participating states would have to kick in the remaining costs. Sanders’ Wall Street tax proposal primarily taxes the rich in order to provide services to the non-wealthy. It would put a small tax on speculative financial trades, like stocks, bonds and derivatives. The revenue potential for such a tax is huge because the volume of Wall Street trading is so large. One estimate — which Sanders points to — put the yearly revenue from a financial transaction tax at more than $300 billion. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center analyzed Sanders' plan and put the yearly revenue at around $50 billion to $60 billion, much more modest but still enough to cover the approximately $50 billion a year in federal dollars Sanders wants to put in his tuition program. (The difference in revenue estimates largely has to do with how the analysts measured the various taxable trades and the impact of the policy.) Setting aside a disagreement over how much a Wall Street tax would raise, in any case, Sanders’ own proposal is straightforward about the fact that the tax revenue will not fund the free public school tuition 100 percent. And as CNN’s Burnett noted, there is some concern among skeptics of Sanders’ proposal about this piece in particular: What if state governments don’t want to play ball and refuse to kick in the remaining one-third of program costs? For example, many states have resisted federal dollars for expanding Medicaid, the low-income health insurance program, under the Affordable Care Act, even though the federal government would provide at minimum 90 percent of the funds to expand the program.   In order to receive federal funding for Sanders' education proposal, states would have to meet other requirements designed to maintain high educational standards, like reducing the number of low-paid adjunct faculty and maintaining state funding for need-based financial aid. This, combined with the fact that state funding for higher education is tight across the country, raises the question of how states — particularly those whose governments are spending-averse — will respond to such a proposal and how that will affect students living in those states. In the CNN interview, Sanders said if a state chooses not to participate, it can expect its students to flock to a state that does. But Sanders is offering a generous deal that might be too good to pass up, said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. He said the amount of federal money Sanders is putting on the table exceeds what states take in with undergraduate tuition, so they shouldn’t have to worry about a shortfall as a result of Sanders’ program. ""But it is theoretically possible that some state does not take federal money,"" Nassirian said, noting that Sanders’ proposal is massive and won’t necessarily be politically feasible to implement. Our ruling Sanders said his free public university tuition program ""is paid for… by a tax on Wall Street's speculation."" Sanders’ $75 billion proposal is a federal matching program, meaning the Wall Street speculation tax would cover two-thirds of the costs. States would be required to pick up the tab for the remaining one-third. There is some question if some states would participate in the program. Recently, states have refused to be part of Medicaid expansion under a more generous style of cost-sharing. Sanders has a point that his proposed Wall Street tax would cover part of the plan, but he left out the significant state contribution. And it’s not a sure thing that every state would join in. So we rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973AAB40>],/factchecks/2016/apr/04/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-wall-street-tax-would-pay-his-/
"['Climate Change', 'Science', 'Virginia', 'Don Beyer']","
Don Beyer says 97 percent of scientists believe humans contribute to global warming
","It’s time to stop debating the science behind whether humans contribute to rising temperatures, says U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th. ""Even while over 97 percent of the scientific community and the vast majority of Americans believe that humans are contributing to climate change, a small but well-heeled cohort continues to deny and even try to discredit what objective science tells us unambiguously,"" he wrote in a March 24 post on his congressional website. This Truth-O-Meter will focus on Beyer’s claim that 97 percent of the scientific community believes humans are a cause of climate change - a figure widely cited by those urging efforts to stem global warming. Climate change skeptics repeatedly have said the figure is not credible. We asked Beyer for the source of his statistic. His spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, pointed to several articles in scientific journals, information from NASA, and other sources about climate change. Let’s start with NASA. Here’s what its website says: ""Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position."" So the federal space agency notes that the 97 percent figure more narrowly focuses on ""actively publishing climate scientists."" That’s different from Beyer’s broad contention that 97 percent the entire ""scientific community"" thinks humans contribute to global warming. Still, this leaves us with the question: What are the sources for the 97 percent? NASA points to several of them in a footnote on its website. Cook study The first is a 2013 study by John Cook, a fellow at the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia. He and his co-authors examined 11,944 abstracts of climate science reports published from 1991 to 2011. Two-thirds of the abstracts didn’t express any opinion about whether man-made global warming was occurring. But among the roughly 4,000 studies that did, 97.1 percent of them ""endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming,"" the report says. Cook also asked a sample of 1,200 authors of the climate reports to rate their own papers and say whether their research agreed that global warming was man-made. The result was that 97.2 percent of the papers that expressed an opinion about man-made global warming backed the position that it’s caused by human activity. Cook’s methodology has been criticized. Tol study Richard Tol, a professor with the Institute for Environmental Studies in Amsterdam, rejects the 97 percent figure. In a 2014 article, he said it was based on an unrepresentative sample of climate science papers that took into account only one-quarter of the climate research available. Tol had other misgivings about the Australian researcher’s methodology. In re-running the figures, Tol found that some 91 percent of climate research papers that Cook’s team examined supported the consensus that man is the main reason for the Earth’s warming temperatures. Despite taking aim at the specificity of the 97 percent figure, Tol said he agrees there indeed is a large consensus that warming temperatures are the result of human activity. ""There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans,"" Tol wrote. ""I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct. Cook et al., however, failed to demonstrate this."" In a reply, Cook re-examined the data and stood by his paper’s conclusions in a 2014 post on his blog, Skeptical Science. University of Illinois study Beyond this debate, NASA also cites a January 2009 study by researchers at the University of Illinois. They surveyed 3,146 earth scientists and asked two questions: Was global warming occurring? Was human activity a ""significant contributing factor"" for changes in the Earth’s temperatures? Nine out of 10 of the scientists said the Earth’s temperatures had risen, and 82 percent said human activities were a key reason. Winnowing the field to climate change researchers who actively published their results, the survey found that 75 of 77 of them, or 97.4 percent, said human activity is a significant driver of climate change. That latter figure also has come under criticism because of its small sample size. National Academy of Sciences Another study published in 2010 by the National Academy of Sciences created a database of  908 climate researchers who had their work published at least 20 times in scientific journals. The study found roughly 90 percent of the climate researchers were convinced that rising temperatures are being caused by human activity, while 10 percent were not convinced. But the more expertise the researchers had, the greater their consensus. Looking at the top 200 researchers, based on the number of articles they published, just 2.5 percent of them were unconvinced climate change was mostly the result of human activity, the study found. That left ""97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field surveyed"" convinced that rising temperatures were mostly due to humans, the report said. Conversely, the study found that the expertise of researchers who weren’t convinced of man-made global warming was ""substantially below that of the convinced researchers."" Bill Anderegg, the PNAS report’s lead author, told us in an email that ""the quote from (Beyer) is absolutely consistent with the scientific literature on this."" We also found a 2013 poll of roughly 1,800 meteorologists by the American Meteorological Society found that 73 percent of those surveyed felt that humans contributed to global warming. But for the more active publishing climate science experts within that group, 93 percent believed that humans were contributing to global warming. Our ruling Beyer said ""over 97 percent of the scientific community"" believe humans are contributing to climate change. The studies Beyer and others cite do not reflect the scientific community at large. They are surveys that focus on the conclusions of climatologists, earth scientists and meteorologists. The studies found that overwhelming majorities of these experts - sometimes, but not always as high as 97 percent - say humans are contributing to global warming. Beyer’s statement is credible but needs elaboration. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A7BDC0>],/factchecks/2016/apr/04/don-beyer/don-beyer-says-97-percent-scientists-believe-human/
"['Campaign Finance', 'Drugs', 'Elections', 'California', 'Californians for Lower Drug Prices']","
Big Pharma Not The King Of Ballot Cash In California, But It's Close
"," Big-time spending is expected in the fight over California’s ballot measures this election year. One expert estimates campaigns could dole out nearly a half billion dollars to influence the fate of the dozen or more initiatives expected on the November ballot. Eight have already qualified. They include a measure to overturn the state’s ban on single-use plastic bags; one to raise funds for school facilities; and another that would regulate the cost the state pays for prescription drugs. Campaigns for a dozen additional initiatives, including a proposed tobacco tax hike, are gathering signatures and could qualify their measures later this year. As money pours in for and against these initiatives, a claim by Californians for Lower Drug Prices caught our attention. The campaign is backing a measure on the November ballot that would impose price controls on state prescription drug purchases. Supporters call the initiative the California Drug Price Relief Act. And they say spending by the measure’s opponent has dwarfed all other fundraising. ""Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the prescription drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined,"" Californians for Lower Drug Prices said in a March 21 press release. That campaign is funded by the Los Angeles-based nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which offers health services and is often at odds with the pharmaceutical industry. We wondered was its claim about Big Pharma true? Had a group of pharmaceutical companies really outspent all other ballot campaigns, combined? How much did all that spending add up to? We set out on a fact check. Our research Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure is the campaign opposing the ballot measure. It’s the one that is claimed to have outraised everyone by a wide margin. First, we checked to see if it’s contributions came from 27 ""out-of-state pharmaceutical companies,"" as claimed by Californians For Lower Drug Prices. We found the campaign in question is sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturer’s Association of America, an industry group based in Washington D.C. And 27 of the 30 companies that had contributed to it are, indeed, from outside California, according to records on the secretary of state’s website. Johnson & Johnson of New Jersey and Pfizer, Inc., of New York, made the largest single contributions at $5.7 million each last year. Big Pharma is uniquely positioned to influence America’s political system. The pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more than $3.2 billion on lobbying from 1998 through 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington D.C. based nonprofit that tracks money in politics. That was $1 billion more than the next sector, insurance. Also last year, the pharmaceutical industry had nearly 1,400 lobbyists working for it, the center reported. Capital Public Radio / file photo More than everyone, combined?  Looking back at the California drug price measure, records show pharmaceutical companies spent nearly $53 million against it by mid-March. It’s a big sum, especially this early in the election year. The total ranks among the top 20 largest sums contributed by a campaign for or against a California initiative, according to the research group MapLight. But as we dug deeper, we found it’s not necessarily more that what’s been spent on all other 2016 ballot measures in the state, combined. It’s not even the highest total raised for an individual measure on this year’s November ballot. Another big money pot The $53 million from the pharma firms is certainly more than what’s been spent on all other ballot measures (about $33 million), but only if you look at what’s been doled out during the 2015-2016 election cycle.  What’s missing is the huge sum -- nearly $59 million -- contributed by a California hospitals association over the past three years for a hospital fees measure on November’s ballot. Most of that money streamed in before this election cycle, because the measure was initially intended for the November 2014 ballot. When making its claim about the pharma cash, it appears Californians for Lower Drug Prices missed a big pot of money, said Ned Wigglesworth a Sacramento-based campaign strategist, who is not associated with either side on the prescription drug measure. ""The statement (by Californians for Lower Drug Prices) doesn’t appear to be accurate,"" he said. ""When you take a closer look at the (campaign) filings … you realize far more money has been raised."" He estimated spending could eventually top $450 million for all measures on this year’s ballot. Representatives for the Californians for Lower Drug Prices campaign said they only looked at the 2015-2016 cycle, and ""missed"" the early money contributed by the hospital group. Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the campaign backed by the pharma companies, said the claim about its spending ""is an early snapshot,"" noting it’s expensive to campaign in a state as large as California. But because other campaigns are expected to pour in hundreds of millions of dollars in more spending, she said the claim ""ignores the bigger picture. Look at (spending totals) in October."" Our ruling Californians for Lower Drug Prices is backing a drug price control measure on the November ballot. In late March, it claimed: ""Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined."" From our research, it’s clear that 27 of the 30 companies backing Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure are, indeed, from outside California. Together they’ve amassed nearly $53 million, which dwarfs the $33 million spent on all other initiative campaigns during the 2015-2016 election cycle. But what’s also clear is that Californians for Lower Drug Prices did not count a large pot of money, nearly $59 million, collected by a hospital association for a separate ballot measure. It says it simply ""missed"" these funds because it was focused on the current election cycle. Much of the $59 million was contributed outside the timeframe used to make the claim, but it is money that was gathered to be spent on a November ballot measure. This doesn’t take away from the fact that pharma firms have aggressively spent funds, so much that their totals already are in the top 20 for cash contributed for any California ballot measure. But the omission of the hospital association money leaves out important details that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Half True. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more than $3.2 billion on lobbying efforts in 2015. The industry spent that total from 1998 through 2015. It spent $240 million in 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.   Source: California Secretary of State",[<zip object at 0x0000028097107EC0>],/factchecks/2016/apr/04/californians-lower-drug-prices/big-pharma-not-king-ballot-spending-california-its/

Hillary Clinton spins on ‘Meet the Press,’ says she put out all her emails
","Controversy over Hillary Clinton's practice of using a private email server while she was secretary of state is continuing to have repercussions in her presidential campaign. The latest is a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial criticizing the Democrat's rationale, saying that ""the only believable reason for the private server in her basement was to keep her emails out of the public eye by willfully avoiding Freedom of Information laws."" NBC's Chuck Todd asked her about the accusation that she's too secretive during a taped April 2 interview for Meet the Press. Clinton repeated her acknowledgment that her use of a private email server was a mistake, along with her assertion that all of her work-related correspondence was sent using government-operated email servers, which would mean that all of those emails should be sitting in government files somewhere. In any event, she said, all of her emails have been released. ""I think that anybody who's actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my emails,"" she said. ""Go and ask others for their emails. Ask everybody else who's in public office. I'm the one who's done it, and I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do."" So are all the emails out? Literally, no. Clinton says she had about 60,000 emails on her private server during the four years she was secretary of state. She and her staff deleted more than 31,000 without any government review in December 2014 on the basis that they were personal correspondence and had nothing to do with her government job. The remaining 30,940 were turned over to the State Department, in paper form, for review and archiving. In March 2015, a House committee demanded that Clinton hand over her server to see if sensitive material had been deleted. In August, Clinton authorized the transfer. She then asked the State Department to publicly release the work-related correspondence, which it began to do in May 2015. The last batch, consisting of about 3,800 pages, was released Feb. 29. Clinton has consistently insisted that the emails did not include any information that was classified at the time she sent or received the correspondence. She turned out to be correct. (Editor's note, July 11, 2016: Based on the information publicly available at the time, she appeared to be correct. The FBI's report from July 2016 subsequently revealed she was not correct. Although that does not affect our ruling on this statement, we have downgraded another statement that she never sent or received classified material and rated that False.)  But ultimately, 2,093 emails were given some form of classification, including 22 now marked ""top secret,"" which have been fully withheld from the public. The rest have been redacted. The 22 ""top secret"" emails were part of seven email chains covering 37 pages. They were not classified at the time they were sent. But a few additional emails have also not been released, even though they were not considered classified. Nineteen were exchanges between Clinton and President Barack Obama that covered eight different chains. They were withheld under the law governing the release of presidential documents, designed to encourage candid exchanges of opinion between the president and his staff. There was also one email withheld at the request of an unspecified law enforcement agency. As for the correspondence that Clinton considered to be personal and private, it’s unclear if any of those emails have been recovered. Bloomberg reported in September that the FBI had obtained the server from a company called Platte River Networks in Colorado and had recovered those deleted emails. McClatchy reported in October that some emails were synched with a cloud storage system run by Datto Inc. of Connecticut and Clinton agreed to have that data released to the FBI. However, McClatchy reported ""conflicting accounts as to whether the developments could lead to retrieval of any of Clinton’s more than 31,000 personal emails, which she said she deleted from her private server upon turning over her work-related emails to the State Department, at its request, in December 2014."" That’s a fairly critical point, as congressional Republicans have questioned whether any of those ""personal"" emails contained government business. State Department spokeswoman Lauren Hickey said the released documents only included the work-related emails that Clinton turned over. Any additional material that might have been recovered by the FBI have not been released. Our ruling Clinton said, ""I have now put out all of my emails."" In reality, only about half of the emails sent or received by Clinton on her private email server have been released. Clinton’s comments focus on emails that she and her staff deemed work-related. Clinton says the half that aren’t available are personal and private. The problem is, it was Clinton and her staff who made that determination. Those emails -- more than 30,000 -- haven’t been available for public review, and it’s not entirely clear they can be retrieved. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f53c15fc-28b4-4025-8158-433cdc006cc4",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FCD680>],/factchecks/2016/apr/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-i-have-now-put-out-all-my-emails/

Hillary Clinton's absurd claim that she's the only candidate being attacked by Wall Street
","As challenger Bernie Sanders continues to hit Hillary Clinton over her Wall Street ties in Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton noted that she and the financial sector are more enemies than friends. On Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd played Clinton a clip of Sanders joking on the campaign trail that her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs must have been written in Shakespearean prose. ""I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against,"" she responded.  ""So I find this, again, a kind of, you know, circuitous way to raise questions about my record."" Is it true that Clinton is the sole target of Wall Street this cycle? The Clinton campaign referred us to our own fact-check of an attack ad sponsored by the hedge fund-backed conservative super PAC, Future45. While this supports Clinton’s point that the financial sector has spent money against her, it doesn’t back the notion that Wall Street has only attacked her. We consulted with Robert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics and Nancy Watzman of the Political TV Ad Archive. Their data shows that Clinton’s statement is inaccurate. The trouble with her claim is Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers aren’t a monolithic group. Some have even expressed their support for Clinton and Sanders, and their donations are dispersed among Republican and Democratic groups. While Clinton has been the target of more attack ads than Sanders, more money from the financial industry has been spent hitting each of the remaining Republicans. In fact, the candidate subject to the most Wall Street-funded hits is actually Donald Trump. Ad blitzes against Clinton primarily come from three conservative groups. In addition to the ad we fact-checked, Future45 has run six others against Clinton. Wall Street donations account for half of the group’s funding. American Crossroads, founded by Karl Rove, has sponsored eight anti-Clinton ads and the Mitt Romney-affiliated group America Rising has released 10 ads attacking her, two of which also target Sanders. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the financial industry is responsible for roughly half of the Rove’s group total donations and two-thirds of the Romney group’s. Future45 has also sponsored one ad against Sanders. ESA Fund, a conservative super PAC, is 56 percent funded by the financial sector and has aired one anti-Sanders ad in Iowa. And last summer, Generation Forward, a pro-Martin O’Malley super PAC, went after Sanders’ record on guns. A fifth of its donations come from Wall Street.   Clinton’s own affiliated super PAC, Priorities USA Action, took a third of its donations from the financial sector. It has aired 11 ads against Trump and spent more than $61,000 targeting the Republican frontrunner. (Update: Priorities USA Action said that the 11 videos it produced only appeared on the Internet.) But that pales in comparison to the amount of money and airtime Trump’s fellow Republicans have devoted to slamming him. Conservative groups have spent more than $28 million opposing Trump. Our Principles PAC, launched by a former Romney aide, has spent more than $14 million against Trump and sponsored at least 27 ads attacking him. A third of the group’s funding comes from Wall Street. Marco Rubio’s affiliated super PAC, Conservative Solutions, aired seven anti-Trump ads and received about 40 percent of its funding from the financial sector. Rubio himself was the subject of 11 attack ads by Ted Cruz’s Keep the Promise I super PAC (hedge fund manager Robert Mercer was responsible for $11 million of its $11,036,250 total donations), and 12 by Jeb Bush’s Right to Rise, which is half funded by Wall Street. Here are the 10 groups with the largest share of Wall Street donations and their opposition opponents, compiled with help from Maguire and Watzman: Name Wall Street support* Opposition ads** Keep the Promise I 99.7 percent 11 against Rubio, 7 against Trump, 6 against Clinton America Rising 68.2 percent 10 against Clinton, 2 against Sanders Citizen Super PAC 61.0 percent 1 against Trump Future45 58.0 percent 7 against Clinton, 1 against Sanders America Leads 53.1 percent 2 against Clinton, 1 against John Kasich American Crossroads 53.1 percent 8 against Clinton, 1 against Trump Right to Rise 51.1 percent 12 against Rubio, 9 against Trump, 5 against Kasich, 4 against Clinton, 2 against Cruz, 2 against Chris Christie Patriot Voices PAC 47 percent 1 against Clinton New Day for America 46 percent 10 against Trump, 5 against Cruz, 4 against Clinton, 4 against Bush, 3 against Rubio, 2 against Christie Conservative Solutions PAC 39.8 percent 9 against Bush, 8 against Trump, 7 against Ted Cruz, 6 against  Clinton, 2 against Christie, 1 against Kasich As you’ll notice, Sanders — who rails against Wall Street daily — has been largely spared by the attack ads. That’s because the finance sector takes Clinton seriously and Sanders less so, according to John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University who wrote the book In Defense of Negativity: Attack Advertising in Presidential Campaigns. ""Sanders has an important message that is resonating with many. But that is not enough to win the nomination,"" Geer said. ""Why spend money that will have little return on the investment?"" Our ruling Clinton said, ""I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against."" Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are running ads against Clinton. But to say she’s the only one being attacked by people associated with the financial sector is preposterous. The financial sector has contributed to both sides of the aisles, including to Clinton’s own campaign. Groups backed by Wall Street have run attack ads against virtually every candidate.

No, Hillary Clinton is not currently laying the groundwork to run for president in 2020
","With the 2020 general election just under a year away, major political parties on both sides of the aisle are ramping up fundraising. For the Missouri GOP, this has included making some bold claims, such as the one made in an email by Chairwoman of the Missouri Republican Party Kay Hoflander. The October 11 email said, ""Have you seen the recent news about Hillary? All signs seem to point to Hillary laying the groundwork to run for president again...GOOD! We welcome her to lose again next November, especially here in Missouri."" It’s a tactic to strike fear in the hearts of the Grand Old Party’s potential donors. On its face, a Clinton run seems unlikely. But we were curious. Are there any signs suggesting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is planning another run for president in 2020? We decided to investigate. We started by looking into the basics — Federal Election Commission statements of candidacy. According to FEC rules, any individual running for federal office must register as a candidate within 15 days of becoming a candidate, which occurs when he or she has raised or spent more than $5,000. Clinton filed her original statement of candidacy for the 2008 election about 21 months before the general election. She filed her original statement of candidacy for the 2016 election nearly 19 months before the general election. If Clinton were to file a statement of candidacy now — joining President Donald Trump and fellow Democrats, all of whom have already declared their candidacy to the FEC — she would be doing so only 12 months before the general election. If Clinton decided on a late-stage run, she would also not be on the primary ballot in Alabama. The deadline to qualify and be on the March 3, 2020, ballot in Alabama was last Friday. While former New York City mayor and businessman Michael Bloomberg made headlines last week by filing paperwork to qualify, Clinton did not take the same step. At least twice, Clinton made flat out denials: ""I’m not running,"" she told New York television in March. ""But I’m going to keep working and speaking and standing up for what I believe."" ""No, I’m not going to run again,"" she told BBC Radio 4’s ""Woman’s Hour"" in October 2017. Jean Evans, the GOP executive director, in an email response specifically cited two articles she said indicate that Clinton’s behavior is ""typical of someone who is seriously considering candidacy."" The first article from the Washington Post said Clinton is being urged to run, but in the same sentence also said she ""signaled that she isn’t planning to run — at least, not at the moment."" Evans’ second example was the rumors after Clinton teased at the idea of a 2020 run on Twitter. On Oct. 8, Trump tweeted that Clinton should enter the presidential race, and Clinton responded, ""Don’t tempt me."" Despite this, former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in January he believes Clinton when she says she isn’t running. He told CNN’s Erin Burnett that the idea of a 2020 Clinton run was ""media catnip."" One of Clinton’s former advisors, Philippe Reines, said in late October that Clinton had not ruled out a 2020 run entirely. Stuart Streichler, a University of Washington affiliate associate professor of law, societies, and justice, said there are a number of problems Clinton would face entering the race so late in the game. Streichler — who has provided volunteer legal counsel to Sen. Al Gore’s presidential campaign and worked as a Wisconsin poll observer during Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential run — explained that it would be ""highly unusual"" for someone to enter the race at this point. ""A lot of the staff — the talent that you would want to get as staff — are already working for other candidates,"" Streichler said. Adjunct professor of law at American University Louis Caldera said leading candidates ""already have an extensive ground game in Iowa and in the early primary states with millions in the bank,"" which makes it even less likely that Clinton would try to jump in now. Streichler said money and donors are already committed to other candidates. Streichler and Caldera acknowledged that Clinton would have name recognition on her side if she decided to run. But Streichler said he thinks ""there’s almost a zero percent chance"" someone new could successfully enter the Democratic field now unless there was a major shift. (Example: In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not seek re-election after almost losing the New Hampshire primary to Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Johnson’s departure allowed candidates like Sen. Robert F. Kennedy — who entered the race just days after the embarrassing New Hampshire primary — to gain a foothold.) Caldera, who also has an extensive background in public service including serving as President Bill Clinton’s Secretary of the Army and working in the Obama White House, added that someone entering the race late would need a ""breakout moment."" But he thinks the odds of Clinton jumping into the race are low. ""One of the truisms of politics is that the closer you get to the Election Day, the fewer undecided votes there are to convince,"" Caldera said. Clinton’s Democratic colleagues in the Senate have also warned her against another run for president, and her allies have said they are not taking the talk of her running again in 2020 seriously, according to Politico reporting. The Missouri GOP appears to be using this claim to spur fundraising; the email ends with the sentence, ""I am not asking for much, but I am asking for participation to make sure we don't see a President Biden, Warren, Sanders, or Clinton in our future!"" It is followed by Kay Hoflander’s sign-off and a button that reads, ""Click to give $1 or a [sic] more now!"" Caldera said this is not a new tactic. ""In politics, party leaders like to fire up the base by trotting out the people who they think they’ll get the strongest response to,"" Caldera said. He explained that even in local elections, unpopular members of the opposing party are often brought up. Because getting President Trump reelected is the primary job of Republican party leaders, Caldera said it made sense that they would single out Hillary Clinton, who stirs up strong negative reactions among GOP supporters, as a potential threat to Trump’s in 2020. ""You know, it’s throwing red meat,"" Caldera said. ""It’s getting people to try to have an immediate negative response and leading them to click on the ‘donate now’ button."" He added that as the incumbent president, Trump can run against the Democratic party as a whole or he can target individual opponents. But Caldera explained that Trump would want to avoid elevating any potential Democratic nominees at this stage. ""It’s a lot easier to say, ‘Hey, remember that person who almost beat him the last time and that we really don’t like? She might jump in the race if we’re not really formidable in our fundraising and scare her off,"" Caldera said. Kay Hoflander said, ""All signs seem to point to Hillary laying the groundwork to run for president again,"" in a Missouri GOP fundraising email. Clinton has not filed as a candidate with the FEC, and it is no longer possible for her to get on the primary ballot in Alabama. In previous months, Clinton has said she will not run, and experts believe it would be difficult for her to enter the race now. Experts also said Clinton hasn’t done anything that would be considered ""laying the groundwork"" to run again. Despite whispers and rumors, at this time no concrete steps have been taken to lay the groundwork for a Clinton 2020 campaign. The claim appears to be an unsubstantiated fundraising tactic. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DE0740>],/factchecks/2019/nov/15/kay-hoflander/no-hillary-clinton-not-currently-laying-groundwork/

Fact-checking impeachment witness William Taylor's claim about Russia treaty violations
","On the first day of the impeachment hearings held in public, Ambassador William Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, took a broad swipe at Russia. ""The Russians are violating all of the rules, treaties, understandings that they committed to that actually kept the peace in Europe for nearly 70 years,"" he declared. Experts told PolitiFact that Taylor’s claim is on target. Treaties and agreements have largely kept the peace between Russia, the United States and Europe since World War II ended in 1945. But Russia is now violating many of them.  ""The use of ‘all’ usually signifies an exaggeration, but this statement is not far off,"" said Georgetown University government and foreign service professor Matthew Kroenig. ""Russia has suspended compliance, violated, or is seriously stretching the limits on almost all of its most important security agreements including: the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the New START Treaty, the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives, the Budapest Memorandum, the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, the Open Skies Treaty and the UN Charter."" Added Max Bergmann, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress and an expert on U.S.-Russia policy: ""Every agreement? They’re going to be in compliance with some. But even when there is an agreement, and maybe they’re not technically violating it, they push the bounds."" Taylor, a career diplomat and U.S. Army veteran who has worked in every administration of both parties since 1985, is a key witness in the House’s investigation of President Donald Trump. Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine to publicly investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential challenger in the 2020 presidential election. U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, led the Nov. 13 hearing where Taylor testified. At one point, Schiff asked Taylor why it was important for the United States to help protect Ukraine’s sovereignty.  Taylor replied that the United States has a national defense policy that identifies Russia and China as adversaries.  ""The Russians are violating all of the rules, treaties, understandings that they committed to that actually kept the peace in Europe for nearly 70 years,"" Taylor said, ""If we don’t push back on those violations then that will continue. That affects us. That affects the world we live in, that our children and grandchildren will grow up in."" Here are two key Russian violations experts cited to us: 1. Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances for Ukraine The 1994 memorandum committed the United States, Russia and England to, among other things, ""respect the independence and sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine"" and to ""refrain from the threat or use of force"" against that country.  By 2014, Russia had ""grossly violated the commitments it made in that document,"" wrote Steven Pifer, a senior fellow at the Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative at the Brookings Institution and a fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. ""Basically, the agreement was that the three Soviet republics that had nukes based on their territory would send the weapons to Russia, in return for which Russia, the U.S. and others would guarantee their security,"" Harley Balzer, a Russia expert and emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University, told us. ""Annexing Crimea and supporting the separatists in Eastern Ukraine is a clear betrayal. ""That is a major concern,"" Balzer added. ""Why would North Korea or anyone else give up nukes if no one will hold the Russians accountable for this reversal?"" 2. Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty  The 1987 treaty, which banned the United States and Russia from fielding land-based missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, ended in August 2019. The U.S. government said Russia’s government violated the treaty with, for example, the 9M729 missile, which developed in the mid 2000s and flew longer than the permissible distance, ForeignPolicy.com reported. ""All of the United States’ NATO allies said they agreed with the U.S. judgment: Russia was breaking the rules."" The rule-breaking started in about 2014 in direct violation of the treaty, Kroenig told us. The Obama administration accused Russia of cheating at that time, and the Trump administration withdrew from the treaty in 2018. The Crimea annexation and Russia’s armed aggression in 2019 in the Donbass region of Ukraine means ""they have certainly violated a lot of their commitments,"" Pifer told us. He said that includes the 1975 Helsinki Final Act’s provisions on respecting sovereignty; and the provisions of the 1997 Ukraine-Russia Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership on territorial integrity and non-use of force against the other. In addition, he said, the UN Charter says that states shall refrain from use of force except in self-defense or if authorized by the UN Security Council. Russia had agreed to get rid of many of its tactical nuclear weapons at the end of the Cold War, under the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives agreement, Kroenig said. ""But it kept many more than it promised to and is now building more,"" he said. In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007 suspended implementation of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.  Bergmann and Kroenig said that among the agreements in which Russia is in compliance is the New START Treaty, an arms-limitation deal signed by the United States and Russia in 2011. But Russia ""is building several new strategic systems that threaten the future viability of the treaty,"" Kroenig said. Taylor said, ""The Russians are violating all of the rules, treaties, understandings that they committed to that actually kept the peace in Europe for nearly 70 years."" Experts told us that ""all"" is an exaggeration, but that Russia has violated numerous treaties and agreements, including by its invasion and armed aggressions against parts of Ukraine. We rate the statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BA2540>],/factchecks/2019/nov/14/william-taylor/fact-checking-impeachment-witness-william-taylors-/

Donald Trump says some DACA recipients are ‘very tough, hardened criminals.’ That’s False
","Hours before the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on whether the Trump administration lawfully decided to wind down Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, President Donald Trump claimed that some immigrants in the Obama-era immigration program are criminals. ""Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from ‘angels.’ Some are very tough, hardened criminals,"" Trump tweeted Nov. 12. Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from “angels.” Some are very tough, hardened criminals. President Obama said he had no legal right to sign order, but would anyway. If Supreme Court remedies with overturn, a deal will be made with Dems for them to stay! Later, Trump also tweeted: ""DACA recipients with arrest records: 53,792! That is a very large proportion of the total."" Immigrants with significant criminal backgrounds are not eligible for the program, so we wanted to look into Trump’s claims more deeply. The Obama administration started the DACA program in 2012; the most recent numbers show that about 660,880 people (on average in their mid 20s) were protected from deportation under the program. Immigrants are ineligible for the program if they have been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanor offenses. They also cannot be deemed a threat to national security or public safety. RELATED: Did Obama say he didn't have the right to issue DACA? Most immigration attorneys are ""exceedingly cautious"" about letting individuals with anything but minor criminal offenses apply for DACA, said Ming Hsu Chen, an associate professor of law at the University of Colorado in Boulder. ""This is because they will not only not qualify, but they will put themselves at risk of immigration enforcement, having turned over a substantial amount of personal identity/biometrics information to the government,"" said Chen, who was a signatory to an amicus brief from immigration law professors urging the Supreme Court to protect DACA. Neither the White House or Trump’s re-election campaign provided on-the-record comment. However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, which reviews DACA applications, sent PolitiFact data on terminations and the arrest history of applicants. None of this data shows that immigrants with significant offenses are enjoying DACA protection. We found that in a five-year period, officials ended about 2,130 DACA protections. The majority of the terminations were for arrests or convictions unrelated to gang activity; fewer than 70 terminations were related to gang membership or affiliation, and they did not involve convictions or arrests. The government also provided data on approximately 889,000 people who applied for DACA. Of this group, 53,792 (the number Trump tweeted) had an arrest before their application was approved.  The top three offenses for those arrests were driving-related (excluding DUI), immigration-related (such as visa overstays), and ""theft, larceny, etc.""  The federal government said an arrest indicates that the individual was arrested or apprehended only, and does not mean the individual was convicted of a crime. They may not have been charged with a crime resulting from the arrest, may have had their charges reduced or dismissed, or may have been acquitted. Immigration experts told PolitiFact they were not aware of data on convictions of current DACA recipients. ""There is little to no publicly available empirical data to suggest that DACA recipients are ‘tough, hardened criminals’,"" said Tom K. Wong, an associate professor and director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Center at the University of California, San Diego. The government’s arrest data should not be taken to imply guilt or a conviction, he said. If DACA recipients have become ""hardened criminals,"" Chen said, they would be ineligible for renewals at two-year intervals. Trump said, ""Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from ‘angels.’ Some are very tough, hardened criminals."" Federal guidelines prohibit immigrants convicted of felonies, significant or numerous misdemeanors from enjoying DACA protection. Immigrants deemed to pose a threat to national security or public safety also do not benefit from the program. No government data shows that immigrants are actively getting protection despite convictions for significant offenses, as Trump’s tweet suggested.

But the ""Family Feud"" host did not make this rant. We recently came across one post that’s been shared over 134,000 times, titled ""HOW I FEEL ABOUT TRUMP"" with a large photo of Harvey. The rant talks about a man finding an infestation of raccoons in his basement. After multiple exterminators say they can’t handle the problem, he decides to bring in ""one guy...who guarantees to get rid of them."" The message suggests that although the man may have shortcomings, such as being an alcoholic, smelling bad or swearing, it doesn’t matter –– as long as he gets rid of the raccoons.  ""Here's why we want Trump: Yes, he's a bit of a jerk; Yes, he's an egomaniac; but we don't care!"" the analogy continues. ""The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republicans and Democrats can be two-faced and gutless, and illegals are everywhere.. We want it all fixed!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is several years old. The message appears to have originated in March 2016 when it was posted on conservative website ""100% FED up!"" In the introduction, the website said the letter was submitted by an anonymous 80-year-old American.   Best we can tell, the attribution to Harvey started in 2019, when a different man named (you guessed it) Steve Harvey posted it on his Facebook page. His post was shared over 160,000 times. At some point, the TV host’s photo was attached to the rant. The rest is celebrity misattribution history.  We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097261F40>],/factchecks/2019/nov/14/facebook-posts/no-steve-harvey-didnt-write-viral-pro-trump-raccoo/

Donald Trump says William Taylor and George Kent are Never Trumpers. There’s no evidence they are
","  As the first day of public impeachment hearings began with testimony from William Taylor and George Kent, President Donald Trump attacked the two senior foreign-policy officials at the hearing as implacable foes. ""The Impeachment Scam hearings begin today! This is a complete Fake Hearing (trial) to interview Never Trumpers and a Pelosi-Schiff SCAM against the Republican Party and me,"" Trump said in a blast fundraising email. What caught our eye was the notion that Taylor and Kent were ""Never Trumpers.""  Trump himself had leveled this accusation on Twitter about 90 minutes before the hearing began, tweeting simply, ""NEVER TRUMPERS!"" He had tweeted that term in reference to the impeachment inquiry several times earlier in November. NEVER TRUMPERS! During the hearing, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., asked each witness whether they were a Never Trumper. Both said they were not. We’ve found no evidence that either Taylor or Kent qualify under any reasonable definition of ""Never Trumpers."" (Neither the Trump campaign nor the White House responded to inquiries for this article.) Nothing in Taylor’s or Kent’s biographies shows they have strong political views. They have been in government for decades, serving under presidents of both parties. Taylor is the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, a role known as the chargé d’affaires. A career diplomat and U.S. Army veteran, he has worked in every administration since 1985, including most recently as the ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009. Kent is a career foreign-service officer who currently oversees State Department policy towards Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.  From 2015 to 2018, Kent served as deputy chief of mission in Kyiv. Previously, he served as the senior anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department’s European Bureau. From 2012 to 2014, he directed the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement. His earlier foreign service postings have included Warsaw; Kyiv; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; and Bangkok. Notably, both Taylor and Kent continue to serve in the Trump administration, and Trump officials named them to their current posts. The term ""Never Trumper"" came to prominence during the 2016 election to refer to individuals, especially Republicans, who were unhappy that Trump was the GOP nominee.  Liz Mair, one of the early leaders of the Never Trump movement, said she would define Never Trumper as ""a Republican who a) voted for Hillary Clinton b) voted third-party c) cast a write-in vote or d) refused to vote in 2016 and has not subsequently reversed course by expressing support for Trump, working for the Trump administration, donating to Trump, endorsing him in 2020, or contemplating voting for him in 2020."" Often, the term has been used in reference to historically Republican or nonpartisan foreign policy officials and advisers who refused to join the Trump administration if he were to win the 2016 election. At times, such officials publicly signed their names to letters. One of them, circulated by foreign-policy expert Eliot A. Cohen and others, said that ""as committed and loyal Republicans, we are unable to support a party ticket with Mr. Trump at its head. We commit ourselves to working energetically to prevent the election of someone so utterly unfitted to the office."" That letter included 122 signatures, none of which belong to Taylor or Kent. A second letter, published in the New York Times, said, ""None of us will vote for Donald Trump. From a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. Indeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous President and would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being."" None of the 50 signatories were Taylor or Kent. Tom Nichols, a U.S. Naval War College professor in national security affairs who has become a prominent Never Trump voice, told PolitiFact that he considers it ""laughable"" to call either Taylor or Kent a Never Trumper. ""I did not know of either of them until now, and I have been a regular at meetings of the Never Trump group in D.C. for over two years,"" Nichols said, speaking in his personal capacity. ""This makes no sense to me and seems to be an appellation applied to anyone Trump doesn't like after the fact."" Mair agreed. ""Kent and Taylor have never been regarded by Never Trumpers as Never Trumpers,"" she said. She added that, before the Ukraine controversy erupted, she heard other Never Trumpers privately deriding Taylor, Kent, or both as ""enablers"" of Trump by agreeing to serve in his administration. Geoffrey Kabaservice, director of political studies at the Niskanen Center, a think tank, helped organize some Never Trumper events in Washington. ""Certainly I had never heard either mentioned as a Never Trumper,"" he told PolitiFact. ""Trump clearly is trying to define a Never Trumper as a Republican and/or conservative who criticizes any aspect of Trump's presidency, or who cooperates with critics of Trump."" According to news reports, John B. Bellinger III, a lawyer with the firm Arnold & Porter, now represents Taylor. Bellinger does have tangible Never Trumper credentials. Bellinger signed the second letter referenced above, and he also joined a group of conservative legal figures opposed to Trump. ""Conservative lawyers are not doing enough to protect constitutional principles that are being undermined by the statements and actions of this president,"" Bellinger, a State Department and White House lawyer under President George W. Bush, told the New York Times in November 2018. However, just because Bellinger is a Never Trumper doesn’t mean that Taylor himself is a Never Trumper. In any case, Trump made the distinction on Oct. 23 when he tweeted, ""Never Trumper Republican John Bellinger, represents Never Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor (who I don’t know), in testimony before Congress!"" We reached out to Bellinger’s firm for this article but did not hear back.  Trump said Taylor and Kent are ""Never Trumpers.""  Both are career foreign policy officials who have served under presidents of both parties. Neither man signed one of the pre-election letters opposing Trump, and leading Never Trumpers told PolitiFact that they never heard of them associating with the group. Both received their current high posts by appointment from the Trump administration. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4DB880>],/factchecks/2019/nov/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-william-taylor-and-george-kent-a/

Claim about root canals causing serious illness not based on scientific evidence
","The theory that root canals cause serious illnesses has been debunked for years but seems to have gained new life on the internet after the documentary ""Root Cause"" was released on streaming platforms in 2019.  The film by Australian filmmaker Frazer Bailey is largely based on discredited dental research from the early 1900s and was pulled from Netflix in early 2019 amid backlash from dentistry organizations, academics and professionals. Social media about the film lives on, however, including one viral post on Facebook that says the procedure substantially weakens the body.  The post displays an illustration of a row of teeth along with text that says:  ""Did you know? Dentists are the only physicians that believe you can get away with leaving dead tissue in the body. One root canal tooth can shut down 63% of your immune system."" The text outside of the picture advises people to watch ""Root Cause"" and also makes the startling claim that, of all the women diagnosed with breast cancer, ""98% had a root canal on the same side."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A root canal repairs damaged or infected teeth. Instead of extracting an infected tooth, endodontists drill into the center of the tooth’s root to clean and fill the canals. The film alleges that infections inside of root canals cause a myriad of serious health problems, including cancer. It instructs viewers to have any teeth treated with root canals removed and replaced with a bridge or implant. The documentary reportedly includes commentary by alternative medicine physicians who have taken controversial stances on health topics including vaccines and Ebola treatments, according to an article by the Philly Voice.  The American Dental Association told PolitiFact the film’s claims have been disproven by decades of peer-reviewed, scientific evidence and may cause people unnecessary alarm.  The organization said it worked with the American Association of Endodontists and the American Association for Dental Research to contact platforms hosting the film, which included Netflix, Amazon and Vimeo. (The film is no longer available on Amazon Prime video but can still be rented or purchased on Vimeo.) The groups shared the concern that the documentary spreads misinformation, and that hosting such a film ""does a disservice to the public because it may cause unwarranted alarm to the point where people might avoid a very necessary dental procedure."" The American Dental Association added that approximately 25 million new endodontic treatments, which includes root canals, are performed safely each year. The UCLA School of Dentistry also released a statement regarding the film: ""The people in this movie are spreading misinformation and confusion about root canal treatment that is misleading and harmful to the consumer public. Their premise is based on junk science and faulty testing conducted more than 100 years ago that was debunked in the 1950s, continuously since then and is even more discredited today by physicians, dentists and academics. Mainstream medical and dental communities overwhelmingly agree that root canal treatment is safe, effective and eliminates pain."" The idea that bacteria trapped inside an endodontically-treated tooth will cause illness stems from research conducted by Dr. Weston Price in the 1920s. Price’s research suggested bacteria trapped in ""dentinal tubules"" during a root canal could ""leak"" and cause almost any type of degenerative systemic disease including arthritis and diseases of the kidney, heart, nervous, gastrointestinal, endocrine and other systems, according to a fact sheet on root canal safety by the American Association of Endodontists. The organization reported that Price advocated for extraction instead, resulting ""in a frightening era of tooth extraction both for treatment of systemic disease and as a prophylactic measure against future illness.""  In the time since, multiple reports and reviews published in scientific journals –– such as the Journal of the American Dental Association and the Journal of the American Medical Association –– have criticized Price’s research methods and discredited his findings.  We rate this claim about root canals leading to serious illnesses False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809671BF00>],/factchecks/2019/nov/13/facebook-posts/claim-about-root-canals-causing-serious-illness-no/

Pro-Trump Facebook ad takes text in Obama’s book wildly out of context
","A Facebook ad by a PAC supporting President Donald Trump distorts a statement in a book by President Barack Obama about African American voters.  The ad by the Committee to Defend the President is entitled ""Enough Empty Promises"" and targets African American voters. ""Democrats promised to help our community,"" the narrator says. ""Promises they never kept.""  The ad then pivots to Obama: ""Here is President Obama: 'Plantation politics. black people in the worst jobs, the worst housing, police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we’d all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey.' "" The narrator then continues: ""Enough empty promises. President Trump promised us jobs and he delivered. Democrats don’t care about us."" The ad ran Nov. 8 largely in states with a significant African American population including Georgia, Michigan and Louisiana. Trump is trying to chip away at the wide margin by which African Americans vote for Democrats. His ad coincided with his ""Black Voices for Trump"" visit in Atlanta. (Judd Legum, who writes the newsletter Popular Information, tweeted about the ad the day it first started running.) The ad takes words from a book by Obama where he was talking from the perspective of someone else. It takes those words out of context and gives them a meaning they didn’t have.  We’ve heard a similar ad before from a pro-Trump group. During a congressional election in Georgia in 2017, Great America Alliance ran a radio ad aimed at cutting African American turnout for Democrat Jon Ossoff. We rated that ad Pants on Fire.  The voice in that and the current ad sounds like Obama’s, but the words were not his own views. They came from Obama reading from his 1995 book ""Dreams From My Father"" about his days as a community organizer in Chicago. He recounted his conversation with a barber he called Smitty about Chicago’s first black mayor, Harold Washington. Smitty explains Chicago politics to Obama, who told the barber he was not in Chicago for the election of Washington. Here’s how the scene plays in the book: ""Had to be here before Harold to understand what he means to this city,"" Smitty said. ""Before Harold, seemed like we’d always be second-class citizens."" ""Plantation politics,"" the man with the newspaper said. ""That’s just what it was, too,"" Smitty said. ""A plantation. Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey. White folks spitting in our faces, and we’d reward ‘em with the vote."" In his book, Obama then described the power of African Americans to shape their political destiny when they are unified. Obama wrote:  ""They had turned out in record numbers on election night, ministers and gang-bangers, young and old. And their faith had been rewarded."" In Smitty’s words, ""The night Harold won, let me tell you, people just ran the streets,…."" he said, recounting how the community was proud of Washington and themselves. ""When I woke up the next morning, it seemed like the most beautiful day of my life."" The pro-Trump ad uses the passage to create the impression that Obama believed that black voters, ignored and suffering, sold their soul to the Democrats at election time. But the actual book passage is about the good things that come from voting. Chad Banghart, the executive director of the PAC, told us that he thinks it is clear that the ad is Obama reading from his book. However, the ad never states the context of Obama’s words.  Banghart also suggested that Smitty the barber was a fictional creation.  In the introduction of the book, Obama wrote that for the sake of compression some of the characters are composites. He wrote that other than family or public figures, the names of most characters were changed to protect their privacy. The Chicago Tribune identified the location of the barber shop in 2008 and in this 2015 graphic. The ad also said that ""President Trump promised us jobs and he delivered."" We found in August that the unemployment rates and poverty rates for African Americans are indeed at or near historical lows, as Trump indicated. However, there were also declines under Obama too. The text on the ad included attacks on four of the Democrats running for president: former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. These attacks related to Biden’s record opposing school busing, Harris’ record as a prosecutor, Warren’s statements identifying herself as Native American, and Sanders’ statements on reparations.   A pro-Trump Facebook ad says that Obama said black people have the ""worst jobs, the worst housing"" and face rampant police brutality, ""but when so-called black committeemen came around election time we’d all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey."" While Obama did say those words, they were not his own. In his book ""Dreams from my Father,"" Obama was describing a conversation with a Chicago barber who remembered African Americans helping elect Chicago’s first black mayor.  The ad creates an impression that Obama said that Democrats ignored the perils faced by black voters and then black voters turned around and automatically voted for them anyway. In reality, a Chicago barber told Obama that, but then said the Chicago mayor’s race showed that turning out to vote can make a difference.

"['Health Care', 'Health Check', 'Elizabeth Warren']","
Warren says out-of-pocket health spending will total $11 trillion in 10 years. We checked the math
","Promoting her much-discussed plan to create a single-payer ""Medicare for All"" health system, Sen. Elizabeth Warren emphasized a striking figure. ""If we make no changes over the next 10 years, Americans will reach into their pockets and pay out about $11 trillion on insurance premiums, copays, deductibles and uncovered medical expenses,"" the Democratic presidential candidate said in an Instagram video posted Nov. 4. The Democratic health care debate has been full of competing analyses and estimates about what Medicare for All might cost, what it might save and who would bear the brunt of paying for it. But this precise number was new to us. If true, it would be a figure both staggering and significant to the unfolding debate, as Americans try to understand how Warren’s brand of a single-payer health system could affect their pocketbooks. So we decided to dig in. We contacted the Warren campaign, which redirected us to a report from the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank, as well as to federal estimates of household out-of-pocket expenses and premium costs over the next decade. The Urban report doesn’t include the $11 trillion figure. But economist Linda Blumberg, who authored the paper, told us the statistic is ""perfectly consistent"" with the analysis. If anything, she said, the number is a lowball figure. When Blumberg and her team crunched the numbers, they found that, under the existing health care system, Americans can expect to pay $11.7 trillion between out-of-pocket costs – the copays, deductibles and uncovered medical expenses – and premiums over the next decade. That calculation comes from Urban’s model for projecting what individual households might expect to spend, factoring in inflation, on these types of health costs. ""Talking about the amount of money we expect households to be spending over time is a very important part of trying to educate people on what single-payer would do, and what the tradeoffs are for them,"" said Blumberg, who previously advised the Clinton White House on health policy. On the numbers, ""they’re roughly in the right neighborhood,"" she added. We consulted other analysts, too, and as far as we can tell, no one else has done a similar calculation. Experts told us that Urban’s estimate — and the Warren campaign’s use of it — checks out, based on what we know about American health care spending. Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation and expert on the Affordable Care Act, pointed to what a typical American family currently spends on health care: about $5,000 per year, when you look at out-of-pocket costs and premiums combined. Extrapolating from there, she said, Warren’s claim seems reasonable. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) ""Over the course of 10 years, when you add it up — that sounds about right,"" Cox said. ""The reality is, people do spend a lot on health care out of their pockets, and there’s a lot spent on their behalf by employers or taxpayer-funded programs that they never see."" Under Warren’s health care plan, Americans would pay nothing directly out-of-pocket — no premiums, copays or deductibles — for health care. So that $11 trillion would disappear from the cost side of the ledger. The figure Warren sited also tracks with national health expenditure projections for out-of-pocket health costs and health premium growth. The bigger picture Still, there are serious questions about the financing such a shift would require. And Warren’s Medicare for All plan has been under intense scrutiny since she unveiled it earlier this month, with many critics suggesting it’s too optimistic in its estimates of how much money a single-payer system would cost. Warren suggests the federal government would need to come up with $20.5 trillion — well below Urban’s estimate of $34 trillion. The difference comes largely from assumptions about how much the government could save, as well as decisions about how much to pay doctors and hospitals. Warren’s financing structure includes cracking down on tax evasion, new taxes on financial institutions and the wealthiest Americans, and maintaining what many employers currently pay into the system. Critics say that could yield its own inefficiencies. For instance, the way employer payments are structured could disproportionately harm small businesses, or lower-wage workers, noted Paul Ginsburg, who directs the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. He also argued that doctors and hospitals —represented by powerful lobbying organizations in Washington — could successfully battle any effort to pay them less, driving up what the government needs to spend. Still, those disputes are separate from the question of this particular statistic. Here, Warren’s on firm ground. Analysts also said the $11 trillion number gets at a larger point. Americans currently pay a lot out-of-pocket on health care. Certainly, some might see a tax hike under Warren’s proposed reform, or see downward pressure on their salaries. Still, others could experience major pocketbook relief. To be sure, Medicare for All is not the only approach to ameliorating what families pay for health care. Other, more incremental proposals — such as building on the ACA’s coverage expansions or pursuing a ""Medicare for all who want it"" approach touted by former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor — would cut into the $11 trillion as well, Cox said. While it wouldn’t eliminate that household cost burden, it would require less in taxes to finance. ""There’s a lot of ways to bring down what people spend on health care,"" Cox said. ""Any expansion of the role of public programs is likely to bring down individuals’ costs. It’s just a question of how much taxes have to go up to pay for that."" In her explanation of how she would structure and finance Medicare for All, Warren highlighted what Americans currently pay for ""insurance premiums, copays, deductibles and uncovered medical expenses."" The $11 trillion figure is staggering — and it checks out. Whether and how to address that issue is fiercely controversial, but on this particular stat, Warren’s statement is accurate. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973AAD00>],/factchecks/2019/nov/12/elizabeth-warren/warren-says-out-pocket-health-spending-will-total-/

","It didn’t take long after the Democratic-led House of Representatives formalized the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump for misinformation to start circulating about the rules of the road.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has led the House investigation into a July phone call in which Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.

The Judiciary Committee leads official impeachment proceedings in the House, while the Intelligence Committee leads the investigation. • The Democrats’ resolution does not require questions of witnesses to first be approved by Schiff. The House resolution says requests from members to call witnesses to provide testimony must be submitted in writing to Schiff. They have three days to do that after a hearing is announced. But the Facebook post overreaches in saying that the rules ""do not allow any witness to be called"" without his approval. Here’s what the resolution says about the power of members in the minority: ""To allow for full evaluation of minority witness requests, the ranking minority member may submit to the chair, in writing, any requests for witness testimony relevant to the investigation described in the first section of this resolution within 72 hours after notice is given for the first hearing designated pursuant to paragraph (1). Any such request shall be accompanied by a detailed written justification of the relevance of the testimony of each requested witness to the investigation described in the first section of this resolution."" That means any request from Nunes for additional testimony must go through Schiff.  RELATED: PolitiFact's Trump-Ukraine-Biden coverage in one place The impeachment resolution says that if Schiff were to refuse a request for additional witnesses, Republicans can bring the matter to a vote by the entire Intelligence Committee. There are 22 members of the committee, meaning the ultimate decision to call witnesses would not just come down to Schiff. However, in practice, it’s reasonable to assume that the Democratic majority would vote with Schiff. Democrats did not come up with these rules out of thin air. They borrowed from House investigation procedures that Republicans passed in 2015, said Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri and an impeachment expert, in an email. The claim that the impeachment resolution does not permit Trump a lawyer is only partially accurate — the two House committees leading the inquiry have different rules. The first is the Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Trump’s interactions with Ukraine. Under the House resolution, there is no role for the president’s lawyers to cross-examine witnesses, submit new evidence or provide a formal defense during hearings called by that committee. However, the Judiciary Committee, which will assess the Intelligence Committee’s findings, is permitted to carry out its work ""as to allow for the participation of the President and his counsel,"" according to the resolution. And the Judiciary Committee has described a clear role for the president’s counsel in those hearings. ""The rules do permit participation by (the president’s) counsel, unless (the president) blocks production of evidence requested by (the) Committee,"" Bowman said.  The House resolution does not say Schiff must approve all questions during impeachment proceedings. RELATED: There’s no evidence Schiff helped write the whistleblower complaint Here’s what the rules say about questioning witnesses: ""The chair and ranking minority member of the Permanent Select Committee shall be permitted to question witnesses for equal specified periods of longer than five minutes, as determined by the chair. The time available for each period of questioning under this paragraph shall be equal for the chair and the ranking minority member."" Per those rules, Schiff and Nunes will each have the opportunity to question witnesses. The resolution says nothing about Schiff approving Nunes’ questions ahead of time. ""The questioning rule seems a complete invention,"" Bowman said. A Facebook post claimed impeachment rules passed by House Democrats ""do not allow"" Republicans to call and question witnesses without Schiff’s permission, and that the resolution prohibits the involvement of Trump’s lawyers.  Requests for additional testimony must go through Schiff, but the decision to ultimately allow them is not his alone. Democrats and Republicans are given equal time to question witnesses, and there’s nothing in the resolution saying Schiff must approve questions. Trump is not permitted counsel during hearings held by the Intelligence Committee, but the same is not true for Judiciary Committee hearings The post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A44B840>],/factchecks/2019/nov/11/facebook-posts/social-media-posts-misrepresent-house-democrats-ru/

Rand Paul’s false equivalence about Trump, Biden on Ukraine
","Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., suggested that threats by President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden to withhold aid from Ukraine were ""exactly"" the same. Speaking on Meet the Press days before the first public hearings on impeachment, Paul said that Americans want fairness. ""And I don't think they're going to judge fairness, when they're accusing President Trump of the same thing Joe Biden did, threatening the aid, if some kind of corruption is not investigated. And it seems like everybody, both parties, have been threatening aid, if some kind of investigation either doesn't happen or is ended. And so I think, really, what's going to happen is people are going to say, ‘Oh, they're impeaching President Trump for exactly the same thing that Joe Biden did.’"" Paul continued: ""He threatened the aid, if they didn't fire someone. And supposedly, the president did, if they didn't investigate someone. So it sounds exactly like what Joe Biden did. And if they weren't going to impeach Joe Biden, they look like, you know, hypocrites, in a way, for going only after President Trump and having not a word to say about what Joe Biden did."" U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., disputed Paul’s characterization later on in the show. ""Let's be very clear. The president of the United States demanding, extorting a vulnerable country to do his political bidding, to go after his opponent, has nothing to do with Joe Biden executing the foreign policy of the United States,"" Himes said. We found that Paul created a false equivalency when summarizing the actions of Trump and Biden. The two cases are not the same, or even particularly similar. We told a Paul spokesperson that based on our previous fact-checking, the actions by Trump and Biden are not the same. ""The question itself shows the bias of the media on this issue,"" a spokesperson replied. ""The motivations of then-Vice President Biden clearly could have included shielding his family and their oligarch patron from scrutiny, yet this is dismissed because of bias. "" Paul’s reference to Biden threatening aid stems from when Biden called for Ukraine to fire prosecutor general Viktor Shokin.  Biden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015. Many Western leaders and institutions, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, viewed Shokin as corrupt and ineffective for failing to prosecute anybody of significance, and for protecting members of the ruling class.   A frustrated Biden in December 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Biden, it worked.  At a Jan. 23, 2018, event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden recounted his threat to then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and from then-Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. ""I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours,"" Biden recounted. ""If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" The big point: On top of the international support for what he did, Biden was representing the views of the U.S. government and its foreign policy analysts. Paul’s reference to Trump threatening aid if Ukraine didn’t investigate someone stems from a July 25 phone call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenksy. According to a readout of the call published by the White House on Sept. 25, Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden and his family’s dealings in Ukraine.  Trump said: ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me."" The withholding of the aid while asking a foreign leader to investigate a potential political rival is at the heart of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry in the House.  Trump told Zelensky that he would have his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr call him. Trump temporarily froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine before their July 25 phone call. The frozen aid was released Sept. 11, after Trump’s call became publicly known. During the phone call, Trump said ""a lot of people are talking about"" the removal of a ""very fair prosecutor"" in Ukraine. We rated that statement False. A complaint by the whistleblower lodged to the inspector general of the intelligence community stated that other White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the phone call. They discussed how to treat the phone call because they had believed Trump was using his position for personal gain. Paul said Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president ""sounds exactly like what Joe Biden did."" Paul equated the actions of Trump and Biden, but they are not the same. Biden threatened to withhold aid unless Ukraine fired a prosecutor who was widely viewed as corrupt — in line with U.S. and international policy. Trump, by contrast, temporarily froze aid and then asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden, his potential 2020 political rival.  We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097047340>],/factchecks/2019/nov/11/rand-paul/rand-paul-said-trumps-actions-related-ukraine-were/
"['National', 'Legal Issues', 'Donald Trump Jr.']","
Is outing the whistleblower only a crime if the inspector general does it?
","Panelists of ABC’s ""The View"" recently grilled Donald Trump Jr. on the issue of revealing the identity of the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry of Trump’s father. Before the interview, Trump had joined a growing chorus of White House supporters seeking to publicize the whistleblower’s name, tweeting out an article that alleged the possible identity of the whistleblower. The president himself has urged the media to report his name, as have a Trump ally, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and other Republicans on Capitol Hill.  ""The View"" co-host Sunny Hostin, a former federal prosecutor who also serves as senior legal correspondent and analyst for ABC News, suggested that the younger Trump's tweet may have broken the law. Here’s the exchange between Trump, his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Hostin: Hostin: ""Kimberly, you’re a lawyer… Did you advise your boyfriend that it is a federal crime to out a whistleblower?"" Trump Jr.: ""It’s only a federal crime for the (inspector general) to do it. That’s in the statute."" Hostin: ""That’s a lie. ... Under U.S. Code section 1505, it is a crime. … My law degree says it is."" Is Trump right that ""it’s only a federal crime for the IG"" to out a whistleblower?"" He’s accurately described the most relevant law on this subject, but he’s glossed over a few other statutes that could come into play. ""There is no statute that contains a general prohibition on disclosing the name of a whistleblower except for the provision that says the IG and his staff can’t disclose it,"" said Robert Litt, an attorney who served as general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during the Obama administration. However, Litt added, ""That’s not the end of the story. There are other statutes that, depending on the circumstances could apply."" Several independent legal experts agreed with Trump’s retort about the inspector general. As Trump noted in a followup tweet, it comes from U.S. Code Section  3033, which specifically bars the inspector general from releasing a name, but is silent on others who would do so. ""There is no overarching protection for the identity of the whistleblower under federal law,"" Dan Meyer, a former executive director of an intelligence community whistleblower program, told NPR. ""Congress has never provided that protection."" Another part of Section 3033 does provide broader protection for workplace ""reprisal."" But by addressing ""disclosure"" and ""reprisal"" separately, the law suggests that disclosure by itself doesn’t amount to reprisal — and that disclosure alone doesn’t qualify for the stronger protections granted against ""reprisal."" Other provisions of federal law could possibly cover the whistleblower scenario, but we can’t say they’d be relevant without knowing more than we do now. A 1982 amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 makes it a crime to intentionally disclose ""any information identifying"" a covert intelligence agent. This provision would be irrelevant if the whistleblower is not a covert agent. Reports based on anonymous sources have said the whistleblower is a CIA officer who had been detailed to the White House. Meanwhile, there’s another argument: that revealing the whistleblower’s name is tantamount to obstructing justice — in this case, the work of Congress in carrying out impeachment. This is what Hostin was getting at when she referred to Section 1505, which makes it a crime if someone ""corruptly, or by threats or force … influences, obstructs, or impedes … the due and proper administration of the law."" This passage specifically mentions a congressional proceeding, legal experts pointed out, which would seem to cover the example of the impeachment inquiry.  There’s a related statute on witness retaliation that may be relevant as well. Section 1513 makes it a crime to retaliate against someone ""for providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any Federal offense."" Some attorneys argue that the scenario involving the whistleblower would qualify under one or both of these provisions.  Section 1513 was cited by a lawyer for the whistleblower in a cease-and-desist letter sent to the White House, an ABC spokeswoman noted. And on Nov. 9, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff released a statement that cited ""the president’s effort to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower."" Sections 1505 and 1513 ""would make it criminal to harm the whistleblower in his or her ‘employment’ or ‘livelihood,’"" said Stephen M. Kohn, a founding partner of Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto LLP, a law firm specializing in whistleblower representation. ""This covers any person — federal employee or not. Because an intelligence community employee needs to maintain a level of confidentiality to perform his or her job, including overseas assignments, I believe that ‘outing’ this person would constitute a serious criminal offense."" There’s another potential negative consequence for the person outing a whistleblower short of criminal liability: They could leave themselves open to lawsuits for damages. This is not an idle concern, given that the whistleblower has received death threats and is under security measures, the whistleblower’s co-counsel, Andrew Bakaj, told USA Today. Trump said, ""It’s only a federal crime for the"" inspector general to out a whistleblower. He has zeroed in on the clearest legal barrier to outing a whistleblower (at least one who isn’t a covert operative). However, it would be possible to argue in court that outing a whistleblower also qualifies as obstruction of justice or witness retaliation, which — if a judge agrees — would be another scenario in which this results in a federal crime. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1FC400>],/factchecks/2019/nov/11/donald-trump-jr/outing-whistleblower-only-crime-if-inspector-gener/
