No, Kente cloth worn by Democrats is not a symbol of slavery
","Typically, politicians use words to make a point. But on June 8, congressional Democrats draped themselves in a bright African fabric and knelt in protest of police killing of blacks. The statement might have been wordless, but the blowback was not. A Facebook user posted an image of the event with a message of his own about the fabric on the Democrats’ shoulders. It is called Kente cloth. ""The Kente cloth was worn by affluent African slave traders,"" reads a June10 Facebook post. ""This would be like honoring Jews by wearing swastikas."" We reached people who study the history of the Kente cloth. They said the post dropped a couple of hundred years of history.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The first Kente cloth emerged about 500 years ago in the area of West Africa now known as Ghana. The dominant group were the Ashanti, who, by the early 1800s, controlled nearly all of the area of present-day Ghana. (Asante is an alternative spelling.) The Ashanti played a well-documented role in the European slave trade. In the 1700s, millions of Africans passed through Ghana ports, having been sold to British and Dutch slavers in exchange for weapons and other European goods. The British abolished slavery in 1807, but enforcement of the ban in Western Africa was weak. So, at the time of the slave trade, Ashanti royalty wore Kente. However, art historians say that the brilliant colors and patterns of the modern version came after the British banned the slave trade.  But more important, what happened under the British changed the fabric from something a person wore, to a symbol of who a person was. Through the 1800s, the Ashanti fought a long-running battle against the British, until  1902, when Britain declared Ghana a colony.  ""There was a long tradition of contesting colonial rule by adopting local dress styles by more radical members of the new African middle class that emerged in the British colonies of West Africa,"" said London-based researcher and African textile dealer Duncan Clarke. ""The suggestion that it is a symbol of slave traders is not one I have seen before."" In 1957, Ghana became the first sub-Saharan African British colony to gain independence.  Kwame Nkrumah, the first African-born prime minister to oversee Ghana following its independence, wore a Kente cloth when he came to Washington to meet President Dwight Eisenhower. ""Nkrumah was claiming the mantle of indigenous leadership,"" said Swarthmore College professor of religion James Padilioni. ""The fabric represented the return of self-rule to that land."" African American thought leaders, including sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois and poet Maya Angelou, moved to Ghana in the early 1960s. Padilioni said that by 1970, many black churches adopted the cloth as liturgical vestments, and in the 1980s, Bronx hip-hop artists such as Afrika Bombaataa used it, too.  ""These are the cultural contexts for why in the U.S., for most black Americans, Kente is about a certain type of black pride birthed during the 1960s Civil Rights movement and the black freedom struggle,"" Padilioni said. At the Democratic event, members of the Congressional Black Caucus distributed the Kente cloths to their colleagues. The sight of white politicians draped in the Kente cloth drew barbs from people who saw it as a superficial use of African symbolism. Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., head of the Congressional Black Caucus, didn’t see it that way. ""The significance of the Kente cloth is our African heritage and for those of you without that heritage who are acting in solidarity,"" Bass told reporters. As for the comparison to the swastika and Jews? ""Bending and stretching the truth, to say the least,"" said Padilioni. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in 1920 adopted the swastika as the symbol of the National Socialist Party in Germany. It was the central symbol on the Nazi flag and came to represent the party’s goal of racial purification. Under that banner, 6 million Jews were murdered. It is the enduring symbol of the white supremacist movement. A post on Facebook said that Democrats wearing the Kente cloth ""worn by affluent African slave traders"" is ""like honoring Jews by wearing swastikas."" A simplified version of the fabric was worn at a time when African leaders were part of the slave trade. No evidence suggests it was the mark of a slave trader. In the 1800s, the cloth began to take on the meaning of African identity in opposition to British rule. The first independent prime minister of Ghana wore it when he met Eisenhower in 1958. It became tied to the Civil Rights movement, and was adopted by black clergy and black musicians. The people we reached who study textile history say it has never been tied to slavery the way the swastika is tied to Nazis. We rate this claim False.","[('Facebook, Post, June 10, 2020\xa0', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10217495563806354&set=a.10201106256723920&type=3'), ('Philadelphia Museum of Art, Kente cloth, accessed June 11, 2020', 'No link'), ('BBC, Why were US Democrats wearing Ghana’s kente cloth?, June 9, 2020', 'https://www.philamuseum.org/micro_sites/exhibitions/africanart/resource_book/object_text.pdf'), ('Nanjala Nyabola, tweet, June 8, 2020', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, Kente cloth is beloved in Ghana.

Yes, Wisconsin has seen a drop of more than a billion in tourism dollars
","Major industries in Wisconsin have sustained significant economic losses during the coronavirus pandemic, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the tourism sector. Wisconsin plays host to about 112 million tourists in a year, according to the WorldAtlas website, and 2019 was ""a record setting year, and the largest year for Wisconsin in at least a decade"" said Wisconsin Secretary of Tourism-designee Sara Meaney. However, the loss of revenue in 2020 is massive, she said.  In a May 24, 2020, appearance on the WISN-TV (Channel 12) show ""UpFront,"" she said, ""Unemployment in our state in general is at about a quarter of our population. It’s actually over 50% of travel and tourism-related jobs that are now facing unemployment.""  Meaney went on to say that just in the weeks since the pandemic hit, the state has lost more than a billion dollars in tourism dollars.  ""Since the week ending March 14, Wisconsin actually saw a drop in tourism spending compared to last year of $1.7 billion,"" she said.  Wisconsin’s tourism industry should come back a bit this summer. Some northern resorts have opened and state campgrounds reopened June 10, according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.  But that tourism recovery could be an uphill climb if Meaney is correct that year-over-year weekly travel spending in the state has dropped $1.7 billion since March. Let’s take a look. Craig Trost, Wisconsin Department of Tourism communications director, pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the U.S. Travel Association, which commissioned a study by Tourism Economics, the firm the department uses for its economic impact data. The U.S. Travel Association is a national, non-profit organization representing the travel industry, with various sectors — including transportation, lodging, retail, recreation, leisure and entertainment and food service, meetings and trade shows.   Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, explained that the analysis is based on a combination of factors: daily hotel data (nights and revenue) from STR, a research company that tracks the hospitality industry; flight data (seats and passengers) from Airline Data Inc. and the Transportation Security Administration; and drive travel data (outside 50 mile radius) from Arrivalist based on mobile device data.   Trost said the week ending March 14 was significant because that is when COVID-19 began significantly impacting tourism spending. ""Since the beginning of March, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over $176 billion in losses for the U.S. travel economy,"" the report states. According to the report, Wisconsin’s  year-over-year net change in weekly travel spending from the week ending March 28 to the week ending May 16 was down about $200 million each week. When going back earlier in March, the report notes losses for the week ending March 14 at $17 million and the week ending March 21 of $50 million. That brings the total to $1.775 billion.  Romy Snyder, CEO/President of the Wisconsin Dells Visitor and Convention Bureau, said it will take time to correctly analyze and know the true financial impact of COVID-19 on Wisconsin Dells.  ""We do know the loss of visitors has been detrimental to the local tourism economy,"" Snyder said in an email. ""According to 2019 numbers, the spring and summer seasons account for 66% of direct visitor spending in Wisconsin Dells."" Snyder said area businesses are ready to welcome visitors.  ""Wisconsin Dells’ businesses are working to accommodate current visitors to the area in a safe manner by increasing sanitation procedures and limiting capacities and hours of operation,"" Snyder said. ""We know Wisconsin Dells has strong brand awareness in the Midwest, which will help our area when people are ready to travel and are looking for an accessible vacation destination with a diversity of activities."" Jon Jarosh of Destination Door County said area businesses have been getting ready and opening up.  ""Everybody has a little different protocol in terms of what they’re going to allow at their particular business,"" Jarosh said on the same ""UpFront"" program where Meaney appeared via remote. ""We’re asking our visitors and residents that are out and about to just respect the individual businesses and what they are asking for. But by and large most businesses are going to be asking that their customers do wear a face covering of some sort and also just practice social distancing guidelines.""  A major Dells attraction, Noah’s Ark water park, set its opening date for June 20, the first day of summer. The water park plans a number of precautions in line with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Those precautions include social distancing and limiting capacity not only in the park itself but also on specific attractions and in buildings. The park is requiring guests to RSVP for the day they want to visit, and visitors must buy tickets in advance online. Walk-up tickets will not be sold. Meaney said the state’s tourism losses have topped $1.7 billion since March.  Data from weekly studies commissioned by the U.S. Travel Association, an organization with over 1,100 members nationwide, found that beginning the week ending March 14, when the COVID-19 crisis first began to significantly impact tourism spending, Wisconsin was down $17 million compared to a year earlier. The drop in year-over-year travel spending in the state mounted weekly, with the latest available report reporting a drop of $214 million for the week ending May 16. That brings the state tourism sector drop to $1.775 billion since the week ending March 14. For a statement that is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing, our rating is True.

Photo of Chick-fil-A employees with ‘Back the Blue’ shirts taken out of context
","Social media users are sharing an image on Facebook of Chick-fil-A employees wearing ""Back the Blue'' T-shirts, a color typically used to refer to the police. The posts suggest that the fast-food chain distributed the shirts following the recent protests over police brutality. The image in the post shows Chick-fil-A workers wearing the shirts through a drive-thru window. The caption above the photo starts with, ""As a retort to ‘BLACK LIVES MATTER.’"" Some of the words aren’t readable, but the caption concludes with: ""Be careful who you patronize. They may want your $$, but make a mockery of our oppression and pain. I hear you loud and clear tho (sic). I think y’all trash anyway."" This is misleading. The photograph is several years old and was worn in support of a local high school football team at one Chick-fil-A location in Texas, the company says. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reached out to Jackson Spalding, Chick-fil-A’s public relations firm, but did not hear back.  A representative of the firm did tell Reuters that the photo is currently being taken out of context, and confirmed that the shirts were made in 2015 by ""one locally owned-and-operated Chick-fil-A restaurant"" to support a high school football team. A November 2015 article by law enforcement website PoliceOne.com counteracts that slightly,  and cites a quote from a manager who said the shirts were meant to support local law enforcement, as well as the football team.  Meanwhile, in 2016, fact-checking website Snopes looked into claims that the shirts were given to Chick-fil-A employees in response to shootings at a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas that killed five police officers.   A Chick-fil-A representative clarified the manager’s words, and told Snopes the shirts were never meant as a reference to police officers and said that one locally owned restaurant in Houston created the shirts for the sole reason of supporting its local football team.  The fast-food company released a statement June 3 addressing the protests and said that ""racism should have no place in society. Not now, not ever. It cannot be tolerated."" Social media users are sharing an image of Chick-fil-A workers wearing ""Back the Blue"" shirts and claim the company distributed them to employees as a response to recent protests over police brutality.

There are some conflicting reports about whether the shirts were also meant to honor local police officers, but the company repeatedly said the shirts were made to solely support a local high school football team.

WHO comment sparks ‘I-told-you-so’ about coronavirus spread
","A recent comment from a public health official is driving unproven claims and conspiracy theories about how the coronavirus may be spreading. A June 9 Facebook post says the World Health Organization ""now admits that asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 is very rare.""  ""The claims of asymptomatic transmission was (sic) a major justification for social distancing, the lockdowns, and masks,"" reads the image, which is a screenshot of a text post. ""Everything about COVID-19 hysteria has been a lie."" Other social media posts have used the WHO’s comments to spin more elaborate ""I-told-you-so"" conspiracy theories about the pandemic, including one that claims it was fabricated. Some claimed the comments show that masks and social distancing are ""unnecessary without symptoms"" and that they were somehow connected to protests after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after a white officer kneeled on his neck. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  (Screenshot from Facebook) Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, public health officials have warned that infected people without any detectable symptoms can still spread the virus. That fact is one of the reasons that officials have advised healthy people to wear masks while in public.  So we wanted to check out claims about the WHO’s most recent comments on asymptomatic coronavirus patients. While an official with the WHO recently said asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus is ""rare,"" the international public health organization has since walked back those comments — and several of the posts about the WHO’s communication about asymptomatic spread were published after the organization issued its clarification. There is no evidence that the WHO statement was connected to ongoing protests over police brutality, that it shows social distancing rules lack scientific backing, or that the pandemic itself was fabricated. During a June 8 press briefing, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO technical lead for COVID-19, said that asymptomatic spread is ""very rare."" The next day, she clarified her statement. Here are her initial comments from June 8, in context: ""We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing. They’re following asymptomatic cases, they’re following contacts and they’re not finding secondary transmission onward — it’s very rare. Much of that is not published in the literature. From the papers that are published, there’s one that came out from Singapore looking at a long-term care facility. There are some household transmission studies where you follow individuals over time and you look at the proportion of those that transmit onwards. ""We are constantly looking at this data and we’re trying to get more information from countries to truly answer this question. It still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward. What we really want to be focused on is following the symptomatic cases. If we followed all of the symptomatic cases — because we know that this is a respiratory pathogen, it passes from an individual through infectious droplets. If we actually followed all of the symptomatic cases, isolated those cases, followed the contacts and quarantined those contacts, we could drastically reduce — I would love to be able to give a proportion — of how much transmission we would actually stop. But it would be a drastic reduction in transmission.  ""If we could focus on that, I think we would do very, very well in terms of suppressing transmission. But from the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual."" Those comments appeared to suggest that the WHO was saying the coronavirus can’t really spread from asymptomatic people. News organizations published reports about Van Kerkhove’s statement, with CNBC publishing in a now-updated story that ""coronavirus patients without symptoms aren’t driving the spread of the virus.""  But on June 9, Van Kerkhove walked back her words in a question-and-answer session. Here’s what she said: ""What I was referring to yesterday in the press conference were a very few studies, some two or three studies, that have been published that actually try to follow asymptomatic cases — so people who are infected — over time, and then look at their contacts and see how many additional people were infected. And that’s a very small subset of studies. ""I was responding to a question at the press conference. I wasn’t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that. I was just trying to articulate what we know. And in that, I used the phrase ‘very rare.’ And I think that that’s a misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare. What I was referring to was a subset of studies. I also referred to data that isn’t published."" Van Kerkhove went on to say that some models have predicted that anywhere between 6% and 41% of the population could be asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. But she said she didn’t mention them during the June 8 press briefing because they are estimates, not research. In a June 10 interview on ""Good Morning America,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the WHO’s initial comment ""was not correct."" ""There’s no evidence to indicate that’s the case. And in fact, the evidence that we have, given the percentage of people — which is about 25% to 45% — of the totality of infected people, likely are without symptoms,"" he said. ""And we know from epidemiological studies they can transmit to someone who is uninfected even when they're without symptoms."" The bottom line: Asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 does occur. But there’s too much scientific uncertainty to confidently say how big of a problem it is in context of overall spread. ""We’re six months into a pandemic,"" Van Kerkhove said on June 9. ""There’s a huge amount of research that’s being done, but we don’t have that full picture yet."" A Facebook post claimed the WHO ""now admits that asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 is very rare."" Van Kerkhove did say during a press briefing that it appeared to be ""very rare"" for an asymptomatic person to spread the novel coronavirus. But she walked back her comments the next day, saying it’s ""a misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare."" Fauci said the WHO’s initial comment ""was not correct.""  The post paraphrases more or less what Van Kerkhove said, but since it was published after Van Kerkhove clarified her comments about asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus, the post leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.","[('CNBC, ""Asymptomatic spread of coronavirus is ‘very rare,’ WHO says,"" June 8, 2020', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/asymptomatic-coronavirus-patients-arent-spreading-new-infections-who-says.html'), ('CNN, ""Coronavirus spread by asymptomatic people \'appears to be rare,\' WHO official says""', 'No link'), ('CNN, ""Fauci says the WHO\'s comment on asymptomatic spread is wrong.

These photos don’t prove George Floyd is alive
","George Floyd died after a police officer pressed his knee into the 46-year-old’s neck for nearly nine minutes. His death has been ruled a homicide and the officer has been charged with murder.  Claims on social media that the death was staged, and that Floyd has appeared in public since the incident on May 25, are wrong.  ""George Floyd at his own funeral and George Floyd 3 days ago,"" reads one Facebook post. ""You forgot America has facial recognition camera ever where, in all city. Facebook and YouTube keep deleted the video that show it a freeman mind operation to bring in Military police in ever city. George Floyd club manager was a crisis actor from Sandy Hook so is the fake police that was on George Floyd’s neck."" The post shows two pictures: one of someone standing in a group of people wearing a black hat, glasses, face mask and hoodie with the words: ""RIP George Floyd."" The other is a selfie with this text over it: ""Video 3 days ago."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We have already debunked claims that Floyd’s death was staged, among other unfounded allegations. But let’s look at the photos used in this Facebook post.  The first shows former NBA player Stephen Jackson at a rally in support of George Floyd, according to a story on the NBA’s website. Floyd was from Houston and so was Jackson, who said they were friends.

Yes, if federal abortion law were overturned, Wisconsin law could make procedure a crime
","When the U.S. Supreme Court hands down a decision on an abortion rights case heard earlier this year, it will be Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s first chance at affecting the country’s abortion landscape.  The case, June Medical Services v. Russo, asks the court to decide whether a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital conflicts with a previously settled case in Texas that held such laws only made abortion access more difficult.  With Kavanaugh on the bench, conservatives now make up a solid majority of the court, and abortion rights advocates fear that a ruling on June Medical Services that sides with the state of Louisiana could ultimately pave the way for the court to make changes to Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that legalized the procedure in 1973.  Such advocates include Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, which released a statement following oral arguments for the case on March 4, 2020.  If the court upholds the Louisiana law, ""abortion could become effectively banned in states across the country, without ever overturning Roe v. Wade,"" the statement says.  It continues: ""Worst case scenario, if Roe is overturned, Wisconsin has a law on the books that would immediately make abortion a crime.""  Would abortion be a crime in Wisconsin if the federal law was overturned? Let’s dig in.  In the section of Wisconsin state statutes that details crimes ""against life and bodily security,"" abortion is included as such a crime.  ""Any person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child is guilty"" of a felony, the law states. It outlines some exceptions, such as if the life of the mother is at stake.  Though the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau has noted that Roe renders this state law unenforceable, it does still exist — and should the federal law be overturned, regulating abortion would be a job fully returned to the state legislatures.  Wisconsin is one of 20 states that have laws that could be used to restrict the legal status of abortion if Roe is overturned, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization that supports abortion access. What’s not so clear, though, is whether the law would take effect automatically if the overriding federal law were to disappear.  There is disagreement about whether such old laws could immediately take effect or whether they would need to be re-enacted, said University of Wisconsin-Madison law and bioethics professor Alta Charo, because they have been rendered ineffective for decades.  This scenario might prompt litigation over the matter instead of an immediate return to enforcing the old law, she said.  Nonetheless, the law that would criminalize the procedure is on the books in the Badger State.  If federal abortion law were overturned, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin claims there’s a law on the books that would make the procedure a crime.  There is such a law, and if Roe disappears, the right would return to the state to enforce it.  We rate this claim True.

A claim by then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, that ""repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied"" by ""Clinton’s State Department,"" was rated True.  On June 2, a hearing (not a trial) was held in a lawsuit involving the attack and Clinton’s use of a private email account and server during her tenure as secretary of state.  That lawsuit was filed in 2014 by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues against the U.S. State Department. The suit seeks records, including emails, in connection with the Benghazi attack. Clinton is challenging a ruling that she can be deposed in the case. Her lawyers asked the federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., to vacate the ruling. According to coverage of the hearing by the National Law Journal, Politico and other news reports: Judicial Watch attorney Ramona Cotca told the court that the group wants to identify all sources where Clinton emails reside, and wants the State Department to do an adequate search for emails. Clinton attorney David Kendall told the court a deposition could be harassing, saying footage of a video deposition could be used by Judicial Watch for political or fundraising needs.

Homeownership gap between white and Black Americans is higher now than in 1960s
","Joe Biden does not support the call from racial-justice activists to ""defund the police."" In a USA Today op-ed, he proposed other policies for rooting out systemic racism in American laws and institutions, focusing on economic opportunities. Homeownership is key to financial stability and building generational wealth, Biden wrote, yet the share of African Americans who own their homes is significantly lower than for whites. ""Today, the gap between African American and white homeownership is larger than it was in the late 1960s,"" Biden wrote in the June 10 op-ed. ""We have to give local officials the tools to combat gentrification, end discriminatory lending practices, and eliminate exclusionary zoning laws designed to keep low-income people and people of color out of certain communities."" Is Biden right about the homeownership gap being larger now than in the late 1960s? His op-ed linked to an October 2019 report from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Researchers there told PolitiFact that Biden accurately referenced their findings, and their data aligned with the U.S. Census Bureau numbers, which also backed Biden’s claim. RELATED: Seeking reparations, Ta-Nehisi Coates says typical Blacks have one-tenth the wealth of whites The homeownership rate refers to the share of households living in owner-occupied homes, rather than renting. The Urban Institute said that in 2017, the white homeownership rate was 71.9% compared with 41.8% for Blacks. (The gap was similar in 2019 and during the first quarter of 2020.) The Black homeownership rate in 2017 was at its lowest level in 50 years and also the lowest of all racial and ethnic groups, according to the Urban Institute. ""The racial homeownership gap between Black households and white households is more than 30 percentage points, which is greater than it was before the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act,"" the Urban Institute report said. It’s difficult to say what the homeownership rate for Black and white Americans was in a given year in the 1960s, because the Census Bureau does not have yearly data on homeownership by race for that decade. (That detailed data is available for the 1970s and later.) Still, the available data show the homeownership gap was lower in 1960 and 1970 than it is now. Homeownership rate by race, according to a 1994 Census Bureau report: 1960: white 64.4%, Black 38.4% (26-point gap)
1970: white 65.2%, Black 41.6% (23.6-point gap)     The Urban Institute provided similar figures to PolitiFact for the 1960s and 1970s. The homeownership rates for non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic whites generally decreased from 2007 through 2016. Since then, the rate for whites has been ticking back up, while Blacks have had a mix of up and down years. RELATED: Fact-checking Mike Bloomberg’s response to redlining attack Among the factors cited for the racial homeownership gap, according to the Urban Institute’s report: Black Americans have lower median household income.  Black households are less likely to have a bachelor’s degree or higher education level, limiting income potential. White households tend to have higher credit scores and longer credit histories.  Marital status has a ""strong association"" with homeownership rates, and residents of Black households are less likely to get married. The racial gap in homeownership is also rooted in federal housing policies, created in the 20th century in response to the Great Depression, ""that explicitly discriminated against African American, Latino, and other families of color by denying them access to federally insured mortgage programs because of their race,"" Nikitra Bailey, executive vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending, told a House committee in May 2019. The recession of 2008-10 also ""wiped out"" 30 years of homeownership gains for African Americans, Bailey said. ""Evidence shows that a large number of borrowers of color were targeted and steered into toxic mortgages, even when they qualified for safer and more responsible loans with cheaper costs."" Biden said, ""Today, the gap between African American and white homeownership is larger than it was in the late 1960s."" This claim is supported by research from the Urban Institute and data from the Census Bureau.

No, Donald Trump church photo op was not the same as Bill Clinton church photo
","President Donald Trump drew widespread criticism after hoisting a Bible for a June 1 photo op in front of a Washington church damaged by protesters. After a speech in which Trump raised the specter of military deployment to quell protests, police forcibly cleared demonstrators so the president could walk across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Church. The imagery was praised by some Trump supporters in the faith community, but many others decried it as a stunt. One defender turned to history to make her case, saying, ""It wasn't a big deal when (President) Bill Clinton held up the Bible in front of the same exact church."" The Facebook post, from June 3, was shared more than 5,000 times. The caption appeared above a photo of Clinton holding a Bible in front of a church sign, which like the one in Trump’s photo had white lettering on a black background. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Did Clinton really raise a Bible in front of the same church, and is the implied similarity between the two images reasonable? The short answer to both questions is no. The photo of Clinton was taken July 9, 2000, by Manny Ceneta and distributed by Getty Images. The caption says it shows Clinton waving his Bible ""following a church service at Foundry United Methodist Church."" Clinton worshipped there ""most Sundays when he’s in town,"" according to a 1998 Washington Post article. So it’s not the same church. And the post’s underlying implication about the similarity of the two situations is just as off base. Clinton was pictured carrying his Bible after attending a church service at his church. Trump’s circumstances were … different. Trump has attended the church a few times, but he’s hardly a regular. The Post reports he attended a service before his swearing-in ceremony in 2017 — following a tradition dating back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt — as well as one other time in 2017 and once in 2019. The church was boarded up at the time of Trump’s June 1 visit, after a fire was set in the basement amid the protests over the death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police. It hadn’t hosted services since mid-March due to the coronavirus restrictions. Critics have noted the moment’s stark contrast to what preceded it. Before going to St. John’s, Trump had delivered a Rose Garden address where he called himself an ""ally of peaceful protesters"" but also invoked strong military language. He condemned protest violence as ""domestic terror,"" urged governors to deploy National Guard to ""dominate the streets"" and promised to deploy the military to ""quickly solve the problems for them"" if state and local officials didn’t take action. Trump closed by saying, ""now I’m going to pay my respects to a very, very special place."" Trump didn’t say much during the stop, where he posed alone and with a group of aides, holding a Bible handed to him by his daughter, Ivanka Trump. When a reporter asked if the Bible was his, Trump responded, ""It’s a Bible."" When asked more generally for his thoughts, Trump talked about America being a ""great country."" And the entire photo op occurred without the permission or involvement of the church, which later condemned the visit. Trump did not inform church leadership he was coming. No one associated with the church was present. He did not enter the building. He did not quote any Scripture. He did not pray. Rev. Mariann Budde, who oversees the church’s denomination in Washington, D.C., said she was ""outraged"" to see the resulting images. ""I am the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and was not given even a courtesy call, that they would be clearing (the area) with tear gas so they could use one of our churches as a prop,"" Budde told the Washington Post. Budde is referring to what preceded the four-minute walk Trump and his entourage took to reach the church. That’s a key reason USA TODAY noted this ""may become a defining event of Trump's presidency."" To clear a path to St. John’s, police had forcibly removed White House demonstrators the New York Times described as a ""generally peaceful crowd."" The nature of that removal remains a topic of debate: Park Police told USA TODAY they did not use tear gas (as many media outlets reported) but did use pepper balls, a chemical irritant. The White House and Park Police said rubber bullets were not used. A viral Facebook post claimed ""It wasn't a big deal when Bill Clinton held up the Bible in front of the same exact church (as Donald Trump)."" The image of Clinton in the post is not from the same church.  And attempting to draw a parallel between the two incidents is a big stretch. Clinton was holding his Bible as he left a service he attended. Trump was manufacturing a photo op that had no other religious content and occurred without the church’s involvement, which was preceded by police forcibly removing protesters to clear a path. We rate this claim False.

National Guard soldiers weren’t forced to sleep on D.C. streets because of mayor
","Were National Guard members forced to sleep on the streets of Washington, D.C., after the mayor kicked them out of their hotels, as some social media posts claim? No. But a Facebook post takes a picture of National Guard members lying on the ground out of context and suggests it is evidence that D.C.’s mayor did just that. The post’s full caption reads: ""These are our soldiers that (sic) DC mayor kicked out of local hotels. We all should be raging mad at this sight."" This miscaptioned post stems from two real events — a photo taken in Minneapolis and an unrelated flap involving the D.C. mayor and the National Guard — but in both cases, the real story is less dramatic than this social media post suggests. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First, the photo was taken in Minneapolis, not D.C. When a reverse-image search surfaced hundreds of posts that shared the same image, some claiming it was taken in D.C., while others saying it was from Minnesota, we reached out to the Minnesota National Guard. A spokesperson there confirmed that the photo shows some of its members taking a rest during a longer shift in Minneapolis. It was taken in front of a bank on May 30 and had nothing to do with the troops’ lodging arrangements. ""While other members of the unit provided security, these soldiers grabbed a quick nap in front U.S. Bank E 2800 Lake St. in Minneapolis,"" Maj. Scott Hawkins, spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard, wrote in an email. ""As more soldiers came on state activate duty orders, replacements became available to relieve them and regular 12 hour shifts were instituted. The Minnesota National Guard had plentiful sleeping arrangements within our staging areas with cots and food supplies. We were not dependent on hotel lodging."" Here’s what happened in D.C., meanwhile. Thousands of National Guard troops from multiple states were sent to D.C. in response to the protests. On June 5, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Ut., tweeted that Muriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of D.C., evicted Utah National Guard members from hotels. ""These brave men and women have risked their lives protecting DC for three days,"" Lee wrote in a subsequent tweet. ""Rioting, looting, arson, and vandalism have all disappeared bc (sic) these soldiers served. And now they are being kicked to the curb by an ungrateful mayor. This must be stopped."" These brave men and women have risked their lives protecting DC for three days. Rioting, looting, arson, and vandalism have all disappeared bc these soldiers served. And now they are being kicked to the curb by an ungrateful mayor. This must be stopped. 2/2 pic.twitter.com/YYyctKvUqN Bowser responded on Twitter, acknowledging that Utah National Guard troops were in D.C. hotels but that  ""D.C. residents cannot pay"" the troops’ hotel bills. Senator — until they are recalled home — which I have formally requested from the President, your troops are in DC hotels. However, DC residents cannot pay their hotel bills. The Army can clear that up with the hotel today, and we are willing to help. https://t.co/WZypXMubxl Reporters at WUSA9 looked into the Twitter spat and reported that Bowser was referring to  a contract the District had with the Marriott Marquis hotel. The District had agreed to cover the accommodation costs of D.C. National Guard members who were activated for COVID-19 response.  At a June 5 news conference, Bowser said the District did not intend, nor would be able to, evict any guardsman from any hotel. She wanted it to be clear that billing arrangements for any out-of-state troops would have to be covered by the military or by their home states.  ""We have an agreement with one of our hotels for our COVID response, for which the District has paid and the District has a contractual arrangement,"" Bowser said. ""So our message to the hotel was that if they are going to use the rooms that we reserved, then they have to pay for them and you have to refund us our money. That, we understood, would just be a matter of the Guard or the Army making those arrangements. So those out of state troops would be covered either by the Army or their home states, not by D.C. residents.""  We reached out to Bowser’s office for comment but did not hear back by time of publication. The Utah National Guard released a statement on June 5 about the situation and said they were informed their 200 service members would be relocated from their hotel rooms and that the D.C. National Guard was working to resolve the matter. Hours later, an updated statement said that a different hotel had been identified, and that the soldiers would be relocated. A photo of National Guard soldiers sleeping outside is being shared online. The caption says it was taken in Washington, D.C., after the mayor ""kicked them out of local hotels."" The photo is from Minneapolis, not D.C. The Minnesota National Guard said the soldiers were on a longer shift and grabbed a quick nap but did have formal sleeping arrangements elsewhere. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser did request that the Army cover the costs of accommodations for out-of-state troops who were in the District in response to recent protests. She said certain rooms that the District paid for were reserved for COVID-19 responders. There is some truth to the hotel dispute in D.C. concerning out of state National Guard members, but the photo is miscaptioned and there is no evidence that the mayor forced soldiers to sleep on the street.

And a recent Facebook post alleging a new political connection by marriage is also wrong.  ""How many of you are aware that the female governor of Michigan is the niece of George Soros?"" the June 1 post says.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

""This is completely false,"" said Chelsea Lewis, the governor’s deputy press secretary.   Soros’ brother, Paul Soros, died in 2013. According to his obituary in the New York Times, he was survived by two sons: Peter and Jeffrey. He had two other children but they both died at 18 months old. A third son, Steven, was in a playground accident and a daughter, Linda, was hit by a vehicle backing out of the family’s garage. So George Soros has no surviving nieces. And his nephews didn’t marry Whitmer (whose husband is Marc Mallory, a dentist in Lansing, Mich.).  Peter Soros married Flora Fraser in 1997. Jeffrey Soros was married to Catharine Cosover in 1995.  If this disinformation connecting Whitmer to Soros seems arbitrary, keep in mind two things: A lot of anger was directed at Whitmer as she locked down Michigan to curb COVID-19, and baseless claims tying George Soros to the coronavirus have proliferated online.

Post inflates number of police killed in connection to protests
","An Oakland, Calif., security officer was fatally shot while working security at a federal courthouse while protests passed a few blocks away. Three days later, a retired officer in St. Louis was fatally shot while responding to a break-in at his friend’s pawn shop amid protests.  The FBI is still investigating whether 53-year-old Dave Patrick Underwood’s May 29 death in Oakland was in any way connected to the nearby protests over police brutality. In St. Louis, meanwhile, police have arrested a man they say shot 77-year-old retired officer David Dorn on June 2 when looting and violence followed peaceful protests. While these two incidents have generated news coverage in the wake of George Floyd’s May 25 death in police custody, we find no evidence of a June 3 claim shared by the thousands on Facebook: ""More than 20 police officers are dead now because of the riots. Where is their justice?"" The Officer Down Memorial Page, a nonprofit dedicated to honoring local active duty law enforcement officers, lists nine law enforcement officers who have died nationwide since protests began. According to the website and news reports, none were related to the Floyd protests.  One officer was shot and killed while delivering an eviction notice. Two were killed while responding to separate domestic disturbance incidents. Two died after contracting COVID-19. One was accidentally shot by another law enforcement officer while responding to a suspicious person call. One was shot and killed while responding to a call for service at a hotel. One died following a vehicle collision. One died while responding to a call about a suspicious vehicle. We did find news reports indicating that several active law enforcement officers have sustained injuries in the course of the hundreds of protests staged in communities across the country since Floyd died.

Immunity gained from COVID-19 infection ignores the risks of getting the disease
","A headline circulating online contends that a study done in Israel shows that people who have recovered from COVID-19 have more protection from the virus than those who’ve only been vaccinated.  The headline is from an article on the conservative website Gateway Pundit, which calls the vaccine ""experimental"" and refers to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading epidemiologist, as ""fuhrer."" The headline states: ""New Israeli Study Finds Fully Vaccinated People are at ""Greater Risk of Hospitalization"" and 13 TIMES MORE LIKELY to Catch Covid-19 Than Those Who Have Recovered and Have Natural Immunity."" The headline was shared in an Instagram post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline accurately reflects some of the study’s findings but ignores the study’s limitations, including that only one vaccine was tested, and that other studies have found that COVID-19 poses much greater danger to people who have not been vaccinated. Without that context, the headline leaves the impression that it’s safer to get COVID-19 and hope to recover than to try to avoid it by getting vaccinated. That’s not true. The study is what is known as a preprint, meaning it has not yet been vetted by experts. It was posted Aug. 25 on medRxiv.com, which added this note: ""This article is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed. It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice."" The study was led by researchers at the Maccabi Research & Innovation Center at Maccabi Healthcare Services in Tel Aviv. They reviewed the records of patients in the Maccabi health system — 674,000 patients who were fully vaccinated and 105,000 who had been infected. Among the 105,000 who had been infected, 63,000 were unvaccinated and 42,000 had received one Pfizer dose three months after recovery. The researchers said the study is ""the largest real-world observational study comparing natural immunity"" gained from infection by the coronavirus, with immunity provided by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They looked at patient records from June through August 2021, when the delta variant was dominant in Israel. They found: People who received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine in January or February 2021 were 13 times more likely to get a breakthrough infection with the delta variant than unvaccinated people who had COVID-19 during the same period were to be reinfected.  Over a longer period of time — with infection occurring anytime from March 2020 to February 2021, when different variants were dominant in Israel — fully vaccinated people in the study were six times more likely to become infected and seven times more likely to experience ""symptomatic disease"" than unvaccinated people in the study. The study ""demonstrated that natural immunity affords longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization due to the delta variant,"" compared with the Pfizer two-dose vaccine-induced immunity, although previously infected people gained additional protection with a single dose of the vaccine. The study has been well received by some experts as an indicator of the strength of natural immunity. But it has limitations, including the fact that it was done through record reviews, which are limited by biases in health care seeking behavior — such as testing, mask wearing and social distancing — that may differ among the groups compared, said Dr. Matthew Laurens of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland. ""This type of study design is not as robust as a prospective study that follows individuals forward in time, testing them at regular intervals and collecting data on symptoms systematically,"" he said. ""Prospective studies should be done to determine if these findings can be replicated. Gauging immunity by comparing COVID-19 reinfection rates among the unvaccinated with breakthrough infections among the vaccinated ignores the dangers of contracting COVID-19 in the first place and the protections against severe illness that vaccines provide. As we’ve reported: As of late July, vaccinated people represented a higher percentage of new COVID-19 cases in Israel than those who are unvaccinated. (This is not unexpected, because Israel has a high overall vaccination rate.) But among Israelis who were fully vaccinated and experienced breakthrough infections, the COVID-19 vaccine was 88% effective in preventing the need for hospitalization and 91% effective against severe illness. Israel’s early vaccine campaign, which resulted in more than 60% of its population being fully vaccinated, led to huge reductions in serious cases and deaths in the country. In August, we rated False a claim that it’s safer to be unvaccinated than vaccinated. Studies of the general adult population in the United States show that the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines have an 86% to 89% effectiveness rate against infection, and a 96% effectiveness rate against hospitalization, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Early evidence for the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine also demonstrates effectiveness against COVID-19, but more studies are underway, CDC said. ""The suggestion that you might be better off getting infected versus vaccinated does not take into account the inherent risks associated with COVID-19 infection, including death,"" Laurens said. ""Vaccination is the best prevention. This has been clearly shown in multiple prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trials, which are the very highest quality for clinical studies."" Experts told the journal Science that seeking immunity through deliberate infection would put unvaccinated people at significant risk of severe disease and death, or the lingering, significant symptoms of what has been dubbed Long COVID. The Maccabi study shows the benefits of natural immunity, said University of Washington immunologist Marion Pepper, but ""doesn’t take into account what this virus does to the body to get to that point.""   A headline widely shared on social media stated: ""New Israeli study finds fully vaccinated people are at ‘greater risk of hospitalization’ and 13 times more likely to catch COVID-19 than those who have recovered and have natural immunity."" The study, which has not been peer reviewed, found that people who had been infected with COVID-19 had greater protection against becoming reinfected with the virus’ delta variant than vaccinated people had against infection. But the headline’s suggestion that people are better off going unvaccinated ignores the fact that peer-reviewed studies repeatedly have found that vaccinated people are more likely to avoid hospitalization or death if they become infected. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.","[('Instagram, post, Aug. 29, 2021\xa0', 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CTKhviQAT4i/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=14080550-0a42-43b7-b98f-b2aea7ed6056'), ('Gateway Pundit, ""New Israeli Study Finds Fully Vaccinated People are at ""Greater Risk of Hospitalization"" and 13 TIMES MORE LIKELY to Catch Covid-19 Than Those Who Have Recovered and Have Natural Immunity,""\xa0', 'No link'), ('MedRxiv, ""Comparing SARS-CoV-2 natural immunity to vaccine-induced immunity: reinfections versus breakthrough infections,"" Aug. 25, 2021', 'https://archive.is/Il68Q'), ('Email, Dr. Matthew Laurens of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Aug. 31, 2021', 'No link'), ('Science, ""Having SARS-CoV-2 once confers much greater immunity than a vaccine—but vaccination remains vital,"" Aug. 26, 2021', 'https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1.full-text'), ('MedPage Today, ""Past Infection May Better Protect Against Delta Than Vaccine, but ‘putting yourself at risk of dying to have natural immunity is not a great tradeoff,’ says expert,"" Aug. 28, 2021', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Reinfection rates do not tell the whole story about protection against COVID-19,"" Aug. 2, 2021', 'https://www.science.org/content/article/having-sars-cov-2-once-confers-much-greater-immunity-vaccine-vaccination-remains-vital'), ('PolitiFact, ""Here’s why experts say people who had COVID-19 should be vaccinated,"" July 27, 2021', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Safer to be unvaccinated against COVID-19?

The mission is named Pineapple Express because Afghans would display images of a pineapple as a rescue signal, the Military Times reported. The post’s references to a ""rogue team"" working ""behind Biden’s back,"" suggest that the group did something in defiance of the U.S. military or without the knowledge of the federal government.

Claim overstates military weapons, equipment US left to Taliban in Afghanistan
","When the United States ended its 20-year war in Afghanistan, how much in usable military weapons and equipment did it leave behind? We rated False a claim that the Biden administration ""gifted the Taliban with $80 billion-plus"" in military-grade weapons. Only a fraction of that amount was spent over the 20 years for hardware; there has been no accounting of how much of it was left and is usable; and one expert told us the aircraft and other military equipment are likely worth less than $10 billion. Now comes a claim that is more detailed, but is also overstated. A viral image claims that the U.S. left what amounts to the ""Taliban’s new arsenal."" The image lists 19 categories of items ranging from 358,530 assault rifles to 22,174 Humvees to 33 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. But not only has there still been no accounting, but the figures cited are inflated because they are dated. ""The short answer is that all of the numbers are wrong,"" said Jonathan Schroden, a military operations analyst at CNA, a safety and security think tank. Many posts with the viral image — from Ben Shapiro and others — were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image was also shared by the official Twitter of the House Republicans. The image says the figures come from the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which experts say is a gold standard for such counts.  But the figures in the viral image are dated. They are not a count of items now in Afghanistan that were left behind and are usable. Overall, most of the weaponry and equipment were provided over many years to the Afghan forces that opposed the Taliban, while some remained in control of the U.S. military. Here’s a sampling from the 19 figures included in the viral image: ""358,530 assault rifles"": That figure appears to be from a 2017 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office that counted the number of rifles, including AK-47s and sniper rifles, provided over some 12 years, from 2004 to 2016. ""64,363 machine guns"": That figure also appears in the GAO report. It counted the number of machine guns provided from 2005 to 2016. ""22,174 Humvees"": The figure appears in the GAO report. It counted the number of Humvees provided from 2003 to 2016. ""33 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters"": As of June 30, 2021, there were 33 usable Black Hawks in Afghanistan, according to the special inspector’s latest report.  ""10 Cessna AC-208 strike aircraft"": As of June 30, 2021, there were 10 usable AC-208 planes in Afghanistan, according to the special inspector report.  None of the figures take into account how many items remained in Afghanistan and were usable when the Taliban took control in mid-August. Figures for the Black Hawks and AC-208s also don’t take into account how many aircraft were flown out of Afghanistan by pilots during the withdrawal, said Schroden. Experts including GlobalSecurity.org director John Pike and Jason Campbell, former country director for Afghanistan in the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense for Policy said it’s important to note that even if some of the materiel was left in usable condition, it might have little value, given the Taliban’s limited ability to use and maintain highly technical assets such as Black Hawks.  Pike said he did not think much of what was left in Afghanistan is useful to the Taliban, but Campbell said what was left is ""a significant haul.""  In the weeks prior to the Taliban’s takeover, in what is known as a retrograde operation, some of the materiel was returned to the U.S. or sent to other locations for use by the U.S. military.  The two most expensive retrograded items were 14 air defense artillery pieces valued at more than $144 million and five ""Enhanced Sentinel FMTVs (Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles)"" valued at more than $16 million, according to the special inspector’s report. A viral image claims that the U.S. left the Taliban an ""arsenal"" in Afghanistan, including 358,530 assault rifles and 22,174 Humvees.   An unknown amount of usable military weaponry and equipment was left behind following the U.S. departure from Afghanistan, but no accounting has been made. Figures cited in the image are dated, including some that count weapons or equipment that was brought to Afghanistan over more than a decade.

Fact-checking Casten’s overheated claim about extreme Chicago summers
","A group of House Democrats and environmental group leaders held a news conference touting President Joe Biden’s infrastructure spending priorities, which include efforts to curb climate change. Among them was U.S. Rep. Sean Casten, a former clean-energy entrepreneur who represents Illinois’ west suburban 6th Congressional District. To make his point, the second-term congressman gave a local example to emphasize the cost of a rapidly warming world. ""Chicago had a heat wave in 1995 that killed 739 people,"" Casten said Aug. 23. ""Prior to 9/11 that was the largest single-day, non-war fatality in the United States. We are now expecting temperatures that hot in Chicago every summer."" The #IPCCReport makes it clear this is our last chance to take the #ClimateAction science demands.I joined @USRepKCastor, @RepDebDingell, & @RepHorsford for a press conference hosted by @LCVoters, @actonclimateUS & @BGAlliance because have to act. Now. pic.twitter.com/Ep7QDHJkv9 The heat wave that struck Chicago that July more than 25 years ago was labeled the deadliest weather event in the city’s history. But it did not take those lives in a single day, making it impossible to compare the tragedy to more sudden disasters. Casten is on firmer ground when it comes to predictions about forecasts for more frequent extreme heat in Chicago, though he left out some important context there, too. The lethal heat wave that July lasted three days and killed 739, according to one estimate from researchers, who also found elderly and Black Chicagoans were disproportionately affected. While the event is considered among the nation’s deadliest climate disasters, it was not the deadliest domestic tragedy prior to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, nor the most fatal event in Chicago history. In 1915, for instance, a passenger boat called the SS Eastland capsized while tied to a dock in the Chicago River, killing 844. Casten specified ""single-day"" fatalities, so we wondered why he chose to compare an estimated death toll for a heat wave that spanned multiple days to the number of fatalities from more sudden disasters like the SS Eastland sinking. In response to our question, Casten spokesperson Emilia Rowland acknowledged the mistake. ""I believe my boss misspoke,"" she wrote in an email. As backup for the second part of Casten’s claim, Rowland sent us a 2010 research brief from the University of Illinois that explored what the Midwest’s climate may look like by mid-century. During the deadly 1995 Chicago heat wave, the two-page publication notes, ""temperatures soared as high as 106 degrees during the day and stayed above 80 degrees on many of the hottest nights. Such heat waves will be more commonplace in 2050. Under lower emissions scenarios, they could occur once per decade. Under higher emissions scenarios, they could happen once a year."" Those predictions were based on previous work from the climate scientists who authored the brief, Donald Wuebbles of the University of Illinois and Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University. The future looks even more grim by the end of the century, when their research predicts Chicago could see 1995-like heat waves every other year even if emissions are lowered and up to three times per year if emissions are not significantly reduced soon. More recent reports have also forecast unprecedented temperature increases in northern Illinois by the end of the century in line with those earlier findings, Wuebbles told us. But the research doesn’t fully back up Casten’s claim that Chicago is ""now expecting"" temperatures as hot as the 1995 heat wave every summer. ""We are expecting temperatures as hot as the 1995 heat wave in Chicago to recur more frequently as a result of climate change: that is absolutely true,"" Hayhoe said. ""The question is, ‘how often?’ — and that depends both on the time frame we’re talking about, and even more critically on our emission choices."" Casten said the 1995 Chicago heat wave that killed 739 people was ""the largest single-day, non-war fatality in the United States"" prior to 9/11 and ""we are now expecting temperatures that hot in Chicago every summer."" That heat wave spanned multiple days, making it impossible to compare the event to more sudden tragedies, many of which also killed more people. Casten’s office told us the congressman was mistaken in this comparison. Casten is correct that Chicago faces a future of increasingly frequent extreme heat. If significant actions are not taken to reduce emissions, the city could face 1995-like heat waves every year. But Chicago might still avoid this fate with lower emissions, researchers said, and even in the worst case such extreme heat events would not become so frequent until at least 2050.

Did Youngkin call COVID relief unnecessary?
","In a recent TV ad, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe says Glenn Youngkin, his Republican opponent, is out of touch with working families. The ad says Youngkin ""called COVID relief ‘unnecessary,’"" a charge the two candidates have been tussling over since June. We fact-checked the claim and found McAuliffe has taken liberty with Youngkin’s position on the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that sent $1,400 checks to many people and aid to state and local governments. McAuliffe’s ad pins its claim to comments Youngkin made during a May 12 interview with the Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning online publication. President Joe Biden had signed the relief bill two months earlier. Youngkin said there was ""unnecessary stimulus"" in the economy that is causing inflation. He blamed ""monetary"" policies and portions of the COVID relief bill that sent money to states and pension plans, many of which he said were poorly managed. Here’s more of Youngkin’s quote: ""We in fact have unnecessary stimulus being pounded through our economy, both from a monetary standpoint coupled with the fact that we have a lot of fiscal stimulus right now."" Youngkin described the relief plan as ""a stimulus bill that in fact was cloaked in being a COVID stimulus bill with virtually no COVID health in it…"".    ""I mean, we had a stimulus bill that in fact was cloaked in being a COVID stimulus bill with virtually no COVID health in it and a lot of handouts and spending to states that were poorly run…"". PolitiFact National has rated Half True a claim that only 9% of the relief act is ""actually going to COVID."" It said while it’s accurate to say less than 9% of the plan funds activities directly meant to combat the virus itself, the definition of COVID-related is squishy and it’s fair to say that some of the relief to individuals and school systems were related to the pandemic.  Youngkin says the ad claim is misleading because, while he opposed broad swaths of the law that sent money to governments, and pensions, he backed the portions that aided individuals.  Youngkin said in March, ""There’s some elements in (the law) that really are extremely helpful.""  He has praised the act’s checks to people, its grants to small businesses and — at least since June — its expansion of child tax credits.  Those items account for roughly one-third of the law’s $1.9 billion cost. Youngkin’s position seems closely aligned with congressional Republicans who voted 259-0 against the bill, describing it as mostly wasteful. Youngkin has not said whether he would have voted for the bill; his campaign said it is irrelevant to this fact-check. He tweeted on Aug. 8, ""I did not oppose the American Rescue plan,"" and made a similar statement on May 19.   Our ruling McAuliffe’s ad says Youngkin ""called COVID relief ‘unnecessary.’""  Youngkin actually said that the economy is bulging with ""unnecessary stimulus."" McAuliffe has a leg to stand on because Youngkin partially blamed the problem on portions of the American Rescue Plan that sent aid to states, localities and pension plans. But McAuliffe skips important information. Youngkin also said, before the ad aired, that he supports popular aspects of the law that gave $1,400 checks to many people, increased tax deductions for children and sent aid to small businesses. McAuliffe takes liberty with Youngkin’s statement and his position on COVID relief. We rate his ad statement Mostly False.  ","[('Terry McAuliffe, TV ad, Aug. 23, 2021', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vL1XSkZSWw'), ('Glenn Youngkin, Daily Caller interview, May 1, 2021 (6:45 mark)', 'No link'), ('Youngkin, WCVH radio interview, March 16, 2021 (9:27 mark)', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4t0bhMMARo&t=396s'), ('Youngkin, WNIS interview, May 19, 2021', 'No link'), ('Youngkin, Twitter, Aug. 2 and Aug. 8, 2021', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAJ1iuuoPxA&t=567s'), ('Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, ""What\'s in the $1.9 Trillion House COVID Relief Bill?""

Person hanging from helicopter in Afghanistan appears to be wearing a harness
","Conservative blog sites, pundits and politicians such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, claimed that the Taliban hanged someone from a helicopter flying over Afghanistan. The viral rumor was based on a short, blurry video that shows a helicopter flying over the country with a person dangling from a rope beneath it. It’s not clear who filmed the footage and when, but the clip appears to be real. However, that doesn't mean it shows an execution by hanging. Various other images and videos reviewed by PolitiFact show that the person dangling from the chopper was alive, moving and waving his arms. The person was suspended by a harness that wrapped under his arms, not a noose around the neck.  A viral tweet claimed without evidence that video showed the Taliban hanging someone from a helicopter. Pentagon spokesperson Eric Pahon said the Defense Department would not comment on the video, given that it came from social media and was presented ""without context, background, a time frame for when the video was shot, or even a clear visual of what is occurring."" Reporters for the BBC, Snopes, the Washington Post, Vice and other outlets reached the same conclusion about the harness, determining that the video did not depict an execution. For its report, the BBC cited unnamed Afghanistan experts with sources in the country. The BBC reported that the flight took place Aug. 30, and that it was an attempt to fix a flag over a public building. The aircraft was likely seized from the Afghanistan Air Force, the BBC said. Other news organizations around the world relayed the same information. An Afghan news agency similarly told Alt News, an outlet from India, that the person was trying to fix a flag on a building — specifically, the governor’s office in Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second largest city. Bilal Sarwary, a freelance Afghan journalist, tweeted that the pilot flying the helicopter was a person he knew, who was trained in the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates. Sarwary also said the person in the harness was a Taliban fighter trying to install a flag. Still, a flurry of social media posts claiming the video showed a public hanging spread widely anyway, racking up hundreds of thousands of total interactions across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. A few viral tweets claimed, again without evidence, that the person hanging was an American interpreter. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Snopes and Vice reported that the 12-second clip was first shared in an Aug. 30 tweet from a page called the Taliban Times, which was later suspended by Twitter. The Taliban Times tweet did not claim that the video was of an execution.  That claim appeared to take off after a version of the same clip was shared by another account, according to Hoaxy, a social media analysis tool that maps the spread of information on Twitter. The account, which says in its Twitter bio that it belongs to a comedian, wrote in a caption, ""Taliban hanging someone from a helicopter in Kandahar.""  That account’s tweet was boosted by several prominent Republican politicians, including Cruz and U.S. Reps. Lauren Boebert and Dan Crenshaw. ""This horrifying image encapsulates Joe Biden's Afghanistan catastrophe: The Taliban hanging a man from an American Blackhawk helicopter,"" Cruz said in his tweet, which helped the video amass over 2.5 million views in less than 24 hours. ""Tragic. Unimaginable."" Elsewhere, blog sites such as RedState and the Western Journal ran headlines that repeated the same claims.  We rate these claims False.","[('Various tweets, Aug. 30, 2021, and Aug. 31, 2021', 'https://www.altnews.in/does-the-video-show-taliban-hanging-a-body-from-a-helicopter/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=social-media&utm_campaign=newpost'), ('Various Facebook posts, Aug. 30, 2021, and Aug. 31, 2021', 'No link'), ('Various Instagram posts, Aug. 30, 2021, and Aug. 31, 2021', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/taliban-hanging-black-hawk/'), ('Various searches on CrowdTangle, Aug. 31, 2021', 'No link'), ('Various searches on Hoaxy, Aug. 31, 2021', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-58279900?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=612e4b133fa7c437236bb678%26Viral%20video%20does%20not%20show%20man%20hanged%20from%20helicopter%262021-08-31T16:46:47.367Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:93b354b1-edd2-4a9c-8053-cbf244df3bdf&pinned_post_asset_id=612e4b133fa7c437236bb678&pinned_post_type=share'), ('Alt News, ""Does the video show Taliban ‘hanging’ a body from a helicopter?""

COVID-19 vaccine testing included people with underlying health conditions
","A common critique of the COVID-19 vaccines is that they were developed and distributed with unprecedented speed, without being tested extensively enough. ""The COVID-19 investigational vaccines were released to the public after only two months of testing in healthy humans,"" claims a man appearing in a Facebook video labeled, ""Why I am not getting THE SHOTS."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The broader arguments of the video are that pharmaceuticals such as vaccines cannot be trusted without studies of their long-term effects, and that the risks of COVID-19 are better known than the potential risks of vaccines.  For this fact-check, we looked at the claim that the vaccines were tested on ""healthy people,"" which suggests that the results of the clinical trials were skewed to exclude those who had health problems that predisposed them to contracting COVID-19 or having bad side effects from the vaccine.  The United States allowed three different COVID-19 vaccines — Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, both in December 2020, and Johnson & Johnson, in February 2021. All three were authorized for emergency use based on data submitted around two to three months into their clinical trials. But the claim about testing in ""healthy humans"" is misleading. All three drug makers’ trials included people with underlying health conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19.   Moderna’s study involved 30,420 volunteers ages 18 and over in the United States. Nearly 17% were people under 65 who had medical conditions that predisposed them to severe COVID-19.  Pfizer’s study included 43,548 people ages 16 and up in the United States and five other countries. Overall, 70% were obese or overweight (as measured by body mass index), and 21% had at least one coexisting condition such as diabetes or chronic pulmonary disease. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine was tested on 43,783 adults in the United States and several other countries. Among them, 41% had health conditions that increased their risks for severe COVID-19, including obesity, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes or HIV. People who participated in clinical trials of the vaccines continue to be monitored, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors the administration of vaccines to the general public for possible side effects that are severe or unexpected. Public health officials, scientists and doctors say the vaccines are safe and protective during pregnancy, based on trials, studies and the available safety data. The CDC on Aug. 11 recommended vaccination for those who are pregnant or looking to get pregnant, as the safety evidence becomes more conclusive and new infections from the delta variant continue to mount. The statement contains only an element of truth.

Mitt Romney accurately says Trump administration worked to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners
","Sen. Mitt Romney blamed both the Trump and Biden administrations for the chaotic events that swept Afghanistan after the Taliban took over the country. A terrorist attack at the Kabul international airport killed more than 100 people, including 13 U.S. service members, as the U.S. military worked to evacuate Americans and Afghans. Romney, R-Utah, made his comments during an Aug. 29 interview with CNN host Jake Tapper. ""Recognize that we're in the position we're in right now because of terrible decisions made by two administrations: One, the Trump administration negotiating directly with the Taliban, getting ready to invite them to Camp David, opening up a prison of 5,000 Taliban and probably ISIS-K individuals and letting them free,"" Romney said on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" Romney said that it was not known whether some of the prisoners released were involved in the airport attack, but that Trump administration decisions ""led to what you're seeing and the danger that exists at the airport."" The Biden administration’s closing of the Bagram Air Base also played a role, he said. All U.S. military forces left Afghanistan by Aug. 31, effectively ending the U.S. war. PolitiFact wondered about Romney’s claim regarding the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners. Romney’s claim is correct. A February 2020 agreement between the Taliban and the Trump administration called for the release of 5,000 Taliban members who were in Afghan prisons. Afghanistan’s government has said that the 5,000 Taliban prisoners were released. A Congressional Research Service report said the release was completed in September 2020. Romney’s press office did not respond to our queries. A Feb. 29, 2020, agreement between the United States and the Taliban said that the U.S. and its allies would withdraw their military forces within 14 months of the agreement’s announcement. The deal said that the Taliban would not allow groups, including al-Qaida, in Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies. It also called for negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government, starting March 10, 2020. The agreement said the U.S. would work with all relevant sides on a plan to release ""combat and political prisoners."" According to the agreement, up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners and up to 1,000 prisoners ""of the other side"" would be released by a specified timeline. ""The United States commits to completing this goal,"" the deal said, adding that the Taliban also committed to keeping its released prisoners from posing a threat to the security of the United States and its allies. Mike Pompeo, Trump’s secretary of state, said on Feb. 29, 2020, that the agreement ""entails a promise from the Taliban that terrorists can never again operate from Afghan soil."" By August 2020, news reports said that the Afghan government, which was not a signatory in the Taliban-U.S. deal, had released 4,600 Taliban prisoners after pressure from the Trump administration. Afghan officials considered the release of 400 other prisoners problematic because they had committed major crimes, Voice of America reported. ""We acknowledge that the release of these prisoners is unpopular,"" Pompeo said Aug. 6. ""But this difficult action will lead to an important result long sought by Afghans and Afghanistan’s friends: reduction of violence and direct talks resulting in a peace agreement and an end to the war."" Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, ultimately signed a decree to release the remaining 400 prisoners. On Aug. 14, 2020, Ghani said that the release of the final 400 prisoners, who were ""convicted of serious crimes, including the killing of Afghans and citizens of the international community,"" was a difficult issue that required consulting with leaders from all provinces of Afghanistan. ""They decided to approve the release of the prisoners, and the next day I signed the order,"" Ghani said. ""It was the Afghan people’s latest, and boldest, risk for peace."" In September 2020, U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad said that the prisoners held by the Afghan government included some who had committed violence against international forces in Afghanistan. ""I know that none of us are happy about the release of prisoners that committed violence against our forces, but we want to keep the big picture in mind, unhappy as we are,"" Khalilzad said. Romney said that the Trump administration decided to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners. This is accurate. Part of a 2020 agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban called for the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners who were held by the Afghan government. News reports and statements from Afghanistan’s president indicate that the release happened, under pressure from the Trump administration.

Joe Rogan falsely says mRNA vaccines are ‘gene therapy’
","Joe Rogan, who hosts one of the most popular podcasts on Spotify, wrongly claimed that the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are ""really gene therapy,"" conflating the vaccines’ pioneering mRNA technology with the experimental technique that involves modifying genes to treat or cure disease. The inaccurate claim came about 51 minutes into the Aug. 20 episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" as Rogan discussed the vaccines with guest Meghan Murphy, a Canadian freelance writer and journalist. Here’s what Rogan said: ""It's not really a vaccine in the traditional sense. A vaccine is where they take a dead virus, and they turn it into a vaccine, and they inject it into your body so that your body fights off — it develops the antibodies, and your body understands what that is, whether it's the measles or polio, it knows how to fight it off.  ""This is really gene therapy. It's a different thing. It’s tricking your body into producing spike protein and making these antibodies for COVID. But it’s only good for a few months, they’re finding out now. The efficacy wanes after five or six months. I’m not saying that people shouldn’t take it. But I’m saying, you’re calling it a thing that it’s not. It’s not exactly what you’re saying it is, and you’re mandating people take it.""  There’s no national mandate requiring that all Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19, although many employers and university systems are requiring it. And Rogan based his claim about the COVID-19 vaccines partly on an outdated conception of what a vaccine is. But the bigger problem with the claim is that it mischaracterizes the technology used by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The technology does not amount to gene therapy, public health experts said. ""It's absolutely incorrect to say that vaccines are really gene therapy,"" said Cindy Prins, clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida. ""Vaccines don't make any changes to your own DNA, so they don't edit your own DNA like gene therapy does. They also don't replace any mutated genes in your body."" No genetic material enters the part of the cell that hosts DNA as a result of the mRNA vaccines. Rogan and Spotify did not offer on-the-record comments for this fact-check.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a vaccine as ""a product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease.""  ""Basically, a vaccine is a way to get your immune system to recognize something and create antibodies to it,"" said Richard Watanabe, professor of population and public health sciences at the University of Southern California. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines fit that definition, the CDC says. While they work differently than many other familiar vaccines — relying on messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology — they still trigger an immune response inside the body, offering vital protection. Older methods of vaccination included inoculating people with inactivated versions of viruses, and some vaccines for other diseases still work that way. But that method has proven at times to be risky, Watanabe said, citing the infamous ""Cutter Incident"" of 1955, in which some polio vaccines were not properly inactivated and tens of thousands of people were accidentally injected with the live virus. The mRNA technology in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines is newer, though research on it dates back to the 1990s. The vaccines work by instructing the cells to make versions of a harmless spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus, so the immune system can recognize the protein and mount an antibody response against the virus in the event of a future infection, the CDC says. The third COVID-19 vaccine available in the U.S., from Johnson & Johnson, delivers similar instructions using an adenovirus that’s been altered to make it harmless. ""It’s true that mRNA vaccines are a major departure from traditional vaccines,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""They contain just the genetic material of the gene of interest in the pathogen that codes for the protein needed for immunity. That’s what makes them so path-breaking."" While both mRNA vaccination and gene therapy involve genetic technology, they are different things, experts said.  Gene therapy involves modifying a person’s genes to cure or treat a disease, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA says it can work by replacing a disease-causing gene in the body with a healthy version, turning off the disease-causing gene, or introducing a new gene entirely. Only a few gene therapies have been fully approved, said Prins. ""Gene therapy is used to replace or fix genetic mutations that lead to diseases like cystic fibrosis, neuromuscular disease, inherited blindness and other genetic conditions,"" Prins said. ""Gene therapy is not used in vaccines at all, since vaccines don't replace or edit your own genes."" Gene therapy corrects a genetic defect by delivering the gene, or DNA, to the nucleus, the part of the cell where DNA is located, Adalja said.  The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are designed around the genetic structure of the virus. They carry mRNA, which teaches the immune system to identify the coronavirus, but they do not alter the recipients’ genetic makeup or DNA. The mRNA strands never enter the nucleus of the cell after vaccination. To cross into the nucleus, the mRNA chains from the shots would need a special enzyme, according to WebMD. And they would need another enzyme to be integrated into the DNA. They don’t have those enzymes. ""It’s really just a different approach to delivering what the immune system needs to see in order to create the antibodies,"" Watanabe said of the mRNA vaccines.  The mRNA strands also break down shortly after entering the body, unlike with gene therapy, Prins said.  ""It sticks around in the cell only long enough to be used as a recipe to make some spike protein that the immune system can then detect and respond to,"" Prins said. ""After a few days, your cells will break up that mRNA into small pieces. So the recipe gets torn up. The spike protein that was made will stay around a little longer, up to a few weeks, which helps you build that immune response. But it will also get broken down so it doesn't stay for long."" Moderna says on its website that while mRNA and gene therapy might sound similar, they ""take fundamentally different approaches."" The company wrote: ""Gene therapy and gene editing alter the original genetic information each cell carries. The goal is to produce a permanent fix to the underlying genetic problem by changing the defective gene ...  Unlike gene editing and gene therapy, mRNA technology does not change the genetic information of the cell, and is intended to be short-acting."" In the same podcast episode, Rogan claimed that ""it’s not supported by science"" for people who have previously been sick with COVID-19 to get the shots. But public health experts recommend that people who have had COVID-19 already get immunized anyway, because the science shows they provide better and broader protection than natural immunity. Rogan said the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are ""really gene therapy."" That’s wrong. The two interventions are not the same. Gene therapy involves modifying genes to cure or treat a disease. The COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna use mRNA technology to instruct the cells to recognize a spike protein on the coronavirus and mount a response against it, but they make no changes to the recipient’s genetic makeup or DNA. The mRNA strands never enter the part of the cell that hosts DNA, and they are broken down soon after they are introduced into the body. We rate Rogan’s claim False.

Yes, over $100 billion was spent on military contracts in Afghanistan
","The debate over how the United States left Afghanistan, and the chaos it created, will likely last for years. So will the debate over the war itself, and whether nearly 20 years of deployment was worth it. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes of Wisconsin, one of at least 10 Democrats hoping to win the seat held by Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, made his position clear in an Aug. 16, 2021 tweet: ""Thousands of American lives lost, plus over 100,000 Afghan civilians and military personnel. Over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts. And for what?""  The cost in human lives has been well documented. Here are the stark totals as reported that same day by The Associated Press: American service members killed in Afghanistan through April: 2,448. U.S. contractors: 3,846. Afghan national military and police: 66,000. Other allied service members, including from other NATO member states: 1,144. Afghan civilians: 47,245. Taliban and other opposition fighters: 51,191. Aid workers: 444. Journalists: 72. Those casualty totals tragically increased August 26, 2021, when a suicide bomber attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabul’s airport. The attacks killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops, Afghan and U.S. officials said. The death toll could rise as authorities examine the scene.  On August 30, 2021, the last plane carrying U.S. forces left Afghanistan after 20 years of war.  But we’re focused on the second part of Barnes’ tweet, and his claim about money spent on military contracts. Has more than $100 billion dollars been spent on military contracts?    Let’s take a look. When asked for back up for the statement, Barnes’ spokesman Christian Slater pointed us to a April 23, 2021 Bloomberg Law report which found that ""Since 2002, the Pentagon has spent $107.9 billion on contracted services in Afghanistan, a Bloomberg Government analysis shows."" Contractor support includes lodging, laundry, private security, mechanics, food, transportation, equipment maintenance, and fuel, according to the article.  Texas-based Fluor was the biggest defense contractor in Afghanistan. The Defense Department had spent $3.8 billion for Fluor’s work in Afghanistan since 2015, federal records show, mainly for logistics services, according to an Associated Press report. A Bloomberg report noted that in April 2021, 16,832 workers were employed by contractors in Afghanistan, with 6,147 of them being U.S. citizens.  That was more than double the remaining 2,500 U.S. troops at the time.  According to a July 21, 2021 US News & World Report article, the number of contractors in Afghanistan dropped over the previous three months from nearly 17,000 in April to 7,800 in July.  Here is Bloomberg’s list of top Department of Defense contractors for fiscal years 2016-2021.   Fluor Corp.: $3.1 billion Amentum Parent Holdings: $1.7 billion Columbia Helicopters: $970 million PAE: $930 million Raytheon Technologies: $830 million Secure Movement Logistics: $680 million   National Fuel: $480 million Boeing Co.: $400 million Bravura Information Tech.: $310 million FedEx Corp.: $310 million  Waste and fraud reported To be sure, all that money was not spent without controversy -- or even all spent appropriately. In an August 2021 report on Afghanistan Reconstruction, Special Inspector General John F. Sopko, noted that fraud and financial waste was rampant: ""Because contract work was often performed with little to no oversight, waste and fraud often went virtually unchecked. In 2012, GAO reported that a number of new, contractor- built facilities had to be repaired or completely rebuilt because oversight personnel were unable to adequately measure contractors’ performance, resulting in ‘wasted resources, low morale, and risks to safety of base and installation personnel where the deficient guard towers, fire stations, and gates were constructed.’ "" Congress created the inspector general’s office as an independent agency focused on the Afghanistan mission and its reconstruction issues. Of the approximately $145 billion the U.S. government spent trying to rebuild Afghanistan, about $83 billion went to developing and sustaining its army and police forces, according to the the office. The $145 billion is in addition to $837 billion the United States spent fighting the war, which began with an invasion in October 2001. Barnes said ""Over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts."" A Bloomberg Law report found that the Pentagon has spent $107.9 billion on contracted services in Afghanistan. Those contracted services include lodging, laundry, food, transportation, equipment maintenance and fuel.  For a statement that is accurate with nothing significant missing, our rating is True.  ","[('Twitter, Lt.

No, the FDA hasn’t approved cigarettes, or any tobacco product
","It didn’t take long after the Food and Drug Administration’s full approval of the PfizerCOVID-19 vaccine for skeptics to spread false claims about the agency’s track record. One post claimed that the FDA approved thalidomide, a dangerous, faulty drug once used to treat pregnancy morning sickness. That never happened, because an FDA medical officer raised concerns about the drug maker’s claims. Another post claimed that the Pfizer vaccine’s approval ""means nothing"" because the agency also approves pesticides in our food — which it does not do. Now, the experts on the internet have added cigarettes to the list of harmful things the FDA has purportedly approved (but, in reality, hasn’t).  ""Friendly reminder: Cigarettes are FDA approved,"" one Facebook post said.  ""Just so everyone is clear .. FDA also approved cigarettes $$$,"" said another. But the FDA has not approved any tobacco product, cigarettes included. The agency does not have the authority to approve the products, or to ban them.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The FDA is responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy and security of food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices and other products.  The agency regulates the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, but it doesn’t approve them the way it does with drugs and vaccines.  ""FDA doesn’t approve tobacco products,"" its website says. ""There’s no such thing as a safe tobacco product, so FDA’s safe and effective standard for evaluating medical products is not appropriate for tobacco products. Instead, FDA regulates tobacco products based on a public health standard that considers the product’s risks to the population as a whole."" To legally sell or distribute a new tobacco product in the U.S., manufacturers must receive a written marketing order from the FDA. The agency says it doesn’t have the authority to ban any class of tobacco products, including cigarettes, but does have the charge to reduce their harm.  Vaccine regulation is different. Pfizer’s vaccine was tested in multiple clinical trials that included tens of thousands of people before it was given full FDA approval on Aug. 24. The FDA granted emergency use authorization for the vaccine in December 2020 for people 16 and older. In May, the authorization was extended for people between 12 and 15.  The COVID-19 vaccines were already deemed safe and effective with the emergency use authorization. Full approval means that businesses and schools may have more leeway to require COVID-19 vaccination, and the Pfizer shot can stay on the market beyond the public health emergency. Pfizer submitted its 340,000-page application for full FDA approval in May 2021, and it was the fastest FDA approval of a vaccine ever. It required data from clinical and non-clinical trials, technical information, labeling information and more. In Pfizer’s case, the application built upon the extensive data submitted to support its application for emergency use authorization. Posts on Facebook suggest people shouldn’t trust the FDA’s approval of the Pfizer vaccine because it also approved cigarettes. That’s wrong. The agency regulates the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of tobacco products, including cigarettes, but it doesn’t approve them the way it does with drugs and vaccines.

The Bidens, Cabinet members were present at Dover Air Force Base to honor fallen soldiers
","On the night of Aug. 28, Buzz Patterson, a GOP candidate for Congress in California, tweeted that the White House failed to send a representative to the dignified transfer ceremony at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for the remains of 13 U.S. military service members who died in the Aug. 26 terror attack outside of Kabul, Afghanistan. A similar post was published by real estate entrepreneur and Republican political adviser Blair Brandt, who tweeted: ""BREAKING: The Biden White House had no representative, including the President, First Lady or Vice President, attend the return of 13 KIA service members back onto American soil at Dover Air Force Base."" Both tweets were based on a false premise: At the time they were posted, the plane carrying the remains hadn’t yet arrived at Dover, and the ceremony hadn’t happened yet. Both tweets were subsequently deleted.  But the false claim continued to circulate overnight, including on Instagram, where an Aug. 29 post shared a screenshot of Brandt’s tweet. According to a White House press pool report, the plane carrying the remains of the fallen service members arrived at Dover at 8 a.m. on Aug. 29. Biden and first lady Jill Biden arrived in Dover on Air Force One about 40 minutes later. CNN reported that they then met with the families of the service members at Dover’s Center for Families of the Fallen.  The Bidens were joined by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  The White House declined to comment on the claim in the tweets and Instagram post. A Pentagon duty officer pointed to a tweet from Biden, which showed a photo of the Bidens, Austin, Blinken and others standing with their hands over their hearts after 11 a.m., when the caskets of the troops were carried from the plane to the transfer vehicles. In keeping with protocol, the press was instructed not to look, film or photograph in the direction of the military family members.  The 13 service members that we lost were heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our highest American ideals and while saving the lives of others.

Delta’s ‘R naught’ contagiousness rate doesn’t mean entire US will get COVID-19
","A TikTok video with more than 535,000 likes claims that if the contagiousness of the COVID-19 delta variant is on the high end of what ""they"" estimate, avoiding infection will be virtually impossible, regardless of vaccination. ""They have found that the R naught of delta is anywhere between 5 and 9½. The R naught value of an infectious pathogen refers to its contagiousness,"" the user says in the three-minute video, which was posted July 31 and was still viral nearly a month later.  ""If the R naught is actually closer to 10, within six weeks the whole country will test positive for delta, regardless of vaccination or not. I mean, at that rate, it’s so contagious, all you have to do is just walk past someone with it. … If you’re in close quarters and you walk past someone that’s exhaling out air and you inhale their air — even you just barely brush by them, if you get in their space and they are delta-positive, you are going to get sick. And at this rate, I think that’s going to happen to you whether you are vaccinated or not."" The conclusion of the claim is incorrect because it doesn’t take into account measures such as vaccination and social distancing that reduce the chances of contracting COVID-19, said Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious-diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University. He added: ""The whole country testing positive within six weeks is patently false.""  According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the delta variant is more than twice as contagious as previous variants of the coronavirus and caused nearly 99% of recent coronavirus cases in the U.S. Unvaccinated people are particularly vulnerable: in Los Angeles County as of July 25, unvaccinated people were five times more likely to be infected and 29 times more likely to be hospitalized. The video alludes to one way health experts think about a virus’ infection rate: the basic reproduction number, or R0 (pronounced ""R naught""). It indicates the average number of times one infected person will transmit the virus to another person. The higher the R0, theoretically, the faster the virus is spreading. The CDC has estimated that delta’s R0 is in the range stated in the video. But even if the R0 were 10, ""that does not mean that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, will be infected,"" said Dr. Céline Gounder, a clinical assistant professor of medicine and infectious disease at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. R0 is a theoretical figure that assumes everyone in a population is without immunity and susceptible to infection.  ""It is important to realize that that is the number in a completely unmitigated, ‘natural’ environment — no one vaccinated, no one social distancing, no one wearing masks, and no one immune from prior infection,"" said Dr. Perry Wilson, a Yale School of Medicine associate professor. Wilson said the important indicator for predicting cases in the future is what researchers call the effective reproduction number, or Rt. It is the observed average number of people an infected person infects. Delta’s Rt likely between 1 and 2, he said. ""Due to vaccination, prior infection, and masking and distancing, we have mitigated the ability of delta to spread, so the Rt is quite a bit lower than the R0,"" Wilson said. In some places, because of steps such as vaccination and masking, the Rt, while changing daily, is below 1, said Dowdy, indicating that the spread of the virus has been curbed. The estimated Rt in the U.S. as of Aug. 28 is 1, according to a project led by researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. A TikTok video claims that the contagiousness of the coronavirus delta variant is ""valued between 5 and 9½,"" and if the value is closer to 10, ""within six weeks, the whole country will test positive for delta, regardless of vaccination.""  One measure rates delta’s contagiousness in the range of what the video states, but it is a theoretical measure that doesn’t take into account steps such as vaccination and social distancing that reduce the risk of getting COVID-19. Accounting for those steps, the reproduction number is far lower. There is no evidence to suggest that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, could become infected.

Video clips disprove claim about Biden’s meeting with Israeli prime minister
","In August 2020, back when President Joe Biden was still the Democratic presidential nominee, a clip circulated on social media that appeared to show him asleep and snoring during an interview.  Only that didn’t happen. The video was edited to make it seem like he was sleeping, though he wasn’t.  Six months later, another false claim emerged that Biden was caught sleeping at his desk in the Oval Office. But that photo was doctored.  Now, claims that Biden fell asleep during a recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett are spreading online.  ""Watch: Joe Biden caught *sleeping* during high-level talks with foreign head of government,"" the headline in one post said.  ""Biden fell asleep meeting with Israel’s prime minister,"" read another. ""How can we trust he isn’t asleep through everything else?"" Both posts show the same image of Biden and Bennett seated next to each other. Bennett appears to be talking to Biden, while the president’s eyes are cast downward at his folded hands.  But if you do actually watch the footage of that meeting, as one of the Facebook posts implores, it’s clear Biden is not sleeping.  These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Thalidomide, morning-sickness drug that caused disabilities, wasn’t FDA-approved for pregnant women
","CORRECTION, Aug. 31, 1 p.m.: This fact-check has been corrected to reflect that the FDA approved thalidomide in the late 1990s, under strict conditions, as a treatment for people with multiple myeloma and lesions from leprosy, and required an extensive warning that it not be used by pregnant women. We’ve clarified the ruling statement to capture the context of the claim more precisely. The rating is not changed. The original fact-check has been archived here. Since the Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for adults Aug. 23, many skeptics of the vaccine have gone on social media to challenge the agency’s safety record and credibility.  ""Thalidomide was also FDA approved,"" says one Facebook post, referring to a drug first used more than six decades ago to treat morning sickness. The post includes a black-and-white picture of four children at a pool who have missing or malformed limbs, leaving the impression that these children were harmed by an FDA-approved drug.   This Aug. 23 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Thalidomide was widely prescribed to pregnant mothers around the world before it was shown to cause thousands of cases of babies born with disabilities, such as missing and malformed limbs.  But the post gets a key fact wrong: The FDA didn’t approve thalidomide for pregnant women. In 1960, FDA medical officer Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey, reviewing an approval application for thalidomide from drug maker Richardson-Merrell, found problems with the company’s claims about its effectiveness. ""The claims were just not supported by the type of clinical studies that had been submitted in the application,"" Kelsey said in an autobiographical interview. A transcript of her interviews was provided by the FDA. Many of the doctors’ reports submitted with the application were ""more testimonials than scientific studies,"" Kelsey said. She also looked into reports that thalidomide’s side effects for adults included painful tingling in the hands and feet. Thousands of babies whose mothers took the drug while pregnant were born with severe defects to their limbs, internal organs, eyesight and hearing.  Richardson-Merrell withdrew the application in 1962. By then, the company and another drug maker, Smith, Kline & French, had already given about 20,000 Americans thalidomide as part of clinical trials — and at least 17 babies were born with disabilities from the drug.  The thalidomide case is often held up as a turning point in the FDA's evaluation of drugs and medical devices. FDA standards are today considered among the world's strictest, said Dr. Henry Miller, senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, former FDA medical reviewer and founding director of the agency’s Office of Biotechnology. It was the thalidomide case that led the Kennedy administration in 1962 to enact the Kefauver-Harris Amendments, which tightened regulations for drug reviews, including a requirement that evidence of a drug’s effectiveness be ""based on adequate and well-controlled clinical studies conducted by qualified experts."" A 1997 law simplified the process for drug reviews but the FDA still generally requires results from two well-controlled clinical studies for a drug approval. The approved Pfizer vaccine and the other vaccines authorized for emergency use were evaluated based on the FDA's evidence standards. Even with the stricter standards, the FDA has approved products that were later shown to cause harm, such as breast implants, which were linked to anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and Vioxx, an anti-inflammatory pain medicine that was pulled from the market in 2004 after a study showed it raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Thalidomide did get FDA approval in 1998, under tight restrictions, as a medicine to treat people newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma or leprosy flare ups. The FDA approval required the drug to carry new warning labels, including an extensive warning that it should not be used by women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, because of the risk of ""severe and life-threatening human birth defects (deformed babies) or death of an unborn baby."" A post implicitly questioning the FDA’s approval of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine showed a picture of disabled children and said, ""Thalidomide was also FDA approved."" The post gave the impression that the children in the image were harmed by an FDA-approved drug. The FDA reviewed an application for a thalidomide drug in the 1960s to treat morning sickness, but withheld approval amid concerns about the evidence of effectiveness and reports that it caused children of the mothers who took it to be born with disabilities. The application was withdrawn in 1962. The FDA approved thalidomide in 1998 for other conditions, but not for use by pregnant women.
