Facebook post says the U.S. is No. 1 in gun violence. Is it?
","In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., Americans took to social media to express their views on guns and violence.
   
A reader sent us one Facebook post about the extent of gun violence in the United States. It said, ""USA is #1 in gun violence. Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead because of gun violence every day.""
   
In this item, we’ll look at the first part of that claim -- that the ""USA is #1 in gun violence.""

International comparisons are always tricky, because there are differences from country to country in the definitions being used as well as the reliability and timeliness of the data. The most comprehensive international comparisons we found were published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Because of limited comparable data, we are defining gun violence as gun homicides. Let’s look at a few statistics:

Annual homicides from firearms

According to the U.N. figures, the U.S. had 9,146 homicides by firearm in 2009. That year, Colombia and Venezuela both exceeded the U.S. total, with 12,808 and 11,115 firearm deaths, respectively. Three other nations topped the U.S. amount in the most recent year for which data is available: Brazil (34,678 in 2008), Mexico (11,309 in 2010) and Thailand (20,032 in 2000).

So the U.S. ranks high in this category, but not first. Even using the higher U.S. homicide figure of 11,493 in 2010 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cited here), the U.S. still doesn’t rank first internationally.

Annual homicide rate for firearms

Because the U.S. is so big, it's better to compare the frequency of firearm homicides per capita, usually expressed as firearm homicides per 100,000 in national population.

According to the U.N., the U.S. had 3.0 firearm homicides per 100,000 in population in 2009. But there were 14 other nations that had higher rates in 2009, primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean: Honduras (57.6), Jamaica (47.2), St. Kitts and Nevis (44.4), Venezuela (39.0), Guatemala (38.5), Colombia (28.1), Trinidad & Tobago (27.3), Panama (19.3), Dominican Republic (16.9), Bahamas (15.4), Belize (15.4), Mexico (7.9), Paraguay (7.3) and Nicaragua (5.9). Three other nations had higher rates in 2008: El Salvador (39.9), Brazil (18.1) and Ecuador (12.7).

So the U.S. doesn’t rank no. 1 when firearm homicides are adjusted for population.

Where the U.S. does rank high in firearm violence

The main area where the U.S. exceeds the firearm violence of other nations is in comparison to other affluent nations. Using the U.N. data, European nations -- even former eastern bloc countries -- typically have rates well below 1 per 100,000, or far less than one-third the frequency seen in the U.S. The pattern is similar in other advanced industrialized nations, such as Canada, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

One study published in 2011 confirms this finding. The study, published in the Journal of Trauma -- Injury Infection & Critical Care, found that firearm homicide rates were 19.5 times higher in the U.S. than in 23 other ""high income"" countries studied, using 2003 data. Rates for other types of gun deaths were also higher in the U.S., but by somewhat smaller margins: 5.8 times higher for firearm suicides (even though overall suicide rates were 30 percent lower in the U.S.) and 5.2 times higher for unintentional firearm deaths.

Our ruling

The Facebook post says the ""USA is #1 in gun violence."" That's only true if you compare the U.S. with other affluent nations on a per capita basis. But widening the comparison to all nations, not just the richest ones, there are at least 17 other countries with higher per capita rates of gun homicides, most of them with rates astronomically higher than the U.S. rate.

And measured by raw gun homicides, the U.S. doesn’t rank first -- at least two and possibly as many as five countries have had more gun homicides in recent years than the U.S. did. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC714BC0>],/factchecks/2012/jul/23/facebook-posts/the-us-is-no-in-gun-violence-is-it/

Stimulus went to windmills from China? Romney ad says so
","
In the 2010 mid-term elections, Republicans won a lot of seats by running against government spending and especially the stimulus. The Romney campaign revived that theme in an ad that asks ‘Where did all the money go?’

The answer in the ad is not subtle. Image after image of dollar bills go up in flames. ""So where did the Obama stimulus money go? Windmills from China,"" the ad says.  

It also mentions cars from Finland, which we dealt with in a separate fact-check. For this one, we’ll focus on whether stimulus money paid for windmills from China.

Windmills from China have something of a history when it comes to political messaging. PolitiFact looked into Sarah Palin’s claim that nearly all of the renewable energy stimulus dollars went to Chinese turbine makers. We rated that False.  A version came up again this year in the Ohio federal Senate race. PolitiFact found that the Republican making the charge believed that a large wind project in Texas would have purchased 300 Chinese turbines. In fact, that project never got off the ground.

The concern over foreign beneficiaries of taxpayer money is not exclusively Republican territory. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has raised a stir about the fraction of money for renewable energy going to foreign businesses.

The Romney campaign sent us supporting documents for the ad’s claim. Among the reports and articles they cite, one refers to that massive project in Texas that was never built and will never receive stimulus money. Others stem from the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a nonprofit journalism project at American University.

The Investigative Reporting Workshop’s report backs up the ad’s claim but paints a murkier picture than the Romney campaign would have you think. The author tallied $2.6 million in stimulus money going to Chinese makers of wind turbines. However, the reporter, Russ Choma, also says that none of the farms used turbines entirely built in China. Additionally, he couldn’t say for sure how much stimulus money made its way to China. ""Some money definitely did, but it is safe to say more money went to creating jobs in the U.S. and Europe,"" he wrote.

A Challenging Money Trail

Federal support for renewable energy projects came through the 1603 tax credit program. So far, this program has paid out about $5.2 billion to wind farms nationwide. Once a project is on line and delivering power, that program pays money to the project developer -- as much as 30 percent of the project cost. Along the way, the developer pays the companies that provided the materials. Following the money becomes complicated because wind turbines are about as intricate as airplanes.

To choose an example, let’s look at a wind farm going up in Alaska. The lead contractor is General Electric, the world’s third-largest supplier of wind turbines and an American firm. But according to the Anchorage Daily News, ""The blades are made in Brazil, the units that contain the generator come from Southern California, the connecting hubs from the Florida Panhandle and the towers are made in China.""

This $65 million project isn’t eligible for the 1603 money until it begins producing power. When it does, it could receive as much as $20 million from Washington. More detailed information would be needed to assign those funds to the manufacturers.

We called the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group, to see if they knew of any Chinese turbines paid for with American stimulus dollars. They said they did. Their best guess is the number is six -- five in Texas and one in Iowa. But ""that might not be exactly right,"" said Liz Salerno, director of industry data and analysis. ""Because some of the blades and towers in Texas might have come from American firms.""

If it is six, that represents a tiny fraction of all the turbines installed with stimulus dollars. Salerno says the program funded more than 12,000 turbine installations over three years. Chinese components might have shown up in various places, but if one is counting complete Chinese ""windmills,"" then they account for less than 1 percent of the total.

Elsewhere, we have reported that due to the limited size of the American wind energy industry, most of the stimulus money to expand wind power went to foreign companies or their American-based subsidiaries. That does not mean that every dollar left the country. Some foreign companies built manufacturing plants in the U.S., for example.

That created jobs for American workers. The U.S. Energy Department estimates that the 1603 program went to projects that involved between 95,000 and 155,000 jobs. Those estimates cover all kinds of renewable energy generation work, but wind projects got over 80 percent of the funds. Manufacturing jobs in the wind industry began growing in 2005, and that trend continued through 2011. They now number about 30,000, according to the American Wind Energy Association.

 Our ruling

Mitt Romney’s ad said that stimulus dollars paid for windmills from China.

By depicting dollars going up in flames, the ad suggests that the U.S. gained nothing from the stimulus spending, and the money largely went to countries such as China.

In reality, many American firms connected to the wind industry expanded during the years of the stimulus. Only a small fraction of the money spent on wind energy went to China.

This statement contains a grain of truth but ignores other information. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC739800>],/factchecks/2012/jul/23/mitt-romney/stimulus-windmills-china-romney-ad/

Do 100,000 people get shot every year in U.S.? Facebook post says yes
","
In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., Americans took to social media to express their views on guns and violence.

A reader sent us one Facebook post about the extent of gun violence in the United States. It said, ""USA is #1 in gun violence. Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead because of gun violence every day.""

In this item, we’ll look at the second half of that claim: ""Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead.""

The numbers

We turned to statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; experts in the field told us it keeps the most reliable statistics on the subject. The CDC collects two sets of relevant data.

The first is data for deaths by guns, which is included in an annual report about deaths of all types during calendar year 2009. The numbers for gun deaths is broken down into several categories:

Suicide: 18,735 deaths
Homicide: 11,493 deaths
Unintentional: 554 deaths
Legal interventions: 333 deaths
Undetermined: 232 deaths

Total: 31,347 deaths

The second data set tracks non-fatal injuries by guns. According to the CDC, there were 73,505 non-fatal firearm injuries in 2010. (We will ignore an additional 13,851 non-fatal injuries from BB or pellet guns.)

How accurate is the Facebook post?

If you add together the gun deaths and the non-fatal gun injuries, you get 104,852 people shot every year. That’s very close to what the Facebook post said. The Facebook post was also close in its daily averages -- 287 people shot every day, and 86 deaths by gun every day.

There’s one area, however, in which the Facebook post could have benefited from additional context. It says that ""nearly 100,000 people get shot every year,"" which to us suggests that a victim is being shot by someone else. In reality, a significant majority of gun deaths comes from self-inflicted firearm wounds.

If you ignore the suicides -- and if you assume that relatively few people survive a suicide attempt with a firearm (we couldn’t find any hard data on that question) -- then the number of people who got shot, either fatally or non-fatally, was about 86,000, or roughly 235 a day. That’s lower than the Facebook post indicated. And the daily number of firearm deaths would be substantially lower -- 35 per day, rather than the 87 cited in the Facebook post.

Our ruling

The numbers in the Facebook post are close to accurate, as long as you make one major assumption -- that suicides count as ""get(ting) shot."" We think that assumption is debatable, but there is no question that at least 100,000 people did die or become injured from firearms. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE03600>],/factchecks/2012/jul/23/facebook-posts/do-people-get-shot-every-year-facebook-post-says/

""Obamacare"" is largest-ever tax on middle class, GOP U.S. Senate candidate Jeff Fitzgerald says
","
On the day the U.S. Supreme Court upheld President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, Rush Limbaugh called the law ""the largest tax increase in the history of the world.""

The conservative radio talk show host earned a Pants on Fire from PolitiFact National. The law isn’t even the largest tax increase in U.S. history, although it does rank among the top five -- as a percentage of gross domestic product -- dating back to 1968.

Other critics of the law, including Wisconsin Republican Jeff Fitzgerald, also reacted on the day of the June 28, 2012, ruling.

Fitzgerald, the Wisconsin Assembly speaker and a candidate for U.S. Senate in the August 2012 primary, fired away on the Twitter social networking site. He said the Supreme Court ""has revealed what Obamacare really is, the largest middle-class tax increase in history!""

Fitzgerald’ claim is narrower, focusing on the middle class.

Is he more on the money?

Fitzgerald’s evidence
 
Fitzgerald campaign manager Steve Stanek made two arguments in defense of Fitzgerald’s claim.

1. The law’s tax is 40 percent for a typical family.

Fitzgerald cited an opinion column on Forbes.com written by Merrill Matthews of the Institute for Policy Innovation, a think tank founded by former Republican U.S. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas. The Texas organization says it values ""individual liberty, limited government, and free markets.""

But one problem for Fitzgerald is that Matthews claims the reform law is the largest tax increase in history, not the largest on the middle class. He argues that not only is the law’s penalty for not having health insurance a tax, but also that the requirement itself is a tax.

Matthews then uses this math:

The median U.S. family income is about $50,000, according to a USA Today news article; the cost of family health coverage ""can easily run $20,000 a year""; and thus the insurance cost is 40 percent of the typical family’s income.  

Fitzgerald argues that a 40 percent hike ""is clearly the largest on the middle class in U.S. history,"" although he offers no evidence of how the figure compares to other tax hikes.

Hmmm.

The column Fitzgerald cites describes a family that pays a premium to a private company in exchange for health insurance. That, obviously, is not a tax paid to the government. Moreover, the 40 percent figure doesn't measure a tax increase but rather an insurance premium's portion of a family's income.

2. The law raises taxes by $1 trillion over 10 years.

Fitzgerald argues the reform law will raise taxes by $1 trillion over 10 years, using multiplication on a figure in the PolitiFact item on Limbaugh’s claim as his source. And he claims about ""75 percent of those taxes will fall on the middle class,"" citing a Wall Street Journal opinion article as his source.

But both articles are misquoted.

In rating Limbaugh’s statement, PolitiFact National cited two nonpartisan federal agencies in reporting that by 2019, the reform law is expected to raise an additional $438 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation; or $525 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

That’s a lot less than the $1 trillion Fitzgerald is claiming. Moreover, Fitzgerald’s claim was about taxes on the middle class, but he is citing figures on overall taxes in the health reform law.

As for the Wall Street Journal opinion writer saying up to 75 percent of the ""tax"" would be on the middle class, he was referring not to the total revenue the law will bring in, but the penalty that would be paid by individuals who do not follow the mandate to get health insurance. The penalty is expected to raise $4 billion per year from 2017 to 2019 -- again, that’s a long way from $1 trillion.

We asked Stanek about the discrepancies. He acknowledged the campaign misread the PolitiFact and Wall Street Journal articles.

In short, Fitzgerald does not produce a figure for how much the reform law is projected to cost the middle class in taxes.

Other considerations

To be clear, the health reform law does raise taxes, as our colleagues have noted -- although two of the biggest hit high-income people, not the middle class:

• Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes go up for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion.

• Starting in 2018, a new tax on high-cost health plans, so-called ""Cadillac plans"" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families), kicks in. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019.

For other newly imposed taxes in the law, it’s not clear how the burden will fall -- and even less clear on how it will affect the middle class. PolitiFact National found these taxes include a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers ($27 billion over 10 years); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion over 10 years); an annual fee on health insurance providers begins ($60.1 billion over 10 years); a higher floor for medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns ($15.2 billion over 10 years); and an excise tax on indoor tanning services ($2.7 billion over 10 years).

Two more things:

The Washington Post Fact Checker found, using Joint Tax Committee data, that middle-class folks (individuals earning under $200,000) are expected to pay $64.6 billion in tax hikes (including penalties for not having insurance) under the health reform law -- but that they are also expected to receive $343 billion in subsidies and credits.

And the Joint Tax Committee and the Congressional Budget Office told us they do not have any listing of the largest middle-class tax hikes in history.

Our rating

Fitzgerald said Obama’s federal health reform law is ""the largest middle class tax increase in history,"" but the two ways he measures it are deeply flawed.

In claiming the law increase taxes on the middle class by 40 percent, Fitzgerald cites figures related to insurance premiums, not taxes. And if even the law would raise taxes by $1 trillion as he erroneously claims, that’s a total figure, not how much taxes would go up for the middle class.

For making an extraordinary claim and offering painfully thin evidence, we rate Fitzgerald’s statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD92540>],/factchecks/2012/jul/23/jeff-fitzgerald/obamacare-largest-ever-tax-middle-class-gop-us-sen/
"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims he cut $360 million from the state Legislature’s budget using line-item vetoes
","
Gov. Chris Christie sliced spending from the state budget, but the cuts are not as deep as he claimed recently.

In a speech at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank in Washington, D.C., Christie said he recently signed his third budget, which he said increased spending on education, while bolstering support for the state’s most vulnerable citizens and making a ""significant down payment on our pension obligation.""

""At the same time, I used my line-item veto authority to veto $360 million dollars in special interest spending, so that our budget this year, in fiscal year 2013, which has just begun, is still smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by my predecessor, Governor Corzine,"" Christie said during the July 9 address.

In fact, Christie sliced about $86 million -- not $360 million -- from the state budget using line-item vetoes, a process that allows the governor to eliminate or reduce particular appropriations in the budget.

Reductions in funds for pension contributions made up a large portion of the cuts. Christie also reduced funding for transitional aid to towns, nursing homes and medical day care services, among other areas.

So Christie is wrong on the size of the cuts.

He’s also wrong to claim those cuts had an impact on trimming the spending plan to below the size of the 2008 and 2009 budgets. The Legislature had passed and delivered a budget to Christie that was already smaller than those two budget bills.

The governor’s office did not respond to requests for clarification on how Christie reached his total of $360 million in cuts, but his office has cited the figure before.

A news release from June 29 -- the day Christie signed the budget -- said that the governor ""put Corzine Democrats on their heels by vetoing $361 million in unnecessary or unsupported spending.""

Attached to that release were several vetoes of other bills the Legislature sent to the governor’s desk. Christie claims in his veto messages that seven of those bills would have increased government spending by more than $275 million. Adding that amount to the line-item vetoes pushes Christie’s total cuts to more than $361 million.

Christie says in the veto documents that separating the bills from the budget is ""little more than a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the tough choices required to meet the constitutional obligation of passing a balanced budget.""

""Taken together,"" Christie claims the bills ""would add more than $275 million of government spending for the coming fiscal year.""

Several of the bills clearly authorize additional appropriations, such as a bill that increased the amount of aid municipalities receive from the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Fund, starting with a $66 million bump in fiscal year 2013.

But others don’t.

One bill Christie vetoed would have provided towns more time to spend affordable housing funds before turning the money over to the state.

And other bills, like a piece of legislation that would have required municipalities to submit economic growth plans to keep participating in the state’s urban enterprise zone program, lacked a firm estimate of potential fiscal impact.

Still, all of the bills were vetoed outright by the governor and were not part of the state budget he signed.

Christie used his line-item veto authority to cut more than $86 million -- not $360 million -- from the Legislature’s budget.

Our ruling

Christie said he used his ""line-item veto authority to veto $360 million dollars in special interest spending, so that our budget this year ... is still smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by my predecessor.""

Only one fourth of that figure -- about $86 million -- represents appropriations in the budget reduced by Christie’s line-item veto.

And Christie’s point that those cuts reduced the size of the budget to below 2008 and 2009 levels is wrong. The budget the Legislature passed was already smaller than those two budgets.

We rate this claim False.

"['New Hampshire', 'Corrections and Updates', 'Taxes', 'Jackie Cilley']","
With no income or sales tax, New Hampshire does rely heavily on property taxes
","
New Hampshire typically ranks among the wealthiest and healthiest states in the country, but, according to gubernatorial candidate Jackie Cilley, the Granite State boasts one distinction that isn’t as complimentary.

In a candidate forum last week in Nashua, Cilley, a former state senator, took aim at New Hampshire’s tax structure and, specifically, the property tax, which she claimed ranks among the nation’s highest.

""We have the third highest (property tax) in the country,"" Cilley, a Barrington Democrat, told the audience gathered Monday, July 16, 2012 at Nashua City Hall.

""That is not the way to fund a government,"" she said.

On its face, the claim seems feasible. New Hampshire is one of nine states in the country without an income tax. The Granite State is one of five without a statewide sales tax, and it’s one of only two, along with Alaska, without either.

This leaves New Hampshire legislators leaning heavily -- too heavily, according to some -- on property taxes as a revenue source. But are the Granite State’s property taxes really the nation’s third highest? We decided to look at the numbers.

Currently, New Hampshire is one of 37 states to charge property taxes at both the state and local level.

Because the local taxes vary from town to town or county to county, it’s difficult to identify a total state property tax rate. Instead, tax analysts determine property tax rankings based on the average amounts collected from each taxpayer.

And, based on 2009 data -- the most recent available -- New Hampshire property taxes do rank among the country’s highest.

In 2009, the U.S. Census reported the state raised about $3.2 billion in total state and local property taxes, which ranked 42nd among the 50 states. But when you spread that among all New Hampshire residents, it works out to $2,424 per person, according to calculations by the Tax Policy Center, a collaboration between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.

That figure places the state third on the list -- behind only Connecticut, which averaged $2,498 per person in 2009, and New Jersey, which averaged $2,671 per person, according to the policy center.

Numbers reported by the Tax Foundation differed slightly, showing New Hampshire’s average property tax bills at $2,440. However, that figure also ranked the Granite State’s property taxes as the third highest in the nation, also behind Connecticut and New Jersey.

These rankings may show Cilley’s claim to be on track, but they don’t tell the whole story behind New Hampshire’s tax structure, analysts said.

To paint a fuller picture of the Granite State’s tax climate, voters should consider all the state and local taxes, according to Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

Based on the same 2009 Census data, New Hampshire ranked 23rd that year among states in terms of total local and state taxes, charging taxpayers an average of $3,765 per person, according to the center.

Comparing that average to per capita income, state taxpayers pay about 8 percent of their income in taxes, according to the Tax Foundation ranks the Granite State 44th in the country in percent of income paid, meaning people in 43 states pay more of their earnings in taxes.

""Property tax may be high (in New Hampshire), but there aren’t many other taxes, so the overall tax burden is pretty low,"" said Nick Kasprak, a Tax Foundation analyst.


""I generally find it misleading to just rank based on a specific tax,"" added Rueben, of the Tax Policy Center. ""New Hampshire will have high per capita property tax because it doesn't really have sales or income taxes.""


Our ruling:

Cilley’s claim that New Hampshire has the nation’s third highest-property taxes is spot on. Using Census data, the leading tax advocacy organizations show that New Hampshire ranks third, behind only Connecticut and New Jersey, in property tax charges. It’s worth noting, though, that Cilley does not paint a full picture of the Granite State’s overall tax landscape. Looking at overall tax burden, New Hampshire residents fund the government with a relatively low percentage of their incomes in comparison to other states. We rate this statement True.

Broun claim on history of crime gets main points right
","
A recent discussion about federal laws concerning online fetish videos somehow turned into a debate over the size of the U.S. Department of Justice.  

U.S. Rep. Paul Broun of Athens voted in 2010 against making the production of ""crush videos"" a federal crime. These horrific videos -- all sides agreed with that assessment -- show animals such as kittens and baby rabbits being killed.

Ever since, Broun’s opponents have tried to use this vote as political ammunition. One of his rivals even claimed he sided with ""sexual deviants."" False, we ruled.

It happened again July 2 on Athens radio station WGAU-AM 1340, on the show ""Newsmakers with Tim Bryant."" Broun was in the midst of an informal debate with GOP primary opponent Stephen Simpson when a caller asked the congressman to explain his vote on crush videos.

Broun said making the videos was a ""heinous act."" But he said there was no need for a federal law. States already ban them.

Furthermore, the federal government has already created more laws than the Constitution allows it to do, he said.  

""Initially, we only had three federal felonies, I believe. It was treason, piracy, and counterfeiting securities and money,"" Broun said.

Only three? Tell us more, Congressman Broun.

He didn’t. His office did not return our messages. So we put on our tricorn hat and knickers and took the Truth-O-Meter on a trip into history.

We interviewed six legal historians with knowledge of early U.S. law. They told us that Broun’s statement broached the truth but contained some inaccuracies.

The U.S. Constitution doesn’t contain an exhaustive list of federal crimes. It does mention three of them: counterfeiting federal coins and securities, piracy and felonies committed on the high seas, and treason -- the ones that Broun mentioned.

But the Constitution is no criminal code, said Robert W. Gordon, a Stanford law professor and an expert on American legal history.

""It doesn't create or provide for the punishment of any crimes -- it just gives authority to the Legislature [Congress] to define and punish various crimes,"" Gordon said.

The nation’s first Congress took this authority and ran with it. The Act of April 30, 1790, otherwise known as the Crimes Act, codified those three federal offenses and declared others.

We read the act and found these additional crimes included committing murder in places under federal jurisdiction, concealing federal crimes and aiding crime on the high seas.

People who falsified records of proceedings in U.S. courts were to be ""whipped not exceeding thirty-nine stripes,"" it said.

The Crimes Act made perjury punishable by ""standing in the pillory for one hour."" Those convicted were banned from testifying in court.

In other words, the first Congress did not assume the three crimes mentioned in the Constitution were the only ones it could establish, said Polly J. Price, an Emory University law professor and expert on American legal history.

On the whole, however, historians thought that Broun’s omissions were important, but not fatal flaws.

""I would say that Representative Broun's claim was pretty nearly accurate, since the major crimes defined in 1790 are the ones he lists; just not completely accurate, because Congress also created a few more crimes at the same time,"" Gordon said.

How do we rule?

Broun’s list was a dozen or so crimes short. But his overarching point is correct. When America was in its infancy, very few federal crimes existed.

""Our budget has doubled in the past three years,"" she said, echoing a claim she made at a recent candidate forum. ""I think we need to prioritize spending."" 
The claim prompted a double take. Here’s what happened next: 
Editorial writer C.T. Bowen: ""I’ve got to back you up. The budget’s doubled the last three years?"" 
O’Connor: ""Yeah."" 
Bowen: ""How’s that possible?"" 
O’Connor: ""It’s possible. I talked to Mr. Nurrenbrock (the county’s longtime budget chief). You can double-check it with him. It has. In the past three years. It’s now over $1 billion."" 
Reporter Lee Logan: ""Um, there must be… I guess… That’s not the general revenue portion of the budget?"" 
O’Connor: ""That’s the total budget."" 
Clearly there’s something funky going on here. 
So we called budget chief Mike Nurrenbrock. He pointed us to the budget’s final summary page. Sure enough, under ""total county budget,"" it includes $554 million for Fiscal Year 2011, $1.1 billion for Fiscal Year 2012, and $1.1 billion for the proposed budget that begins Oct. 1. 
But Nurrenbrock explained that line doesn’t exactly compare apples to apples. Here’s the key: the FY2011 figure lists what was actually spent that year. The next two numbers are the total budget, even though officials know a good chunk of the money won’t be spent that year. 
Nurrenbrock said that ""dramatic difference"" is money that is rolled from each year to the next. That includes reserves, large capital projects and money for bond issues. 
""There’s a major portion of our budget that just goes forward the next year, pretty much every year,"" he said. 
Some high-profile examples: The county has $32 million in general fund reserves in case a major storm hits, and there is a similar $5 million pot in the municipal service fund. About $11.5 million in tourism taxes have been collecting for 20 years, and commissioners recently earmarked the money for a sports complex in Wesley Chapel. 
There is a $7 million fund for economic development incentives or infrastructure. And there’s a total of $93 million in transportation impact fees. Those are set aside for specific projects that simply haven’t gone out to bid. That figure includes about $40 million for the long-stalled Ridge Road extension. 
And so on. 
Nurrenbrock said it’s more accurate to compare the total spending plans from each year. Here are the last five bottom-line budgets: $980 million (FY09), $949 million (FY10), $1.03 billion (FY11), $1.09 billion (FY 12), and next year’s proposed $1.1 billion. 
O’Connor acknowledged the mistake. She said it stems from trying to make sense of a complex, 292-page spending plan. Challengers are often at a disadvantage to incumbents regarding budgetary details, because sitting commissioners are supposed to know how the county’s money is spent. 
""As candidates, it’s very difficult to look at that budget and come up with specific things to cut,"" she said. ""When you try to get insight with the county administration, they’re not the easiest to work with."" 
Fair enough. Also, O’Connor isn’t the only candidate to make a wild claim about Pasco’s spending. District 3 hopeful Kathryn Starkey recently retracted a line about reining in ""runaway local government spending"" that was on her campaign flier. In an interview, she said, ""All in all, I think our county government has done a good job of being fiscally conservative in a tough time."" 
But O’Connor’s claim about a ballooning county budget is shocking — especially as property tax collections have shriveled in the past several years. The claim is also incorrect. O’Connor’s statement earns a False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFC85C0>],/factchecks/2012/jul/22/rachel-oconnor/rachel-oconnor-says-pascos-budget-has-doubled-thre/

Bill Pascrell claims Barack Obama has not raised taxes
","
Forget social issues. U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell said he learned in his recent primary fight that the economy is at the forefront of people’s minds.

So while explaining the need to set aside distractions and reach a balanced approach to deal with national fiscal issues, the Democratic congressman tried to set straight President Barack Obama’s record on taxes.

""We need tax cuts, there’s no question about it,"" Pascrell said in a July 18 interview on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal. But, he said, ""this president has not raised taxes. He has not raised taxes ... and I haven't agreed with the president on everything, even as a Democrat, but he has not raised taxes. There have been so many myths about this presidency and they need to be clarified and maybe we'll do that during the election.""

Has Obama really not raised taxes?

Thomas Pietrykoski, Pascrell’s spokesman, said the congressman was ""referring to the overall effective tax rate for American families."" Our colleagues at PolitiFact National found last year that for the average middle-class family, the effective tax rate -- how much the average taxpayer pays as a percentage of his income -- fell between 2008 and 2011.

But Pascrell didn’t make that distinction in the interview. And Obama has raised some taxes.

Obama earned a False last year from PolitiFact National for saying he ""didn’t raise taxes once.""

Soon after taking office the president signed a bill that increased the federal excise tax on tobacco products. That tax hike went into effect in 2009.

Then Obama signed the health care law, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act but often called ObamaCare. That law includes several tax increases, some of which have not yet gone into effect, though some are in place now.

For example, individuals who use indoor tanning services started paying a 10 percent tax in 2010.

Other taxes in the law -- such as additional Medicare taxes of 0.9 percent on individuals who make more than $200,000 and couples that make more than $250,000 -- don’t go into effect until Jan. 1, 2013 or later.

And then there’s the individual mandate, a linchpin of the health care law that will require people who forego health insurance coverage to pay a fine. The U.S. Supreme Court said in a decision upholding most of the law that the mandate ""may reasonably be characterized as a tax"" and that ""it is reasonable to construe"" it as a tax.

Though these tax hikes may be relatively narrow in scope, they are examples of taxes increasing under Obama.

But Obama has also cut taxes.

The president said in 2011 that he ""lowered taxes over the last two years."" That statement earned a Mostly True from PolitiFact National.

The president’s stimulus bill included the ""Making Work Pay"" tax credit, which was intended to offset payroll taxes. The credit gave up to $400 for working individuals and up to $800 for married taxpayers filing joint returns in 2009 and 2010.

Also, Obama and Congress reached a deal in 2010 to lower payroll taxes by 2 percent for one year. The reduced tax rate was later extended through the end of this year.

The tax cuts impacted a broader group, while the tax increases have had a more narrow reach.

Nevertheless, some taxes have still increased under Obama.

Our ruling

Pascrell said ""this president has not raised taxes.""

Some taxes have increased during Obama’s time in the White House. In his first months in office, Obama increased the federal excise tax on tobacco products and the national health care law includes a number of tax increases.

It’s also true that other taxes -- such as payroll taxes -- have been reduced during the president’s tenure.

However, it’s wrong to broadly state that Obama has not raised taxes.

We rate this claim False.

Memphis candidate Bergmann repeats Limbaugh claim that health-care tax increase is biggest in world history
","
Charlotte Bergmann, the Republican businesswoman running against physician George S. Flinn in the 9th Congressional District primary, put out a Fourth of July newsletter to supporters making a claim we’re hearing a lot these days – that the Affordable Care Act ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court is not just a tax, but ""the largest tax increase in the history of the world."" 
There are a lot of people making that or similar claims. Our colleagues at the national PolitiFact operation in Washington looked into one the earliest, by radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. We’ll reprise some of its pertinent findings, and its rationale for giving his statement its ""Pants on Fire"" rating, below.

We first asked the Bergmann campaign to provide the sourcing backing its claim. Bergmann’s spokeswoman, Brenda Fowler, sent us a list of selected taxes included in the health-care law. We’ll quote from the email: 
""--Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year tax increase: $210.2 billion.

""--Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called ‘Cadillac plans’ (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families) kicks in. That's a tax increase of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019.

""--Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers begins. Total estimated 10-year tax increase: $60.1 billion.

""--Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's estimated to be an additional tax of $15.2 billion over the next 10 years.""

All of that appears to be accurate. It also appears to come verbatim from a larger seven-bullet summary of the tax provisions handed out by the federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress staffed by economists and accountants. Some of the taxes, as Fowler points out, don’t affect big segments of the population.

The issue is simply whether the Affordable Care Act is the largest tax increase ever. Rather than examine tax increases that have been put in effect in Burkina Faso or the Maldives, or whether the Stamp Act or the tax on tea in the 18th century that precipitated the American Revolution were higher or more onerous historically, let’s just compare the ACA tax increases to tax revenue-raising legislation in the United States in this century.

To summarize the national PolitiFact findings, by the time the new law is fully implemented, in 2019, it will have raised a total of somewhere between $437.8 billion and $525 billion. That sounds pretty big, but historically, Politifact discovered, the relative size of the tax as a percentage of the nation’s economy is lower than several other previous bills – including some signed into law by Republican presidents.

Politifact’s estimation of the relative size of the tax compared how much revenue is raised in 2019, when the ACA will be fully implemented, to the projected Gross Domestic Product for that year. We use a formula designed by Jerry Tempalski at the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which looks at the revenue raised through tax legislation as a percentage of GDP going back to 1940. 
In 2019, when the act is fully implemented, it will generate $104 billion in increased revenue. With a GDP projected at $21.164 trillion, the ACA tax provisions will account for 0.49 percent of GDP.

To make a long story shorter, Tempalski found that the Revenue Act of 1942, one of that era’s stimulus bills to finance World War II, accounted for 5.04 percent of GDP (more than 10 times the ACA’s impact). The Revenue Act of 1961 was 2.2 percent of GDP. The Current Tax Payment Act of 1943 was 1.13 percent of GDP. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act signed by Ronald Reagan was 0.8 percent of GDP. In fact, 10 other acts of Congress have been bigger in terms of their impact on GDP than ""Obamacare"" will be.

Our ruling 
In an appeal to supporters to help fund her congressional campaign, Charlotte Bergmann repeated an assertion made by Rush Limbaugh that the Affordable Care Act created the largest tax increase in the history of the world. But we have consistently found that the ACA will bring in less revenue as a percentage of the entire national economy than many previous tax increases in U.S. history. 
That means the assertion by Bergmann and others that the health-care law is the biggest tax increase in world history cannot possibly be true. That claim is not just wrong but so far removed from the truth that we rate it Pants On Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC035700>],/factchecks/2012/jul/22/charlotte-bergmann/memphis-candidate-bergmann-repeats-limbaugh-claim-/
"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Regulation', 'Small Business', 'States', 'Robert DiMuccio']","
Amica Insurance President Robert DiMuccio says Rhode Islanders pay some of the highest auto repair bills in the U.S.
","
One of the late-night, end-of-session bills passed by the General Assembly in June would have required insurance companies to reach an agreement with auto body shops over the cost of a repair.

Proponents, including the shops, characterized it as consumer-friendly legislation, contending that the shops are advocates for their customers.

Opponents, including insurance companies, began a campaign to get Governor Chafee to veto the measure, which he ultimately did.

Critics argued that the legislation would make insurance-related auto repairs even more expensive and drive up rates.

Robert DiMuccio, chairman and president of Amica Insurance, made that pitch in a letter to policy holders, saying the legislation would allow ""shops to set inflated prices for labor and repairs and use the threat of lawsuits to charge these exorbitant repair costs.""

He offered links to web pages showing which legislators voted in favor of the bill in the House and the Senate, and said it was another example of how, ""over the past few years, the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island (ABARI) has pushed a legislative agenda that drives up the costs of auto body repair without consideration for the consumer.""

""As a result,"" he wrote, ""Rhode Islanders pay among the highest auto repair bills in the nation.""

We know Rhode Island ranks high on many scales of dubious distinction. So we wondered if DiMuccio was painting an accurate picture. It took us awhile to get to the bottom of it, but here’s what we found.

When we called DiMuccio's office, an official at Amica said the data came from the Property Casualty Insurers (PCI) Association of America, a trade association of more than 1,000 insurance companies, which was running radio ads urging Chafee to veto the legislation.

PCI spokesman Jeffrey Brewer told us its data came from Audatex, which provides software and other services to collision repair companies and automobile insurance claims processors. Those numbers are not publicly available but, after consulting with Audatex, he released them to us.

When we analyzed the data, broken down by category in the report, here's what we saw. 
LABOR: This was, by far, typically the costliest part of a repair job, responsible for 41 percent of the average body shop repair bill.

And Rhode Island, according to the study, was the second most expensive state for labor. Montana was the first. 

While the U.S. average labor cost was $953 per repair in 2010, the typical Rhode Island cost was 29 percent higher, or $1,233. Going to Connecticut would have saved you $66. Traveling to Massachusetts would have saved a hefty $361, which was $81 less than the U.S. average. 
ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER'S PARTS: In this category -- usually the second-most expensive part of the repair, accounting for 25 percent -- Rhode Island topped the list in costs.

While the typical cost for this portion of the bill was $580, Rhode Islanders paid a whopping 49 percent more, or $866. 

Why the extra cost? It's not clear. But it's not location. In Alaska, the second most expensive state (shipping costs may be a factor), the average price for replacement parts was $61 less.

Replacement parts cost $78 less in Connecticut and $281 less in Massachusetts. In South Carolina, they were less than half the price than in Rhode Island.

OTHER PARTS: In this category, which includes parts not made by the car manufacturer, Rhode Island's ranking plummets to 27th, although the cost of these parts makes up only 13 percent of the average bill.

OTHER COSTS (including towing and storage): Again, Rhode Island ranks in the middle of the pack at 26th, with costs 4 percent below the national average. These costs make up 22 percent of the average bill.

OVERALL: The higher cost of labor and original parts makes Rhode Island auto body repair bills 23 percent more expensive than the national average. That made us the 5th most expensive in the nation, according to the 2010 Audatex data. 

New York ranks fourth and Connecticut ranks sixth. Massachusetts is a more-than-reasonable 43rd.

But that's just one data source. Some auto body shops use a similar service run by Mitchell International, another automated tool for coordinating repair costs between auto body shops and insurance companies.

Greg Horn, vice president for industry relations, sent us his company's numbers going back to 2006. Mitchell organizes its data in a different way so the results were slightly different.

In their listing, Rhode Island ranked sixth in overall costs in 2010, not fifth. 

What was more interesting was the year-to-year trend. Rhode Island's ranking on the list of most-expensive states for accident-related car repairs has been going up steadily. We were 17th in 2006, 11th in 2007, 10th in 2008, 9th in 2009 and 6th in 2010.

In 2011, based on data from their customers, Rhode Island was the second most costly state to have your car repaired after an accident.

Breaking it down, we ranked 11th nationally on labor costs, ninth on the cost of parts and first in the cost of paint, which makes up nearly 12 percent of the average repair bill.

PCI says the higher repair costs explain why Rhode Islanders pay the sixth highest collision insurance premium in the nation, although the numbers it's citing -- $356 versus $294 in the  United States -- are from a 2008-09 database. 

When we asked the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island about that, spokeswoman Jina Petrarca-Karampetsos, a lawyer, sent us an association publication showing that the average collision premium was about $356 around 2009, and a chart showing a decline since 2005.

Petrarca-Karampetsos expressed concern that the data we had received from Audatex and Mitchell were not publicly available and ""absolutely unverifiable.""

But rankings she provided from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners show Rhode Island 5th in 2006, 6th in 2007 and 5th in 2008, the most recent year available. The fact that the state was 5th in 2010 according to Audatex ""indicates that Rhode Island has maintained the same rank for years!"" she said in an e-mail.

On a side issue, we also wonder whether car repairs in general -- non-accident-related repairs -- cost more in Rhode Island, even though insurance companies don't pay for them.

One study suggests that those repairs have a very different cost profile here.

CarMD, which collected data on the cost of 163,583 repairs done nationwide in 2011, found that the average cost of parts and labor in Rhode Island was $331, $3 below the national average. The range was $389 in Wyoming to $284 in Indiana.

Our ruling

Amica Insurance President Robert DiMuccio said, ""Rhode Islanders pay among the highest auto repair bills in the nation."" From the context, it was clear he was talking about accident-related repairs, which is what insurance companies cover.

Data from two national services that collect data show that Rhode Islanders typically pay far more than consumers in other states.

According to the Audatex data, Rhode Island ranked fifth in 2010.

According to Mitchell International, we've been steadily climbing in the rankings, at least since 2006, and have been in the top 10 since 2008. In 2011, we had peaked at second place. (As of July 15, 2012, we ranked fourth.)

The auto body association says fifth- or sixth-place rankings are not new for Rhode Island, disputing Mitchell data suggesting a sharp increase in recent years. 

We'll steer clear of the debate over whether the General Assembly was wise to pass the law or whether Chafee was helping consumers when he vetoed it.

But DiMuccio said our bills are currently among the highest now, and we're driven to rate it True.

Attack ad says Jim Frishe raised taxes on accountants' fees
","
St. Petersburg Rep. Jim Frishe got his start in the Florida House in the 1980s, when the Republican served six years and took a vote to raise taxes.

The widely unpopular ""services tax"" of 1987 was repealed months later amid a public uproar.

But a group supporting his GOP opponent in the Senate District 22 primary isn’t letting Frishe, or voters, forget that initial vote. A television commercial riffs Frishe’s own slogan -- ""This Republican has walked the walk for over 40 years"" -- by saying he’s trampled voters with new taxes.

Man: ""Jim Frishe says he’s walked the walk in politics for 40 years. The truth is, he’s walked all over us with taxes.""

Woman: ""Yeah, Frishe voted to raise our taxes on everything from dry-cleaning to pest control. Forty years is enough.""

Second woman: ""Frishe voted to increase fees on car tags and fishing permits.""

Second man: ""Frishe even wanted to tax accountants.""

Third woman: ""You mean he wants to tax us for doing our taxes?""

Third man: ""Forty years of this is enough.""

Fourth woman: ""More than enough.""

The ad is sponsored by Accountability in Government, an electioneering group that supports St. Petersburg Republican Rep. Jeff Brandes for the seat. We tried to contact the group’s chairman but did not hear back. The group sponsors a website, 40yearsisenough.com, that contains a lengthy document of news clips summarizing the tax controversy and newspaper editorials against Frishe.

(As an aside, we want to first address the ""Forty years is enough"" rhetoric. It’s taken from Frishe’s own ads, where he talks about being active within the Republican Party and for Ronald Reagan. To be clear, he has served six terms in the Legislature. Six years from 1984 to 1990, and six more from 2006-2012.)

Of all the tax claims, we were most intrigued by the exchange about taxing accountant services. Did Frishe really want to ""tax us for doing our taxes?""

The tone of the ad might suggest the taxes Frishe supported stuck. The truth is, some did and some didn’t, and some votes referenced in the ad happened more than 20 years apart.

This vote on taxing accountant services, among many other services, happened 25 years ago. Tampa Republican Bob Martinez was governor and Democrats controlled the Legislature. Frishe was in the Republican minority.

There was a push that year to broaden the state’s tax base, Frishe explained. There was no recession that year; rather, Florida’s economy was booming. Still, the state needed money to fix roads and pay for an influx of new public school students.

To do that, the Legislature passed a 5 percent sales tax on many personal and professional services, including accountants’ fees, agricultural services, house-building, architect and engineering fees, pest control, cleaning services, computer and data processing, advertising, legal fees, magazine and newspaper subscriptions and newspaper rack sales, pet-grooming and cleaning services.

The April vote on SB 777 was 83-31, with some Pinellas County Republicans, including Frishe, former Rep. and Sen. Dennis Jones, and current lobbyist Pete Dunbar, joining the Democrats to pass it despite the objections of many conservatives.

Lawmakers said it was the biggest tax increase in state history and expected it to raise $761.1 million for the state in its first year and $1.2 billion the year after that. Martinez swiftly signed it into law.

""There is no joy and glee in taxation, but there is a sense that this House and this Senate have taken the first step forward for protecting Florida's future,"" said House Speaker Jon Mills, D-Gainesville, according to a Tampa Bay Times  account (then the St. Petersburg Times).

Someone had to be the ""adult in the room,"" Frishe said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida, taking a jab against Brandes, 36, whom Frishe indirectly mocks in another commercial as ""a young wannabe politician, beating his chest, claiming to be a Reagan Republican.""

A lobbying fight to repeal the tax emerged that summer, with the Florida Association of Broadcasters railing against it loudly. Martinez summoned lawmakers for a special session on the issue, and lawmakers repealed the services sales tax on Dec. 10, 1987, and replaced it with a one percent increase on the state sales tax on goods.

Frishe voted against the measure. In the House Journal, which is an official record of the proceedings, Frishe explained his vote by saying that he supported repealing the tax on services, but he opposed raising the sales tax on goods. 
""I favor repealing the sales tax on services as it passed in the 1987 Regular Session,"" Frishe wrote. ""I have voted 'No' on CS/CS/SB 5-D and CS/SB 6-D because it raises the state sales tax from 5 cents to 6 cents. This merely continues to raise the needed revenue for our state from the same shrinking base and remains as regressive as it was at 5 cents. Florida has serious needs, but to continue 'business as usual' will not solve the long term needs of this state.""

Would Florida’s economy be in a stronger place if the tax had remained? ""I think it unquestionably would,"" Frishe told PolitiFact Florida.

We asked Brandes for his thoughts, even though he did not sponsor the ad.

""I think the question is, is it a fact that Jim Frishe voted to raise taxes?"" Brandes said. ""Not that he later changed his mind. And I think clearly it’s a fact that he did.""

Our ruling 
A third-party group says Frishe voted to tax people for ""doing our taxes."" In 1987, Frishe did vote for a plan to tax services in the state of Florida, including accountants' fees. 
He later said he favored a proposal to repeal the services tax, but he could not support the repeal in the Legislature becuase it included a provision that raised the sales tax on goods. 
While those caveats give a fuller picture of Frishe's position and his vote, they do not undermine the statement made by the group Accountability in Government. We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEF4140>],/factchecks/2012/jul/20/accountability-government/attack-ad-says-jim-frishe-raised-taxes-accountants/
"['Campaign Finance', 'History', 'Florida', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says he could be ""the first president in modern history to be outspent""
","
In the spring of 2012, headlines blared about President Barack Obama’s ""hefty cash advantage.""

By June, once Republicans had settled on Mitt Romney, the story had changed to this: ""Romney’s fund-raising outpaces president’s.""

Obama used the news to appeal to donors in a June 26 fundraising plea: ""I will be the first president in modern history to be outspent in his re-election campaign, if things continue as they have so far. I'm not just talking about the super PACs and anonymous outside groups -- I'm talking about the Romney campaign itself. Those outside groups just add even more to the underlying problem.""

We researched whether Obama’s team could be outraised by Romney and concluded that there are too many unknowns to determine if his prediction will come true. (Read our extended analysis of the issue.)

We could determine, though, if there had been any president in modern history to be outspent in his re-election campaign. We looked at two races involving Democratic incumbents facing Republican challengers: President Jimmy Carter vs. Ronald Reagan in 1980 and President Bill Clinton vs. Bob Dole in 1996. These examples contradict Obama’s point. 
But a simple comparison of the numbers doesn’t tell the full story. 
The earlier races both occurred when candidates accepted public financing for general election campaigns. The public financing system, began in the wake of the Watergate scandal, gave each candidate a set amount of money to spend after the primary and before the general election. Obama opted out of that system in both 2008 and 2012 because he could raise more money on his own.

1980: Carter vs. Reagan

We shared Obama’s claim with Bob Biersack, a former longtime official at the Federal Election Commission who now works for the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan center that tracks campaign fundraising. He suggested we look back at the 1980 race.

The Federal Election Commission dug up a report for us that showed that Reagan outraised Carter in the primary: $28.3 million to $19.6 million, which includes some federal matching funds. For the general election, both candidates participated in public campaign financing, said Georgetown government professor Clyde Wilcox in an email.

""Carter’s popularity was low, and he had just won a divided primary election against Kennedy,"" said Wilcox. ""Reagan faced a number of competitors in a divisive context that lasted months. So it makes sense that he raised more money.""

An FEC press release about political party spending for the 1980 election stated that ""Republican Party committees at the national, state and local levels spent almost five times as much money as their Democratic counterparts.""

1996: Clinton vs. Dole

FEC records for the 1996 presidential race show Dole raised $44.9 million, while Clinton raised $42.5 million during the primaries, which included public matching funds. But Dole was at a disadvantage, because he had to spend money to fend off primary challengers, while Clinton faced no Democratic challengers. They both took a federal grant of about $62 million for the general election.

The Republican national, state and local party committees outraised the Democrats in hard money, and Republican national party committees also raised more than the Democrats in soft money, about $138 million to $124 million.

But most of that money didn’t go to the presidential race, said Wilcox. (Soft money allowed donors to bypass contribution limits. See the FEC description about soft money.)

""All of Clinton’s money went against Dole,"" Wilcox said. ""Most of Dole’s money went against his GOP rivals.""

Fundraising totals don’t tell the full story, though. It’s also important to look at the amount of cash candidates had on hand close to Election Day. By that measure, Clinton was far ahead: He had $31 million in the bank 20 days before the election, while Dole had $16.7 million, the Miami Herald reported in 1996.

Comparing numbers doesn’t tell the full story

Just as it’s not a simple exercise of comparing numbers for the 1980 and 1996 races, it’s also not simple to look at fundraising for the general election of 2012.

Obama’s side is ahead so far. But Republicans have gained momentum, and with multi-millionaire donors and super PACs in the mix, the final tally won’t be known for months. Obama and Romney are both forgoing public financing.

""It is not really fair to compare the publicly funded races to what we have now,"" said Brendan Glavin, data manager for the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes campaign spending.

""The Reagan-Carter race was publicly funded evenly on both sides. The money that Reagan raised was nearly all spent in the primary race against George Bush,"" he said. ""Similarly, Carter was fighting off a challenge from Ted Kennedy. Also, at that time the distinction between primary and general election was stronger. George Bush dropped out of the race in late May 1980 and the convention was in mid July.""

Obama is technically wrong, said University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato, but the fundraising landscape is different.

""You are really operating under a very different -- maybe completely different -- campaign finance universe,"" Sabato said. ""That doesn’t make his statement right. If he had said he’d be the first president under the new system of campaign finance to be outspent in his re-election campaign that would be right.""

Sabato, who predicts election outcomes on his Crystal Ball website, said he doesn’t know for certain that Obama will be outraised but predicts that he will be outraised by ""sizable margins"" due to the super PACs.

In both the 1980 and 1996 races, the fundraising difference wasn’t that significant, Sabato said.

""Yes, Reagan outspent Carter, but that had nothing to do with Carter’s loss. Carter’s loss was about two recessions, the economy and the Iranian hostage crisis,"" Sabato said.

And the 1996 race doesn’t account for the labor movement’s work, which is off the books. Their get-out-the-vote efforts benefited Democrats.

""Clinton consistently led by a mile in the polls -- it was good economy, peace. There was never any question Clinton was going to win,"" Sabato said.

Sabato told us if we compare those earlier races to Obama-Romney in 2012, we’re not quite comparing apples and oranges, but we are comparing oranges and tangerines.

Our ruling

Obama was wrong to suggest that there hadn’t been other presidents in modern history to be outraised in their re-elections. Looking at numbers alone, Carter and Clinton fall into that category. But what we are comparing is  primary races then with total fundraising for the general election now.

We think 1980 and 1996 certainly fall under ""modern history,"" but the campaign finance picture has changed dramatically since then, and there are important caveats to those races. Those earlier races involved public financing -- this time Obama and Romney are forgoing those dollars.

Trump correct about video showing flag desecration by man who rushed him
","The American flag has always been an important backdrop to U.S. politics. And now it has been raised as an issue in the Donald Trump campaign, after 22-year-old Thomas DiMassimo jumped a barrier and rushed the stage March 12 at a Trump event in Dayton, Ohio. DiMassimo was promptly arrested. The DiMassimo incident and its aftermath captured much of the weekend news cycle amid concerns over repeated confrontations between pro- and anti-Trump factions. On NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd noted that after the Dayton rally, Trump tweeted a video that purportedly showed DiMassimo posing with a gun against the backdrop of an ISIS flag, with Arabic-language music playing in the background. Trump was referring to a video that, as it turns out, had been posted on YouTube in order to troll DiMassimo. PolitiFact previously looked at Trump’s DiMassimo-ISIS claim and rated it False. But Trump also made another point -- that DiMassimo had desecrated a U.S. flag. And, Trump said, there was a video to prove it. ""He was walking, dragging the American flag on the ground like it was a piece of garbage,"" Trump told Todd. ""I don’t like that, and a lot of people don’t like that."" PolitiFact decided to check this claim as well. DiMassimo has numerous Atlanta connections. His mother works as manager of Atlanta’s infrastructure bond program, and his father is a metro area teacher. Cartersville attorney Lester Tate is representing the family and helped Thomas DiMassimo, who was released from jail the same day he was charged, retain an attorney in Ohio. Tate declined to comment when contacted for this fact-check. DiMassimo did not respond to an email request for comment. According to news reports, YouTube videos and his own Facebook page, DiMassimo has a history of using flag desecration as a form of protest. He ripped up a Confederate Flag at a Stone Mountain protest last year. One video, titled ""Not My Flag"" and uploaded by YouTube user ""Tommy DiMassimo,"" shows DiMassimo taking part in a protest at Wright State University, where he was a student, in April 2015. The video shows him dragging a U.S. flag behind him and ultimately standing on it. The video had been viewed more than 311,000 times as of this fact-check. It had 270 likes and more than 2,300 dislikes. Mistreating the flag is an incendiary topic. There have been attempts to ban the practice throughout U.S. history, but it is not illegal, even to the point of damaging or destroying a flag. According to U.S. law, ""desecration"" of the flag applies to ""whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States."" The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Texas vs. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), and reaffirmed in U.S. vs. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990), that it is unconstitutional for a government to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as symbolic speech. Text accompanying the DiMassimo video states the demonstration was held to support Valdosta State University student Eric Sheppard, who was arrested for bringing a gun on campus during a protest at the Georgia school. Sheppard also desecrated a U.S. flag in that protest. In the video of the Wright State University demonstration, a counter-protester confronts DiMassimo and the other protesters. The man is carrying a U.S. flag on a pole across his shoulder. ""You need to learn respect,"" yells the man, who then references U.S. deaths in the Vietnam War. ""I’ve got 58,000 of my brothers who died for this flag."" One of the protesters yells, ""You know what this stands for?"" At that point, DiMassimo, who is standing on a U.S. flag, yells:  ""Racism, capitalism, imperialism."" Our ruling Trump said Thomas DiMassimo had desecrated a U.S. flag by ""dragging the American flag on the ground like it was a piece of garbage."" He is correct. A YouTube video posted by DiMassimo shows him dragging a flag on the ground and later standing on it. This is offensive to many, but legal under the First Amendment. We rate Trump’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7D7500>],/factchecks/2016/mar/17/donald-trump/trump-correct-about-video-showing-flag-desecration/
"['Children', 'California', 'Anthony Rendon']","
Mostly True: California has restored only a fraction of $1 billion-plus in child care cuts
"," For California’s new Assembly speaker, Anthony Rendon, winning more state budget funding for child care is deeply personal. Before his election to the Legislature, Rendon ran a nonprofit that helped provide child care to thousands of Los Angeles County kids. Now, he wants young children and their families to be part of the ‘California comeback.’ Surging tax revenue has allowed the state to put aside billions of dollars in reserves and regain financial stability in recent years. Rendon, a Democrat from Los Angeles County, has said it’s now time to fully restore the deep funding cuts that weakened California’s early childhood education programs, such as subsidized child care. ""I was the executive director of a Head Start and Early Childhood Education organization when this state cut about $1.3 billion in child care (during the recession),"" Rendon said during a news conference at the Capitol on March 7th, shortly after being sworn in as the state’s 70th Assembly Speaker. ""We’ve only reinvested about $300 million,"" Rendon continued. ""So we’re nowhere close to where we were. We have more kids now than ever before. … We need to invest in our families."" It’s not the first time Rendon has used child care to argue for greater state budget investments. In January of this year, he told reporters: ""We’ve cut about $1.2 billion out of child care and I think we need to put that money back in. We’ve gotten about a quarter of the way in terms of restoring those funds. But restoring more funds to early childhood education is something that’s very important to me."" Taking a more conservative approach, Gov. Jerry Brown has declined to restore social service funding as rapidly as many Democrats in the Legislature would like. But in recent budgets, the four-term Democratic governor has agreed to pour hundreds of millions of dollars back into programs slashed during the recession. That made us wonder, was Rendon right when he said the state has reinvested just $300 million in child care? Or has California done more? We decided to check the facts.  Assembly Member Eduardo Garcia, left, congratulates Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon on his inauguration March 7, 2016. Andrew Nixon / Capital Public Radio Our research First, it’s important to define what’s meant by ‘child care.’ For lawmakers and budget analysts at the Capitol, and for early education advocates across the state, ‘child care’ is a huge umbrella term. It includes subsidized child care programs for infants and toddlers of low-income working parents and preschool for older children.  There’s no debate that California slashed more than $1 billion in funds for these programs during the recession. Those cuts eliminated child care and preschool for tens of thousands of working families. Cuts to child care alone totaled nearly $1.1 billion between the fiscal years of 2007-08 to 2011-12, according to budget estimates from the Legislative Analyst’s Office. That’s not quite the $1.3 billion that Rendon stated this month, but it’s close. When looking at reinvestments in the child care system as a whole, the state has put back more than $578 million, according to the Department of Finance, which is part of the Brown Administration. Taking a more narrow look at what can be defined as child care, Brown’s finance team said the state has still pumped more than $450 million back. Both figures are far more than Rendon’s $300 million reinvestment total. We asked Rendon to explain his number. His spokesman said Rendon was speaking strictly about child care services, not preschool. Of the $1.1 billion in child care cuts, under this strict view, the state has reinvested a figure matching Rendon’s total -- $303 million -- over the past two fiscal years in childcare programs, according to budget estimates from the Legislative Analyst’s Office. That figure, however, excludes $151 million reinvested under a preschool category that Brown’s finance team described as ""wraparound child care,"" which gives preschool students a full day of care. An independent expert we spoke with said it was strange that Rendon would ignore the preschool component, but agreed it was possible he was using the much stricter definition of child care funding. One advocate for early childhood education suggested Rendon may have been highlighting the fact that while California has made ""huge strides"" in investing in preschool, it’s not done the same for child care. ""It’s a tale of two different parts of the system when you think about what’s been put back in,"" said Erin Gabel, deputy director of First 5 California, a state commission that advocates for health and education programs for children up to the age of 5. With the push to provide preschool for all of California’s eligible four year olds, state preschool funding has more than tripled from the recession to the current fiscal year, according to budget figures. Gabel said child care programs for children under age 2, meanwhile, have seen ""almost no restoration"" from cuts during the recession. While there are questions about the numbers Rendon used, experts we contacted agreed that Rendon is correct that California ""is nowhere close"" to restoring all the child care funds cut during the recession. Our ruling California Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said recently that the state cut $1.3 billion in child care programs during the recession and has reinvested only $300 million since. His spokesman told us Rendon was speaking strictly about child care programs, not preschool funding. Experts agree that more than $1 billion was cut to the child care system. An analysis of budget data shows the total cut from just child care programs was closer to $1.1 billion, a bit less than Rendon’s total. A very strict look at how much has been reinvested shows California put back $303 million of that $1.1 billion just to child care programs. The state Department of Finance, however, says the total is more than $450 million because some preschool funding actually pays for child care. We believe this is an important point for those who crunch budget numbers at the Capitol. But we don’t feel it’s enough to say Rendon was intending to deceive the general public. We rate his statement Mostly True because it’s accurate but needs clarification and additional information.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE58200>],/factchecks/2016/mar/17/anthony-rendon/claim-california-has-restored-only-fraction-1-bill/

Sen. Blunt overstates White House policy's impact on coal jobs
","Supporters of the coal industry have criticized President Barack Obama’s administration as it attempts to establish stricter environmental regulations on coal-fired plants in the U.S. The Clean Power Plan is the administration’s latest initiative to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency proposes restrictions on coal-fired plants to reduce carbon emissions. On Feb. 9 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Clean Power Plan would not be allowed to go into effect until the court is able to hear arguments from those who support and oppose the plan. Before that ruling, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt spoke out against the Clean Power Plan in a January press release. Blunt said: ""The administration’s regulatory assault on coal-fired energy has put thousands of Americans out of work, and threatens to double utility costs for Missouri families by 2020."" We decided to look into that statement. Employment in the coal industry Employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows jobs in coal were declining well before Obama took office in 2009. Coal mining employment has been dropping since 1985.  There are a number of market factors contributing to the long downturn, including technological innovation, investments in natural gas and renewable energy. PolitiFact has reported on the Obama administration’s impact on the coal industry before and found coal has been losing to natural gas for a while now. Natural gas attracts companieslooking for cheaper, cleaner and more efficient energy. Employment in the coal industry has declined faster since Obama’s first term, but Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute, a group that receives significant funding from labor unions, says regulations adopted by the administration so far probably only had a marginal effect. Instead, the decline has to do more with cheaper natural gas. ""More than anything to me, they’re just sort of locking in the coal declines that were originally caused by the decline in natural gas prices,"" Bivens said. ""The single biggest factor in the decline of the coal sector over the past decade has been the big fall in the price of natural gas."" Bivens added that if the Clean Power Plan goes into effect, he expects jobs in the coal industry to decline further. Electric bills We can’t fact-check a prediction, so Blunt’s assertion about the doubling of utility costs is beyond the scope of this fact-check. But we did look into the source behind his forecast. Blunt spokesman Brian Hart pointed us to this study on behalf of a group of Midwest utilities and regulators.  We found two significant issues. First, the study says Missouri electricity bills could possibly double by 2030, not 2020. Second, the study was conducted in 2009, but Obama and the EPA didn’t actually propose the Clean Power Plan until 2015. The methodologies used to conduct the study aren’t consistent with Obama’s current environmental proposal. But we did find a study from the U.S. Environmental Information Administration that specifically breaks down how the Clean Power Plan will affect electrical utilities. That agency predicts electricity prices will rise slightly in the early 2020s. Prices will differ across the country, but the highest rise in prices is predicted to be 7 percent. Our ruling Blunt said the Obama administration’s regulations have caused thousands of workers in the coal industry to lose their jobs. While the decline in coal industry employment is real, the role of administration policy is less certain. Experts note that competition from abundant, cheap natural gas has reduced the demand for coal more than any other factor. With less demand, the need for workers falls. While the administration has encouraged movement away from coal for environmental reasons, market forces in the energy sector have been the dominant driver. While it is impossible to know how utility costs will rise or fall in the future, the study on which Blunt based his claims was conducted before the Clean Power Plan was enacted. Blunt’s claim overemphasizes the role of White House policy. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA23780>],/factchecks/2016/mar/17/roy-blunt/sen-blunt-overstates-white-house-policys-impact-co/

Ted Cruz pins too much blame for outflow of jobs on Barack Obama
","One of the biggest topics in the 2016 presidential election has been how to reverse the loss of American jobs to other countries. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz blamed President Barack Obama for the outflow of jobs. The topic came up after host Chuck Todd played a clip of Obama saying the Republicans are significantly to blame for the angry tone of politics today. Cruz responded, ""You know, Chuck, Barack Obama's a world-class demagogue. That language there is designed to divide us. No, Mr. President, we're not angry at that. We're angry at politicians in Washington, including you, who ignore the men and women who elected you, who have been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years."" The part of Cruz’s comment that caught our eye was that Obama has ""been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years."" We decided to take a look. (Cruz’s staff did not respond to inquiries.) We found that Cruz has a point that the United States has seen jobs go overseas during the seven years that Obama has been in office. However, this pattern was well under way before Obama became president -- and the trend has little to do with policy choices a president can make. We will start by noting that there are two related but distinct reasons why jobs may move overseas. One is when foreign companies become competitive enough to sell their products in the United States, displacing American producers. The other occurs when American companies move their own production to subcontractors overseas. We will also note that there is no single data source that provides specific numbers of jobs flowing overseas. We did find a couple of studies that touched on this subject; however, each has drawbacks. One source of data is the National Organizations Survey, a pilot study of U.S. businesses and nonprofits described in a paper by Clair Brown of the University of California-Berkeley, Timothy Sturgeon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Connor Cole of the University of Michigan. The survey was conducted in 2010, meaning that it captured a snapshot in time, rather than a study of changes over time. The survey found that about 23 percent of full-time employees worked at organizations that do international outsourcing, meaning that they either had such duties as sales, research, transportation and customer service handled by a part of the company based in another country, or by contracting with an overseas company to handle those tasks. According to the study, about a third of full-time employees with large organizations worked for one doing international outsourcing; for smaller organizations, the rate was smaller, less than 10 percent. Sectors where international offshoring has been especially noticeable include electronics and motor vehicles. That said, ""for the typical U.S. employee’s organization, the majority of costs continue to be in the United States,"" the authors concluded. The other study does show changes over time, though it’s worth noting that it was published by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning group that has taken a hard line against the flow of American jobs overseas. The Economic Policy Institute study found that between 2001 and 2013, a growing U.S. trade deficit with China ""eliminated or displaced 3.2 million U.S. jobs,"" of which 2.4 million were in manufacturing. ""These lost manufacturing jobs account for about two-thirds of all U.S. manufacturing jobs lost or displaced between December 2001 and December 2013,"" the paper concluded. Here’s a summary of their findings:  Experts we contacted agreed that a significant shift has been going on. ""The U.S. economy and many others have been going through wrenching changes for many decades, due to a combination of technological change, globalization, and loss of union power,"" said Sturgeon, a senior researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Industrial Performance Center. Sturgeon pointed to research by Margaret McMillan at Tufts University that looked at data between 1990 and 2005 and found that a key reason for these trends is ""rapid increases in trade"" between the United States and China. In a paper, McMillan and three co-authors found that Chinese employment growth has been largest in U.S. industries that have experienced employment declines, suggesting that Chinese workers are being substituted for U.S. workers. She also found that the share of workers performing ""routine occupations"" in the United States declined as the share increased in China, with these shifts correlated across industries."" But while Cruz has a point that jobs have indeed been shifting overseas under Obama, the previous chart shows a distinct problem with Cruz’s contention: The way Cruz phrased it, it sounds like it started under Obama, and that simply isn’t the case. ""Most of the advanced economies of the world have long moved into a new, postindustrial phase of development,"" wrote Dani Rodrik of Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government in a November 2015 paper. ""These economies have been deindustrializing for decades, a trend that is particularly noticeable when one looks at the employment share of manufacturing. … In the United States, manufacturing industries’ share of total employment has steadily fallen since the 1950s, coming down from around a quarter of the workforce to less than a tenth today."" (We looked at this question previously here.) Indeed, in February 2003, the cover of a special issue of BusinessWeek magazine asked, ""Is Your Job Next? A new round of globalization is sending upscale jobs offshore. They include chip design, engineering, basic research -- even financial analysis. Can America lose these jobs and still prosper?"" That was about six years before Obama took office. In fact, when PolitiFact asked McMillan whether this pattern predates Obama, she emailed back, ""Hell yes,"" followed by 12 exclamation points. In her paper, McMillan wrote that employment declined modestly in the 1990s in such labor-intensive industries as textiles and became ""precipitous"" with the advent of the Internet in the late 1990s. She finds that both technological advancements and a growing role for an overseas labor force played a role. The ability to conduct work overseas ""has led to fundamental reorganization of the global supply chain, with detrimental effects on domestic manufacturing workers and surging corporate profits,"" she wrote. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment between 1987 and 2015 -- starting 22 years before Obama took office -- can be seen in the following graph:  So jobs have clearly been moving overseas for many years, even if the trend predated Obama and occurred for reasons other than his policies. Still, it’s worth making a few additional observations: • Manufacturing jobs have been increasing under Obama. While the rise in manufacturing jobs under Obama hasn’t come close to wiping out the declines of previous decades, the number has risen rather than fallen since 2010 -- the first sustained increase since at least the 1990s. There is at least anecdotal evidence of ""onshoring"" -- the return of jobs to the United States. For instance, 177 ""foreign-trade zones"" -- special manufacturing and assembly facilities located in the United States -- serve more than 3,000 companies, employ 390,000 workers and handled $835 billion in merchandise, almost two-thirds of it domestically sourced, according to the National Association of Foreign-Trade Zones. • Along with job losses, there have been job gains. Overall, productivity has been improving in the United States. ""Specific industries and job categories have been hard hit, sometimes very much so,"" Sturgeon said. At the same time, many are benefiting, including ""in ways they may not even notice, such as new types of work and jobs, greater product variety and lower prices."" Sturgeon is among those who argue that Cruz’s answer is too simplistic. ""The debate right now is playing to people’s fears and discontent in ways that are nearly devoid of fact or serious consideration of the trade-offs or remedies,"" he said. Where it comes to Obama’s role, he said, ""this is a broad structural issue and not something Obama invented or could do much to change, or even do much to mitigate with an uncooperative Congress."" Our ruling Cruz said that Obama has ""been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years."" While the pattern has been occurring under Obama, it is hardly new or unique to Obama. We rate the statement. Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE48800>],/factchecks/2016/mar/16/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-pins-too-much-blame-outflow-jobs-barack-o/

Ted Cruz levels flawed claim about Donald Trump opposing efforts to defund Planned Parenthood
","In a TV ad, conservative pastor James Dobson tells viewers that Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has the support of thousands of likeminded pastors thanks to his unwavering support for ""the sanctity of human life and traditional marriage."" In the ad, which Cruz’s campaign mostly ran in Iowa in advance of the 2016 presidential caucuses, Dobsonthen turns his attention to others vying for the Republican presidential nod. ""After Donald Trump and Marco Rubio announced they would accept the Supreme Court’s ruling on gay marriage, we knew we could not support them,"" Dobson said. Dobson goes on: ""Our decision was confirmed when they,"" Trump and Rubio, ""opposed Senator Cruz’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood."" His gay marriage comment rang a bell. Rubio, the Florida senator, and Trump, the New York businessman, each called the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage the law of the land while Cruz insisted in June 2015 that states not singled out in the ruling didn’t have to comply, which we found Mostly False. We focused on Dobson’s closing claim: Did Rubio and Trump each oppose Cruz’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood? This seemed unlikely. Republican efforts to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, limited already to family planning and non-abortion health services, gained steam last summer when videos secretly shot by an anti-abortion group purported to show Planned Parenthood officials selling fetal tissue for a profit, a conclusion that hasn’t factually borne out. Cruz’s efforts extended to a failed September 2015 attempt to stop Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s plan to fund the government unless, Cruz said, Congress amended the agreement in a way that would defund Planned Parenthood. This ad first aired in November 2015 and then throughout December and January leading up to the Iowa caucuses. A version captured in video online by the Political TV Ad Archive, however, shows Dobson mentioning Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, as a reason for GOP voters to elect Cruz. We checked with Internet Archive, the database that manages these ads, on how that could be possible. According to the Television Archive’s managing editor, Nancy Watzman, the Scalia mention was most likely added to the original ad, before this version began airing after the justice’s death Feb. 13, 2016.   Asked about the basis of the Rubio-Trump claim, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email that ""Trump has said he’s against defunding Planned Parenthood, and Rubio missed the votes to defund Planned Parenthood."" Where was Marco? According to news accounts, Rubio indeed missed two votes on defunding Planned Parenthood, both of which Rubio called ""show votes."" Rubio was at a Florida campaign fundraiser at the time of a Sept. 28, 2015, cloture vote on McConnell’s plan to fund the government. He then missed a Sept. 30, 2015, vote on final passage of that plan. News stories and Senate records otherwise indicate that from August 2015 through December 2015, the Senate voted at least five times on defunding Planned Parenthood. Set aside the votes Rubio missed, the records show, and Rubio and Cruz each voted three times to defund. Yet we didn’t spot any instance of Rubio opposing defunding, though that judgment doesn’t take into account Rubio’s absence from the Senate the day that all but one Republican colleague of Cruz didn’t go along with the Texan’s move to reject McConnell’s government funding plan until it defunded Planned Parenthood. Cruz's September song In September 2015, Cruz was one of the last hold-outs on McConnell’s government funding plan, which included an extension of Planned Parenthood funding. In one of his last moves protesting the funding bill, Cruz called for -- and failed to get -- a roll call vote or a voice vote to register Republicans’ positions on the final plan. Cruz said later that denying him the vote was a way for his colleagues to avoid accountability. Republicans in the Senate, Politico reported, loudly yelled ""no"" when Cruz called for a voice vote, a resounding rejection for what was described as typically an uncomplicated procedural matter. The only Senate colleague to back Cruz in his last-ditch effort was Mike Lee of Utah. This all took place on Sept. 28, 2015, when Rubio was absent, and shortly before the funding bill was finalized, which kept the government running and eliminated the possibility of defunding Planned Parenthood in the immediate future. Rubio camp's response Cruz has attacked Rubio’s record on this matter before. At the Faith and Family Presidential Forum at Bob Jones University Feb. 12, 2016, Cruz told voters that Rubio didn’t want to use Congress’ ""constitutional authority to defund Planned Parenthood,"" Politico reported, quoting Cruz saying: ""Marco Rubio has spoken out about Planned Parenthood. But when these videos came out I stood with millions of Americans calling on Republican leadership to use the power of Congress to defund Planned Parenthood and to cut off the money. And Marco stood up and said: 'No, we shouldn't.’"" At the time, Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told Politico that Cruz was ""making things up."" On the other hand, a Sept. 17, 2015, Politico news story said Rubio had refused to sign a letter circulated by Cruz urging McConnell not to advance government funding without an end to Planned Parenthood aid. In a Sept. 27, 2015 interview with NPR News, Rubio said he wouldn’t ""prefer to see it (the government) shut down."" He said, ""I don't think there is any single organization in the country that's worth shutting the government down over,"" but he also laid the blame for a potential shutdown on Democrats for insisting on funding Planned Parenthood. When we asked the Rubio campaign about the claim in the Cruz ad, spokesman Jahan Wilcox sent a press release the campaign initially distributed Feb. 12, 2016, the day of Cruz’s speech at Bob Jones University. The release said Rubio has cosponsored legislation to defund Planned Parenthood and has ""always"" voted to do so. The Rubio release offered specific votes: Rubio’s Dec. 3, 2015, vote to defund Planned Parenthood in a reconciliation bill, his Sept. 24, 2015 vote for a funding bill that defunded Planned Parenthood, his Aug. 3, 2015 vote to defund Planned Parenthood, and his co-sponsorship of that bill. Anti-abortion group We also reached out to National Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, to seek its perspective on Cruz’s claims. (The group hasn’t endorsed a presidential candidate.) By email, we fielded a comment from its president, Carol Tobias, saying Rubio had voted to defund Planned Parenthood even before Cruz joined the Senate; she pointed out a roll call on H. Con. Res. 36, April 14, 2011. Tobias also said that since Cruz joined the Senate in 2013, ""both he and Sen. Rubio have voted the same on every roll call that National Right to Life regards as pertinent to defunding Planned Parenthood. To suggest that Sen. Rubio voted wrong or missed meaningful votes on the Planned Parenthood issue is inaccurate and misleading."" Trump supported Cruz's push at first As for Trump, National Right to Life pointed out his lack of a congressional voting record. We asked Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks,  about Cruz’s claim. Hicks said by email: ""Mr. Trump has always stated he will defund"" Planned Parenthood ""as long as abortions are taking place, but believes the women's health services like cancer screenings for cervical and breast cancers are essential to millions of women across the country."" That seems to represent the progression of Trump’s position on the matter. As well documented, Trump favored abortion rights earlier in his life. At the first GOP presidential debate Aug. 6, 2015, Trump said he had had a change of heart after a friend decided not to get an abortion, and he saw that child grow up. News stories show that in August 2015, Trump supported Cruz’s unsuccessful push to shut down the government unless Congress defunded Planned Parenthood. But Trump shortly backtracked, saying he would look at the ""good aspects"" of the organization. And in October 2015, Trump told Fox News he wouldn’t shut down the government over Planned Parenthood though he also said the organization should ""absolutely be defunded."" On Meet the Press Feb. 21, 2016, Trump said he wouldn’t fund Planned Parenthood ""as long as they’re doing abortions."" In the same interview he said that his friends, who are women, ""understand Planned Parenthood better"" than he ever would. At the Feb. 25, 2016 Republican presidential debate, Trump said: ""Millions and millions of women — cervical cancer, breast cancer — are helped by Planned Parenthood. So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly,"" but that he also ""wouldn’t fund it."" Our ruling Dobson said in Cruz’s ad that Trump and Rubio opposed Cruz’s ""efforts to defund Planned Parenthood."" In the narrowest way, you could say Rubio opposed Cruz’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood by expressing misgivings about holding the government hostage to funding of a particular organization. But that's also misleading. Rubio, like Cruz, otherwise repeatedly voted to defund. Trump, meantime, expressed support at the time for Cruz’s efforts. He later reversed course on that but he's been clear lately about wishing to defund so long as the group provides abortions. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Hillary Clinton says guns exceed next nine categories as leading cause of death for young black men
","In a speech posted on Medium, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a striking statistic about gun violence and minority youth. ""Gun violence,"" she wrote, ""is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined."" We wondered whether this is correct, so we took a closer look. We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014.   Rank Cause of death Number of deaths Number gun-related 1st Homicide 2,416 2,256 2nd Unintentional injuries 1,135 47 3rd Suicide 448 230 4th Heart disease 172 -- 5th Cancer 161 -- 6th HIV 52 -- 7th Chronic lower respiratory diseases 47 -- 8th Congenital anomalies 38 -- 9th Anemia 33 -- 10th Diabetes 33 -- Total, 2nd through 9th place -- 2,119 -- So even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton’s statement correct. If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further. There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns. We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases. That said, we think Clinton’s definition of ""young"" as 15-24 is a reasonable one. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined."" As long as you define ""young"" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton’s statement is accurate, according to CDC data.

Emma Watson: More lives are lost due to gender discrimination than in all 20th century wars
","Violence against women resulted in more deaths than all the wars and conflicts of the past century combined, according to actress Emma Watson. As part of her work as an United Nations Women Goodwill ambassador, Watson recently launched a feminist book club, Our Shared Self, and spoke with feminist icon Gloria Steinem in London. Beyond revelations about Watson’s similarity to Hermione, her new hairdo and her research into female sexual pleasure, the Harry Potter star also shared a statistic that ""blindsided"" her from the book, Sex & World Peace. (""The two things we want, right?"" quipped Steinem.)   ""There are now 101.3 men to every 100 women on the planet. So women are no longer half of humanity,"" Watson said on Feb. 24. ""I’m quoting the book here but it says, ‘More lives are lost from violence against women, sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, suicide, egregious maternal mortality, and other sex-linked causes than were lost during all of the wars and civil strife of 20th century.’ "" ""So from this perspective,"" she continued, ""The greatest security dilemma then is systematic, social devaluation of female life. I’d never come across a statistic like this. I had not understood that we were literally affecting the balance of the population of the world."" That’s a startling statistic, and we wondered if it was grounded in fact. Looking at the available data, Watson has a point that the devaluation of female life leads to a staggering amount of lost lives. However, it’s not clear that those lost lives are higher than the number of war and conflict deaths in the 20th century. The numbers are comparable, but some estimates find the number of war deaths as slightly higher. The comparison We didn’t hear back from Watson or UN Women, but we did speak with Sex & World Peace’s author, Valerie Hudson, who’s a professor of international affairs at Texas A&M University. Hudson walked us through how she crunched the numbers and shared a chart from her 2009 study comparing the deaths due to conflict and deaths due to sex-selective causes:  Hudson told us she tallied up the death tolls of 53 wars, conflicts and authoritarian regimes for a total of 152.75 million lives. She then compared that number to the number of ""missing women."" This concept, developed by Nobel-winning economist and philosopher Amartya Sen in 1990s, uses abnormal male-to-female ratios to determine how many women would be alive in a specific year or time period if they weren’t aborted, neglected or victims of inequality. For example, in 2005, the sex ratio in India was 107.5 males per 100 females. The normal sex ratio for a stable population is about 98 to 100.3 males per 100 females. (Women tend to live longer under equal circumstances.) This means that there was a 6.7 percent to 9 percent shortfall in India’s female population, equal to roughly 36 million to 49 million missing women. Hudson used the UN Population Fund’s estimate of 163 million missing women in Asia in 2005 — 10 million more than lives lost to 20th century conflicts. But these figures aren’t the only estimates out there. Conflict deaths Let’s state off the bat that there are many difficulties with tallying up both how many women should exist but don’t, as well as how many lives were lost in all of the last century’s civil strife and wars. Any estimate of missing women only works on the assumption that the skewed sex ratio is a result of discrimination. Similarly, while the specific number of casualties in World War I or under Khmer Rouge are reported, estimates for deaths in little-known conflicts like the one between Islamic separatists in the Philippines and the government are murky or nonexistent. That being said, the estimates we found besides Hudson’s do not show female deaths eclipsing the conflict death of the 20th century. Nonetheless, the numbers for sex-linked deaths are still considerable. Hudson’s number for conflict deaths (153 million) is a bit low. Most other tallies pin the total death toll somewhere around 200 million: Source Death toll Rummel, 2011 At least 169.2 million* White, 2010 203 million Brzezinski, 2010 170 million Leitenberg, 2006 225.5 to 237.5 million Bassiouni, 1996 203 million Average 201.9 million (*We did not include Rummel’s 169.2 million estimate in calculating the average, because the figure refers only to democides, or government-inflicted deaths, and does not include war casualties or famines associated with regime mismanagement.) Hudson’s missing women figure, meanwhile, appears to be an outlier when compared to other estimates: Source Number of missing women Year Bongaarts and Guilmoto, 2015 150 million worldwide 2035 Bongaarts and Guilmoto, 2015 126 million worldwide 2010 UN Population Fund, 2012 117 million worldwide 2010 Anderson and Ray, 2010 86 million in China, India and sub-Saharan Africa 2000s UN Population Fund, 2005 (Hudson’s source) 163 million worldwide in Asia 2005 Hesketh and Zhu, 2006 67 million to 92 million in 8 Asian countries 2001 Klasen and Wink, 2003 102 million to 113 million worldwide 1990s Klasen and Wink, 2001 65 million to 107 million worldwide 1990s The war on women Experts we spoke with expressed the toll of gendercide with more tempered, and more accurate, comparisons than Hudson’s and Watson’s. ""The number of missing females is undoubtedly of a larger order than recent demographic catastrophes such as World War II, the Chinese Famine, the HIV-aids epidemics, etc.,"" said Christophe Guilmoto, a demographer and author of several UN reports on the issue. ""There are more missing women today than died in the two World Wars of the 20th century,"" said Stephan Klasen, a professor of development economics at the University of Göttingen. While none of the missing women estimates top the 20th century’s conflict death toll, they’re a ""stock measure,"" which quantifies the impact of gender inequality in survival for generations that are currently alive, according to Klasen. ""(A missing women estimate) does not count those women and girls who died from discrimination decades ago and would have, by now, died from other causes,"" Klasen said. If you tallied up all the missing women of the 20th century, ""the number would be well over 200 million,"" said Siwan Anderson, a University of British Columbia professor who specializes in development and gender economics. Since the 1970s, the number of missing women has risen and is expected to peak in 2035. There are no signs that skewed sex ratios have normalized even as we’ve normalized violence against women, Hudson told us. ""We silo it off as ‘stuff that happens between men and women’ and do not count it as ‘stuff that happens to human beings,"" she said. ""What an incredible level of impunity for a crime committed against a human being, just because that human being has two X chromosomes."" Our ruling Watson said, ""More lives are lost from violence against women, sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, suicide, egregious maternal mortality, and other sex-linked causes than were lost during all of the wars and civil strife of 20th century."" The claim comes from the book Sex and World Peace by Valerie Hudson, who was citing a UN figure of 163 million missing women in 2005. That’s 10 million more than her estimate of lives lost in all of last century’s strife, 153 million. But this is using a high estimate for the first measure and a low estimate for the second. The number of sex-related deaths, which varies from year to year, typically falls within 100 million to 130 million range. The number of deaths due to war, according to most other estimates, is about 200 million. Both numbers are disturbingly high, but it’s not clear that one is definitively higher than the other.   With this caveat, we rate Watson’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB71240>],/factchecks/2016/mar/15/emma-watson/emma-watson-more-lives-are-lost-due-gender-discrim/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'North Carolina', 'Taxes', 'Pat McCrory']","
McCrory right that Cooper lacks a plan for paying but overstates what Cooper wants to pay for
","A week before North Carolina’s Democratic primary for governor, N.C. Attorney General Roy Cooper unveiled his eight-point plan for public education, including proposals for Pre-K programs, child care tax credits, literacy programs, teacher pay and college affordability. It was that last part that caught the eye of Republican Gov. Pat McCrory’s administration. The next day, McCrory released a statement bashing Cooper and trying to tie him to former Gov. Bev Perdue. McCrory lost to Perdue in 2008 but won the governor’s office in 2012 after Perdue, facing low popularity numbers, decided not to seek re-election. ""Just like Bev Perdue, Roy Cooper won't say how he will pay for ‘free’ college tuition,"" McCrory said in a Facebook post. That claim and ones like it have since been repeated often by the McCrory campaign. Perdue did indeed propose free tuition plans, and in their 2008 campaign McCrory criticized her for them. She shelved them just days before she was sworn in, citing the worsening recession. But we were more curious about what McCrory had to say about his current opponent. Does Cooper really propose offering free college tuition? And does he lack a plan to pay for it? Luckily, finding the answers didn't require us to go back to college for another costly degree. First, the promise of tuition The McCrory administration paints an overly broad stroke here by simply using the term ""college."" Cooper’s plan only covers community college. Cooper promises in his plan – which is available on his website – ""to design a proposal for North Carolina to offer free tuition for community college."" His plan doesn't mention anything about making four-year colleges or advanced degree programs free. Furthermore, free community college tuition is already partially in place, at least for enterprising teenagers. Anyone who’s enrolled in a public, private or home-school high school and has a B average can take community college classes for free – a program called Career and College Promise that Perdue started in 2011, with support from the Republican-led legislature. Cooper is proposing to expand the availability of free tuition to everyone, though. That’s a lot of people, but not nearly as many as if he were proposing free tuition for college in general, as McCrory implied. A plan to pay for it? The state has reported that 733,855 students took classes at the state’s 58 community college campuses in the 2014-15 school year. The North Carolina community college system calls itself the third largest in the country. It would cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year if the state paid all those students’ tuition, which is $76 per credit hour this year. But Cooper's plan says the state shouldn’t pay for 100 percent of the tuition. He proposes covering what’s left after factoring in scholarships and financial aid. Still, that’s not nothing. So what's Cooper’s plan to pay for it? McCrory said Cooper ""won't say."" And that much is true. Cooper’s plan is specific on what he wants to pay for, but not on where the money would come from. It also doesn’t provide an estimate as to how much the plan might cost. Cooper spoke to reporters after releasing his plan on March 8. According to The Associated Press, he gave a few vague ideas for paying the plan, but he mostly stressed that he wouldn't increase taxes to pay for it. Instead, he said he wanted to rework some of the recent tax changes passed by the General Assembly, but ""I'm not wedded to any particular formula."" Citing the presumably high cost of the program, McCrory campaign spokesman Ricky Diaz said Cooper ""seemingly is trying to be coy about reviving a broken promise from former governor Bev Perdue."" But just because Cooper hasn't detailed how he would pay for community college tuition doesn't mean he has no plan whatsoever. He outlines how he will put together a team to figure out the details, and what kind of benefits he thinks such a program would have. Let’s hear it, in its entirety: ""A number of states either have a free community college program or are considering offering one. The program works as a last dollar scholarship program whereby the state provides a grant to cover the remaining share of tuition and fees after Pell Grants and other financial aid and scholarships are applied. Most programs also offer mentors to help students navigate the college process on their journey toward success. As governor, I will put together a team of education partners and budgetary advisors to design a proposal for North Carolina to offer free tuition for community college. This would provide more students access to college and create opportunity for students to earn better paying jobs. Additionally it will help our state to meet our employers’ demands for educated workers and address the gap that now exists for skilled labor."" That's a start, although McCrory is right that Cooper hasn't given the public any details on how the state would pay for his plan. Our ruling McCrory's claim is overly broad, failing to distinguish between college and community college. In enrollment numbers and especially the cost of tuition, that's a massive difference. Adding the single word ""community"" might have toned down the intended rhetorical effect of the quote, but it also would've added needed context. Still, Cooper does propose offering free tuition for community college, which would cover hundreds of thousands of students statewide. He has said what the state won't pay for (the full cost of tuition) and one way he won’t pay for it (tax hikes), but it’s correct to say that Cooper does not have a specific plan – or at least one that’s publicly available – for paying for his proposal.

Donald Trump says U.S. doesn't make TVs anymore
","Editor's note: We looked at a similar claim from Trump in October 2015 and rated it Half True. (View an archive of the original report.) PolitiFact Virginia recently looked at this claim again and found convincing evidence that while companies in the United States assemble televisions from foreign parts, they don't make them. We have re-rated the statement as True and removed the older report from Trump's Truth-O-Meter record. Donald Trump, a no stranger to the small screen, says the U.S. doesn’t make television sets anymore. He made the statement during a Feb. 23 appearance at Regent University in Virginia Beach while hitting on one of his major campaign themes - that the U.S. has ""horrible, horrible"" trade deals with other nations. Trump named several countries that he said are beating the U.S. in commerce. ""Then we have South Korea, who I love,"" he said. ""I have buildings in South Korea. But they make a fortune. I buy television sets. I buy a tremendous amount of things there because we don’t make television sets anymore, folks. We’d like to make them. We used to make them. You remember Sylvania, RCA. But those days are gone."" Has the manufacturing of American-made TVs truly shut down? We asked the Trump campaign for the basis of his statement but didn’t hear back. So we began our own search for American television manufacturers and found no company that flat out says its sets are ""Made in USA."" To make that claim, the Federal Trade Commission requires that a company make ""all or virtually all"" of its product in the U.S. The rule doesn’t apply to automakers. Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, told us that just about all components for TVs - the electronics that go inside the set - are made in Asia. ""It would be impossible to manufacture a TV in the U.S. without imported parts,"" he said. With the help of Paul’s group and the Consumer Technology Association, we found three companies that - to varying degrees - assemble the components into TV sets inside the United States. Element Electronics is by far the largest. From a plant in Winnsboro, S.C., it assembles flat-screen TVs that are sold by Walmart, Target and other retail outlets. We tried three times to reach a spokesperson for the company but didn’t hear back. The Wall Street Journal reported July 17, 2014, that Element doesn’t do much assembly work at the plant. The article said assembly-line employees open boxes with TVs shipped from China, inspect the sets for damage, unscrew a plastic panel and insert a Chinese-made memory board, and conduct mechanical tests. Then the television is put back in its box and shipped to retailers. The TVs often are shipped in red, white and blue boxes that have a picture of Statue of Liberty and say ""Assembled in the USA,"" a claim Walmart has vaunted in selling the sets. But the back of many of the sets bears small print that says ""Made in China.""   A March 25, 2014, article in The Herald Independent of Winnsboro, S.C., reported that Element had an assembly quota of 1,000 sets a day. Assuming the company hit that goal every day, including weekends, Element would have shipped 365,000 TVs in 2014. That translates to about 1 percent of all the televisions sold in the U.S. that year, according to data from IHS Technology, a global business information company. The other two companies assemble expensive, niche TVs in the U.S.: Seura of Green Bay, Wis., assembles TVs with screens that turn to mirrors when the sets are turned off, and waterproof units for use outdoors or in bathrooms. A spokesman said the screens are made in the U.S. and the TVs are assembled with mostly imported  components. Seura’s televisions range in cost from $1,799 to at least $12,999, according to its website. SunBrite TV of Thousand Oaks, Calif., assembles waterproof outdoor sets that vary in price from $1,495 to $24,995, according to its website. It also makes jumbo screens that are used at Disneyland and Dodger Stadium. Company officials declined our invitations for comment. Paul told us that the two specialty companies’ sales are insignificant compared to major brands that are sold in the United States. Trump, while speaking at Regent, recalled days when the United States dominated TV manufacturing. We thought we’d take a minute to discuss the decline. Down the tube During the 1950s, there were 90 to 150 television manufacturers in the United States, and they churned out 11 million sets per year, according to a 1955 report by the now-defunct Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association. American manufacturers continued to dominate the domestic market into the 1960s, though Japanese-made TVs began to trickle in. In 1965, the United States made about 3 million color sets, while Japan produced fewer than 100,000. But companies in Japan and other Asian nations were catching up fast. Imports rose quickly during the 1970s, as U.S. makers began to move production abroad. By 1972, every major American manufacturer had established factories in developing countries, while imports from South Korea and Taiwan began to overtake those from Japan, according to a 1983 book, ""Cases in Competitive Strategy,"" written by Michael E. Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School. By 1980, just three American makers remained: the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), Zenith, and GTE-Sylvania, which stopped making consumer electronics a few years later. According to a report from the now-defunct congressional Office of Technology Assessment, 68 percent of black-and-white TVs and 13 percent of color TVs were imported in 1982, and whatever manufacturing remained largely had become assembly operations. Still, Zenith and RCA held about 40 percent of the U.S. market share. But in 1986, RCA was acquired and broken up by General Electric. Zenith, then the third-largest and last remaining American TV maker, ""gave up its battle to survive on its own"" in 1995 and was sold to the South Korean giant, LG Electronics, according to The New York Times. American-made vs. American-owned LG’s acquisition of Zenith, however, did not mean the end of all TV manufacturing in the United States. In 1995, the two largest producers - Thomson Consumer Electronics of France and Philips of the Netherlands - made TV sets in Indiana and Tennessee, respectively, according to the New York Times. American manufacturing may see a comeback yet. Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturer of Apple products that has drawn negative attention for its labor practices, is in talks to make TV displays in Arizona, according to Bloomberg. Nonetheless, two of the three largest TV makers worldwide are South Korean - Samsung and LGE - and the other, Sony, is Japanese. Together, they account for about half of the flat-screen market. Our ruling Trump said the U.S. ""doesn’t make television sets anymore."" He has a point. We know of no televisions on the market that bear the label ""Made in USA,"" a claim that requires virtually all of the product to be manufactured domestically. An expert told us it’s ""impossible"" to build a TV in the United States without relying heavily on imported components. Evidence suggests about 99 percent of sets sold in the United States are fully made and assembled overseas, mainly in Asia. Trump’s statement ignores three companies that are, to varying degrees, assembling TVs in the United States. Two of them manufacture expensive niche products such as outdoor televisions. A spokesman for one of the companies told us it makes its specialty screens in the U.S. and imports most of its components. The third company, Element Electronics, essentially imports sets, inserts Chinese-made memory boards in them, and then ships them to large retailers. The back of some of the sets say ""Made in China."" So Trump’s statement holds up and we rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7D2040>],/factchecks/2016/mar/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-doesnt-make-tvs-anymore/

Anti-gun violence group uses old data incorrectly to compare international homicide rates for women
","We see a lot of statistics about the murder rate in the United States, particularly as part of the debate over gun control. But a Facebook meme making the rounds is contending that the homicide rate for American women is more than two and a half times higher that it is for other developed countries. A reader in Utah pointed us to the meme on the page of a group called Everytown for Gun Safety, whose web page lists former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as a member of the advisory board. The reader wondered if it was accurate. We did, too.  Posted March 8, the meme reports the rates of female homicide for 25 countries. The United States' is 1.54 per 100,000 women. That's just over 2½ times the rate for the second-ranked country, Switzerland, whose rate is listed as 0.61 per 100,000. The chart does not list a source. First, a few things to note about the meme. Although Everytown is an anti-gun violence group, the meme mentions nothing about weapons. The legend at the bottom simply says the chart is listing murder rates. Also, because the headline on the meme talks about ""America's Deadly Domestic Violence Problem,"" it's not clear if the group is talking about all causes of homicide or just domestic violence homicide. The answer turns out to be neither. Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for the group, said the data come from a 2002 paper in the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association that used World Health Organization statistics on female murder rates — both gun related and non-gun related — from 1994 to 1999. The data in the Everytown meme are the rates for gun homicides, not all homicides. The rates were from 25 populous high-income countries. But when you look at all homicides — which the chart claims to be measuring — the rates are different. The United States was still No. 1, with 3.21 murders per 100,000 women during the 1990s. But the United States was not as far ahead of the rest of the pack. The rate was 1.7 times higher than No. 2 Finland and about 2.4 times higher than the countries in third, fourth and fifth place, which were Switzerland, Belgium and New Zealand respectively. ""The U.S. female homicide victimization rate was 5 times higher than the rate for the other high-income countries combined,"" said the researchers, led by David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. More recent data When we contacted Hemenway seeking newer data, he sent us a November 2015 paper done with Erin Grinshteyn of the University of Nevada-Reno, which found that the U.S. homicide rate was 7 times higher than 23 other high-income countries — 25 times higher if you only look at gun deaths. But the paper offers no breakdown by gender. It used 2010 mortality data from the World Health Organization. We contacted Grinshteyn directly, and she sent us the 2010 rates for women in more detail. We've put it in chart form.  Newer homicide estimates are available in a WHO report released in 2014. They show a similar pattern. In that ranking, female murder rates in the United States in 2012 were much higher than 22 other countries. Finland and Belgium ranked second and third, at 1.3 each, but the difference is not as dramatic as the Everytown Facebook chart. The report did not compile rates for female gun deaths. Lamb also said the group was in the process of fixing the chart, which had been shared 1,869 times when we last checked. Our ruling Everytown for Gun Safety produced a chart showing that the rate of U.S. female homicides outnumbers the rates in 24 other developed countries by more than 2½ to 1. But the rates in the chart are for gun-related homicides, not all homicides. Nor are they the rates for domestic violence deaths among women, contrary to the headline on the chart. Finally, the data are about two decades out of date. The relationship that caught our eye — female homicides being 2½ times more common than other developed countries — is not as extreme, according to the latest estimates, although the United States is clearly far ahead of other developed countries. The chart gets the general trend right, but most of its actual numbers are off. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7F2240>],/factchecks/2016/mar/14/everytown-gun-safety/anti-gun-group-uses-old-data-incorrectly-compare-i/

Susie Lee's wealth under fire in competitive Nevada congressional primary
","The powerful Las Vegas Culinary Workers Union may not have officially gotten involved in the Nevada presidential caucuses, but the 57,000-member union is starting to throw its weight around in down-ballot races. The union endorsed state Sen. Ruben Kihuen in the crowded Democratic primary for Nevada’s hotly contested Fourth Congressional District, and is going on the offensive against Kihuen’s biggest challenger — education advocate and philanthropist Susie Lee. The primary election is June 14. Union secretary-treasurer Geoconda Arguello-Kline asked union members in a letter sent March 9 to endorse Kihuen at the upcoming AFL-CIO state convention, and claimed that Lee is ""trying to purchase this congressional seat."" ""She has never run for office, never taken a tough vote, and frankly, doesn’t represent our values,"" Arguello-Kline wrote. ""She and her husband own 17 homes across the country and use their private jet to take vacations. She is an investor whose personal wealth comes from questionable investments in companies like Walmart, Halliburton and GEO Group (a for-profit prison company)."" Given the specificity of the those charges and the likelihood that Lee’s opponents will use her wealth as a negative over the next three months of campaigning, we wanted to see just how accurate the union is. A union spokeswoman forwarded a screenshot of an excel spreadsheet listing all of the properties owned by Lee and her husband Dan, a casino company CEO. We found the union to be correct: The couple listed 14 rentable properties in multiple states on their 60-page financial disclosure report, with a total net value between $2.2 million and $4.8 million. They also own a five-bedroom home in Las Vegas worth around $2.1 million, a vacation home in Wilson, Wyo., and another house in Las Vegas where Lee’s mother-in-law lives, according to county assessor records (personal and vacation homes aren’t required to be disclosed). That adds up to 17 properties. Lee does indeed list several investments in companies generally seen as liberal kryptonite, including Halliburton, for-profit prison company GEO Group and Walmart. But those investments were made through a brokerage account that Lee’s campaign says were made at the discretion of the account manager, not the candidate. Lee’s campaign manager says she dropped the investments, which made up a tiny percentage of her overall investment portfolio, after filing her financial disclosure report in September 2015. Lee’s campaign confirmed that the couple owns a plane, but they said it’s a small single-engine turboprop plane that Dan Lee uses to visit his casino properties in rural areas like Fallon, Nev., and Rising Sun, Ind. The charge of trying to ""buy this primary"" is harder to fact-check, but Lee has loaned her campaign $150,000, which makes up around 17 percent of her total money raised. But even subtracting those loans, Lee leads her primary opponents in the fundraising race by a significant margin. It’s worth noting that Lee, Kihuen and their two other major opponents have relatively similar stances on raising the standard of living for working class families — all four support universal health care and want to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Our ruling The Culinary Workers Union claims that Lee and her husband ""own 17 homes across the country,"" a ""private jet,"" and that she invests in Walmart, Haliburton and the for-profit prison company GEO Group. There’s no doubt that Lee and her husband are substantially well-off. The union letter is correct on many details about the Lee family’s wealth, but it slightly fudged some of the particulars, like the couple’s airplane and details in their investments. We rate their statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE1E140>],/factchecks/2016/mar/14/culinary-workers-union/susie-lees-wealth-under-fire-competitive-nevada-co/
"['Iowa', 'Guns', 'Viral image']","
Viral photo fabricates Hillary Clinton quote on guns
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton explicitly stated her plans to ""shut down"" the National Rifle Association and expressed hope at banning handguns in an interview with The Des Moines Register last summer. At least, that’s according to a viral image that first cropped up on an anti-Clinton Tumblr blog and has been shared widely on Facebook. ""I will get the NRA shut down for good if I become president. If we can ban handguns, we will do it,"" the post quotes Clinton as telling the Register on Aug. 8, 2015. But here’s the thing: The quote is wholly fabricated. Clinton was never quoted in the Register making that statement, and it appears she has not made such a statement anywhere else. Clinton campaigned heavily in Iowa throughout the summer and fall of 2015, and Register reporters and the paper’s editorial board interviewed her several times. But she was not in Iowa on Aug. 8, when she allegedly made the statement. Clinton’s first visit to Iowa in the month of August occurred on Aug. 14, followed by public events on Aug. 15 and Aug. 26. A review of the Register’s archives show Clinton was neither interviewed nor quoted directly on Aug. 8 or in the days immediately following. Clinton did make several statements regarding gun control on the Iowa campaign trail that were covered by the Register. In all of them, she laid out an agenda that calls for broader background-check requirements, including sales at gun shows, as well as stronger measures to prevent gun purchases by domestic abusers and people with serious mental health problems. ""I'm going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because I believe we can do better than that,"" Clinton said in Iowa in July. ""A majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners agree with universal background checks to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people who are mentally unstable and even terrorists."" On Aug. 26 in Ankeny, she responded to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia: ""We've got to do something. It's a very difficult political issue. But we are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths,"" she said. She went on,  ""If guns weren't so readily available, if we had universal background checks, if we could put some time out between the person who got fired, or domestic abuse, or whatever other motivation ... maybe we could prevent this kind of carnage."" On Oct. 6, she described her views again, in response to a mass shooting in Oregon: ""I feel like this is unfinished business in our country, and I am very determined that we are going to try to bring some sanity back, so that people's Second Amendment rights are protected — but they are not absolute, the way the NRA wants them to be,"" Clinton said at an event in Davenport. ""There are common-sense ways to make sure people are not using guns to commit mass murders."" Gun control came up again at an event in Sioux City on Dec. 4, after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. At that time, she expressed support for banning gun sales to people on federal ""no-fly"" lists. ""I think we've got to be more willing to start imposing these kinds of gun-safety measures,"" Clinton said. ""I'm certainly going to continue advocating for them."" Internet searches for the quote found on the image refer only to the image itself — not to any original reporting from the Des Moines Register, another news outlet or to raw audio or video. Evidence of the quote does not appear to exist beyond what was originally posted on Tumblr. Our ruling A post spread via social media quotes Clinton as telling The Des Moines Register, ""I will get the NRA shut down for good if I become president. If we can ban handguns, we will do it."" Clinton was quoted in The Des Moines Register several times about gun control in the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses, but she did not say what the post accuses her of saying. Clinton has not advocated for shutting down the NRA or banning handguns outright. The claim is entirely fabricated. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB890900>],/factchecks/2016/mar/14/viral-image/viral-photo-fabricates-hillary-clinton-quote-guns/
"['Arizona', 'Supreme Court', 'Jeff Flake']","
Arizona senator claims confirming Supreme Court nominees in an election year is rare
","As President Barack Obama is on the brink of selecting a U.S. Supreme Court nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Republican lawmakers have made a slew of historical statements related to vacant Supreme Court seats. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., joined the party in a Feb. 22 statement. ""One would have to go back more than a century to find a scenario where a president’s nominee for the Supreme Court was confirmed by the opposition party in the Senate when the vacancy occurred during an election year,"" Flake said. ""I'm not about to break new ground in the Senate, particularly when any nominee could so drastically shift the balance of the court."" PolitiFact has researched similar claims of late: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said in February that ""it’s been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year,"" also saying that not approving a nomination in an election year is a long tradition. It’s been 76 years, but these openings are rare, so it’s not much of a tradition. We rated Cruz’s claim Half True. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also claimed in February that ""it’s been 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court Justice."" President Ronald Reagan, in his second term, nominated Justice Anthony Kennedy in November 1987. He confirmed Kennedy while still in office in February 1988. We rated Rubio’s claim Mostly False. So, turning back the history book once again, we decided to look at Flake’s claim. Checks out  Flake spokesman Jason Samuels emphasized that the Arizona senator’s statement included ""confirmed by the opposition party"" and ""vacancy occurred during an election year"" when we reached out. Samuels referred us to the Senate’s list of Supreme Court nominations going back to 1789. Experts we spoke with generally agreed with Flake’s claim. Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, said Flake’s statement is ""technically correct."" She noted that there are no 20th century examples of a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year that the opposition party in the Senate refused to consider. ""The only seat left vacant was Sherman Minton's, who resigned in October 1956, one month before the election.  The (Democratic-controlled) Senate had already adjourned for the elections, so (Republican) President Eisenhower gave William Brennan a recess appointment, and he was later nominated and confirmed in 1957,"" Binder said. A recess appointment isn’t the same as submitting a nominee, according to Russell Wheeler, an expert on federal courts at the Brookings Institution. ""Eisenhower didn’t submit a nominee; he recess appointed Brennan then nominated him the following January. It helped that Brennan was a Democrat,"" Wheeler said. The Justice Kennedy instance aids Flake’s statement too. ""Jeff chose his words very, very carefully. There have been vacancies during election years that were filled -- including Anthony Kennedy -- by an opposition Senate. But the vacancy occurred shortly before the election year,"" said Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Fundamental to this statement is the reality that we have not had a vacancy occurring in an election year with an opposition Senate."" Our ruling Flake said, ""One would have to go back more than a century to find a scenario where a president’s nominee for the Supreme Court was confirmed by the opposition party in the Senate when the vacancy occurred during an election year."" He’s right. Flake’s carefully crafted statement rules out potential exceptions, such as Justice Kennedy’s 1988 election year confirmation, but 1987 nomination, or the 1950s case with President Eisenhower and a Democratic Senate in adjournment when a Supreme Court vacancy came up a month before the November election. This seems to be because a vacancy just hasn’t happened to occur under these circumstances. We rate Flake’s claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEB77C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/14/jeff-flake/arizona-senator-claims-confirming-supreme-court-no/
"['Ohio', 'Drugs', 'Rob Portman']","
Most heroin in U.S. now comes across Mexican border, Rob Portman says
","Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio. The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.) Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015. Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico’s border, we were skeptical. Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States. ""Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,"" the report state. ""Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand."" The report also says that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEA’s term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them."" The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014. Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015. Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent. Smugglers’ creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California. Our ruling Portman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasn’t been studying drug facts for nothing. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7E2180>],/factchecks/2016/mar/14/rob-portman/most-heroin-us-comes-over-mexican-border/
"['Elections', 'Legal Issues', 'Race and Ethnicity', 'Missouri', 'Caleb Rowden']","
Rowden mostly right about Missouri residents supporting voter ID
","The debate over whether to require photo identification to vote continues in Missouri. Republicans argue photo IDs are necessary to safeguard the voting process from fraud, while Democrats warn that legislation would disenfranchise minority and poor voters.  At a League of Women Voters’ town hall meeting in Columbia, state Rep. Caleb Rowden said most people are behind the idea. The Columbia Republican said ""70 percent of Missourians support voter photo ID legislation."" We decided to look into that. Rowden said he based his 70 percent figure on a poll conducted by Remington Research in Missouri Scout, a political subscription service. He also said he has internally polled the district he represents. The survey Rowden cited put the question this way: ""The legislature is proposing to require voters to show a valid Missouri driver’s license or other valid identification in order to vote. Do you agree or disagree with this?"" Remington’s poll said 70 percent of Missourians said they agreed, with results varying city-to-city. The hitch is that the poll does not clarify what ""other valid identification"" entails. Defining what does and does not constitute ""valid identification"" is the crux of a proposed Missouri bill. As Missouri law stands now, any form of ID issued by Missouri, the federal government or another state is accepted as proof of identity to vote. Those forms include driver’s licenses from another state, birth certificates, student IDs, utility bills and bank statements. Not all of those include a photo. In contrast, the Missouri bill would require one of four documents, all of which include photos: a Missouri driver’s license; a Missouri non-driver’s license (state ID); a military ID; or a national government-issued form of ID with a signature and photograph. Marvin Overby, MU professor of political science at , said changes in phrasing when it comes to survey research can lead to different results. ""To a lot of people, it’s just common-sense rhetoric that you need a photo ID to do lots of things in life, including voting,"" he said. ""But if the wording laid out more exact points, such as the fact that the proposed legislation doesn’t include student IDs or out-of-state licenses, you might get a different response."" That said, evidence from national polling suggests Rowden might be on solid ground.  Nationwide support for photo ID The Pew Research Center found that 77 percent of Americans supported photo voter ID requirements. A poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports this summer illustrated a similar trend, showing more than three-quarters of Americans are in favor of requiring a photo ID to vote. That poll asked, ""Should voters be required to show photo identification such as a driver’s license before being allowed to vote?"" Unlike the poll cited by Rowden, the Rasmussen Reports poll specifically defined a valid ID as one requiring a photo. Rasmussen Reports Managing Editor Fran Coombs said the goal is to keep any potential bias out of survey questions. ""As a rule, we just try to keep the questioning as simple as possible,"" she said. ""The important thing is not to influence the responses with the wording of the question."" Even those who disagree with the idea of requiring photo identification don’t dispute that surveys show a high level of support for the idea. Missouri’s League of Women Voters’ Voter Protection and Service Director Kathleen Farrell said people might not know the details of the legislation that surveys ask about.  ""The average person might not know just how strict Missouri’s proposed legislation is,"" she said. ""They also may not know how expensive it could be to require photo ID for all voters."" The bill’s fiscal note allows for up to about $10.7 million dollars of funding; if the necessary funds were not allocated, the requirements for photo identification to vote would not be implemented. Our ruling Rowden’s statement that ""70 percent of Missourians support voter photo ID identification"" isn’t fully supported by the poll he provided. The poll Rowden cited only asks about ""requiring Missouri driver’s licenses or other valid form of ID to vote."" It doesn’t specify that the proposed legislation restricts valid identification to IDs that have photos. But national polls show about 75 percent of Americans support requiring a photo ID to vote. The wording in the poll Rowden cited is confusing, but the results mirror the national trend. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE2B4C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/14/caleb-rowden/rowden-mostly-right-about-missouri-residents-supp/
"['Economy', 'Wealth', 'Virginia', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders says Walmart heirs are wealthier than bottom 40 percent of Americans
","U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders starts with the nation’s richest family when describing the magnitude of wealth inequality in the United States. ""Today in America one family, the Walton family of Walmart. You all heard of Walmart. This one family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people,"" Sanders, I-Vt., said recently in Norfolk during a rally for his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. PolitiFact has looked at similar claims in the past from Sanders and other liberals, but the last time was in 2013. Since the statement has become a standard line in Sanders’ campaign speech, we decided to give it a new examination. The claim originates from research by Sylvia Allegretto, an economist at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California-Berkeley. She last updated her research in 2014. Allegretto tallied the total wealth held by the six relatives of Walmart founder Sam Walton: his sons Jim and Robert Walton; daughter Alice Walton; daughter-in-law Christy Walton; and his nieces, Ann Walton Kroenke and Nancy Walton Laurie. Using figures from the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans in 2013, Allegretto totaled the wealth of those six Waltons at $145 billion. Next, she turned to a survey of the net worth of Americans published every three years by the Federal Reserve. The most recent one was published in 2014 based on survey results from the previous year. The combined worth of the Walton clan in 2013, Allegretto said, ""equaled the total wealth of the entire bottom 43 percent."" We should point out that this is not a measure of ""income"" - the amount of money families earn every year. Instead, wealth is the bottom-line figure of a household’s ""net worth."" As our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin pointed out in their 2013 fact-check, net worth is the amount left over after accounting for things such as savings and retirement accounts minus what’s owed on home mortgages, credit card bills and other debts. That means it’s entirely possible for someone earning a six-digit salary to be in the ""bottom 40 percent,"" because all their debts still could leave them with zero or even negative net worth. Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute free-market think tank in London, has been critical of comparing the Walton wealth to people of modest net worth. Worstall noted in a 2011 op-ed in Forbes that many high earners easily could fall into the category of zero or negative net worth, such as doctors still paying off loans from attending medical school. ""If you’ve no debts and have $10 in your pocket, you have more wealth than 25% of Americans. More than that 25% of Americans have collectively that is,"" Worstall wrote. Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal Washington think tank, looked at the figure another way in a 2014 post. Noting that the Federal Reserve placed the median U.S. family wealth the previous year at $81,200, he wrote that it would take 1.7 million families with that amount of net worth to equal the wealth of the Waltons, he said. The Walton wealth has not been static since 2013. Forbes this year published figures showing the family’s wealth has declined to $121.9 billion -- a drop of $23.1 billion. Forbes explained it lowered the net worth held by Christy Walton after new information surfaced showing that her late husband, John - Sam Walton’s son - left some of his fortune to charity. We wondered whether that reduced $121.9 billion figure still would leave the Waltons’ wealth equal to about 40 percent of U.S. families. Allegretto was unavailable to run a new set computations for us. So we turned to the Urban Institute, a Washington non-profit specializing in economic social research. Its numbers show that Sanders’ claim remains correct based on the latest national wealth figures from 2013. Our ruling Sanders said the Walton family ""owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people."" The latest comparable figures, from 2013, support his claim. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFA61C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/14/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-walmart-heirs-are-wealthier-bo/

Donald Trump wrongly links Ohio campaign event protester to ISIS
","Despite evidence to the contrary, Donald Trump on Sunday morning repeated his charge that a man who rushed at him in Dayton, Ohio, had ISIS affiliations. The March 12 incident at a Trump rally at the Dayton airport involved Thomas DiMassimo, 22. According to police, DiMassimo jumped a barrier and rushed the stage where Trump was speaking. Secret Service agents tackled him and took him into custody. DiMassimo was charged with inducing panic and disorderly conduct and was released from Montgomery County Jail later the same day. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER On NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd noted that after the Dayton rally, Trump tweeted a video that purportedly showed DiMassimo posing with a gun against the backdrop of an ISIS flag, with Arabic-language music playing in the background. Trump’s tweet said, ""USSS (U.S. Secret Service) did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail."" The link to the video was appended to the tweet.  On Meet the Press, Todd said, ""That turned out to be a hoax. Did you go over the top there on that?"" Trump responded, ""No, no, no, no. He was, if you look on the Internet, if you look at clips…"" Todd repeated, ""It turned out to be a hoax. Somebody made that up, sir."" Trump then said, ""Well, I don't know what they made up. All I can do is play what's there. He was walking, dragging the American flag on the ground. Is that a correct statement? Was that a hoax, too? Was he dragging the flag on the ground?"" After further back and forth, Trump said, ""No, excuse me, you didn't see the clip. He was playing Arabic music, he was dragging the flag along the ground, and he had Internet chatter with ISIS and about ISIS. So I don't know if he was or not. But all we did was put out what he had on his Internet. … (He) had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS."" When Todd repeated that the video appeared to be a hoax, Trump responded, ""Okay, look, well, was it a hoax that he's dragging the flag? Was that him? It looked like the same man to me. He was dragging a flag along the ground and he was playing a certain type of music. And supposedly, there was chatter about ISIS. Now, I don't know. What do I know about it? All I know is what's on the Internet."" We decided to take a closer look at whether DiMassimo ""had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS"" on his social media posts. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The online trail DiMassimo, who could not be reached for comment, has a long history of anti-racist activism, often with a confrontational bent. For instance, he was apparently filmed on Aug. 12, 2015, destroying a Confederate battle flag at a protest at Stone Mountain, Ga.  As it turns out, there is a similar video to the one Trump tweeted that apparently involves DiMassimo -- but it doesn’t show anything related to ISIS. The video, uploaded by YouTube user ""Tommy DiMassimo,"" shows a man who appears to be DiMassimo taking part in a protest at Wright State University, where he is reportedly a student, in April 2015. The video shows him dragging a United States flag behind him, and ultimately standing on it.   Trump, in the Meet the Press interview, seems to be correct that genuine video exists of DiMassimo dragging the U.S. flag. And we expect that Trump won’t be the only American disturbed by such images. However, that’s not the same thing as DiMassimo being linked to ISIS. Trump’s tweet made the connection based on an edited version of the video DiMassimo originally uploaded. Unlike DiMassimo’s original uploaded video, the one Trump linked to includes an image of DiMassimo armed and in front of the ISIS flag, as well as Arabic-language music. (The post also fails to capitalize the first ""M"" in DiMassimo’s last name.) The version Trump linked to also includes Arabic text in the description, but according to BuzzFeed, ""the Arabic is badly garbled, but appears to say ‘Tommy D’ was trying to look ‘cool’ and as if he has big balls for standing on an American flag."" BuzzFeed tracked the video with the ISIS imagery to a May 2015 upload by someone named Thomas Jenners, whose account has since been deleted. It also found a Facebook page called ""Tommy dimassimo wasn’t hugged enough as a kid"" that was dedicated to trolling DiMassimo, including ISIS-related jabs. Here’s one:  Put it all together, and all signs point to the video Trump tweeted being either a hoax or an effort to troll DiMassimo. When we contacted Andrew Kaczynski, BuzzFeed’s specialist in debunking Internet hoaxes, he said his conclusion is that ""there's nothing linking him to ISIS."" The law-enforcement angle Further supporting the hoax theory of the ISIS video is that the criminal justice system has not treated DiMassimo as an ISIS-linked or ISIS-inspired terrorist -- even though the high-profile incident and the involvement of the Secret Service would have made such a linkage, if it were real, an urgent issue of national security. The fact that DiMassimo was released within hours of the incident is something that would be almost inconceivable if he had truly been a terrorist linked to ISIS, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. ""If the guy had actually made an ISIS video while doing his activism, then the feds would have certainly come across it,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. ""And then there would be a number of things he could be charged with, such as material support for terrorism. There would certainly be an argument that he poses a threat to the community for his pro-ISIS ties, which means they could have detained him pending trial."" The police report of the incident, obtained by the Dayton Daily News and shared with PolitiFact, says DiMassimo told police that he intended to take Trump’s microphone and yell, ""Donald Trump is a racist."" The report makes no mention of ISIS or Islamic terrorism. Our ruling Trump said Thomas DiMassimo, the man who rushed at him in Dayton, Ohio, ""had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS"" in his social media posts. There is lots to offend people on DiMassimo’s social media posts. But there doesn’t appear to be any legitimate connection between DiMassimo and ISIS. The link Trump tweeted was a hoax or an effort to troll DiMassimo. It’s also unlikely that someone who really had ISIS ties and who had been arrested for threatening a presidential candidate on live television would be quickly released from custody pending trial. The police report of his arrest makes no mention of ISIS or Islamic terrorism. We rate the claim False. UPDATE, March 14, 2016: In an interview with CNN on March 13, DiMassimo ""vehemently denied belonging to ISIS. He told CNN the video was doctored and provided a link to what he said was the original footage from a protest he participated in more than a year ago.""
