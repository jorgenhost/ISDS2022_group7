Israel O'Quinn flip-flops on banning personal use of campaign funds
","Three times in recent years, Virginia Del. Israel O’Quinn of Washington County has joined his fellow Republicans in the House of Delegates in unanimously supporting a bill that would have prohibited candidates from using campaign funds for personal expenses. Each time, the bill died in the state Senate.   In a surprise move this year, House Republicans killed the bill in a subcommittee led by O’Quinn. The action, backed by O’Quinn, all but assures the prohibition has once again been quashed. We examined O’Quinn’s voting through our Flip-O-Meter, which gauges if politicians have changed their positions on issues. O’Quinn’s office did not reply to three requests we made for comment. From 2018 to 2021, O’Quinn cast six votes for bills that would have banned personal use of campaign money.  In 2018 and 2019, the bills swept through a subcommittee and committee of the Republican-controlled House without dissent. Both years, they were bundled in a block with other uncontested bills and unanimously passed without debate by the 100-member House. The measures, however, were killed in Senate committees, where there was concern  that there can be a thin line between personal and campaign expenses and a prohibition could entrap well-intentioned candidates. In 2021, the House, then controlled by Democrats, again unanimously approved a ban in a block with other uncontested bills and sent it to the Senate. This time, the measure was passed by that chamber’s Privileges and Elections Committee but faced roadblocks on the Senate floor, where some members said the bill needed more specificity. Instead of voting on the legislation, the Senate agreed to form a panel with the House to work out concerns. What resulted were three identical bills - two introduced in the House this year and one in the Senate.  The bills said, ""a contribution is considered to have been converted to personal use if the contribution, in whole or in part, is used to fulfill any commitment, obligation or expense that would exist irrespective of the person's seeking, holding or maintaining public office."" Examples of personal use, according to the bills, are mortgages and rents, automobile costs, vacations and country club memberships. The bills carved out an exception for a candidate’s childcare costs ""that are incurred as a direct result of campaign activity.""  The House bills were defeated Feb. 2 on a partisan 5-3 vote in a House subcommittee chaired by O’Quinn.  In addition to O’Quinn, the vote was a clear reversal for Del. Bob Bloxom Jr., R-Accomack, who voted for the ban four times over the previous four years. Bloxom’s office, like O’Quinn’s, did not reply to our requests for an explanation. The other three Republicans on the subcommittee are freshmen who were voting on the ban for the first time.  On Feb. 3, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, said on the House floor that the subcommittee vote ""was a complete reversal…of a position Republicans had embraced over the last several sessions."" Simon said House Republicans in the past had a ""free pass"" in supporting the ban because they knew it would die in the Senate. He said there’s growing momentum in the Senate for the ban this year and if the House GOP supported the bill ""it might actually become law."" The bill’s fate in the Senate is uncertain, however. It passed the chamber’s Privileges and Elections Committee on an 9-6  vote Tuesday and still faces review from the Finance and Appropriations Committee before it can advance to the Senate floor.  If the bill does pass the Senate, it’s then likely to be routed through O’Quinn’s unfriendly House subcommittee.  Six times over the previous four years, O’Quinn voted for bills that would have banned using campaign money for personal expenses. The measures unanimously passed the House and died in the Senate. This year, O’Quinn led four fellow Republicans who formed a majority on a House subcommittee that voted to kill a bill that would have banned the practice. We rate O’Quinn’s vote a Full Flop.  ","[('Legislative Information Service, HB122, 2018 session', 'https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=181&typ=bil&val=hb122'), ('LIS, HB1617, 2019 session', 'No link'), ('LIS, HB1952, 2021 session', 'https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&typ=bil&val=hb1617'), ('LIS, HB973, HB1296, SB463, 2022 session', 'No link'), ('Del.

No clear evidence that COVID vaccines are responsible for strange blood clots observed by embalmers
","Embalmers and funeral home workers say they are noticing an increase in unusual blood clots among the deceased. Some of them, without evidence, are attributing it to the COVID-19 vaccines. One of the claims comes from an article titled ""Embalmers finding ‘strange clots’ in jabbed people"" and published by NewsWars, a website run by Alex Jones that has a history of spreading fake news and conspiracy theories. ""I actually pulled this long, fibrous-looking clot out prior to embalming … . At the front end of it, it looks like a normal blood clot, but that white fibrous-looking stuff just isn’t normal,"" Alabama embalmer Richard Hirschman was quoted in the article as saying. Hirschman added that ""my gut is telling me"" it’s caused by the vaccine. Hirschman shared similar claims on the ""Dr. Jane Ruby Show,"" and with PolitiFact when we contacted him. John O’Looney of Milton Keynes Family Funeral Services based in the United Kingdom made similar claims to InfoWars, another conspiracy-oriented website run by Jones, suggesting that ""the experimental shot"" could be to blame.  Experts we talked to say there’s something to the claim about a greater incidence of blood clots, but they dismiss the idea that it’s linked to the vaccines. What embalmers are noticing, they say, could well be the effects of COVID-19 infection itself, and those effects are occurring in people who are vaccinated and unvaccinated. More than 900,000 people in the U.S., and nearly 5.8 million worldwide, have died of COVID-19 or related causes. This could explain why funeral home workers are encountering more bodies that show effects of a COVID-19 infection, which include blood vessel inflammation, damage to very small vessels, and blood clots.  Hirschman acknowledged on the ""Dr. Jane Ruby Show"" that one of the dead people in which he observed the blood clots ""was vaccinated, but also had apparently contracted COVID anyway."" ""The association between COVID-19 and blood clots was recognized early in the pandemic among hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"" said Yazan Abou-Ismail, a hematologist at University of Utah Health. ""These patients experienced blood clots both in deep veins and arteries, which sometimes led to strokes and heart attacks. Although these conditions have mostly been seen in patients with severe COVID-19 illness, people with moderate illness have also developed blood clots.""  Abou-Ismail said the incidence of blood clots ranged from 20% to 40% among patients with severe COVID-19 illness, and 3% to 9% among those with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness. Abnormal clots were found in COVID-19 victims ""long before vaccinations were available,"" said licensed embalmer Monica Torres, of NXT Generation Mortuary Support in Phoenix, ""and it is not uncommon to find dark blood clots in any deceased, not just COVID persons, who have been stored in refrigeration for a long period of time before embalming."" The National Funeral Directors Association, a U.S. professional organization, told PolitiFact that embalmers in its network have noticed similar abnormalities in COVID-related deaths, but among both the vaccinated and unvaccinated.  ""It’s only anecdotal evidence, and there’s no scientific evidence to draw any conclusions,"" said Jessica Koth, director of public relations for the association. Embalmers typically do not know the vaccination status of those they are embalming, according to the experts PolitiFact spoke to. ""It is not on the death certificate,"" said Dr. Hari P. Close, national president of the National Funeral Directors & Morticians Association. It is worth noting that the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine has been linked to a higher risk for a serious condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, which is a combination of a blood clot and low platelets. The condition is considered ""very rare and treatable when diagnosed in time,"" according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that out of more than 18.2 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine given in the United States as of Feb. 3, it has confirmed 57 reports of people who developed TTS after vaccination, and has identified nine deaths attributed to TTS following vaccination. Generally, the vaccines available in the U.S. have been shown to sharply reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Even before COVID-19 arose, cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death globally and in the U.S. According to the World Health Organization, ""an estimated 17.9 million people died from cardiovascular diseases in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke."" A news article claimed that embalmers are ""finding ‘strange clots’ in jabbed people."" The article gives the impression that the clots are linked to the COVID-19 vaccine. But there’s no scientific evidence of such a link.

Embalmers say they have noticed an uptick in unusual blood clots. But experts noted that the COVID-19 infection itself can cause blood vessel inflammation, damage to very small vessels, and blood clots. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('News Wars, Shocking Interview: Embalmers Finding ""Strange Clots"" In Jabbed People, Jan. 28, 2022.\xa0', 'https://www.newswars.com/pivotal-interview-embalmers-finding-strange-clots-in-jabbed-people/'), ('InfoWars, Funeral Director Describes ""Alarming Rise"" in Blood Clot Deaths Since Covid Vaccine Rollout, Dec. 8, 2021.', 'No link'), ('Johns Hopkins Medicine, COVID Vaccine Side Effects, Nov. 9, 2021.', 'https://www.infowars.com/posts/funeral-director-describes-alarming-rise-in-blood-clot-deaths-since-covid-vaccine-rollout/'), ('Johns Hopkins Medicine, Heart Problems after COVID-19, Dec. 8, 2021.', 'No link'), ('Johns Hopkins University & Medicine, Coronavirus Resource Center, accessed Feb. 8, 2022.\xa0', 'https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-vaccine-side-effects'), ('The University of Utah, Blood Clotting, COVID-19, and Vaccines, July 7, 2021.', 'No link'), ('World Health Organization, Cardiovascular Diseases, June 11, 2021.\xa0', 'https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/heart-problems-after-covid19'), ('Email correspondence with Jessica Koth, Director of Public Relations of the National Funeral Directors Association, Feb. 3, 2022.', 'No link'), ('Email correspondence with John O’Looney, Funeral Director of Milton Keynes Family Funeral Services, Feb. 3-6, 2022.', 'https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/united-states'), ('Email correspondence with Andrew Malcom, Managing Director of Kapiti Coast Funeral Home, Feb. 7, 2022.', 'No link'), ('Email correspondence with Dr. Hari P.

In graphic labeled ‘top ten most unhealthy U.S. cities,’ Dan Bongino actually showed the healthiest
","In a sweeping segment blaming ""garbage Democrat politicians"" for society’s ills, Fox News host Dan Bongino aired a map that he claimed showed the ""Top Ten Most Unhealthy U.S. Cities."" The map highlighted 10 blue-leaning cities: San Francisco; Seattle; Portland, Oregon; San Diego; Honolulu; Washington, D.C.; Austin, Texas; Irving, Texas; Portland, Maine; and Denver. ""You look at some of the health outcomes in some of these inner cities that these Democrats have run monopolistically for decades, and you stand a pretty darn good chance of dying in one of these inner cities,"" Bongino said Feb. 5 as the graphic aired beside him. ""Far more likely than if you lived in areas where they gave a damn about people and their healthcare outcomes."" The problem: the source for Bongino’s graphic, the personal finance website WalletHub, says the exact opposite of what his map showed.   Bongino's original Feb. 5 segment on Fox News included a graphic that claimed to show the ""Top Ten Most Unhealthy U.S. Cities."" The 10 cities Bongino singled out as the ""most unhealthy"" are actually the 10 ""healthiest places to live in the U.S.,"" based on assessments of health care, food, fitness and green space. Bongino also mixed up Irvine, California, a city southeast of Los Angeles, with Irving, Texas, a large Dallas suburb; the WalletHub analysis concluded that Irvine, not Irving, is the eighth healthiest place to live. The 10 cities at the bottom of WalletHub’s 182-city list were Brownsville, Texas; Laredo, Texas; Gulfport, Mississippi; Shreveport, Louisiana; Memphis, Tennessee; Montgomery, Alabama; Fort Smith, Arkansas; Jackson, Mississippi; Huntington, West Virginia; and Lubbock, Texas.  Reporters and social media users panned the mistake on Twitter. The inverted and inaccurate graphic was presented during the 9 p.m. EST showing of ""Unfiltered with Dan Bongino,"" Bongino’s weekend talk show. When Fox News ran the program again hours later, it had pulled the graphic from the airwaves. As Bongino spoke, file footage depicting homeless people in Seattle was shown beside him instead.  When the segment ran again later that evening, the inaccurate graphic had been removed and replaced with other images. ""On Saturday night's episode of ‘Unfiltered with Dan Bongino,’ a graphic was aired with inaccurate information on the unhealthiest cities in the country,"" a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. ""We regret the error which will be corrected on next week’s program."" Bongino acknowledged the error on another show he hosts, ""The Dan Bongino Show,"" on Feb. 7, though he insisted that the graphic ""had nothing to do with what I said."" He said his staff made the error as they rushed to put together a graphic to match his plan for a segment on what he called ""the two Americas."" ""It was just totally, completely wrong about healthiest cities in the United States,"" he said. ""It was just totally, completely, almost comically wrong."" Reached for comment, Bongino attacked fact-checkers in an emailed response and blocked this reporter from viewing his Twitter feed.

Social media post is wrong about proposal to change data collection on teacher sexual misconduct
","A social media post says a federal requirement for schools to report teacher sexual misconduct is at risk, but the post references an outdated proposal that has been withdrawn, and it describes that proposal in a misleading way. A Jan. 30 post on Facebook reads, ""Joe Biden wants to eliminate a regulation that requires school districts to report allegations of teacher on student rape, alleged rape, and sexual assault."" The post also says, ""TAKE ACTION: Send a message to Biden and the Department of Education to KEEP this regulation!"" and includes a link to a website with an email comment form. The site appears to be operated by FreedomWorks, a conservative and libertarian advocacy group based in Washington. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post, which refers to a Nov. 19 proposal from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, gives the false impression that the proposed change would have resulted in allegations of sexual misconduct, such as a rape in school, going unreported to law enforcement and not being investigated. That’s not the case. The proposal referred only to the federal government’s collection of data about such allegations. Moreover, the proposal would not have eliminated the data reporting requirements altogether, as the post suggests. Rather, it would have eliminated the collection of some statistics about sexual misconduct by school staff. In any case, the proposal was withdrawn several weeks before the Facebook post. Under a new Dec. 13 proposal, the data will continue to be collected. Every two years, the U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights conducts a survey of public schools to collect data about access and barriers to educational opportunity.  The proposal for the 2021-22 school year data collection was announced Nov. 18, when the agency submitted it to the Federal Register for public comment. The public had 60 days to provide comments.  The proposed changes to data collection were aimed at reducing the reporting burden on schools and school districts, the proposal said, and would have eliminated some data points related to the number of allegations made against a school staff member. For example, under the original proposal, the Office for Civil Rights would have no longer asked districts to report how many allegations were made against a particular school staff member in certain situations. If an employee accused of rape, attempted rape or sexual assault at school subsequently resigned or retired before being disciplined or terminated, then the number of allegations against that person would not have to be reported. ""However, OCR will continue to collect data on the number of documented incidents of offenses that occur at the school, including the number of documented incidents of sexual assault committed by students and staff,"" the original proposal said. Before the 60-day period expired, the proposed rule was replaced with a new one. In the new Dec. 13 proposal, the agency said it would retain those data elements and would continue to collect the data. The website the Facebook post links to said, ""After hearing outcries from the grassroots, the Biden administration is now re-thinking getting rid of this requirement. Your voices are being heard, but the Biden administration's terrible idea is still on the table."" That is incorrect. The withdrawn proposal was replaced with a new one that ""maintains the five data elements"" that were proposed for elimination, it says. A Facebook post says, ""Joe Biden wants to eliminate a regulation that requires school districts to report allegations of teacher on student rape, alleged rape, and sexual assault."" The post refers to a proposed federal rule change that had already been withdrawn weeks before the post was made. And it describes the proposal in a misleading way. The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which conducts a biennial survey of public schools, had proposed to stop collecting certain data points about sexual assaults and rapes by school staff — not eliminating the reporting requirements altogether. The post gives the impression that the proposed change would have resulted in allegations going unreported to law enforcement and not being investigated. That’s not the case. The proposal covers only data collection by the federal government. Under a new proposal submitted Dec. 13, the data will continue to be collected.

Ron DeSantis ad on Fauci ‘flip-flops’ leaves out reasons for guidance changes
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has long railed against COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, pushing back against government measures like mask and vaccine mandates that aimed to control the spread of infection. Though DeSantis doesn’t yet have a clear opponent in his Nov. 8 bid for re-election, his campaign took aim at Dr. Anthony Fauci in a new ad that accused the White House’s chief health adviser of ""flip-flopping."" The ad shows shortened clips of the nation’s top infectious disease expert making a series of back-to-back statements, each seemingly in opposition with the one prior: ""People should not be walking around with masks."" ""Masks work."" ""Fully vaccinated, you are protected and you do not need to wear a mask."" ""If you are vaccinated, you should still wear a mask."" ""You really better be very careful before you bring the children back."" ""The default position should be to try as best as possible to keep the children in school."" ""Right now, at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you're doing on a day by day basis."" ""I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see."" It ends with the words on a screen in all caps: ""Dr. Fauci, he flips, he flops. But he can’t stop freedom in Florida."" Then the screen fades to show a pair of red flip flops on a beach and the words, ""Fauci can pound sand."" Guidance surrounding the pandemic has changed since the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged as a global health threat in late 2019 and early 2020. But DeSantis’ ad omits a lot of context, including about what was and wasn’t known about the new virus at the time Fauci made these statements. It also selectively edits out key words and caveats, giving viewers a misleading impression about what Fauci actually said. Through Helen Aguirre Ferré, executive director of the Republican Party of Florida, DeSantis’ campaign stood by its ad, citing what it called Fauci’s ""nonsensical policies and endless contradictions."" The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the agency Fauci heads, said public health recommendations have evolved as knowledge about the disease has evolved: ""The public health and scientific communities have been faced with an unprecedented and evolving pandemic event and have made recommendations in ‘real time’ according to the best scientific data available at that time."" A close look at each of the statements shows Fauci was more nuanced and specific in his guidance than the selective editing in this ad would suggest. Here’s a look at each of the Fauci statements used in the ad, with context: Ad: ""People should not be walking around with masks."" Context: This shortened clip of Fauci was from a March 8, 2020, interview on CBS’ ""60 Minutes,"" three days before the World Health Organization designated the novel coronavirus a global pandemic. At the time, there was a concern about a shortage of personal protective equipment, called PPE, for health care providers. Officials at the time did not know that the virus could be transmitted by asymptomatic people. The CDC changed its guidance a month later, urging Americans to wear cloth face coverings. Fauci explained the change in mask guidance in an interview with PolitiFact on May 14, 2021.    Fauci’s full comment: ""The masks are important for someone who’s infected to prevent them from infecting someone else. Now when you see people and look at the films in China or South Korea, whatever, everybody’s wearing a mask … right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks."" Ad: ""Masks work."" Context: This clip shows two words of a much longer answer Fauci gave in a June 12, 2020, interview with The Street. He also said masks weren’t 100% effective and went on to discuss the need for physical separation.         Fauci’s full comment: ""Masks are not 100% protective. However, they certainly are better than not wearing a mask. Both to prevent you, if you happen to be a person who may feel well, but has an asymptomatic infection that you don't even know about, to prevent you from infecting someone else. But also, it can protect to a certain degree, not a hundred percent, in protecting you from getting infected from someone who, either is breathing, or coughing, or sneezing, or singing or whatever it is, in which the droplets or the aerosols go out. So masks work."" Ad: ""Fully vaccinated, you are protected and you do not need to wear a mask."" Context: The CDC had changed its guidance on masks in May 2021, saying that data showed it was safe for fully vaccinated people to stop wearing masks in most indoor or outdoor settings. In this June 29, 2021, clip from an interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt, Fauci was responding to concerns about the surge in delta variant cases and said that the CDC guidance on masks stood ""for now.""    Fauci’s full comment: ""We know from experience now that the vaccines that we're using in this country do very well against the delta variant. You have to take that variant seriously. It's nothing to just pooh-pooh, because it spreads more rapidly than the original virus, and it can cause more serious disease. But for now, the CDC recommendations stand, that if in fact you are vaccinated ... fully vaccinated, you are protected and you do not need to wear a mask, outdoors or indoors."" Ad: ""If you are vaccinated, you should still wear a mask."" Context: This clip from a July 27, 2021, interview on PBS was edited to leave out that Fauci was referring to wearing a mask indoors. It also left out the important context that the CDC’s mask guidance had changed in response to new data showing that vaccinated people with breakthrough infections could transmit the more highly contagious delta variant to others.   Fauci’s full comment: ""So, when you have vaccinated people who might have a breakthrough infection, and we know now as the fact, as a scientific fact, that they can transmit the virus to an uninfected person, it's for that reason that the CDC made the change in recommendation, and did, just as you correctly stated, namely, that, if you are vaccinated, if you are (in) an indoor setting, you should still wear a mask."" Ad: ""You really better be very careful before you bring the children back."" Context: This clip is from Sept. 8, 2020, on ""PBS NewsHour."" Fauci was speaking about K-12 schools and the rate of infection in the local community. He referred to green, yellow and red zones and cautioned about bringing students back too soon in communities in red zones.   Fauci’s full comment: ""And then finally, if you’re in the red zone, you really better be very careful before you bring the children back because you don’t want to create a situation where you have a hyper-spreading event, as you might have in the school."" Ad: ""The default position should be to try as best as possible to keep the children in school."" Context: This clip from Nov. 29, 2020, on ABC News, edits out the words ""within reason"" that Fauci said after ""as best as possible."" He was responding to a question in the context of New York schools closing and said there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach to closures. Fauci’s full comment: ""Obviously, you don't have one size fits all. But as I said in the past and as you accurately quoted me, the default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school, or to get them back to school. The best way to ensure the safety of the children in school is to get the community level of spread low. So, if you mitigate the things that you know are causing spread in a very, very profound way, in a robust way, if you bring that down, you will then indirectly and ultimately protect the children in the school because the community level is determined how things go across the board."" Ad: ""Right now, at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis."" Context: This comment on Feb. 29, 2020, from NBC’s ""Today"" show came after Fauci was asked if people needed to alter their daily lives because of the virus. Fauci said no, but the clip leaves out the context that he warned that this was subject to change if people started to see community spread.   Fauci’s full comment: ""No, right now, at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis. Right now, the risk is still low, but this could change. I’ve said that many times, even on this program. You’ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don’t need to change anything you’re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change, and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread."" 
  Ad: ""I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see."" Context: This March 15, 2020, clip from CNN is deceptively edited mid-sentence to make it seem Fauci was speaking broadly about personal interactions, when in reality he was answering a question from host ​​Brianna Keilar about young people crowding into bars and restaurants, and whether he would like to see a national lockdown. He went on to say that young people were not immune to the virus, and that even if they were less likely to get seriously ill, they could transmit the virus to a more vulnerable person. Fauci’s full comment: ""Well, I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and in bars. Whatever it takes to do that, that’s what I’d like to see."" Ad: ""So let me clarify that because there was a little bit of a misunderstanding."" Context: Fauci said this Jan. 24, 2021, on CBS’ ""Face the Nation."" He was trying to clear up some confusion over Biden’s promise to get 100 million vaccine doses into the arms of Americans in his first 100 days as president. That’s because Fauci had misspoken in an earlier interview, saying there would be 100 million Americans fully vaccinated in 100 days. Asked about the conflicting statements on ""Face the Nation,"" he said there was a misunderstanding. Fauci’s full comment: ""Yes, so let me clarify that, because there was a little bit of a misunderstanding. What we're talking about is 100 million shots in individuals. So, a shot — as in other words, when you get down to, let's say, a certain part of the 100 days, at the end of 100 days, you're going to have some people who will have gotten both shots and some will still be on their first shots. What the president is saying (is) 100 million shots in the arms of people within 100 days."" A new ad for DeSantis accuses Fauci of ‘flip-flopping’ on guidance for mask wearing, school closures and COVID-19 precautions. The ad splices together various clips of Fauci speaking, but selectively omits key context, words and caveats that would explain the changes in guidance and provide a more accurate picture of his position. These omissions and edits fundamentally alter the story that is being told. When Fauci said people did not need to walk around in masks, it was before scientists knew COVID-19 could be spread asymptomatically. When he said masks work, he indicated they do not work 100% but can help stem infection spread. When he said that fully vaccinated people should wear masks, he was talking about how to behave safely indoors after new data showed vaccinated people with breakthrough infections could transmit the highly contagious delta variant. When he said children should be kept home, his comments were specific to areas where there was high transmission early in the pandemic, before vaccines. When he said people didn’t need to change their behavior, it was in February 2020 when U.S. cases were few, but he added the caveat that that guidance could change. When he advised personal interaction should be diminished, it was March 2020, and he was speaking specifically of young people crowding into bars and restaurants.   The ad contains an element of truth in that it does quote words that came out of Fauci’s mouth. But these statements came at different points in the pandemic as scientists understood more about COVID-19. The video is edited in such a way as to mislead by ignoring critical facts and cutting out words that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('AdMo, ""Fauci Flip-Flops""', 'https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/5ace2c6a-3b35-4fed-8f2e-8acf16ffb1f2/'), ('Email interview with Helen Aguirre Ferré, executive director of the Republican Party of Florida, Feb. 6, 2022', 'No link'), ('Emailed statement from The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Feb. 4, 2022', 'https://www.niaid.nih.gov/'), ('PolitiFact, ""Transcript: What Dr. Fauci told PolitiFact,"" May 14, 2021', 'No link'), ('NPR, ""CDC Now Recommends Americans Consider Wearing Cloth Face Coverings In Public,"" April 3, 2020', 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/may/14/transcript-what-dr-fauci-told-politifact/'), ('""60 Minutes"" via YouTube, ""March 2020: Dr. Anthony Fauci talks with Dr Jon LaPook about Covid-19,""\xa0', 'No link'), ('""NBC Nightly News"" via YouTube, ""Dr. Fauci On Confusion Over Mask Wearing Amid Delta Variant Concerns,"" June 29, 2021', 'https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/03/826219824/president-trump-says-cdc-now-recommends-americans-wear-cloth-masks-in-public'), ('""NBC Nightly News"" via YouTube, ""NBC Nightly News Broadcast (Full) - June 29th, 2021""', 'No link'), ('The Street, via YouTube, ""Why Weren\'t We Wearing Masks From the Beginning?

Yes, Iowa Republican’s bill would put cameras in classrooms
","Editor's note, Feb. 10: A subcommittee on the bill to install cameras in Iowa classrooms did not meet as scheduled on Feb. 9, and the subcommittee leader said the bill will not move forward. We rate claims based on what is known at the time, so the rating remains unchanged.  A bill introduced by an Iowa state Rep. Norlin Mommsen that would install cameras in public school classrooms would allow parents to watch a livestream of their child’s class. The move has garnered attention outside of the Hawkeye State, in stories by several national media outlets and commentary from pundits.  On Feb. 2, left-learning podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen, host of the popular podcast No Lie with Brian Tyler Cohen, tweeted that the bill would put government-installed cameras in every classroom. Content in public schools has been a hot-button issue in the Iowa Legislature this session. On Feb. 3, Iowa Senate President Jake Chapman, R-Adel, introduced a bill that would allow parents to sue teachers for distributing what they deem obscene material to students.  Chapman had previously proposed charging educators with felonies for distributing obscene material.  Cohen is correct about proposed cameras in Iowa’s classrooms, except that language in Mommsen’s bill, HF2177, provides narrow exceptions to the cameras for gym class and special education classrooms.  Cohen told Politifact Iowa the source for the tweet was an NBC News story.  Cohen also linked to an NBC story about a similar bill proposed in Florida, which teachers called spying.  ""This is very clearly a way for conservative lawmakers to censor educators so that they’ll avoid teaching topics that could be considered politically inconvenient for Republicans. It’s political interference in education. I think it’s extremely fair to call this practice a way to spy on teachers in their classrooms for the sole purpose of chilling speech/lesson plans/education for fear of punishment,"" Cohen wrote in a message to Politifact.  Mommsen told Politifact Iowa those who think the intent of his bill is to spy on teachers are incorrect.   ""What I’m trying to do is build a stronger bond between parents and teachers and the children’s education,"" Mommsen said. ""I think that’s been missing.""  Mommsen said the cameras also could provide a record of what happens in the classroom for teachers facing harassment.  ""I’ve had teachers call me, I’ve had parents of teachers call me talking about the abuse they take in the classroom,"" Mommsen said. ""And they see this as a way to protect themselves.""  In Maryland, Democratic lawmakers have proposed installing cameras, though without audio and live streaming, in special education classrooms to provide evidence in case of complaints of abuse from teachers.  Texas, West Virginia and Louisiana have similar laws on the books as the one proposed in Maryland for special education classrooms. A bill making its way through the Florida Legislature would not allow for camera footage to be livestreamed.  As of Feb.7, several associations representing Iowa teachers had declared their opposition to the bill through lobbyists, including the Iowa Association of School Boards, School Administrators of Iowa, Professional Educators of Iowa, the Iowa State Education Association, Rural School Advocates of Iowa, Iowa Safe Schools, and the Urban Education Network of Iowa.  As of Feb. 7, no groups had registered lobbyist declarations in favor of the bill.  Iowa State Education Association President Mike Beranek said in a prepared statement issued Feb. 3, that the bill would further insult public school educators. ""To suggest that precious school resources be spent on live streaming equipment and additional bandwidth so that anyone can observe a classroom is misguided and dangerous,"" Beranek said.  The bill proposes that state funding pay for the cameras.  Mommsen told Politifact Iowa that he envisions the livestream taking place over a platform like Zoom, that could be secured so only parents could access it.  Cohen is correct in saying Mommsen’s bill would put cameras in classrooms, live streaming school activities for parents who want to know what’s happening in their child’s classroom.  The bill would not put cameras in every classroom. It leaves some exceptions for physical education and special education rooms. And, the bill would allow viewing all day during class time, not ""at all times of the day,"" as the statement could be interpreted as saying if taken out of the context Cohen provides in the tweet.  But on a whole, Cohen is correct about the purpose of the bill.  We rate Cohen’s claim as True. ","[('Iowa House File 2177\xa0', 'https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=89&ba=HF2177'), ('Brian Tyler Cohen tweet,\xa0Feb. 2, 2022\xa0', 'No link'), ('Twitter Direct Message Exchange, @briantylercohen, Feb. 7, 2022\xa0', 'https://twitter.com/NoLieWithBTC/status/1488987894232633350'), ('Phone interview with Rep.

No proof of immigrant drop-offs in Charlotte suburb
","A candidate for a U.S. House seat is claiming that federal officials are transporting immigrants to a town in his western North Carolina district. Tyler Lee, a Republican, is running in the state’s newly-drawn 13th Congressional District. On Jan. 27, he shared a tweet by a Fox News reporter that said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been ""releasing some illegal immigrants with misdemeanor criminal histories"" in cities across the country. Lee then added his own commentary: ""I’ve been told by local citizens this has been happening in Huntersville #NC13 at big box retail locations. Feds aren’t notifying anyone, just making secret drops at 3am. When I’m elected, we won’t fund this illegal operation by @DHSgov."" Several people quickly called Lee’s tweet into question. It’s similar to other rumors spread in conservative media about ""ghost flights"" transporting immigrants ""in the middle of the night,"" which in many cases haven’t been substantiated.  When asked to provide evidence to support his statement, Lee said in an email to Politifact NC: ""I am reporting on what citizens in Huntersville and Charlotte are seeing and have told me."" So is Lee onto something in Huntersville? It appears not. We reached out to Huntersville police, the Mecklenburg County government, the North Carolina health department, ICE, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. Each group said it was unaware of immigrants allegedly being dropped off in the town.  Before we get into their comments, let’s go over some recent immigration history and how the relocation process works. The number of people crossing the southern U.S. border has skyrocketed over the past decade as the economy stagnated, corruption took root, and violence increased in Central American nations. PolitiFact has written about the immigration trends for years. The number of apprehensions at the border has reached new heights under President Biden. Many migrants attempt to stay in the U.S. by seeking asylum — which is their right under federal law. And those seeking asylum are allowed to stay in the country until their case is heard. As shelters and third-party housing facilities fill up, federal agencies sometimes help relocate these migrants throughout the country. So, hypothetically, it’s conceivable that the federal government could legally relocate people to Huntersville, a Mecklenburg County suburb of Charlotte. However, government agencies say they’re not aware of any recent effort to transport migrants to Huntersville. ""We have no complaints that have been filed with our agency in regards to this and are not aware of this occurring,"" Capt. Brian Vaughan of the Huntersville Police Department told us in an email. Mecklenburg County officials are also ""unaware of any such activities"" described in the tweet, county spokesman Alex Burnett said in an email. When immigrants seeking asylum arrive in North Carolina, the state Department of Health and Human Services’ Refugee Office works with the federal government and partner agencies to provide them with support services, said Bailey Pennington, a spokeswoman for the health department. The state’s refugee office is ""not aware of such actions"" mentioned in Lee’s tweet, Pennington said. ICE agents in North Carolina are also unaware of any drop-offs in Huntersville, agency spokesperson Lindsay Williams told PolitiFact NC.  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency often works with ICE to move immigrants across the country. However, when the agency’s facilities get full, they sometimes relocate them without ICE’s help. That has not happened in this case, according to the Customs and Border Protection agency. CBP spokesperson Justin Long said staff with the U.S. Border Patrol hasn’t released migrants into Huntersville this year. This isn’t the first time PolitiFact has checked rumors about the government allegedly dropping off immigrants in U.S. cities.  In April, bloggers falsely claimed that the Biden administration was ""busing thousands of illegals to red states to get permanent status."" And in August, a viral Facebook post falsely claimed that the federal government dropped off immigrants illegally in the country at a Mexican restaurant in a small town in northeastern Florida.  Lee said ICE has been releasing immigrants ""in Huntersville #NC13 at big box retail locations"" and suggested the actions are ""illegal."" In PolitiFact’s fact-checking process, the burden of proof is on the person who makes a claim. And we rate statements based on the information available at the time the statement is made.  In this case, Lee provided no evidence for his claim. And federal, state and local authorities say they’re not aware of any effort to transport migrants to Huntersville. If migrants were being transported there, it’s unlikely that the drop-off would be illegal. Migrants who are seeking asylum are allowed to stay in the U.S. until their case is heard, and federal agencies often help them find housing throughout the country.  This claim is False.","[('Tweet by Tyler Lee, candidate for Congress in North Carolina, on Jan. 27, 2022.', 'https://twitter.com/votetylerlee/status/1486747574585417733'), ('Email exchange with Tyler Lee, candidate for Congress in North Carolina.', 'No link'), ('Story by the Washington Post, ""Claims of ‘ghost flights’ of ‘illegal immigrants’ don’t add up,"" posted Feb. 4, 2022.', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/04/claims-ghost-flights-illegal-immigrants-dont-add-up/'), ('Story by the Associated Press, ""Far from border, US cities feel effect of migrant releases,"" posted May 23, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Email exchange with Capt.

GOP chair McDaniel’s false claim about ‘persecution’ and ‘legitimate political discourse’
","On Feb. 5, the members of the Republican National Committee censured Reps. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., for sitting on the House Select Committee investigating the breach of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel told the Washington Post that Cheney and Kinzinger were ""not sticking up for hard-working Republicans."" ""We've had two members engage in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse."" McDaniel said Feb. 4. McDaniel’s framing, which mirrored the words of the censure resolution, didn’t go down well with top Republican leaders. The No. 2 Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota, saw little value to his party by drawing attention to the events of Jan. 6. ""If we want to get our majorities in the fall, it’s better to turn our fire on Democrats, not each other,"" Thune said Feb. 7. Soon after her statement became public, McDaniel recast her words to say they didn’t apply to people who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, but rather to party members who weren’t at the Capitol that day, yet were caught up in the Jan. 6 committee’s broader investigation. Still, between the definition of the word ""persecution,"" the people involved and the nature of the activities the committee is investigating, we found no grounds on which McDaniel’s statement holds up. By the text of the resolution, Cheney’s and Kinzinger’s political sin is their participation on the Jan. 6 committee, which Republicans have opposed.  The two lawmakers agreed to participate after a disagreement over the committee’s makeup resulted in the House GOP leader withdrawing all his nominees.  This work, the resolution says, serves to ""sabotage"" Republican plans to take back the House and Senate. The committee is examining many facets of that day that many Republicans would rather not revisit — not just the violent breach of the Capitol by armed supporters of former President Donald Trump, but also other extralegal efforts to disrupt and subvert the certification of Joe Biden’s election. For example, committee investigators are looking into the submission of uncertified — potentially fraudulent — slates of Trump electors in several states Trump lost. They’re also looking at Trump’s delayed response in calling off the rioters, and his role in inciting the attack in the first place (for which he was impeached before he left office). The censure resolution’s reference to ""legitimate political discourse"" in the context of the violent Jan. 6 attack triggered an uproar, including from some conservatives. Conservative columnist Quin Hillyer tweeted, ""The ‘legitimate political discourse’ line from the RNC might be the single most self-damaging statement by a party committee in history.""  The ""legitimate political discourse"" line from the RNC might be the single most self-damaging statement by a party committee in history. Twitter was flooded with video and photos of the violence that day that contrasted sharply with the notion of ""legitimate political discourse."" In response, McDaniel sent a tweet to clarify what she said was the resolution’s intent. ""Cheney and Kinzinger chose to join Pelosi in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol,"" McDaniel tweeted Feb. 4. Cheney and Kinzinger chose to join Pelosi in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol.The NYT needs to correct this story now, or again expose themselves as political hacks. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said the language in the censure resolution described not the rioters, but others who played a more tangential role. Rubio accused the Jan. 6 committee of harassing an RNC member who was part of the plan to submit uncertified slates of Trump electors to Washington. ""She signed some papers,"" Rubio said. ""She wasn't even in Washington on January 6.""  Even with that revision, McDaniel’s statement about ""persecution of ordinary citizens"" doesn’t hold up. The Republicans said they were thinking of party members who have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee, specifically those who participated in the certification of the false electoral slates. But it’s a stretch to call these people ""ordinary citizens."" They were not merely disgruntled Trump supporters. They were members of a select group of loyal state party members who gained appointment to the Republican National Committee, the party’s leadership tier. They had an official role that rank-and-file Republicans did not enjoy. Every person subpoenaed was either labeled the chairperson or secretary of the slate of Trump electors. The RNC says that didn’t make them less ordinary, and that they had no reason to believe that what they were doing was illegal. The RNC cites Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig to say there is legal precedent for what they did. The activity they engaged in was part of a larger national plan by Trump and his lawyers to throw the results of the 2020 election into limbo, a plan that the majority of legal scholars say lacked a constitutional foundation. Criminal referrals are a possibility, not necessarily solely for the actions the Republican electors took, but for the underlying scheme, which went well beyond what the country has seen this century. That is on top of ongoing investigations by the Justice Department and a grand jury in Georgia that is looking at Trump’s efforts to reverse his loss there. What the participants in this plot have faced from the Jan. 6 committee so far is subpoenas to answer questions. They have not been charged. That does not meet the definition of persecution, which is ""unfair or cruel treatment over a long period of time because of race, religion, or political beliefs.""  The effort to use uncertified slates of electors as a means to cast doubt on results from seven states was integral to Trump’s plans to overturn the election, and asking the participants questions about it easily falls within the committee’s legal scope. McDaniel said that Cheney and Kinzinger engaged ""in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse."" McDaniel said her words applied not to the Capitol rioters but to others who were subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee to answer questions.  But the people she had in mind weren’t ordinary citizens. They purported to be acting in an official capacity and participated in a national level scheme to overturn the 2020 election. Investigating their actions isn’t persecution. It is part of finding the facts. We rate this claim False.

Explaining Oregon's 'permanent' mask mandate in context
","A Republican candidate for Oregon’s governor warned that her incumbent competitor is taking mask mandates to an extreme. ""Governor Kate Brown wants to make Oregon’s mask mandate PERMANENT,"" read a Jan. 5 post from Christin Drazan, a former state representative challenging Brown, who has held the seat since 2015. The link in Drazan’s post invites people to sign a petition to help stop Gov. Kate Brown from making ""Oregon’s mask mandate permanent."" The petition was shared over 1,000 times. The claim appears to stem from a proposal by the Oregon Health Authority to create a permanent mask mandate for public indoor spaces. While the claim conjures images of people wearing masks indefinitely, the state has said its plan would allow for the rule to be overturned when the measure is no longer necessary. Jonathan Modie, lead communicator for the OHA, told PolitiFact that ""permanent"" doesn’t mean that the mandate will last forever — the agency will peel it back when it’s deemed safe to do so.  As the Associated Press reported, ""The proposed permanent rule emerged to address a technical glitch in state law that requires the current temporary to expire in early February — after the predicted peak of the omicron wave."" As it is, the agency’s mask mandates have been temporary, lasting only 180 days. Oregon’s current mandate, for example, began in November 2021 and will last until Feb. 8, at which point the agency must take action to extend it, if needed. ""OHA could rescind the rule as conditions with the pandemic improve,"" Modie said. State epidemiologist Dean Sidelinger said during a Jan. 21 press conference that the state would revoke the masking rule when COVID-19 no longer threatens to overwhelm Oregon’s hospitals and therapeutic drugs are more widely available. ""We need to look at the number of COVID-19-positive folks in the hospital who are receiving care and the impact on the ability of the hospitals to provide care,"" Sidelinger said later in a Jan. 28 press release. ""What we know right now is that those numbers are still increasing but are anticipated to peak soon — within the next week to week and a half — and then are anticipated to come down rather quickly."" Still, the plan generated plenty of backlash from people who were concerned that the agency would not repeal it.  Oregon has adopted some of the strictest COVID-19 rules compared to other states. Like much of the rest of the country, the state in recent months has seen a rise in cases from the omicron variant. A chart on the OHA dashboard shows the sharp increase: By Jan. 16, omicron made up 100% of the monitored cases.  ""We are still in the process of formulating our decision about an indoor mask rule, so I don’t have any additional info on whether or how any metrics for lifting an indoor mask rule – a question we’ve gotten a lot – would be integrated into the rule,"" Modie said on Feb. 3. Trey Rosser, Drazan’s campaign manager, told PolitiFact the campaign was borrowed from the ""Governor Brown administration's own words."" ""It has no expiration date,"" Rosser said. ""Though it can be repealed, the Oregon Health Authority has provided no information regarding when or by what metrics they would repeal the rule. A rule without an expiration date nor a timeline for repeal is a permanent rule."" We reached out to Brown’s office, but did not receive a response for comment. We did not find that Brown herself has weighed in on the proposal to make this mask mandate permanent. But  Brown has defended the decision to take action with mandates in the past, as The Oregonian reported in August 2021: ""We’re still in the midst of a pandemic and I will take the actions that I need to keep Oregonians safe, healthy and alive and make sure that we have adequate hospital capacity."" In a Facebook petition, Drazan said Oregon’s governor wants to make mask mandates permanent. The state’s public health agency, which falls under Brown’s administration, has issued a proposal to put a permanent mandate in place in order to extend the mandate without an expiration date, unlike the current temporary mandates. The agency says it will be able to repeal the mandate once it’s deemed safe to do so, but it has not provided a date certain for when that might happen. We have not found any evidence that Brown herself has spoken specifically in support of the permanent mandate proposal. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

Facebook meme says Ted Cruz a flip-flopper on president needing to be U.S.-born
","Canadian-born Ted Cruz, the Texas senator lately embarked on a bid for president, conveniently flip-flopped on whether a candidate needs to be born in the United States to run for president, an online meme suggests. We speak of this March 26, 2015, Facebook post: SOURCE: Facebook post, March 26, 2015 The post quotes the pictured Cruz, who was born in Calgary, Alberta, in December 1970 to an American mother and a Cuban-born father, saying Barack ""Obama’s mother’s citizenship is irrelevant since his father wasn’t American and he wasn’t born in America. He can’t be president."" Constitutional provision That comment would have been of a piece with inaccurate ""birther"" charges about the Democratic president, who was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in August 1961 to an American mother and Kenyan father. At issue is the constitutional provision requiring any president to be a ""natural born citizen"" of the United States--meaning the person must be a citizen at birth, most legal experts concur. The candidate also must be 35 years of age and a U.S. resident for 14 years. What does it mean to be a ""natural born citizen""? Most legal experts contend it means someone is a citizen from birth and doesn’t have to go through a naturalization process to become one. And if that’s the definition, then Cruz is a natural born citizen by being born to an American mother and having her citizenship at birth. (See a full rundown of Cruz’s eligibility in this updated PolitiFact story.) Cruz flip-flop? The Facebook post, making the case for Cruz’s flip-flop, says Cruz said March 23, 2015, the day he announced his presidential candidacy: ""All you need to know about my parentage is my mother was a citizen. My father and place of birth are irrelevant."" Hypocrite! No confirmation of either comment Except, ahem, an extensive search of the Nexis news database and online news sources yields no sign of Cruz, a Houston lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, making either statement. Our searches led us only to a March 26, 2015, web post on Debunkr.net saying the same; Cruz hasn’t made these comments. We asked Cruz’s campaign if Cruz had ever said Obama couldn’t be president for anything connected to his birthplace. He ""has not,"" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed. In news stories dating from 2013 to the present, Dallas Morning News reporter Todd J. Gillman, who heads that paper’s Washington, D.C., bureau, has detailed Cruz’s citizenship actions including a decision to legally end his dual U.S.-Canada citizenship in June 2014. At the time, Cruz made his birth certificate available to reporters:  SOURCE: Email, Catherine Frazier, then-press secretary, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, to Jonathan Tilove, chief political writer, Austin American-Statesman, Aug. 19, 2013 Previously, Gillman took note of a Mother Jones magazine article stating Cruz’s father, Dallas-area pastor Rafael Cruz, had made a comment while stumping for his son that suggested Obama be sent back to Kenya. In September 2012, the elder Cruz spoke of sending Obama ""back to Kenya."" That's the land of birth for Obama's father, the News noted in a Nov. 1, 2013, news story, though the 44th president was born in Hawaii, ""making him a natural-born American two ways -- by birth on American soil and because his mother was from Kansas."" ""We have our work cut out for us,"" the elder Cruz told a North Texas Tea Party gathering Sept. 12, 2012, as later revealed by Mother Jones. ""We need to send Barack Obama back to Chicago. I'd like to send him back to Kenya, back to Indonesia."" At the time, Frazier said the pastor did not speak for his son. Ted Cruz subsequently said his father made an ""ill-advised joke,"" the News reported. Our ruling A Facebook meme indicates Ted Cruz has conveniently flip-flopped on whether the president must be U.S.-born. We found no evidence Cruz made the presented comments or that he’s changed his position about the ""natural born citizen"" provision. While he’s spoken occasionally about his own birth and citizenship, he appears not to have made declarations about Obama’s origins. This makes the Facebook post factually unsupported and ridiculous.

Bernie Sanders: GOP budget does not ask ultra-wealthy to contribute 'one penny' to deficit reduction
","If the Republicans’ proposed budget reduces the deficit, the country’s ultra-wealthy won’t have anything to do with it, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Sanders, who is an Independent but caucuses with Democrats, tweeted a meme March 23 that said, ""From 2013-2015, the richest 14 Americans increased their net wealth by more than $157 billion, yet the Republican budget would not require these Americans to contribute one penny to deficit reduction."" Both the House and the Senate have passed Republican budget proposals for Fiscal Year 2016, and they're working on reaching a final deal. We wondered if the 14 wealthiest Americans really had made $157 billion in just two years. and whether these individuals would contribute to deficit reduction under the budget proposal. The $157 billion The first part of Sanders’ claim is on point. His staff made the calculation using the Forbes 400 list, which tracks net wealth of the world’s richest people. We won’t recreate the whole list here, but the top-14 includes the likes of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, investor Warren Buffett and members of the Walton family, who founded Wal-Mart. One minor thing -- Sanders’ list accidentally left out Alice Walton, ranked No. 8, but included Google co-founder Sergey Brin, ranked No. 15. We calculated it both ways (with Walton and without Brin, and vice versa), and the difference was negligible, so we won’t take issue with that minor discrepancy. Forbes data shows that the 14 wealthiest Americans were collectively worth $450.3 billion in March 2013. As of March 2015, they are worth $607.4 billion. That’s a difference of $157.1 billion. The biggest leap was that of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who went from a net worth of $13.3 billion in 2013 to $33.4 billion today. That’s a $20.1 billion change. Does their wealth go untouched by the Republican budget? It’s really hard to say. The Republican budget The first question is whether the Republican budget proposals -- one out of the House, another out of the Senate -- reduce the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan government research agency, says they would. In a recent report, CBO found that the Senate Republican proposal would reduce the deficit by $4.9 trillion over 10 years, compared to the baseline. (The baseline assumes current law continues without any change.) Another report found that the House Republican proposal -- which passed the chamber -- would reduce the deficit by $5.3 trillion over 10 years. In broad strokes, the proposals say they accomplish deficit reduction through a combination of spending cuts (such as repealing the Affordable Care Act) of about $5 trillion and closing tax loopholes. The proposals also say they will not raise taxes on anyone at any income level -- they assume that revenue over the next 10 years will be about what it is expected to be under current law. ""Along with lower rates, we propose broadening the tax base by closing special interest loopholes that distort economic activity,"" the House proposal reads, without getting any more specific. There’s nothing in either the Senate or House proposal that specifically addresses the ultra-wealthy. The ultra-wealthy could, though, contribute to the deficit reduction by either paying more taxes or taking some sort of hit in the spending cuts. The problem here is that a federal budget resolution is not a line-item appropriation bill. Rather, it is a list of spending targets and policy priorities. To pass the spending outlined in the budget requires additional legislation. This means that we have no idea how different spending targets will be reached, nor do we know the specifics of the tax reforms. ""The only thing budget resolutions really do is say how much or little we will be spending in each area of government,"" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the nonpartisan think tank Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""From that perspective, no budget resolution can specifically ask anything from the wealthy for deficit reduction – it’s just not how they are designed,"" Goldwein added. We posed Sanders’ statement to the Senate Budget Committee staff, and they told us that it is up to the authorizing committees to determine how the spending cuts and tax reforms are enacted. So we don’t know who or what will specifically cause the deficit reduction. The CBO says outright that it cannot determine the effect on how the budget would impact individuals’ taxes without knowing the particulars. The top 1 percent of earners currently pay a median income tax rate of about 30 percent. But there’s nothing to suggest they would be contributing above and beyond current levels. A spokesman for the Democratic members of the Senate Budget Committee (which includes Sanders) told us that because the budgets don't increase revenue or taxes, the ultra-wealthy are not required to contribute to deficit reduction.  The flip side of that coin is that no one at any income level is required to contribute extra to deficit reduction.  It’s likely that broad-based spending cuts suggested in the proposals would likely have some sort of impact on individuals at every level of wealth, meaning even the ultra-wealthy would have to sacrifice something as part of Republicans’ plan to reduce the deficit, Goldwein added. But again, without knowing the specifics, it’s impossible to know with certainty. Curtis Dubay, a tax policy fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, pointed out an issue of words: Sanders’ claim talks about net wealth, when the government does not tax wealth directly (except for the estate tax) -- it taxes income. ""It would be more germane if he cited how much income the richest Americans earned, but that would be a different list since income and wealth are different,"" Dubay said. Our ruling Sanders said, ""From 2013-2015, the richest 14 Americans increased their net wealth by more than $157 billion, yet the Republican budget would not require these Americans to contribute one penny to deficit reduction."" The 14 richest Americans’ net wealth did go up by about $157 billion between 2013 and 2015. The proposed Republican budget does not ask anything specific of the ultra-wealthy. It does not raise taxes, but it says it intends to streamline the tax code. However, these are broad strokes -- not specific legislation. So we don’t know how lawmakers would specifically handle these proposals, and we don’t know how they would impact the ultra-wealthy. Sanders’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, so we rate it Half True.","[('Sen.

Jeb Bush praises Florida for closing achievement gap
","In his first foray into New Hampshire as a potential Republican presidential contender, former Gov. Jeb Bush talked up Florida’s record on education during his tenure. Bush, who was governor between 1999 and  2007, talked about how the state stopped automatically moving up third-graders to fourth grade if they weren’t deemed ready. (The old approach has sometimes been called ""social promotion."") And he also touted that during his tenure Florida started the state’s voluntary prekindergarten program. Such policies paid off, Bush said. ""We had significant gains, particularly with kids in poverty,"" Bush said at a business roundtable in Hudson, N.H., March 13. ""Florida continues to be one of the states that does the best with low-income kids, and we are one of the few states that has actually had a narrowing of the achievement gap based on income, or based on race or ethnicity."" Is Bush correct that Florida is one of the few states that narrowed the achievement gap for minorities and the poor? We took a closer look. The achievement gap for Hispanics and blacks When we asked Matt Gorman, a spokesman for Bush’s Right to Rise PAC, for evidence supporting Bush’s claim, he sent us some data from the National Center for Education Statistics, an office of the U.S. Education Department, originating with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP. This test, which measures a sample of fourth- and eighth-graders nationwide on math and reading, is dubbed ""the nation’s report card"" because the data can be used to draw comparisons between states and among racial, ethnic and income groups. ""Achievement gaps"" occur when one group of students outperforms another group in average scores, as long as the difference is statistically significant. The size of such gaps, and how they compare to past gaps, can vary widely, depending upon the years and subgroups chosen. Not surprisingly, Bush zeroed in on some of the statistics that put Florida in the most favorable light. Gorman pointed to test results comparing 2003 with 2013 that showed that Florida had narrowed the achievement gap between white and black students in fourth and eighth grade, on both the math and reading tests. That claim checks out -- an Education Department spokesman confirmed that Florida was the only state to narrow that gap for both grade levels and for subject matters for that specific time span. However, by changing the date range, we found different results. For example, Florida didn’t narrow the white-black gap if we compared certain other years between 2000 and 2013. (A caveat: 2003 was the first year that all the states had to participate in NAEP. In previous years, some didn’t.) Meanwhile, the data for ethnicity and income -- also cited by Bush -- are more problematic for Bush’s claim. Florida failed to narrow the gap by much between whites and Hispanics between 2003 and 2013 for fourth-grade math, eighth-grade math  or eighth-grade reading. The one gap that did narrow was fourth-grade reading. (We’ll note that sometimes the gap narrowed, but if it was only slightly NAEP does not consider the state to be among the ones that narrowed the gap.) As for income, NAEP looks at students who are eligible for free and reduced lunches and compares them to those who are not. For this comparison, Gorman pointed to a different set of years -- 2003 and 2009. That time span was mentioned in a report by the Education Trust; it stated that Florida significantly narrowed the gap between low-income and higher-income students in fourth-grade reading. The gap for fourth-grade reading narrowed by 8 percentage points in Florida (and three other states), compared to a narrowing of 2 points nationally. Overall, then, Bush has a point about Florida narrowing the white-black gap, but the support for Florida having narrowed the white-Hispanic gap is weak. On income, Bush has a point that Florida narrowed the gap, at least for particular years. It’s worth noting that in some cases Florida’s gap was already smaller than the nation as a whole, making it difficult for Bush to have overseen further narrowing of the gap. For example in 2013, the NAEP showed that Florida’s Hispanic fourth-graders ranked the first state in the nation for highest average reading score. And we’ve heard before from experts who say we can’t simply compare Florida’s Hispanics to Hispanics in other states when income and other factors play a role, too. Also, it’s hard to say how much Bush’s policy changes contributed to the improvements in achievement, since other demographic or economic factors outside the governor’s influence could have played a role. University of Iowa education professor David Bills said that before he could conclude that Florida ""did"" anything to narrow the Hispanic-white gap, he would have to know about changes in the state’s Hispanic population -- for example, if their income had gone up or down. Our ruling Bush said Florida is ""one of the few states that has actually had a narrowing of the achievement gap based on income, or based on race or ethnicity."" Changes in the achievement gap can vary widely depending on the years studied, the tests chosen and the student groups measured, but Bush can point to fairly strong evidence on the black-white gap narrowing, fairly weak evidence of improvements in the white-Hispanic gap, and modest evidence backing up gains among poorer students. As for how unique Florida is, Bush has a point that it was the only state to consistently narrow the gap between black and white students, at least on math and reading tests between 2003 and 2013. The state wasn’t a national leader in closing the achievement gap between whites and Hispanics, though Florida’s Hispanic students are a leader on fourth-grade reading scores. On balance, then, Bush is more correct than not, so we rate his claim Mostly True.","[('WMUR, Former Gov.

Has PolitiFact rated Scott Walker the nation's ""most factually-challenged"" politician?
","The Wisconsin Democratic Party posted a statement on its website March 17, 2015 that criticizes Gov. Scott Walker's state budget proposal -- and claims Walker ""has been rated America’s most factually-challenged politician."" A belittling label, even coming from the opposing party, for a Republican who is formulating a 2016 run for the White House. Since we’re in the fact-checking business, we wondered what the party was using as its source. Turns out it's us. Flattering. But we’ve never done that kind of rating. And the party’s analysis has some big holes in it. Ratings The party’s statement links to a post on its website from October 2014. That earlier post cites a January 2014 article by PolitiFact National about the 10 most-fact-checked people on the Truth-O-Meter at the time. The article tallied all PolitiFact fact checks -- those done by PolitiFact National (since 2007), as well as PolitiFact Wisconsin (since 2010) and the other PolitiFact state operations. President Barack Obama topped the list, with 500 fact checks. Coming in ninth, with 85 fact checks, was Walker -- just behind Hillary Clinton and ahead of U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. The Democratic Party said that, based on the tallies, 54 percent of the 85 Walker statements had been rated Mostly False, False or Pants on Fire -- and that that percentage was higher than anyone else on the top 10 list. OK. But there are several problems with using our ratings to make the claim the party did. The first is obvious. The Democrats based their claim on only the top 10 list, which -- as one might expect -- was dominated by politicians who ran for president or were from states that had PolitiFact operations.   That ignores all of the other office holders, former office holders and candidates around the country that PolitiFact has fact checked -- including more than 130 such politicians in Wisconsin alone. More importantly, we don't rate politicians in the way the Democratic Party's claim suggests. We don’t rate every single claim a person makes. Rather, we choose a statement based largely on whether it is interesting and timely, and we give it a rating based on our research and reporting. And those ratings apply to the individual statements. We don't make sweeping generalizations about a politician's overall facility with the facts. Some notes before we close. To date, PolitiFact has fact-checked 130 Walker statements. Just over 51 percent of them have been rated True, Mostly True or Half True; nearly 49 percent have been rated Mostly False, False, or Pants on Fire. Meanwhile, we have previously rated 18 claims from the Wisconsin Democratic Party. One was rated True and one was rated Half True; the other 16 were rated Mostly False, False or Pants on Fire. A few days ago, PolitiFact National put in one snapshot a summary of the Truth-O-Meter records of Walker and nine other likely presidential candidates for 2016. Check it out. Our rating The state Democratic Party said Walker ""has been rated America’s most factually-challenged politician."" But the party misuses our data to claim we said something we never did.

Price's point about rising deficits on the money
","It’s budget time in the nation’s capital. And, as the GOP produces its first spending proposals since President Barack Obama took office, a metro Atlanta voice is central to the discussion. U.S. Rep. Tom Price, R-Roswell unveiled his 2016 budget resolution as House budget chair last week. It would reduce spending by $5.5 trillion in the next 10 years in a bid to produce a budget surplus by 2025. The House on Thursday narrowly approved a budget that follows much of Price’s blueprint but also adds $38 billion in war funding. The original plan, though, made it clear that even with attention to military spending, the focus would be spending cuts. ""Under current conditions, by 2023, interest payments on the nation’s debt alone will be $722 billion,"" Price wrote in the budget blueprint. ""That will be larger than (Congressional Budget Office’s) projected defense spending budget of $696 billion."" Most budget watchers have played down those claims, since fiscal conservatives and defense hawks have just worked to pass a budget that opens up Senate negotiations over a so-called reconciliation package that can go after Obamacare. But is the Price blueprint right? Without spending reductions, will taxpayers be paying more to carry debt than to have a standing military? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. Price cites the Congressional Budget Office for his projections. The CBO is a federal, nonpartisan agency that has provided Congress with budget and economic information since its creation in 1974. The agency publishes projections several times a year, based on its detailed formulas that look at current laws, historic spending, revenue trends and other previous projections. The figures that Price cites are in the January budget and economic outlook for 2015 to 2025. Based on information from December 2014, the report estimates that the nation’s debt will be about 2.6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product for the year. That’s the smallest deficit relative to the nation’s economic output since 2007 but just under the 50-year historical average of 2.7 percent of GDP. And, tucked into the tables that help examine the rising deficits are the exact numbers that Price cites. On page 13, a table of the agency’s budget projections shows an estimated $722 billion bill for 2023. Deeper into the report, on page 86, the report projects defense spending will total $696 billion. So is it settled? Not quite. First, it’s important to recognize that defense total is a projection based on the spending caps, or sequestration, in effect through 2021. Those cuts are what some of the additional funding restored in the House budget version approved this week. Looking at the CBO projections without the automatic spending reductions, defense spending in 2023 is forecast to be $752 billion – substantially ahead of the projected price tag on the nation’s debt. Then again, that is a short-lived balance. By 2024, even stopping sequestration on defense spending, the CBO projects $777 billion in interest payments and $771 billion on defense. Price has a point when raising concerns about the projected cost of our national debt. And using the CBO projections gives a broad credibility, given the agency’s reputation for high-level, nonpartisan analysis. But there are caveats, said Laura Wheeler, a senior research associate at the Center for State and Local Finance at Georgia State University. After all, the projections are not hard and fast expectations but highly refined estimates on known factors at a snapshot in time. When the January report was released, for instance, the calculations could not account for recent financial woes in Europe, which undoubtedly affect the U.S. economy, or the possibility that American troops could be sent abroad, Wheeler said. ""Based on what we know is going to happen and what has already occurred by trend, this is what the future looks like,"" she said. ""There is a lot that can change, especially in 10 years."" The question then becomes whether defense spending is the yardstick to measure the nation’s rising deficits. That becomes a political discussion, with some favoring military spending as the benchmark and others looking instead at costs such as medical spending. Wheeler, an economist, said many outside analysts prefer to examine the debt level compared with the GDP. As the CBO report points out, the 2014 rate is expected to be just a tenth of a percentage point below the historic rate of 2.7 percent. By 2025, the CBO projects a steep increase, 4 percent of GDP. That goes back to Price’s point, that interest on our national borrowing is projected to grow faster than the economy. That could change, especially if the sluggish economic recovery ramps up. But the projected increases are enough to get people – read political leaders – concerned, Wheeler said. ""This becomes a philosophical debate about how to best handle that concern and when it becomes a problem,"" Wheeler said. ""This is a place to start that conversation."" A big part of Price’s job, for Georgians and all Americans, is to frame that conversation. His first budget proposal claims without change, the nation will be paying more in interest on our debt than our military. His figures are based on the best-available data, which tries to project a decade out. Those projections can and will change, though how is impossible to know. The decision to compare military spending with debt is not a common way to benchmark projections. But even the broader comparisons Price could have made – about the share of the nation’s economic output being spent on interest payments – support that broader argument. We rate his claim True.","[('House Budget Committee, FY 2016 Budget Resolution, March 18, 2015', 'http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fy16budget.pdf'), ('The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Price budget clears first hurdle, but defense fight looms,"" March 19, 2015', 'No link'), ('Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2015 to 2025, Jan. 26, 2015', 'https://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/price-budget-clears-first-hurdle-but-defense-fight/nkZ4R/'), ('Bloomberg News, ""House Votes to Boost U.S. War Funds While Cutting Medicare,"" March 25, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Deborah Kilroe, spokeswoman, Congressional Budget Office, March. 23 - 25, 2015', 'https://www.cbo.gov/publication/49892'), ('Phone interview, Laura Wheeler, economist and senior research associate, Center for State and Local Finance at Georgia State University, March 24, 2015', 'No link'), ('\n\xa0', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-25/house-adopts-plan-to-boost-u-s-war-funds-while-cutting-medicare')]",/factchecks/2015/mar/27/tom-price/prices-budget-point-about-rising-deficits-money/

Social media posts say Michelle Obama is mandating that all day care kids be weighed
","First Lady Michelle Obama’s initiative on healthy eating and physical activity may have been intended to be noncontroversial, but it hasn’t turned out that way. She has faced pushback from critics who assail her call for healthier school lunches as forcing kids to eat unappetizing meals and who say she’s second-guessing parents who know what’s best for their kids better than the government does. Now, a new front against her has opened in the conservative blogosphere: Michelle Obama, critics say, is requiring day care centers to track their children’s weight. A reader tipped us off to this social media phenomenon, which has been driven by such headlines as ""Michelle Obama Sending Government Monitors To Weigh Children In Daycare"" (downtrend.com), ""Government plans to weigh and measure your child in daycare,"" (American Thinker), ""Michelle O Mandates Weighing Children in Daycare,"" (InfoWars), and ""Michelle Obama Now Mandating Daycare Centers Weigh Kids"" (Western Journalism Center). So is Michelle Obama really mandating the weighing of children in day care? No, this rumor is wildly overblown. Here’s how it came about. In 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Michelle Obama was a high-profile supporter of the measure -- she joined her husband in speaking at the bill-signing ceremony -- after it passed the Senate by unanimous consent and the House by a fairly (but not perfectly) party-line vote. The law included a provision (section 223) for a Study on Nutrition and Wellness Quality in Childcare Settings, or SNAQCS. The study was designed to look at four topics: the nutritional quality of foods offered, the amount of physical activity, the amount of sedentary activity and the ways that child care centers and family day care homes can improve their performance on these metrics. On March 23, 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released details on the proposed study, along with a request for public comments. ""Good nutrition is a key to proper childhood development, but not enough is known about the food children are eating in child care and related programs,"" the document reads. Among other things, the study would involve a child food diary to be completed by parents, a standing height and weight form to be collected by study staff, an infant food intake form and a parent interview. If this were a mandatory requirement for all day care centers -- as the blogosphere trumpeted -- that would be pretty intrusive. But it’s not -- it’s a study of a limited number of day care centers and students. The USDA document says it will involve an estimated 3,000 children, 3,753 staff members at child care centers, family day care homes and after-school childcare providers, and 4,175 parents. That’s a tiny fraction of the more than 30 million children in some form of day care -- about one ten-thousandth, to be exact. The Agriculture Department told PolitiFact that the only mandatory aspect of the program is that all facilities receiving federal funding from the Child and Adult Care Food Program will have to fill out a form. Day care centers that don’t participate in that program may be asked on a voluntary basis if they would like to take part as a control group. Moreover, only a small sampling of children at the federally supported centers would ever be weighed, and parents would be allowed to opt their children out of the weighing part if they wish. The headline of the article that sparked the flurry of social media commentary -- published by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website -- was more measured than the later iterations. The Free Beacon piece was titled, ""Feds to Weigh Children in Daycare: USDA collecting data for study mandated by Michelle Obama’s healthy eating law."" The Free Beacon mentioned the fact that the study was limited to 3,000 children high up in the story and quotes at length from the USDA’s explanation of the purpose of the study. Some of the subsequent articles that appeared on the Internet also mentioned the size of the study and the department’s justification for undertaking it, but the headlines glossed over these nuances. (Email inquiries to several of the publications in question were not returned.) ""I'm not responsible for how the blogosphere picks up my stories,"" Elizabeth Harrington, the Beacon reporter who wrote the story, told PolitiFact. ""Though other sites may have gone farther, the mandate in the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, which the First Lady was largely responsible for, is still clear. And that's what I reported on."" Our ruling Bloggers say Michelle Obama ""mandates"" weighing children in day care. A law she supported -- that was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate -- has set in motion a proposed study of how children in day care are eating, and part of the monitoring would include periodically weighing the participating students. However, the headlines of most of the posts on social media painted this as a sweeping, new requirement for all children in day care. That’s not true -- the study aims to track 3,000 children, or about one ten-thousandth of all children in day care. We rate the claim False. CORRECTION, Mar. 27, 2015: This version corrects a mathematical error in the initial posting of this story. Three thousand children is one ten-thousandth of the 30 million children in day care nationally, not one ten-thousandth of 1 percent.","[('U.S. Department of Agriculture, ""Food and Nutrition Service Agency Information Collection Activities: Proposed Collection; Comment Request--Study on Nutrition and Wellness Quality in Childcare Settings (SNAQCS),"" March 23, 2015', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2015-06592.pdf'), ('Washington Free Beacon, ""Feds to Weigh Children in Daycare: USDA collecting data for study mandated by Michelle Obama’s healthy eating law,"" March 26, 2015', 'No link'), ('Snopes.com, ""Weighty Matters,"" March 25, 2015', 'http://freebeacon.com/issues/feds-to-weigh-children-in-daycare/'), ('Govtrack.us, ""S. 3307 (111th): Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010,"" accessed March 26, 2015', 'No link'), ('White House, ""The President & First Lady on Child Nutrition Bill: \'The Basic Nutrition They Need to Learn and Grow and to Pursue Their Dreams,\' "" Dec. 13, 2010', 'https://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/weighed.asp'), ('Los Angeles Times, ""Conservatives dig into Michelle Obama\'s anti-obesity campaign,"" Feb. 26, 2011', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Elizabeth Harrington, reporter with the Washington Free Beacon, March 25, 2015', 'https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/s3307'), ('Email interview with Cullen Schwarz, Agriculture Department spokesman, March 26, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/mar/26/blog-posting/social-media-posts-say-michelle-obama-mandating-al/

Allen West says Obama EPA wants to regulate backyard barbecue
","Hands off our backyard barbecues, says former Rep. Allen West, R-Fla. West -- now the president and CEO of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based free-market think tank -- leapt to the defense of home-cooked meat in a signed item posted on his personal website on March 19, 2015. The article was headlined, ""Two things the EPA wants to regulate in your life,"" and referred to alleged interest by the Environmental Protection Agency in backyard barbecues and hotel shower water. Here’s an excerpt of West’s post: ""Ladies and gents, I just cannot ascertain when the absurdity of this current administration will cease. The weather is finally warming up and one of the rituals of spring and summer is the family BBQ. Well, it is for now until the Environmental Protection Agency has its way. ""As reported by Fox News, ‘the EPA is funding a $15,000 University of California-Riverside study to look at the particulate emissions you breathe when grilling over an open flame. … Why is the EPA concerned about BBQ grill emissions? Who are these people and why are they using one single dime of American taxpayer dollars for this tomfoolery?"" A reader saw West’s claim about barbecue and asked us to check it out. So we took a look at whether West was correct that the EPA wants to regulate the family BBQ. According to the Fox News article cited by West, ""the EPA is funding a $15,000 University of California-Riverside study to look at the particulate emissions you breathe when grilling over an open flame."" The study in question can be found on an EPA webpage for ""extramural research"" -- that is, research funded by EPA but carried out by external researchers. This particular study was titled, ""Technology for the Reduction of Particulate Matter Emissions for Residential Propane BBQs,"" and was to be undertaken by four researchers at the University of California-Riverside between Aug. 15, 2014, and Aug. 14, 2015. The project amount was $15,000. The objective? ""To perform research and develop preventative technology that will reduce fine particulate emissions ... from residential barbecues. This technology is intended to reduce air pollution as well as health hazards in Southern California, with potential for global application,"" according to the EPA website. So West’s claim hasn’t been made up from whole cloth. But it’s still pretty misleading. Most importantly, there’s a big difference between funding a small scientific grant and actually seeking to regulate an activity. The EPA makes clear that this grant isn’t exactly the camel’s nose under the tent. ""EPA does not regulate backyard barbecues and does not plan to in the future,"" the agency said in a statement to PolitiFact. (The Fox News article did mention this disclaimer toward the end of its story.) The difference between supporting a study and setting national policy is especially wide in this case, because the funding comes from a national student design competition -- the ""P3 Awards: A National Student Design Competition for Sustainability Focusing on People, Prosperity and the Planet."" The other study mentioned in West’s post, the one about hotel water monitoring, also stemmed from the same student design competition. This project ""aims to develop a novel, low-cost, wireless device for monitoring water use from hotel guest room showers,"" that could eventually be ""marketed to the hotel industry to reduce costs by promoting water conservation among hotel guests,"" according to the EPA’s summary. By West’s standard, would projects hosted by the White House at its science fair on March 23 also constitute a roadmap for future policymaking? Will the high school projects for a wearable breathalyzer wristband, or a system for turning algae into a biofuel -- two real projects hosted at the science fair -- automatically become guideposts for future federal rulemaking? We don’t think so. (West’s press office didn’t reply to two emails for this article.) Our ruling West said the ""EPA wants to regulate … the family BBQ."" Reasonable people can disagree over whether the research projects in question are worth spending tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayer funds. But it’s wrong to say, as West does, that their existence demonstrates that the EPA ""wants to"" regulate backyard barbecues. The EPA says it isn’t seeking to do so, and the projects in question are examples of scientific inquiry, not examples of federal rulemaking. We rate the claim False.","[('Allen West, ""Insanity: Two things the EPA wants to regulate in your life,"" March 19, 2015', 'http://allenbwest.com/2015/03/insanity-two-things-the-epa-wants-to-regulate-in-your-life/'), ('Environmental Protection Agency, ""Developing a Wireless Device for Monitoring Water Usage for Hotel Showers,"" accessed March 25, 2015', 'No link'), ('Environmental Protection Agency, ""Technology for the Reduction of Particulate Matter Emissions for Residential Propane BBQs,"" accessed March 25, 2015', 'http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/10274'), ('Fox News, ""Lawmaker calls for a rebellion against EPA pollution emissions for backyard barbecues,"" March 17, 2015', 'No link'), ('Fox2 St. Louis, ""St. Louis politician calls for tasty protest against proposed EPA barbecue regulations – #PorkSteakRebellion,"" March 16, 2015', 'http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/10266/report/0'), ('White House, ""President Obama Hosts 5th White House Science Fair,"" March 23, 2015', 'No link'), ('Environmental Protection Agency, statement to PolitiFact, March 25, 2015', 'http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2015/03/17/lawmaker-calls-for-rebellion-against-epa-pollution-emissions-for-backyard/')]",/factchecks/2015/mar/26/allen-west/allen-west-says-obama-epa-wants-regulate-backyard-/

Greg Abbott says Dallas minority students fare better on AP exams than students any place in America
","Gov. Greg Abbott, who’s vowed to make the Texas education system No. 1 in the country, told lawmakers that some Dallas students already lead the pack. In his February 2015 State of the State address, Abbott hammered his goal again, saying: ""As we look to some of  these challenges, the way I see is that our journey begins with striving to create the best education system in America. ""We’ve seen that we can do it,"" Abbott said. ""In Dallas, for example, African-American and Hispanic students pass AP exams at a higher rate than any other place in America."" AP, as in advanced placement, tests are offered through the nonprofit College Board. Exam scores of thre or higher, on a five-point scale, qualify students for college credit. We sought to learn the basis of Abbott’s Dallas declaration. Abbott's office did not engage. But responding by email, a spokesman for the Dallas school district, André Riley, referred us to research by the Dallas-based National Math and Science Initiative based on data provided by the district. Riley noted an October 2014 initiative press release stating that according to AP test results in 2013-14, ""a minority student in Dallas is more than twice as likely to earn a qualifying score on an AP math or science exam than in any other large urban school district in the country."" That’s not any other place, which is what Abbott said, though it’s close to any comparably populous place. It’s also not a ranking that takes into account all the AP subject-matter exams, unlike what Abbott said. According to the release, the Dallas district was the first in the nation to partner with the initiative ""in its effort to raise academic rigor and increase the number of students who graduate from high school college-ready."" Since 2008, the release said, the initiative’s College Readiness Program has been implemented in more than 620 schools across 26 states. The release said the initiative’s funding, which covers stipends for teacher training plus AP-related equipment and supplies, was provided by the Texas Instruments Foundation and the O’Donnell Foundation. Separately, a January 2015 news story by KERA, a Dallas public radio station, said the initiative, which has worked with Dallas students since 1996, ""offers Saturday study sessions, pays the hefty exam fees for students, gathers teachers together for professional development and even gives teachers better books or lesson plans if they need them."" And, the story said, the initiative offers cash for success, giving $100 to each student who passes a math, science or English exam, and $100 to the teacher for each passing student. Generally, the story said, the intent was to prime students for jobs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Seeking elaboration, we contacted the initiative; spokeswoman Tara Marathe said by email the initiative reached its conclusion about Dallas minority students by comparing 2013-14 results for African American and Hispanic students in Dallas to results on the math, science and English AP exams for such students in similarly large districts with comparable shares of low-income and African American and Hispanic students. Marathe said the upshot was that an African American or Hispanic student in Dallas appeared twice as likely to earn a qualifying score on an AP math or science exam as a minority student in similar large urban districts. Specifically, Marathe said, districts chosen for the comparisons had to have at least half the Dallas district’s total African-American and Hispanic high school juniors and seniors (about 7,500 or more); be at least 75 percent Hispanic and African-American as a whole; and have 75 percent of students qualifying for free- and reduced-price lunches. ""There were 15,194 junior and senior African-American and Hispanic students in Dallas in 2013-14, who earned 948 passing AP math and science scores,"" Marathe wrote. ""This rate of 62 minority passing exams per 1,000 minority juniors and seniors is more than twice what we see in similar urban districts."" Marathe said the initiative’s agreements with the College Board ""prevent us"" from sharing detailed data for other districts. But she said the comparison swept in public schools in Houston, Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Phoenix, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Chicago, Miami, Baltimore, San Diego, Louisville and San Antonio. Next, we asked the College Board if it had confirmed the Dallas-above-all ranking. By email, spokesman Zach Goldberg said the initiative is a partner with the board ""and we have no reason to doubt what they have provided."" Wondering if Abbott’s mention of the Dallas students outscoring peers from ""any place in America"" might hold up just for math and science results, we applied the initiative’s methodology to a couple other Texas districts, drawing enrollment data from a Texas Education Agency website. By our calculations, the Dallas district’s result of 62 minority passing exams per 1,000 minority juniors and seniors ran behind the 83 passing exams per 1,000 minority juniors and seniors in the Round Rock school district. The Dallas result ran ahead of the 34 passing exams per 1,000 minority juniors and seniors in the Austin district. Our ruling Abbott said Dallas ""African-American and Hispanic students pass AP exams at a higher rate than any other place in America."" That’s an overly broad recap of research indicating that such students in Dallas passed math and science AP exams at a better clip than peers in more than 15 districts nationally with like demographics. This conclusion, that is, didn’t sweep in every AP test nor did it extend to the Dallas students outpacing students everywhere else. On balance, we rate Abbott’s statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.","[('Press release, ""Governor Abbott delivers State of the State address, releases governor\'s budget,"" Gov.

Liberty University students faced $10 fine if they skipped Ted Cruz presidential speech
","Every politician likes a packed house, and when Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, announced that he was officially running for president this week, he got one. About 11,000 students at Liberty University in Virginia were on hand when Cruz came to their campus. But as Jess McIntosh, the spokeswoman for the abortion rights group Emily’s List noted, they weren’t there necessarily by choice. ""Students were mandated to be in attendance or they would be fined,"" McIntosh told Chris Hayes on MSNBC on March 24, 2015. ""Not as much as they would be fined for possessing R-rated movies or practicing witchcraft, but still, they had to pay money if they didn’t want to see him."" McIntosh wasn’t the only person to make this point, and a reader asked us to see what was up at Liberty University. In this case, McIntosh gets an A for accuracy, although there was no special rule related to Cruz. The university, founded by televangelist Jerry Falwell, requires its 13,500 residential students to attend as many as three events each week as part of a program called Convocation. There are sermons by guest pastors, performances from Christian entertainers and talks by leaders in many fields. What happens if you don’t go? The university’s student appeals court handbook has the list of consequences for various infractions. Missing Convocation is on the list. (A reprimand is a formal mark against a student’s record.) Here’s what the handbook says: Each student should be familiar with these sanctions. 1 Reprimand:  Late for curfew (1 additional reprimand for each 30 minutes late)  Late for Convocation (1 additional reprimand for each 15 minutes late)  4 Reprimands + $10.00 Fine:  Absence from required meeting (Convocation, etc.)  Disturbance/non-participation during Convocation  Dress/hair code violation (male or female)  Cruz’s presidential announcement was scheduled as a Convocation event by the university, therefore the penalty for a student’s absence would be four reprimands and a $10 fine. Liberty University issued a statement about Cruz’s speech that confirmed that ""missing Convocation is only a minor penalty, a $10 fine."" University President Jerry Falwell Jr. addressed the Convocation requirement in a separate statement after Cruz’s address. ""Convocation speakers do not all line up with traditional Evangelical Christian viewpoints or even Liberty University’s doctrinal statement. A fundamental part of the college experience is being exposed to a variety of viewpoints so students can better understand why they hold their own beliefs and be better prepared to defend them."" Students were aware of the rule. One of them posted about it on her Facebook page. Citing another student, she wrote, ""Students will either attend Convocation and lend to the illusion of widespread support for Sen. Cruz, or they will be subject to administrative punishment -- specifically, four reprimands and a $10 fine -- if they are absent."" We have plenty of questions about the fine system, but Liberty University officials didn’t get back to us before our deadline.   Among our unanswered questions: If the crowd at Cruz’s announcement was 11,000 -- as reported by Liberty -- does that mean at least 2,500 students skipped the event and are subject to a fine? How does Liberty University take attendance? (We did find this seating chart that might begin to explain that question.) How many attendance fines were issued in 2014, or any other period of time? (Update: After our fact-check published, students and alumni helped us fill in some of these details. You can read more here.) Incidentally, McIntosh is also correct about the greater sanctions for worse offenses. There’s a penalty on the books of 12 reprimands and a $50 fine for seeing an R-rated movie, deception, and participating in an unauthorized petition or demonstration. Participating in a seance, witchcraft or other demonic activity carries a $500 fine, 30 hours of community service, 30 reprimands and possible expulsion. Our ruling McIntosh said Liberty University students ""were mandated"" to attend Cruz’s presidential announcement ""or they would be fined."" Cruz’s speech was part of a regular program at the university called Convocation. By the letter of the law, students are required to attend or pay a $10 fine. The private university wouldn’t tell us if they issued any fines to students skipping Cruz’s speech, how the system works and how often fines are issued. McIntosh’s claim is accurate. We rate it True.","[('MSNBC, All in with Chris Hayes, March 24, 2015', 'https://on.msnbc.com/1CNedVB'), (""National Journal, These Students 'Stand with Rand' at Ted Cruz's 2016 Announcement, March 23, 2015"", 'No link'), ('Bloomberg, Ted Cruz Has Skeptics at Liberty, and They Use Yik Yak, March 23, 2015', 'http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/students-stand-with-rand-cruz-20150323'), ('Jessica Kramer Facebook page, post, March 23, 2015', 'No link'), ('Liberty University, Student Appeals Court handbook, 2010-2011', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-23/ted-cruz-has-skeptics-at-liberty-and-they-use-yik-yak'), ('Liberty University, Convocation schedule', 'No link'), ('Liberty University, University statement: Clarification for media reports on Convocation, March 23, 2015', 'https://www.facebook.com/jessica.kramer.9469/posts/466801033472139?pnref=story'), ('Liberty University, Sen.

Rand Paul says polls show he has the best shot at beating Hillary Clinton
","Among the potential Republican contenders, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., says he is best-positioned to take on likely Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. In an interview with Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who asked about his chances at a win, Paul said, ""I think when you see my polling, the polling that's out there so far, nobody is doing better against Hillary Clinton than myself."" ""Also though, when you poll people not just against each other, but against the other side, that shows which candidate has the best chance of picking up the independent vote,"" he added. ""And right now I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton in certain purple states. I'm the only one that also scores above all the other Republicans in whether or not I can beat her."" We wondered if Paul really is doing the best in polls against Clinton in a hypothetical 2016 general election match-up. Paul’s office directed us to a recent CNN/ORC poll that asked participants whether they would vote for Clinton or various Republican candidates in the general election. Indeed, more people said they would vote for Paul over Clinton than they would vote for other Republican candidates over Clinton. In a Paul-Clinton race, 43 percent said they would pick Paul, while 54 percent said they would pick Clinton, according to the CNN/ORC poll. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., came in second place behind Paul, with 42 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 55 percent. However, there are a few contextual issues we’d like to point out. First, the margin of error in the CNN poll is plus or minus three percentage points. Every Republican candidate in this poll came in between 40 percent and 43 percent against Clinton. So taking into account that three-point margin of error, the Republican candidates had more or less the same results, meaning there isn't a clear winner. Additionally, the CNN poll is only one of several polls. Of the seven polls collected by PollingReport.com, a nonpartisan public opinion site, that pit Paul against Clinton, this CNN/ORC is the only one where Paul has a lead among Republicans. This table shows results of the CNN poll and three other recent polls. The percentage that would vote for the Republican candidate is on the left, and the percentage that would vote for Clinton is on the right. The Republican with the best chance against Clinton is bolded in each column. The polls did not ask about every candidate. Candidate (vs. Clinton) CNN 3/13-15 Marist 3/1-4 Quinnipiac 2/26-3/2 Fox 1/25-27 Rand Paul  43% to 54% 40% to 51% 41% to 47% 44% to 47% Jeb Bush  40% to 55% 42% to 49% 42% to 45% 43% to 48% Chris Christie 40% to 55% n/a 39% to 46% 42% to 48% Ted Cruz  n/a 39% to 53% 38% to 48% n/a Scott Walker 40% to 55% 44% to 48% 39% to 48% n/a Ben Carson 40% to 56% n/a n/a n/a Mike Huckabee 41% to 55% n/a 40% to 47% n/a Marco Rubio 42% to 55% 42% to 49% 41% to 46% n/a Rick Perry n/a 42% to 51% n/a n/a Mitt Romney n/a n/a n/a 46% to 46%   As you can see, each poll has a different winner in the match-up against Clinton. So there’s no obvious frontrunner in this regard, with the possible exception of failed 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney in the Fox News poll, where he received the highest percentage of the vote against Clinton among all the poll results (46 percent to 46 percent). But Romney has decided not to run this cycle. Additionally, all of the Republicans are coming within a couple points of each other when compared to Clinton, such as Paul with 43 percent and Rubio with 42 percent in the CNN poll. This downplays Paul’s assertion that ""nobody’s doing better"" than him. ""I doubt any respectable pollsters would say a single percentage point lead suggests that he is ‘doing better’ "" than other candidates against Clinton, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Foundation. Bowman added the Republicans’ results hover around 40 percent in each of these polls because that’s about the percentage of Americans who are Republican or lean right, and it’s fair to assume that any Republican candidate will get core party support. ""So, any Republican will probably get around 40 percent of the vote to start,"" she said, noting that it is still too early to tell which specific candidate would do best against Clinton 18 months from now. ""It is probably easier at this point to see if someone is just a non-starter, if he or she is significantly below that threshold."" We posed Bowman’s analysis to Paul spokeswoman Eleanor May, and she said, ""We all recognize that polling data can be collected a number of different ways and can produce various outcomes. The specific poll Sen. Paul was citing, along with the outlet that conducted the poll publicly declared that Sen. Paul comes closest to beating Hillary Clinton."" It’s also worth noting that in every single one of these match-ups, Clinton wins. (The one exception is the tied Romney-Clinton results in the Fox poll.) In the CNN/ORC poll that Paul cites as showing he’s got the best chance at beating Clinton, she is still ahead by 11 percentage points. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has the best chance against Clinton in the Marist poll, is behind Clinton by 4 percentage points in that poll. Our ruling Paul said that according to recent polls, no Republican candidate ""is doing better against Hillary Clinton than myself."" The big picture shows nearly any Republican candidate getting approximately 40 percent of the vote when matched up against Clinton, so it’s hard to argue that any particular candidate is in the lead in this regard. One poll shows Paul with the highest support among Republicans against Clinton. But the size of the margin of error allows for the possibility that Paul might, in reality, be behind other Republican candidates. Additionally that is the only poll that shows Paul with a lead. Because it’s hard to say if any candidate, so far out from the 2016 election, is the clear frontrunner in a hypothetical race against Clinton, we rate Paul’s claim Mostly False.","[('Fox News, transcript, March 24, 2015', 'http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/03/23/megyn-rand-paul-why-werent-you-first-announce-2016-run'), ('CNN, ""Poll: Hillary Clinton still tops in 2016,"" March 18, 2015', 'No link'), ('PollingReport.com, ""White House 2016: General Election,"" March 15, 2015', 'https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/18/politics/2016-election-poll-clinton-bush/index.html'), ('Email interview, AEI senior fellow Karlyn Bowman, March 24, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Paul spokeswoman Eleanor May, March 24, 2015', 'http://www.pollingreport.com/wh16gen.htm')]",/factchecks/2015/mar/25/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-he-has-best-shot-beating-hillary-cl/

Robin Vos says Walker cut to UW budget is similar to Doyle’s, but Democrats didn’t protest then
","When Gov. Scott Walker proposed a $300 million cut to the state’s university system over two years, Democrats called it a ""massive"" and ""destructive"" blow. That stuck in the craw Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, even though he thought Walker’s plan cut too much. ""Let’s remember that the cut that’s happening under Gov. Walker is about the size of the one that happened under (Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle),"" Vos said March 12, 2015 in an interview on Wisconsin Eye. Vos added: ""I didn’t hear Democrats then complaining about the loss of the university and how the world was going to come to an end."" Vos was responding to a prediction from Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, that the university system would fall from the top ranks nationally for a generation under Walker’s plan. (We rated Mostly True a Barca claim from the interview that ""the average faculty member at UW-Madison brings in close to a quarter million dollars a year"" in grant money). The largest cut to higher education during Doyle’s eight-year tenure came in his 2003-’05 budget, his first. That’s the budget Vos was referring to said aide Kit Beyer.   First, the numbers. Walker’s cut in state support, depending on how you tally it up, amounts to between $278 million and $297 million in the 2015-’17 budget. The Doyle cut, approved by Republican lawmakers, was $250 million from 2003 to 2005. The best comparison is the percentage view: Walker’s cut amounts to between 12 percent and 13 percent of state general-fund aid to the university system; Doyle’s was 12 percent. So, as Vos said, the reductions were quite comparable. But Vos’ analysis skips past an important point. In 2003, Doyle and legislative Republicans allowed tuition to rise by 18 percent, or $150 million. That took a lot of the sting out of the budget cuts. In contrast, Walker has again proposed a tuition freeze, blocking the university from turning to students or their families to backfill the budget. Now to the second part of Vos’ claim, that Democrats didn’t see the 2003 cut in the apocalyptic way they describe Walker’s. We reviewed news releases posted on WisPolitics.com and looked at news stories from that time. Democrats did appear to lay off of Doyle’s UW cuts, at least publicly. One Milwaukee-area Democrat, state Rep. Sheldon Wasserman said: ""We're in a fiscal crisis. The truth is, I think the whole situation is not fair. At this point, although the university is being hit, when you're dealing with life and death (matters), it's a basic triage."" The same can’t be said of UW administrators and student groups, both of whom pushed back pretty hard on the cuts and the tuition increase. ""We don't have too many friends in the Legislature, and I'd like to know why because we're not bad people doing bad things to the state,"" Linda Weimer, the UW System's vice president for university relations, was quoted as saying in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story. Vos focused on Democratic Party legislators in his claim, though, not on students or UW officials. And lawmakers and Doyle defended the cut, in part, by pointing out UW tuition rates were among the lowest in the Big 10 at the time. There’s one other piece of context worth noting when comparing Democratic reaction in 2003 and 2015. Doyle’s 2003 cut was the first significant reduction in state support in years. The previous budget, under Gov. Scott McCallum, cut $12 million; the one before that actually increased state support. The fact that UW had been spared deep cuts in the years leading up to 2003 seemed to mute reaction from both parties to the big Doyle cut. By contrast, under Walker, his proposed 2015-’17 reduction comes four years after cuts of $250 million to universities in his first budget (2011-’13). Our rating Vos said Walker’s proposed reduction in university spending is ""about the size of the one that happened"" under Doyle, but Democrats didn’t treat that  cut as so dire. The one cut Vos referred to, in 2003 under Doyle and legislators, was very similar in size to Walker’s current proposal. It’s worth pointing out though that Doyle, unlike Walker, allowed big tuition hikes to ease the 2003 budget cuts, and that Walker has proposed deeper cuts in the UW System than Doyle in less time. We rate the Vos claim Mostly True.  ","[('Wisconsin Eye interview with Robin Vos and Peter Barca, March 12, 2015', 'http://www.wiseye.org/videoplayer/vp.html?sid=12450'), ('Emails with Kit Beyer, Vos spokeswoman, March 17, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/mar/25/robin-vos/robin-vos-says-walker-cut-uw-budget-similar-doyles/

Ted Cruz longest-serving solicitor general of Texas, Jerry Falwell said
","Republican Ted Cruz declared his candidacy for president to an enthusiastic crowd at Liberty University in Virginia after being introduced by the Christian institution’s president, Jerry Falwell. Falwell, whose late father founded the university in 1971, introduced the Texas senator on March 23, 2015 by proclaiming Cruz accomplishments, including: ""In 2003, he became the solicitor general of Texas, the youngest in the country at that time."" Falwell went on: ""He left only after becoming the longest-serving solicitor general in the history of Texas, achieving an unprecedented series of landmark national victories before the U.S. Supreme Court."" We’re not sure how to tally landmark court wins; time will tell. But did Cruz set a record for service as the Lone Star State’s chief litigator in state and federal appellate courts? It's a short history We first contacted the Texas attorney general's office to inquire about the individuals who have held the title of Texas solicitor general. We learned the post has only been around since January 1999, which would have coincided with John Cornyn, now the state’s senior senator, getting sworn in for his term as attorney general. Before that, the only other position in Texas government that resembled the role of solicitor general was called state solicitor, according to Renea Hicks, an Austin lawyer who formerly held the title. ""There was no office like solicitor general in the state up until 1994,"" Hicks said by phone. ""At that point, the attorney general created the position called state solicitor and that was me."" Hicks said instead of having a team of lawyers to work on appeals like the current solicitor general, he alone reviewed legal briefs and helped prepare appellate attorneys for court appearances. ""It hadn’t grown into anything like the full-fledged division of what it is now,"" Hicks said. Hicks said he served in the role for about year before leaving the AG’s office, but no one formally replaced him until Cornyn established the Office of Solicitor General in 1999. ""He had liked the idea of someone in charge of appellate"" litigation ""for the state,"" Hicks said. So Hicks had his year. And what about individuals later named solicitor general? Solicitors general for Texas A spokeswoman for the AG’s office, Lauri Saathoff, emailed us the following list of Texas solicitors general: Solicitor General, Texas Attorney General’s Office Time Served  Duration Gregory Coleman 09/1999 – 08/2001 1 year and 11 months Julie Parsley 08/2001 – 11/2002 1 year and 3 months Rafael Edward 02/2003 – 05/2008 5 years and 3 months James Ho 04/2008 – 12/2010 2 years and 8 months Jonathan Mitchell 11/2010 – 01/2015 4 years and 2 months Scott Keller 12/2014 – Present 3 months and counting Source:  Email, Lauri Saathoff, Press Secretary, Texas Attorney General’s Office, March 23, 2015  We also checked these names in Who’s Who, where we found that the years Coleman, Cruz and Ho served as solicitor general listed in the database matched the Saathoff's information. In the cases of Parsley and Mitchell -- where the data in Who’s Who was either incomplete or missing -- we checked online websites. The website for Parsley’s current law firm shows the attorney worked as solicitor general from August 2001 to November 2002. Meanwhile, Mitchell’s faculty page at the University of Texas School of Law states the visiting professor was appointed to the position in 2010 and stepped down in January 2015. Our ruling  Falwell said Ted Cruz was ""the longest-serving solicitor general in the history of Texas."" That post has been around less than 20 years.

Blog claims U.S. funded anti-Netanyahu election effort in Israel
","Did President Barack Obama spend U.S. taxpayer dollars trying to toss Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu out of office? That’s a claim floating around conservative media websites in recent days. A conservative blog called Fire Andrea Mitchell was one of several to relay a Fox News report about alleged back-door funding in the recent Israeli elections. On March 16, 2015, the blogger wrote ""Obama has been sending taxpayer dollars, at least $350,000 to fund anti-Likud, anti Netanyahu groups in Israel for tomorrow’s election."" Fox News said a congressional investigation into the matter is underway, and presidential contender Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, along with Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., sent a letter about this to federal officials ""to express our strong concerns over recent media reports."" What are the facts of the matter? The basis of the claim In September 2013, the State Department funded two projects run by OneVoice, a New York nonprofit. The OneVoice mission is clear -- to advance a two-state solution in Israel and the Palestinian territories. ""Through OneVoice, young grassroots activists in Israel and Palestine are equipped with the knowledge and skills to be heard as they build momentum and a constituency for the two-state solution locally and internationally,"" the organization wrote in its 2013 annual report. Affiliates OneVoice Israel got $233,500 from the State Department to spend in Israel and OneVoice Palestine got another $115,776 to spend in the Palestinian Territories. That adds up to a little more than $349,000. The question is: Do those contributions amount to funding ""anti-Likud, anti-Netanyahu groups in Israel for tomorrow’s election""? How OneVoice says the money was spent Given that residents of the Palestinian Territories can’t vote in national Israeli elections, it’s hard to see how money spent there would influence voters in Israel. That leave us to account for $233,500. Payton Knopf, senior director of global communications for OneVoice, said the money helped fund a series of ""town-hall style meetings on university campuses and provided support to the Knesset Caucus for the Two-State Solution in organizing a meeting with 300 Israeli students and (Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud) Abbas in February 2014."" Knopf told us the State Department money was spent by November 2014 -- nearly four months ago. OneVoice, he said, never ""spent any U.S. government funds in connection with the recent elections in Israel.  Claims to the contrary are simply wrong."" There are two important points to unpack there. If OneVoice says it spent the money by November 2014, that would be before the Israeli elections were even scheduled. That happened in December after Netanyahu called for early elections. The State Department said in a briefing that ""no payment was made to OneVoice after November 2014."" That would contradict the way the claim in the blog was phrased. ""Has been sending"" says the money continues to flow. In this case the money was spent and disbursed months ago. Second, while Netanyahu waffled on the notion of a two-state solution in the run-up to the Israeli elections, the prime minister had been on record supporting a two-state strategy in November and the months before it. Where it gets complicated Put aside OneVoice’s explanation for a second. In January 2015, after the Israeli elections had been scheduled, OneVoice announced a partnership with V15, a new Israeli voter mobilization project. The partnership’s mission, as stated in its press release, was to ""disrupt the status quo."" Using methods honed from the Obama campaign, including a key staffer from the president’s 2012 field operation, V15 aimed to put a center-left coalition into power. While its leaders officially denied that they opposed Netanyahu, it was a difference without a distinction. V15 wanted a government that would do more than Netanyahu’s Likud Party to negotiate with the Palestinians. (All you have to do is read parts of V15’s statement after Netanyahu’s victory to know where the group stands: ""A confusing night turned into a painful morning,"" the group said, according to a translation from Arutz Sheva. ""It was painful not because we lost, but because we have no faith in the winners."") So the connecting of the dots goes like this. Obama’s State Department gives OneVoice money. OneVoice trains student activists. Later, OneVoice strikes up a partnership with V15, which is aided by a former Obama campaign hand. V15, a voter mobilization project, wants to ""disrupt the status quo."" The status quo in this case is Netanyahu. A limited money trail The connections between OneVoice, Obama and V15 may raise plenty of questions, but they don’t prove that U.S. tax dollars funded ""anti-Likud, anti Netanyahu groups in Israel for tomorrow’s election."" Gerald M. Steinberg is a professor at Bar Ilan University and head of NGO Monitor, a project that aims to prevent nonprofit meddling in Israeli affairs. Steinberg is suspicious that State Department dollars helped V15, at least indirectly, but he can’t know for sure based on the information available. In a draft report Steinberg shared with PunditFact, all he has are questions. ""Did OneVoice use U.S. government funds to launch V15? If not, and since money is fungible, did U.S. government funds free up other OneVoice financing to facilitate V15? Full transparency on the parts of the U.S. State Department, OneVoice, and V15 is necessary to verify or disprove the allegations and claims."" IRS regulations prohibit a not-for-profit OneVoice from campaigning directly for or against a candidate from office. But there are allowances when it comes to campaigning for issues (a two-state solution) or for promoting civic engagement, which would include voting. It’s worth noting that about a month before the election, the parent organization of OneVoice created PeaceWorks Action, a 501(c)4 group. That IRS designation allows it to engage in outright political lobbying. Funding OneVoice was entirely in line with the administration’s agenda. As far back as 2009, Hillary Clinton said in her Senate confirmation hearing to be secretary of state that in pursuit of a state for Palestinians ""we will exert every effort to support the work of Israelis and Palestinians who seek that result."" Our ruling A conservative blog claimed, ""Obama has been sending taxpayer dollars, at least $350,000 to fund anti-Likud, anti Netanyahu groups in Israel for tomorrow’s election."" First, there is the matter of the dollar amount. If any U.S. money was used to mobilize anti-Likud voters, it would have been in Israel. A more accurate figure would be $233,500. Next, there is a matter of the blog’s tense. ""Has been sending"" says the action is continuing. In this case, the money stopped flowing in 2014, before elections were called in Israel. Finally, the allegation that the money was spent to fund anti-Likud, anti-Netanyahu groups in Israel for the election is based on speculation. Yes, Obama sent money to OneVoice, a group that promoted a two-state solution. And yes that group partnered with a different group V15 that wanted Netanyahu defeated. But there is no paper trail that the money given to OneVoice was spent on an electoral ground game. It would be naive to ignore that OneVoice’s policy positions mesh well with V15’s voter mobilization, but that’s different from saying that American taxpayer dollars were spent by V15. That may change as more evidence comes to light. PunditFact’s rulings are based on when a statement was made and on the information available at that time. This claim rates Mostly False.","[('Fire Andrea Mitchell, Obama funneled $350,000 federal funds to anti-Likud One Voice Movement and Victory 15, March 16, 2015', 'http://www.fireandreamitchell.com/2015/03/16/obama-funneled-350000-federal-funds-to-anti-likud-one-voice-movement-and-victory-15/'), ('Fox News, Source: Senate panel probing \u200epossible Obama administration ties to anti-Netanyahu effort, March 15, 2015', 'No link'), ('One Voice Movement, website', 'http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/15/senate-committee-probes-whether-obama-administration-funded-effort-to-oust/'), ('One Voice, 2013 Annual report', 'No link'), ('U.S. State Department, Daily press briefing, Jan. 28, 2015', 'https://www.onevoicemovement.org/'), ('U.S. State Department, Daily press briefing, Jan. 29, 2015', 'No link'), ('One Voice, Press release: OneVoice Israel Partners with V15 to Change Status Quo, Jan. 27, 2015', 'https://issuu.com/peaceworks/docs/onevoice2013annualreport'), ('Haaretz, The Obama campaign strategist who could break the Israeli elections wide open, Jan. 26, 2015', 'No link'), ('Office of Sen.

Patrick Murphy voted for free lifetime health care for Congress, GOP group says
","The 2016 Senate race in Florida officially kicked into high gear March 23 when U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, became the first major candidate to announce he will run for Sen. Marco Rubio’s seat. Murphy, 31, has built a reputation as a middle-of-the-road Democrat, but he could face a challenge on the left from U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson of Orlando. If Rubio runs for president, Murphy is still certain to face a heavyweight on the GOP side -- potentially Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera or CFO Jeff Atwater. Murphy has said he will run whether Rubio runs or not. On the day of Murphy’s announcement, the National Republican Senatorial Committee unveiled a website attacking his positions on several topics, including the Affordable Care Act and health care for members of Congress: ""Murphy voted to keep Obamacare the law of the land but also voted to allow members of Congress to receive taxpayer-funded health care for life!"" Did Murphy vote for permanent health care for members of Congress, including himself? Actually, no. Members of Congress do not get health care for life, and Murphy has never voted to give them health care for life. Instead, the NRSC is twisting generic votes in favor of the health care law into an entirely new -- and false -- attack. Murphy and the Affordable Care Act Murphy won his first race for Congress against Allen West in 2012, so he wasn’t in office when Congress approved the Affordable Care Act in 2010. On the campaign trail in 2012, Murphy said he supported the health care law, but also thought it could be improved. He criticized some of the requirements on businesses, such as the requirement for filing complicated 1099 forms, which was later repealed. While in office, he has taken votes related to the health care law -- for example, he joined most Democrats in opposing a bill which would have prevented the IRS from enforcing any portion of Obamacare. The NRSC pointed to a few votes by Murphy including on May 16, 2013, to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Murphy voted against it -- as did all but two Democrats while Republicans overwhelmingly supported it. The bill passed the House 229-195 but never passed the Senate. So what would repeal have to do with members of Congress getting their own insurance? The health care law requires members of Congress to obtain health insurance through an online marketplace, such as healthcare.gov. Previously, lawmakers bought insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, in which federal employees younger than 65 chose a plan and split premiums with the federal government. If Congress ever repealed Obamacare, members would go back to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. But here’s the problem with the claim: Members of Congress don’t get to use the federal health plan forever. Instead, it’s similar to getting insurance through work. When they lose the election -- essentially losing their job -- they have to find a new way to get health insurance. The NRSC also cited Murphy’s vote 2014 against a congressional resolution that included repeal of the health care law. Democrats including Murphy unanimously voted against it. Included along with the resolution is a ""policy statement on responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars"" that states: ""Retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life."" By voting against the resolution, ""Patrick Murphy voted to allow Members of Congress to receive taxpayer funded healthcare for life,"" NRSC spokesman Matt Connelly told PolitiFact Florida. But unlike the earlier vote, this one has an added wrinkle in that it carried no power. Both Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense and Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown’s Government Affairs Institute, said that the House budget resolution doesn’t have the weight of law and it doesn’t go to the president for signature. Murphy’s spokesman Richard Carbo told PolitiFact Florida that ""essentially, the so-called 'ban' is nothing more than words on a page."" ""It was a bogus and misleading claim then, and it is a bogus and misleading claim now,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. ""Obamacare actually gives all Americans the opportunity to obtain what members of Congress already have: access to decent, affordable health insurance."" As a side note, attacks about Congress voting for ""free health care for life"" are not exclusively made by Republicans.  Health care experts we interviewed in 2013 debunked a similar claim by Democrats that repeal of the health care law would lead to free insurance for life for Congress. And Democrats used that attack line again in 2014. We rated both those claims as Pants on Fire wrong. Our ruling The NRSC said that Murphy ""voted to allow members of Congress to receive taxpayer-funded health care for life."" The NRSC cites votes Murphy took against repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Even if those votes led to actual repeal -- which they didn’t -- members of Congress would not get free healthcare for life. This was a misleading claim when Democrats tried their versions of it in the past -- and it’s just as misleading now. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.","[('National Republican Senatorial Committee, Patrick Murphy 2016 website, March 23, 2015', 'http://patrickmurphy2016.com/#record'), ('House of Representatives, House Congressional Resolution, April 1, 2014', 'No link'), ('Library of Congress, HR 325 Roll Call 30, Jan. 23, 2013', 'http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fy15billtext.pdf'), ('Library of Congress, House Congressional Resolution 96, Roll Call 171, Roll Call 172, Roll Call 173, Roll Call 175, Roll Call 176, and Roll Call 177,April 9-10, 2014', 'No link'), ('GovTrack.US, H.R. 45 (113th), Passed the House May 16, 2013', 'http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll030.xml'), ('Taxpayers for Common Sense, ""Broken budget promises,"" March 20, 2015', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Florida, ""Fact-checking Patrick Murphy, Democratic hopeful to succeed Marco Rubio,"" March 23, 2015', 'http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll171.xml'), ('PolitiFact Florida, ""Democrats accuse Southerland of seeking ‘healthcare for life,’"" Oct. 8, 2014', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Pro-Democratic group says Rep.

Ted Cruz: Small business are going out of business 'in record numbers'
","Republican Sen. Ted Cruz became the first big-name politician to announce a 2016 presidential bid during an address at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. Cruz, of Texas, asked the audience to ""imagine"" (a word he used 38 times) what he believed a conservative administration could accomplish. ""Think just how different the world would be. Imagine instead of economic stagnation, booming economic growth,"" Cruz said. ""Instead of small businesses going out of business in record numbers, imagine small businesses growing and prospering. Imagine young people coming out of school with four, five, six job offers."" Let’s leave imagination land and return to the real world to evaluate whether businesses are closing their doors ""in record numbers."" Cruz’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiries, so we hunted down the data on our own. We found that while the height of the recession was particularly tough on small businesses, it’s quite a stretch to say things are still worse than ever. To begin, one common definition for ""small business"" is 500 employees or fewer, so we’ll keep that in mind as we go through the numbers. But also know that 90 percent of those small businesses have 20 or fewer employees, which might be closer to what an average person considers a ""small business."" The Center for Economic Studies at the U.S. Census Bureau surveys private businesses and their administrative records to track the number of firms and establishments over time. We want to look at firms with fewer than 500 employees, not establishments, which would include every single Starbucks across America. Firms are a count of companies no matter the number of locations, which allows us to single out small businesses in the truest sense. The number of firm ""deaths"" — meaning every location owned by a business was completely closed down — for businesses with fewer than 500 employees has been trending up since 1984. The peak came in 2009 during the height of the recession, when nearly 500,000 small businesses closed their doors. However, as of 2012 (the last year available) the number of business deaths had fallen back to where they were in 2005, 1998 and 1988.  Data for the last couple years is not available, but if the trend from 2010 to 2012 holds, those numbers would likely paint an improved picture, said Zoltan Acs, on leave as director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Public Policy at George Mason University. ""Those are all recession years and we know that we’ve been adding jobs for the last couple years so this is no longer happening,"" Acs said. ""But the data is not up to date."" The steady rise in businesses closing also looks less drastic when you compare the number of closures to the total number of small businesses. As you can see by the chart below, the rate of closures came close to peak levels in 2009, but the high point remains the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the percentage of businesses that closed exceeded 10.5 percent. More recently, the rate is on par with much of the last three decades.  In addition to the rise in business closures during the recession, another decades-long trend has concerned economists: People are creating small businesses at a slower rate. Together, the two issues created a situation where ""business deaths exceed business births for the first time in the 30-plus-year history of our data,"" according to a May 2014 Brookings Institute analysis. As it was, from 2008 to 2011, the economy lost a significant number of small businesses annually, the first instance of back-to-back years of negative small business growth in the 35 years of available research. That’s certainly alarming. However, the most recent data from the Center for Economic Studies shows the economy gained 84,674 small firms in 2012. ""It’s not a really clear picture,"" said William McDowell, an entrepreneurship professor at Middle Tennessee State and president of the Small Business Institute. ""It’s all a big mess when you try to make some broadstroke statements. There’s no real research to defend what he’s trying to show."" Our ruling Cruz claimed small businesses were ""going out of business in record numbers."" In terms of sheer volume, that was true in 2009, at the height of the recession, though the data only goes back to 1977. However, the total number of closures has since fallen. Data for the most recent year, 2012, shows business closures at about what they were in 2005. The percentage of firms that closed was quite high in 2009, but it wasn’t the highest point, and more recently, it is in line with historical figures. We rate Cruz’s statement False.","[('Washington Post, Transcript: Ted Cruz’s Speech at Liberty University, March 24, 2015', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-ted-cruzs-speech-at-liberty-university/2015/03/23/41c4011a-d168-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html'), ('Email interview with Eleanor Patout, spokeswoman for the Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy, March 24-25, 2015', 'No link'), ('United States Census Bureau, Center for Economic Studies: Firm Characteristics Data Tables, accessed March 24, 2015', 'https://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/data_firm.html'), ('United States Census Bureau, Business Dynamic Statistics Codebook, accessed March 25, 2015', 'No link'), ('Gallup, Business Deaths are Hampering Job Growth, March 4, 2015', 'https://www.census.gov/ces/pdf/BDS_2012_Codebook.pdf'), ('Washington Post, ""The decline of American entrepreneurship — in five charts,"" Feb. 12, 2015', 'No link'), ('U.S. Small Business Administration, Firm Size Data, accessed March 24, 2015', 'http://www.gallup.com/opinion/behavioral-economy/181841/business-deaths-hampering-job-growth.aspx?utm_source=WWWV7HP&utm_medium=topic&utm_campaign=tiles'), ('Brookings Institute, ""Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros,"" May 2014', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Zoltan Acs, on leave as director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Public Policy at George Mason University, March 24, 2015', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-small-business/wp/2015/02/12/the-decline-of-american-entrepreneurship-in-five-charts/'), ('Phone interview with William McDowell, entrepreneurship professor at Middle Tennessee State and president of the Small Business Institute, March 25, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/mar/24/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-small-business-are-going-out-business-rec/

White House aide says job growth now at 'fastest pace in this country's history'
","With the economy finally seeming to turn a corner, the Obama administration has been more aggressive recently about touting its accomplishments in creating jobs. But a claim made by one White House official recently was novel enough to catch our attention. The claim was made on CNN’s New Day by David Simas, the assistant to the president and director of the White House’s office of political strategy and outreach. ""We're more than happy to compare the record of this administration over the past six years that inherited the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and is in the fifth year of record job creation, which is the fastest pace in this country's history,"" Simas told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota. Is job growth at the ""fastest pace in this country's history""? We took a closer look. We found that he actually had mangled his talking point: He meant to talk about how many months of consistent growth there’s been, not how fast the pace is. We’ll look at both metrics. Because the current recovery began 69 months ago, we looked at total job gains during the first 69 months of each of the previous recoveries, going back to World War II. (Employment data is not easily comparable further back than that.) We ignored the first dip of the double-dip recession in the early 1980s; we counted only from the end of the second dip. Here are the results: End month of recession Percent increase in nonfarm employment in first 69 months from end of recession October 1945 25 percent October 1949 18 percent May 1954 11 percent April 1958 12 percent February 1961 21 percent November 1970 13 percent March 1975 18 percent November 1982 19 percent March 1991 11 percent November 2001 5 percent June 2009 8 percent This shows that far from being the ""fastest"" job growth in history, the pace of growth after the Great Recession was actually the second slowest out of these 11 time periods. ""I don't see any way to claim that the speed of growth in this recovery, even recently, is any kind of record,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Indeed, that's how many Americans seem to feel about the current recovery. ""Accounting for the severity of the recession, the speed of the jobs rebound was disappointing, especially in the first three or so years of the recovery,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. So what’s going on? The White House told PolitiFact that Simas was referring to something else -- that the ongoing streak of 60 months of private-sector job growth is the longest on record. Here, the White House has a point. Sinclair agreed that the United States is currently enjoying the ""longest string of consistently positive monthly job growth since the payroll employment data we typically rely on began being reported in 1939. The late 1980s comes close, but there was a pesky one-month fall in employment in June 1986. Similarly, in the 1990s, there were a couple of small dips."" Overall, it’s the duration of this recovery -- rather than the rate of growth for job creation -- that has made it impressive. Our ruling Simas said job growth in the United States is now at the ""fastest pace in this country's history."" He would have been right if he’d stuck to the duration of the recovery: At 60 months and counting, it’s the longest post-war recovery, though earlier recoveries would have been longer had brief blips not intruded. However, looking at how Simas phrased it on CNN, he’s wrong: The current recovery actually ranks second-to-last among post-World War II recoveries when judged by the rate of growth in jobs. We rate the claim False.","[('David Simas, interview on CNN’s New Day, March 18, 2015', 'http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4645140?0'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National),"" accessed March\xa018, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, March 23, 2015', 'http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ce'), ('Email interview with Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economist, March 23, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/mar/24/david-simas/white-house-aide-says-job-growth-now-fastest-pace-/

SeaWorld says their whales live as long as wild whales do
","More and more, critics are making the case that keeping killer whales in captivity is harmful to the animals and dangerous for the people who train them. SeaWorld, the theme park that showcases the trained whales, is now fighting back. A new ad, part of a multimedia blitz for the company, is headlined, ""Fact: Whales live as long at SeaWorld,"" and it is written in the voice of Chris Dold, a SeaWorld veterinarian. The ad, which has appeared in the Tampa Bay Times, takes specific aim at criticism leveled by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, an animal-rights group that has been among the theme park company’s biggest critics. Here’s a portion of the ad’s text: ""You might have heard attacks from PETA saying our killer whales live only a fraction as long as whales in the wild. They say, ‘In captivity, orcas’ average life span plummets to just nine years.’ But the author of an independent study, Dr. Douglas DeMaster, of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying, ‘Survival in the wild is comparable to survival in captivity.’ There’s no other way to say it… PETA is not giving you the facts."" PETA, meanwhile, pushed back against the ad’s conclusions, citing the average age of whales that have died since 1965. According to PETA’s documentation of captive whale deaths, the average age of death is 12 years old for SeaWorld’s female orcas -- which are expected to survive in the wild for about 50 years. For males -- which are expected to survive in the wild for 30 years -- the average age of death is 16. SeaWorld currently has in its care several whales in their 30s and one in its 40s. Keeping whales in captivity is a complicated issue, and the critical 2013 documentary Blackfish has brought more attention to it. Clearly, longevity is just one factor, and it isn’t the same thing as the quality of the whales’ daily lives. Here, though, we wanted to drill down on SeaWorld’s specific claim that the whales at their parks live just as long as they do in the wild. SeaWorld’s evidence We posed SeaWorld’s claim to DeMaster, the scientist quoted in the ad. He’s the science director of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, an office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a federal government agency. Most of the independent experts we contacted agreed that DeMaster is the key scientist to ask about this issue. DeMaster said that SeaWorld is correct -- ""as long as you use data from 2005 to 2013."" (PETA’s data, by contrast, goes back 40 more years.) On three occasions -- in 1988, 1995 and 2013 -- DeMaster has compiled data that comprehensively compared survival among captive and wild marine mammals. In the 1988 and 1995 papers, DeMaster found differences in the survival rates of marine mammals, including killer whales (also called orcas), depending on whether they lived in the wild or in captivity. The 1995 paper, for instance, found that captive orcas had a 94 percent chance of surviving to the next year in captivity, compared to 98 percent in the wild. That changed by the time DeMaster completed his latest research, in 2013. By then, he found, the annual survival rate for both captive and non-captive killer whales had converged at 98 percent. ""According to recent information there was an improvement in the annual survival rate, to quite close to what you might see in the wild,"" DeMaster told PolitiFact. DeMaster cautioned that he’s not sure of the reason for the improvement in survival, and he said he doesn’t take a position on whether or not large mammals should be kept in captivity. Meanwhile, an Associated Press analysis also cited in the SeaWorld ad -- which is based on the same data DeMaster used, the federal government’s Marine Mammal Inventory Report -- found that the average life expectancy for a killer whale born at SeaWorld was 46 years, which it said was close to the 49-year average life expectancy of a wild orca. Critiquing the SeaWorld evidence So SeaWorld has support for its claim. But the company glosses over some important caveats. • None of the statistical comparisons take into account quality of life, as opposed to length of life. Science is better at measuring longevity than it is at judging how humane a life in captivity is. The mathematical approach ""is totally irrelevant,"" said Dave Duffus, an associate professor of geography at Canada's University of Victoria, who participated on the panel with DeMaster in New Zealand. ""To me the important variable is not how long, rather it is how well, which isn’t a scientific question as much as it is a logical question. Everything about the quality of captive life is in opposition to the wild, which is the product of thousands of generations of natural selection."" • Merely reaching parity with wild populations isn’t necessarily a major achievement. Simple logic would suggest several reasons why marine mammals should live longer in captivity. Captive animals don’t have to worry about predators, food shortages, fishing nets, or pollution, and they’re given nutritional supplements, vaccines and veterinary care. ""It would sort of make sense that any animal given better medical and nutritional care would live just as long, or longer, than one not given this sort of care,"" said Paul Nachtigall, director of the Marine Mammal Research Program at the University of Hawaii. • The ad focuses on longevity, not survival rates; those are different statistics. The ad’s headline refers to how long whales live, and the text uses terms like ""life span"" and ""life expectancy."" But those are different things than the statistic DeMaster used that’s favorable to SeaWorld -- annual survival rates. Many experts, including DeMaster, told PolitiFact that annual survival rates are better measurements than longevity. Whales have not been in captivity long enough to know whether they are able to live a full-length life in that setting, DeMaster told PolitiFact. They’ve only been in captivity since the 1960s. Jaap van der Toom, a Dutch biologist who has studied marine mammals, has made a similar point. ""Longevity is basically an incidental finding: it is determined by the oldest animal you find in your sample,"" he has written. ""You can only determine the longevity of a group of animals after all the members of that group have died."" Well before SeaWorld released its ad, van der Toom published a cheat sheet about how to spin statistics. Referring to the same group of animals, he said, you could use different statistics to paint opposite appraisals. ""If you want to paint a positive picture,"" you could say that ""the life expectancy is 19.5 years"" or ""the majority of the animals will become older than 13 years,"" he wrote. In effect, that’s the approach SeaWorld took. But if you wanted to offer a negative spin, you would say that ""within five years, 23 percent of the animals will have died,"" or that ""one-third of the animals will survive no longer than eight years,"" or ""within 14 years, 50 percent of the animals will be dead."" Van der Toom summed up: ""To paraphrase an old song: "" ‘t ain't what you say, it's the way that you say it."" • The data on wild orca populations is sparse. There is data on whale life spans from the Pacific Northwest, but there are orcas all over the world, and there’s no guarantee that all of them have similar life spans and survival rates. In the 1995 paper, DeMaster cautioned that ""comparisons between survival in captivity with survival in the wild will remain tenuous until additional demographic studies are conducted on wild populations."" Our ruling A SeaWorld ad said ""whales live as long at SeaWorld"" as they do in the wild. At its core, this claim is an oversimplification of a much more complex issue. Recent independent data suggests that survival rates for captive and wild orcas are about equal, but that by itself isn't all that significant, experts told us. The data is limited and comparisons between orcas in captivity and in the wild are tenuous. Experts also noted that logic suggests captive whales should live longer because they don't face predators and receive medical care, which makes SeaWorld's claim further misleading.  Lastly, experts said that a simple measurement of survival rates (or lifespan) serves as a smokescreen from the more fundamental question of the conditions for whales in captivity. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.","[('SeaWorld advertisement, March 24, 2015', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/tourism/seaworld-launches-ad-campaign-after-backlash-from-blackfish/2222463'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""SeaWorld launches ad campaign after backlash from \'Blackfish,\' "" March 24, 2015', 'No link'), ('WLTZ, ""New SeaWorld Advertising Campaign Highlights Leadership In Killer Whale Care, Counters Misinformation,"" March 23, 2015', 'http://www.wltz.com/story/28590192/new-seaworld-advertising-campaign-highlights-leadership-in-killer-whale-care-counters-misinformation'), ('Small, RJ and DP Demaster.
