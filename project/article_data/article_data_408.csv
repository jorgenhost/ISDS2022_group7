Barack Obama says Mitt Romney called the Arizona immigration law a 'model for the nation.'
","
In the second presidential debate at Hofstra University, President Barack Obama repeated a claim that he and many of his allies have repeated for months.

Referring to a high-profile Arizona immigration law known as S.B. 1070, Obama said Romney ""called the Arizona law a model for the nation.""

Soon after Obama made that claim, Romney fired back. ""I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect,"" Romney said at the debate. ""I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation.""

They both can’t be right. So which one is correct?

PolitiFact Texas looked at this question earlier this year. We’ll recap and update their analysis here.

First, some background on the law. In June, the Supreme Court delivered a mixed ruling on the Arizona law. It threw out parts that would have made state crimes out of federal immigration violations, including provisions requiring immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers, making it a state criminal offense for an illegal immigrant to seek work or hold a job and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants, according to the Associated Press.
   
But the court let stand a ""show me your papers"" requirement that police officers check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Even then, the AP reported, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges. And they removed some teeth by prohibiting officers from arresting people on immigration charges.

The notion that Romney called S.B. 1070 a ""model for the nation"" stems from a comment he made during a Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Arizona.
       
As John King of CNN framed his question to Romney, the audience applauded mention of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona’s Maricopa County, who is known for his advocacy of hard-line immigration policies. King said to Romney: ""You've talked, governor, about self-deportation, if businesses do their job, asking for the right documents, the people will leave. But what about arresting? Should there be aggressive, seek them out, find them and arrest them as Sheriff Arpaio advocates?""
   
Romney answered, ""You know, I think you see a model here in Arizona. They passed a law here that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on E-Verify. This E-Verify system allows employers in Arizona to know who's here legally and who's not here legally. And as a result of E-Verify being put in place, the number of people in Arizona that are here illegally has dropped by some 14 percent, where the national average has only gone down 7 percent.""

E-Verify is a federal, Internet-based system that employers can use to verify whether someone is authorized to work in the United States. Participation is voluntary for most U.S. businesses -- there is no federal mandate. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s website says that more than 280,000 employers across the country are using the system.
   
After the Arizona debate, many reporters, opinion columnists, Democrats and liberal groups interpreted that statement by Romney as him saying that SB 1070 as a whole should be a model, either for the nation or for other states.
   
However, Dan Nowicki, the Arizona Republic’s national political reporter, questioned those interpretations in a March 3, 2012, news article that noted that Arizona’s requirement that businesses use E-Verify is not contained in SB 1070 but rather in an earlier state law, the Legal Arizona Workers Act.
   
""It's clear from the (debate) transcript that Romney was describing part of the state's 2007 employer-sanctions law, which has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Nowicki wrote. ""That Arizona law requires employers to use a federal electronic system to verify whether new hires are eligible to work in the United States and provides punishment for companies that hire undocumented immigrants.""
   
In other words, Romney in the debate saluted the E-Verify element of a 5-year-old Arizona law — which was not part of the 2010 immigration-enforcement law.

It’s important to note that Romney is not opposed to the Arizona law. In fact, at the same debate, he said that if elected, he would drop federal lawsuits against the Arizona law ""on day one.""

Romney expressed support for the law at least as early as Sept. 13, 2011, during an event in Arizona sponsored by the Christian Broadcasting Network. According to the CBN account, Romney said, ""Well, I support the Arizona law by recognizing what Arizona has done -- underscored the failure of the federal government to do its job.""

Then, shortly after the Supreme Court decision, Romney echoed this view, saying he believes that ""each state has the duty — and the right — to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities.""

And Romney spokesman Ryan Williams confirmed to PolitiFact after the debate that the candidate’s view remains the same. ""He said very clearly he supports the right of states to craft individual laws to help them address failures of the federal government, but he has never said that S.B. 1070 is a ‘model for the nation,"" Williams said.

Our ruling

Obama said Mitt Romney ""called the Arizona law a model for the nation."" That statement mischaracterizes Romney’s salute to Arizona’s mandate that employers electronically verify the legal status of employees, which was passed in 2007 and was not included in S.B. 1070.

Mitt Romney says Barack Obama began his presidency ""with an apology tour""
","The notion that President Barack Obama started his presidency with an ""apology tour"" is a persistent and false Republican talking point that we have debunked a number of times.

Mitt Romney is sticking to it.

The Republican presidential nominee repeated it during his second debate against Obama at Hofstra University on Oct. 16, 2012, in response to an audience member’s question about the September 2012 Libya attack.

""The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes,"" he said.

We checked Romney’s ""apology"" attack when he used it at the Republican National Convention and in his 2010 book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness.

The tour, he wrote, is Obama’s way ""of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them.""

""In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations, and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy.""

An early apology tour?

Romney labels seven separate Obama speeches as apologies in his book. (We've compiled those passages in a separate document.) We noticed Obama tended to acknowledge American mistakes or bad impressions, but he countered it with praise of American ideals and the need to come together.

At a town hall meeting in France in 2009, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States ""has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive."" But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a ""casual"" and ""insidious"" anti-Americanism.

At a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, ""I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.""

At a speech in Cairo on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He suggested both countries simply ""move forward.""

Throughout those speeches, Obama was most conciliatory when talking about torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama typically said the U.S. must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why he ""unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year.""

Apologies or diplomacy?

We asked several experts in 2010 if Obama had apologized. Here’s a recap of their thoughts (read more here):

• Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama was definitely apologizing. He co-wrote an analysis on the topic: ""Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower.""

""Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies,"" Gardiner said. ""It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership.""

• John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama used conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing.

""It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,"" Murphy said. ""Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology.""

• Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it.

She said Obama's words fell short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words ""sorry"" or ""regret."" ""I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there,"" Bloom said.

Obama's remarks were really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy.

""Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal,"" Bloom said. ""For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable.""

• We spoke with Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who tracked international human rights issues via the website Political Apologies and Reparations. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery.

""To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent,"" Howard-Hassman said. ""A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it.""

Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said.

""Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect,"" she said. ""But a gesture of respect is not an apology.""

We should note that Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have offered two apologies to foreign leaders during the latter half of Obama’s term -- once to Afghanistan President Harmid Karzai for the accidental burnings of the Quran, the holy book of Islam, and another to Pakistan for the death of Pakistani troops, respectively. However, these 2012 and 2011 gestures do not fit Romney’s claim that Obama’s presidency ""began with an apology tour.""

Our ruling

Once again, Romney has accused Obama of beginning his presidency ""with an apology tour.""

Our reviews of Obama’s 2009 foreign travels and speeches showed no such thing. While he criticized past U.S. actions, such as torture practices at Guantanamo, he did not offer one  apology.

It’s ridiculous to call Obama’s foreign visits and remarks ""an apology tour."" We rate this statement Pants on Fire!  ",/factchecks/2012/oct/17/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-began/

Romney says Obama waited 14 days to call Libya attack terror
","
For weeks, Republicans have been hammering the Obama administration for allegedly concealing the true nature of the attack in Libya that claimed the life of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. During the second presidential debate, Mitt Romney charged that ""it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.""

Obama had bristled at the idea that his administration had played politics with the attack. He called the suggestion ""offensive"".

 Obama: ""The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened -- that this was an act of terror -- and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.""

Romney: ""I think interesting the president just said something, which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.""

Obama: ""That's what I said.""

Romney: ""You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror. It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?""

Obama: ""Please proceed, governor.""

Romney: ""I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.""

Obama: ""Get the transcript.""

We went to the transcript, and the president has a point. On September 12, the day after the attack, in the Rose Garden, Obama condemned the attack and said, ""No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation."" 
In the days since, some have parsed Obama's remarks and argued he didn't say the Benghazi attack was specifically an act of terror. However, given the overall context of his comments, it seems a fair conclusion that he was including the attack in the ""acts of terror"" that he said would never shake American resolve.

However, in the days that followed, the White House spokesman and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations suggested that the attack seemed to have taken advantage of a demonstration over an American-made video that disparaged Islam.

On Sept. 13, White House spokesman Jay Carney said, ""The protests we're seeing around the region are in reaction to this movie. They are not directly in reaction to any policy of the United States or the government of the United States or the people of the United States.""

The next day, a State Department spokeswoman said, ""We are very cautious about drawing any conclusions with regard to who the perpetrators were, what their motivations were, whether it was premeditated."" But she ended with this: ""Obviously, there are plenty of people around the region citing this disgusting video as something that has been motivating.""

On Sept. 16, five days after the attack, Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said, ""We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned.""

On Sept. 20, Carney told reporters, ""It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result was four deaths of American officials.""

But that same day, Obama told an audience at a town hall meeting, ""What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.""

It wasn’t until Sept. 21 that everyone in the administration as a whole stated publicly that the attack was planned and executed by a terrorist group.

Our ruling

Romney said it took the president 14 days before he called the Libya attack terror.

In fact, Obama described it in those terms the day after the attack. But in the days that followed, neither he nor all the members of his administration spoke consistently on the subject. There were many suggestions that the attack was part of demonstrations over an American-made video that disparaged Islam.

We rate the statement Half True. 
Update:
  
After we published this item, we heard from readers that the president called the attack ""an act of terror"" two more times -- on Sept. 13 in Colorado and Sept. 14 in Nevada.

""As for the ones we lost last night: I want to assure you, we will bring their killers to justice,"" Obama said at a campaign event in Nevada. ""And we want to send a message all around the world -- anybody who would do us harm: No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America.""

So as we noted in our original item, Romney is off the mark as it relates to the word ""terror."" But Obama contributed to the administration's mixed message when he spoke at the Univision Town Hall event on Sept. 20. A questioner asked:  ""We have reports that the White House said today that the attacks in Libya were a terrorist attack. Do you have information indicating that it was Iran, or al Qaeda was behind organizing the protests?""

Here is Obama’s reply:

""Well, we’re still doing an investigation, and there are going to be different circumstances in different countries. And so I don’t want to speak to something until we have all the information. What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.""

So although Obama acknowledged the uncertainty, he emphasized the inflammatory video and the protest as contributing factors in the attack.

By mentioning the video, Obama drew attention away from the possibility that the attack had been a planned assault. This lies at the heart of the dispute over what Obama and his administration were saying in the days after the attack. The president had the chance to be more complete and direct in Florida, but the administration was continuing to focus on the response to the video.

Just four days earlier, Ambassador Rice downplayed the possibility that the attack was premeditated. The president’s words did not correct that impression.

So while Obama did use the word ""terror,"" there is also some truth to Romney's point that it took many days for the administration to fully characterize the attack as the work of a terrorist group. So we're still rating this Half True.",/factchecks/2012/oct/17/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-waited-14-days-call-libya-attack/

Obama: Mitt Romney refused to say whether he supports Lilly Ledbetter Act
","
Updated Thursday, October 25th, 2012 at 2:08 p.m. 
Asked about fair pay for women during the second presidential debate, President Barack Obama was quick to bring up the first piece of legislation he signed into law -- the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.

Audience member Katherine Fenton asked Obama, ""In what new ways to you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn?""

Obama talked about being raised by a single mom who put herself through school and of his grandmother, who worked her way up from a bank secretary to a vice president but ""hit the glass ceiling.""

""She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn't complain. That's not what you did in that generation,"" he said at the debate at Hofstra University on Oct. 16, 2012. ""And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lilly Ledbetter bill.""

Romney responded by saying at one point he had more women in senior leadership positions than any other governor and that he wanted to help more women find jobs.

Obama jumped in, saying, ""Katherine, I just want to point out that when Gov. Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, ‘I'll get back to you.’ And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.""

Did Romney and his campaign really refuse to say whether he supported the law? Sort of.

The law, which Obama signed on Jan. 29, 2009, made it easier for workers to pursue wage discrimination claims but received little Republican support in Congress. It updated 1960s civil rights and age discrimination laws to reset the statute of limitations on such claims with each new paycheck. In 2007, the Supreme Court had ruled in Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. that the 180-day statute of limitations started from the day an employer made the decision to discriminate — making it harder for employees who claimed such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.

What did Romney have to say about it? For a previous fact-check in May, the Obama campaign directed us to a couple media reports.

In an April 2012 conference call covered by a Washington Post blogger, a Huffington Post reporter asked an unnamed Romney adviser whether Romney supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The adviser responded, ""Sam (Stein), we’ll get back to you on that.""

Later, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul clarified in an email, ""He supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law.""

The second piece the Obama campaign showed us was a Romney interview by Diane Sawyer of ABC News. Sawyer asked Romney, "" If you were president — you had been president — would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Law?""

Romney’s response: 
Romney: ""It's certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing. I wasn't there three years ago —"" 
Sawyer: ""But would you have signed it?"" 
Romney: ""... I'm not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and — and have no intention of changing that law, don't think there's a reason to."" 
Here, Romney did refuse to say whether he would have signed the bill into law. But he also said he has ""no intention of changing that law."" 
Our ruling

Obama said that when asked whether he would have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act into law, Romney's campaign said, ""I'll get back to you."" His point was that the campaign was dodging the question.

Indeed, a Romney adviser did say earlier this year that he would ""get back"" to a reporter about whether he supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. A spokeswoman then said he would not change it, and Romney later said he ""certainly support(s) equal pay for women,"" and has ""no intention of changing that law.""

So Obama is correct about the initial statement, but Romney later clarified by saying he wouldn't change the law. We rate Obama's claim Mostly True. 
CORRECTION: A previous version of this item said the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision made it ""impossible for employees who learned of such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay."" In fact, the court declined to address the question of whether employees who learned of discrimination after the statute of limitations expired would be protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",/factchecks/2012/oct/17/barack-obama/obama-mitt-romney-refused-say-whether-he-supports-/

Obama says Romney once said a coal-burning plant ‘kills people’
","
Energy policy and gas prices garnered a lot of attention in the town-hall style debate between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney.

Romney accused Obama of stifling domestic production and said he would champion the oil and coal industries. Obama fired back that Romney hasn’t always been such a proponent of coal.

""Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ‘This plant kills,’ and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal,"" Obama said.

PolitiFact Ohio has looked into this bit of Bay State history before, rating a statement similar to this one. We’ll recap.

The Salem Harbor Power Station

Back on Feb. 5, 2003, Romney made several statements during a showdown over the future of the controversial, coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station, in the Boston area.

A couple of years earlier, Massachusetts had passed new rules to reduce power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and mercury, to be phased in over several years. The mercury standard would not be finalized until 2004. As governor, Romney supported the rules, as he made clear repeatedly.
   
Massachusetts singled out its most egregious polluters as the ""Filthy Five"" plants, including Salem Harbor. Public health and environmental scientists at Harvard studied the emissions from two of the plants in 2000 and concluded that Salem Harbor was responsible for 53 deaths, 570 emergency room visits, 14,400 asthma attacks and 99,000 incidents of upper respiratory symptoms -- all per year.
   
Local residents and others who wanted to keep the Salem Harbor plant open (for jobs and tax revenues) disputed those figures, saying they resulted from unproven modeling. It turned out that the Harvard scientists had revised their figures in 2002, putting premature deaths from Salem Harbor’s pollution at 30 per year and reducing the number of emergency room visits to 400 and the asthma attacks at 2,000, according to the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.
   
But the scientists stood by the broader conclusion -- that emissions from dirty power plants can be deadly. The Harvard methodology has now been widely replicated and is respected by health scientists, according to several environmental authorities we spoke with. Romney appeared to accept their findings, too.

The spat with Salem Harbor turned into a testy exchange after Salem Harbor’s then-owner, Pacific Gas and Electric, sought an extension until 2006 to comply with Massachusetts’ emissions rules -- and plant supporters showed up to to demand that the governor back off. Romney was adamant that the company comply by 2004 and appeared at a press conference near the plant to emphasize the point.

His statements that day show how he felt, and they’re documented in this video: ""I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people, and that plant -- that plant kills people.""

Our ruling

Obama said Romney has changed his tune about coal, claiming that in Massachusetts he ""stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ‘This plant kills.’""

Romney was the newly elected governor when a showdown erupted over the coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station. Obama quoted Romney accurately when he said the governor entered the controversy by saying the plant ""kills people.""

Mitt Romney says 'oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land'
","
President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney sparred during the second presidential debate over drilling policy on federal lands.

Romney said -- among other things -- that ""oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land.""

That’s similar to a statement that PolitiFact Ohio checked last April-- ""Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before."" It’s also similar to a claim we checked a few weeks later, that oil ""production's down where Obama's in charge.""

We’ll recap our analysis here.

The 14 percent number

We turned to a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration titled, ""Sales of Fossil Fuels Produced from Federal and Indian Lands, FY 2003 through FY 2011."" To produce the report, EIA worked with the Interior Department’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue, which tracks royalties to the government for oil, gas and coal produced on federal lands, including oil from offshore wells.

While Romney said ""this year,"" the most recent data available is from 2011, so that's what we'll use. In 2010, EIA data show, 726 million barrels of oil came from federal lands, including offshore wells. In 2011, it was 626. That’s a drop of 13.77 percent, which can be rounded to 14 percent.
   
This data, as well as a more complex measure (it involves royalties and British thermal units of energy, but we’ll spare you), would appear to render the statement accurate.

How reliable is it?

But is the 14 percent figure cherry picked?

Yes, says Jay Hakes, who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration for seven years during the Clinton administration. ""From a statistical standpoint, to take one year out of three — one year is not indicative of a trend,"" he said.
   
So we pulled the numbers from when George W. Bush was in office -- January 2001 to January 2009 -- as well as from when Obama was in office. In our chart, we’ve italicized the years he was in office and put in bold the years Obama led.
   
We note that:
   
• From 2004-08, well into Bush’s tenure, oil production on federal lands and waters fell in four of five years, for a net decrease of 16.8 percent.
   
• From 2009-11, the Obama years, oil production rose two of three years, for a net increase of 10.6 percent.
  
  
It’s also worth taking a closer look at what went into the overall number.

From 2009 to 2010, oil production from offshore sources rose by 14.9 percent. Prior to that, before Obama’s presidency, the offshore volume fell for several years, and it was erratic even during a phase in which it rose, EIA figures show.
   
Yet onshore oil production generally rose on federally owned land -- and did again in 2011, by 3.7 percent. Offshore production that took the hit, falling 16.8 percent.

So the big story of the one-year dropoff in public production is the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. A six-month moratorium on exploratory drilling followed — though it by no means stopped gulf oil production— along with changes in regulation that forced the industry to adjust.
   
While the moratorium could have been more targeted, it wasn’t a policy choice unique to Obama, said Hakes, the former EIA director who also directed policy and research for the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. Bush had his own disasters to contend with: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 also drove a decline the next year, said Shirley Neff, a senior adviser at EIA. And President Richard Nixon ordered a moratorium in the wake of a 1969 well blowout off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif.

""Every president, if you have a blowout like that … is going to get a moratorium,"" Hakes said.

Who gets the credit or blame?
   
It’s important to note that most big boosts in production, according to experts, follow years of earlier exploration and drilling -- efforts begun under the policies of prior administrations. By the same token, Obama’s actions in office should have an impact in the years to come.

""I don't think Obama can claim a lot of credit for production levels now, and I'm not even sure that Bush can,"" said Hakes, the author of A Declaration of Energy Independence, which looks at energy policy from President Harry S. Truman to President George W. Bush. ""If you're going to go back — who should get the credit — I might be able to find something that Nixon did.""
   
The recent expansion of hydrofracking — using pressurized fluid to get gas or oil out of rock formations — came about over decades.
   
""That's why attaching production things to any particular administration is a very, very tricky business, and probably best handled in books rather than in articles,"" Hakes said. ""There are just too many factors.""
   
So, Obama certainly shouldn’t be claiming full credit for increases in oil production on private land — but neither should supporters of Bush.

Our ruling
   
So: Did the United States produce 14 percent less oil on its public lands last year? Yes.
   
But there’s nuance in the number. Production under Obama was hobbled due to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, making a one-year figure subject to cherry-picking. And it’s not at all clear that the president in charge when the oil is taken out of the ground deserves full credit or blame; years of prior policies on exploration and drilling had an impact.

Romney says Obama failed to offer the immigration bill he promised

In the second presidential debate, Mitt Romney focused on the commitments that President Obama failed to deliver on. In that list, he included immigration reform. Romney reminded the audience of what Obama had promised.

""He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges,"" Romney said. ""Didn't even file it.""""

This is one of the promises we’ve tracked in the Obamameter, and Romney is correct.

During the 2008 campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. ""I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,"" Obama said. ""But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.""

In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated ""that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.""
   
But the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill.

Over the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework ""to fix our broken immigration system."" That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the president called a ""a very important step.""
   
Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. ""In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we’ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken,"" said Obama.
   
Obama promised to strongly support a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would be introduced during his first year in office. As president, he has repeatedly called for reform and several immigration-related bills are pending in Congress. But all that we've seen are proposals and frameworks, no actual bills.

Our ruling

Romney said that Obama promised to introduce a comprehensive immigration bill but never did.

Obama did make the promise in 2008 and while he talked about moving forward, he did not.

Allen West attacks Patrick Murphy for 'drunken assault of a police officer'
","Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West of South Florida says his opponent, Democrat Patrick Murphy, has criticized West’s military career to cover-up his own brawl with the law -- literally, a brawl with a police officer.

In the ad, called ""Ashamed,"" the narrator says: ""First, Patrick Murphy called a man who has fought to defend our country a coward. Then Murphy hid behind his father in attacks that were called racist and disgusting.""

The ad then airs TV media quotes stating that the attacks on West were a ‘low blow,’ ‘disgusting’ and displayed ‘racial stereotypes.’

The ad then shows photos of West in his Army fatigues with fellow soldiers.

""Now Murphy is questioning the actions of a soldier in combat fighting to protect his men. Why? To hide his drunken assault of a police officer.""

The ad shows a copy of a 2003 police report and a dour mug shot of Murphy.

Here we will fact-check whether Murphy engaged in a ""drunken assault of a police officer."" We will also explain if he tried to ""hide"" that incident and briefly touch on some of the other claims in the ad.

Murphy’s 2003 arrest

West’s campaign sent us a copy of the police report of the Feb. 16, 2003, incident. At the time, Murphy was a 19-year-old college freshman at the University of Miami.

The narrative in the hand-written police report is somewhat difficult to decipher, but it says that Murphy and a friend were fighting and disrupting others at a Miami Beach bar, Club Crobar, and escorted out by security. The two men had been drinking, were ""soaking wet"" from alcohol and had ""eyes bloodshot, slurring speech.""

An officer asked Murphy for his I.D., but Murphy refused to turn over the fake New Jersey driver’s license. The report noted that ""defendant continued to act disorderly"" and wasn’t listening to the officer’s directions to step away and calm down.

""Defendant refused shouting ‘(expletive) you,’’’ and was arrested, the report stated. Murphy then made ""false allegations"" that he was mistreated, the officer wrote. To be clear, we saw no evidence in the officer’s narrative or court records that Murphy physically assaulted a police officer.

Court case dropped

The criminal case was filed on Feb. 17, 2003 -- one day after the incident, online Miami-Dade court records show. Murphy was charged with felony possession of a stolen driver’s license. He entered a plea of ""not guilty"" Feb. 26, and the criminal case was closed March 10 with a charge transferred to traffic court.

Court records also list ""misdemeanor disorderly intoxication"" based on the arrest report, but court records show ""no action"" on this count and he wasn’t charged for that by prosecutors.

The charge transferred to traffic court for altering a driver’s  license was dismissed by the state attorney’s office in June 2003. The  online record doesn’t explain the reason for the dismissal.

Did Murphy ‘hide’ his assault

Murphy was clearly arrested but not convicted of the driver’s license charge. And prosecutors never charged him with assault. But did he try to ""hide"" it?

Murphy campaign consultant Eric Johnson said Murphy didn’t try to get the record expunged and has discussed it with reporters for several months.

The Palm Beach Post wrote in June that it found the arrest in state records and asked Murphy about it.

""I was a teenager and I got in trouble with a fake I.D.,and I was under-age drinking and, look, biggest learning experience of my life, never had a run-in with the police since. I'm sorry it ever happened. ... It's nothing I can hide from,"" Murphy told the Post.

We asked West campaign manager Tim Edson if West had any proof that the assault was physical or that Murphy tried to hide it.

""Our campaign never said there was a physical assault. Call it what you will, but Patrick Murphy’s campaign was trying to distract from, hide or obscure his drunken verbal assault on a police officer with a false attack ad on Allen West’s military record...,"" Edson responded in an email.  ""It is clear that Murphy verbally assaulted a police officer.""

The other claims in the ad

There are some other interesting claims in the ad that we are not going to factor into our ruling but we will provide a little background:

• West said that Murphy ""called a man who has fought to defend our country a coward."" Murphy called West a ""coward"" for switching districts after redistricting made his current district more liberal.

""Allen West went from talking tough this weekend and telling progressives to ‘get the hell out of this country’ to abandoning the people who elected him. There is no other way to interpret this: Allen West is a coward,"" a Murphy press release stated in January 2012.

• ""Murphy hid behind his father in attacks that were called racist and disgusting."" Murphy’s dad formed a political action committee,which aired an ad depicting a caricature of West, a black congressman, in boxing gloves punching an old white woman, a younger white woman and grabbing money from a black family. The ad was intended to depict West socking it to constituents over Medicare, health care and tax cuts. West and his supporters argued the ad was racist, but the NAACP disagreed. (A Palm Beach Post editorial said the ad wasn’t racist but criticized Murphy for saying he had nothing to do with an ad created by his father.)

Our ruling

West’s ad says that opponent Murphy is trying to hide his ""drunken assault of a police officer."" Murphy was arrested for disorderly intoxication and possession of a stolen driver’s license.

But West omits several facts about the incident. Most importantly, we saw no evidence in the officer’s narrative or court records that Murphy physically assaulted a police officer. A viewer hearing that phrase could easily misinterpret it to mean a physical assault.

Murphy wasn’t convicted -- a charge was quickly transferred to traffic court and dismissed within months. It’s also worth noting that this was almost a decade ago,when Murphy was 19.

We found no proof that Murphy has tried to ""hide"" his arrest. Sure, he’s not highlighting it, but he has answered reporters’ questions about it for months.

There is some truth here: Murphy was arrested while drunk and disrespected a police officer. But saying that he was hiding a drunken assault of a police officer is significantly overstating it.

Patrick Murphy attacks Allen West for military investigation
","
In a television ad, Democrat Patrick Murphy attacked Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West for a much-publicized incident that led to West’s retirement from the Army. The ad shows photos of West in his Army fatigues:

""You need the facts about Allen West in 2003,"" states the narrator, as a manila folder opens. ""West was criminally charged with violating the uniform code of military justice, found guilty of three counts of aggravated assault, and relieved of his command. The final Army report: West 'performed illegal acts, merited court martial, faced 11 years in prison.' Allen West. He just isn’t who he says he is.""

West and political newcomer Murphy have launched character attacks on each other in their battle for Congressional District 18, which spans parts of Florida’s Treasure Coast.

We wanted to check if Murphy accurately portrayed the end of West’s two-decade Army career.

In a separate fact-check, we evaluated West’s ad that Murphy tried to ""hide his drunken assault of a police officer.""

When West fired in 2003

We first fact-checked claims about West’s military background in 2011, after hearing complimentary comments that radio host Glenn Beck made about West. (Read our earlier report for a longer account.)

In 2003, West was serving in Iraq as a lieutenant colonel overseeing an artillery battalion of about 650 soldiers and officers.

In early August, soldiers received a tip that West and one of his subordinate battery commanders were to be the subject of an assassination attempt. The informant offered the names of three people involved in the planning of the assassination, including an Iraqi policeman, Yehiya Kadoori Hamoodi.

Hamoodi was apprehended and brought in for questioning.

What happened next comes from accounts provided by West and the other soldiers involved in the interrogation through sworn statements they gave during a subsequent military investigation.

West joined the interrogation in progress after soldiers were unable to get useful information from Hamoodi. West said soldiers told him Hamoodi was being evasive and belligerent.

That's when the interrogation got more physical. Soldiers punched and shoved Hamoodi when he wouldn't answer interrogators' questions. At some point, West sat down across from Hamoodi, took out his 9mm pistol and placed it on his thigh pointing in Hamoodi's direction.

""I'm here for a reason,"" West said, according to a soldier. ""You are going to tell me who wants to kill me, or I am going to kill you.""

Then they took Hamoodi outside and placed his head over a clearing barrel -- a barrel filled with sand where people can unload firearms safely. West showed Hamoodi the gun and told him he had five seconds to talk. ""I brought his head down toward the barrel using my left hand to shield him away from any sand or blast,"" West told investigators.

Then West fired into the sand, at least once, maybe three times, inches from Hamoodi's head.

Then West fired into the sky.

Hamoodi was alive and ready to talk.

West headed back to the operations center and let the interrogation conclude.

West’s actions drew criticism, but he became a cause celebre among some in the military and conservatives -- and that brought him the fame that would lead to his congressional career.

Outcome of military investigation

We are going to focus on the part of Murphy’s ad that says, ""The final Army report: West ‘performed illegal acts, merited court martial, faced 11 years in prison.’ ""

We reviewed preliminary investigative reports, including sworn statements by West and other soldiers obtained by the ACLU as part of a torture investigation. (The names in the report are blacked out except on the last page it does name West.) We also read media reports, including two cited in the ad, the Boston Globe and CNN. We also contacted the West campaign and interviewed West’s military defense attorney Neal Puckett, who disputes the ad. Finally, we interviewed military justice attorneys not involved in the case.

The ad mentions a ""final Army report,"" but the quotes that follow are from media reports cited in the ad. Our efforts to independently obtain any sort of final Army report were unsuccessful.

'Performed illegal acts'

Soon after the incident, the Army launched a criminal investigation into charges of aggravated assault and communicating a threat. A statement from West -- in which he confessed -- and other soldiers were taken in September 2003. The case started as an Article 32, a preliminary hearing required under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

""I know the method I used was not right, but I wanted to take care of my soldiers,"" West testified, adding later: ""If it's about the lives of my soldiers at stake, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can.""

An investigating officer recommended that the case be handled through Article 15/nonjudicial proceedings, which the general commander and West accepted. (Article 15 is a noncriminal process.)

The Boston Globe wrote that during a closed-door tribunal in the town of Tikrit, ""West was found guilty of three counts of aggravated assault and a single count of communicating a threat. The ruling was issued after West pleaded guilty to misconduct.""

West’s lawyer Puckett, who did not attend that tribunal, told us in an interview that West ""was adjudicated to having committed those offenses -- in a broad sense he was found guilty of those offenses.""

But what the ad omits is that once the case became an Article 15, it was no longer a criminal proceeding, and that point isn’t in dispute.

In December, the commander reprimanded West and fined him $5,000. West then retired.

So West ""performed illegal acts,"" but they were resolved through a nonjudicial, or noncriminal punishment.

'Merited court martial'

Media reports made it clear that West could have faced a courtmartial but ultimately didn’t.

The Boston Globe wrote that the military said West ""disobeyed laws, ignored orders . . . and mortgaged future discipline in his unit. Without discipline, there is no trust, no cohesion, and no higher purpose for which we fight.""

But the military also stated, ""while his crimes merit a court-martial, mitigating factors were considered, including the stressful environment . . . and Lieutenant Colonel West's record as an officer and commander.""

And that’s why the military recommended the Article 15 route.

""Frustration and anger overcame his professional ethics and personal values, and he performed what he knew to be illegal and immoral acts,"" said the statement issued by the Army's Fourth Infantry Division.

Article 15 is supposed to be used only for minor offenses, but it can be used for serious offenses including assault, said Eugene Fidell, a who teaches military justice at Yale Law School and previously served as a judge advocate in the U.S. Coast Guard.

""You can have a serious case on paper, but because of the way it is handled through nonjudicial punishment, the actual exposure is much less,"" Fidell said. Though an Article 15 is not a criminal proceeding, ""you cannot get an Article 15 because you are a slob. You have to have committed some military crime.""

The ad says that West ""merited"" court martial -- it doesn’t say he ""was"" court martialed, said Murphy’s campaign consultant Eric Johnson.

 'Faced 11 years in prison'

West’s lawyer Puckett wrote that a military legal adviser (who he doesn’t name) confided in him that the case was never destined for trial, court martial or plans for confining West, however ""there was a perceived need to have a public hearing.""

An officer doesn’t ""face"" prison, Puckett said, until he or she is courtmartialed, and that never happened. The range of punishments for an Article 15 does not include prison.

But Fidell said that while West could not be sent to jail as part of an Article 15 sentence, ""Lt. Col. West was certainly ‘facing’ jail when he was charged,"" he wrote in an email.

CNN wrote that the infantry's top general in Tikrit, ""could have rejected the recommendation and ordered a court martial. If he were to be found guilty at a court martial of the two articles against him, West could have faced 11 years in prison, a military prosecutor told CNN."" Some other news reports we found stated West could have faced eight years.

So West could have faced prison time. But the ad omits that once his case entered the Article 15 proceedings, prison was no longer a possibility.

Our ruling

Murphy’s ad included this sentence: ""The final Army report: West ‘performed illegal acts, merited court martial, faced 11 years in prison.' ""

The ad cites Boston Globe and CNN reports, but it also could leave viewers with the impression that those quotes were pulled from some ""final Army report,"" though the Murphy ad wasn’t directly citing such a report.

West did violate military code and confessed to the assault, so the ad is on safe ground when it says West ""performed illegal acts.""

The military concluded that West’s ""crimes merit a courtmartial,"" which could have meant prison time. But the ad fails to explain that the Army found mitigating circumstances and handled West’s case through a noncriminal proceeding that meant he avoided courtmartial and prison was off the table.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Foreign Policy', 'Joe Biden']","
Joe Biden says Paul Ryan cut embassy security by $300 million
","
In the vice presidential debate in Danville, Ky., Joe Biden and Paul Ryan sparred over embassy security in the wake of the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

""This lecture on embassy security — the congressman here cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for,"" Biden said.

When we checked with the Obama campaign, a spokeswoman said that the claim of a $300 million cut can be supported in either of two ways.

One -- which was noted by several fact-checkers in the aftermath of the debate -- is that Ryan, as the chairman of the House Budget Committee, put forward such severe cuts in his budget proposal that, running the numbers, embassy security funding would suffer a cut of $300 million.

The second was was to compare the relevant budget lines in the president’s proposed fiscal year 2012 budget to the amount passed by the House of Representatives last year.

We’ll look at both of these justifications, but first, let’s outline what Obama proposed for fiscal year 2012 (figures are rounded):

Worldwide Security Protection (ongoing operations): $1.45 billion
Worldwide Security Protection (overseas contingency operations): $247 million
Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance -- Worldwide Security Upgrades: $938 million

Total: $2.64 billion

Cuts from Ryan’s proposed budget

The Obama administration’s Office of Management and Budget has run the numbers in the Ryan budget and argues that it will cut non-defense discretionary spending as a whole by 19 percent between 2013 and 2014. A 19 percent cut to a $2.64 billion line item works out to just over $500 million -- even more than the number Biden cited.

Leaving aside whether this percentage is accurate, using it in this context is problematic. First, it’s not an immediate cut -- according to OMB, the 19 percent cut would happen in the second year of Ryan’s budget, with the first year representing a 5 percent cut.

More importantly, as the Romney-Ryan campaign noted in an interview -- and as we have written in the past -- all of this is a speculative proposition. Ryan’s budget did not reduce federal expenditures across the board, and assuming that every item under Ryan’s budget would be cut equally isn’t the most accurate way to look at it. (That said, the lack of detail in Ryan’s plan has left the Romney-Ryan ticket open to such attacks.)

Cuts in spending already passed by Congress

Using the second justification -- comparing Obama’s request to what the GOP-controlled House voted to spend for fiscal year 2012 -- has the advantage of not being speculative. Here’s the amount passed by the House for fiscal 2012 (figures also rounded):

Worldwide Security Protection (ongoing operations): $1.31 billion
Worldwide Security Protection (overseas contigency operations): $247 million
Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance -- Worldwide Security Upgrades: $755 million

Total: $2.31 billion

The difference between these two amounts is nearly $327 million -- a bit above the $300 million Biden cited.

Ultimately, a final bill with slightly higher amounts than the House’s initial bill -- about $60 million more -- was passed by both chambers and signed by the president.

But this approach has problems as well. For starters, Biden glosses over the fact that the president did ultimately sign the bill with the new lower funding amount, meaning he shares some responsibility for the lower level. (All presidential budget requests are opening offers that inevitably become subject to negotiation.)

The main problem with Biden’s claim, however, is that it’s not really what he was referring to in his claim from the debate. Biden said Ryan ""cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for,"" but what passed the House wasn’t Ryan’s budget blueprint -- it was an actual spending bill that emerged from the House Appropriations Committee.

This may be a distinction of interest only to budget wonks, but by muddying the difference, Biden is able to hold up Ryan’s budget -- a long-standing target of Democratic attacks for its approach to Medicare and other federal programs -- as the perpetrator of the cuts, rather than the more obscure appropriations bill.

Our ruling

Both ways of defending the claim of a $300 million cut have some justification, but also come with problems. Extrapolating from Ryan’s budget is a speculative exercise, while the enacted appropriations figures were not directly shaped by Ryan's budget. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/oct/16/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-paul-ryan-cut-embassy-security-300-/

Gov. Nathan Deal touts job creation, investment
","
Job creation has become the calling card of politicians on every level. From the president of the United States to the local city council member, all are touting their contributions to improving the economy through the most measurable way: jobs.

Earlier this month, Gov. Nathan Deal released a statement touting job creation under his administration for the fiscal year that ended June 30. This was the first such announcement for Deal, who took office in January 2011.

In the statement, Deal announced that jobs and investment generated by the Global Commerce Division of the Georgia Department of Economic Development jumped by almost one-third during fiscal 2012.

""The department reported that the 403 company expansions or locations with which it assisted created 28,776 jobs, an increase of 29 percent from last fiscal year, and $5.97 billion in investment, a 32 percent increase,"" the statement said.

We wanted to check the numbers. Where did they originate? At PolitiFact Georgia, we fact-check claims of others, but who at the state level fact-checks the companies’ job creation and investment claims? Is there any follow-up from state officials?

Georgia’s unemployment rate sat at 9.2 percent in August, according to the state Labor Department, above the national rate of 7.8 percent in September. (Georgia’s unemployment numbers for September are expected later this week). Georgia lost 339,000 jobs during the Great Recession, according to the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, and it has only regained about one-third of those jobs.

During the most recent legislative session, Deal proposed a series of incentives -- some of which were approved by the Legislature -- designed to boost long- and short-term economic development. The plan included items such as removing the sales tax on energy used in manufacturing and broadening tax credits for adding jobs.
With the jobs cited in the news release, we asked the Department of Economic Development about the numbers and how they are computed. The news release includes the number of jobs that companies say they are willing to commit to, said Alison Tyrer, a department spokeswoman. The companies also determine what amount of investment the project will produce, and the state also reports that information.

Of the 403 projects worked by the state’s Global Commerce Division and mentioned in the release, 36 percent were new locations; the remaining 64 percent were expansions by existing companies.

The release did not include information regarding the duration of the projects or how many of the jobs were new vs. existing or transfers from other areas. Nor does the release mention the incentives offered at the state and local levels to lure the companies to the state and promote expansion. In articles about some of the larger project announcements over the past fiscal year, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported additional facts regarding the jobs and investment.

For example, a new Caterpillar plant in Athens-Clarke and Oconee counties in northeast Georgia is listed as one of the top projects in the state in fiscal 2012. The company reported 1,400 jobs to be created and an investment in the state of $200 million.

The factory was expected to initially employ 800 employees and expand to 1,400 jobs by 2020. The higher number is used in the news release, even though those jobs will come years from now.

And a Home Depot company expansion in Cobb County for a customer support center was  reported in the release as producing 700 jobs and a $24 million investment. In news reports at the time of the announcement in November 2011, company officials said the center would open with 400 jobs and expand to 700 jobs by 2015.

Because they don’t independently track the numbers, the governor’s numbers can’t really be disputed, said Wesley Tharpe, a policy analyst for the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. The institute has done its own analysis based on all jobs, not just those affected by the Economic Development Department, and found that Georgia has seen a net increase of 50,000 jobs during the similar time period of Deal’s release, from July 2011 to July 2012.

Without including the full information regarding incentives and job and investment results, releases such as those from Deal and other elected officials are ""just fluff without any supporting evidence,"" said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit, nonpartisan policy center promoting corporate and government accountability in economic development.

Two years ago, Good Jobs First conducted a 50-state examination of state’s economic development transparency. At the time, Georgia was one of 13 states plus the District of Columbia to receive a zero rating because they did not report and evaluate the outcomes of economic development deals and spending. The organization plans to update the study next year.

Within the Economic Development Department, the state does release information on incentives when required, Tyrer said. The department recommends grants for certain companies and projects that are then tracked by the Department of Community Affairs. Job tax credits are monitored by the Georgia Department of Revenue when companies report the jobs numbers on their annual tax forms.

The jobs and investment claims in the news release include information about the total number of jobs created during fiscal 2012, which ended June 30. While the jobs gains are admirable, the numbers do not tell the full story.

The numbers included are provided by the companies. They are not from independent analysis or state Economic Development Department examination. And many of the promised jobs and investments extend beyond the noted fiscal year -- they extend over  the course of several years.

That critical context is needed to move this item higher on the Truth-O-Meter.

U.S. Rep. James Langevin says more energy is being produced in the U.S. under the Obama administration than ever before
","
The concern that the United States is not producing enough energy, resulting in high fuel prices, has been one of the themes of the 2012 election season. It came up during the Oct. 9, 2012, Eyewitness News debate between Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin and Republican challenger Michael Riley.

Langevin, asked about energy, said the United States should tap whatever natural resources it can, but added, ""The reality is that the United States doesn't have enough of the world's energy supplies to make a real appreciable difference in controlling or bringing down our energy costs.

""Under the Obama administration we are drilling and producing more domestic energy supplies than we ever had before and it really hasn't had much of an impact on bringing down energy prices,"" he said.

We hadn't heard that the United States is producing more energy than ever before. We decided to see if it was true.

We asked the Langevin campaign for the source of the candidate's claim.

His communications director, Jonathon Dworkin, responded by e-mail that, ""The Congressman misspoke when he said 'ever,' as he realized after the debate.""

""His point was that during the Obama administration, domestic drilling had increased significantly from the years before he took office, going back either 8 or 25 years depending on what you want to measure,"" said Dworkin.

He sent us a statement from the U.S. Department of the Interior asserting that domestic oil production is at an eight-year high and an Aug. 27, 2011, chart from The Wall Street Journal showing that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States had risen to 1,069, the highest level since at least 1987, according to data from the oil services company  Baker Hughes Inc.

We also looked at some of the statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and found that the United States has a long way to go before producing more oil than it ever has.

U.S. production of crude oil peaked at nearly 3.52 billion barrels in 1970. In 2011, production was 2.07 billion barrels. That's about 41 percent below the peak. Production bottomed out at 1.83 billion barrels in 2008 -- the last year of the George W. Bush administration -- and has subsequently risen 13 percent. July production was 194 million barrels; aside from last March, that's the highest since May 1998.

(Many people assume that when you produce more oil, it lowers prices at the gasoline pump. But the Associated Press compared EIA data on domestic oil production with gasoline prices over the past 36 years and found that there was no link.)

But although Langevin's spokesman sent us information about oil prices, Langevin's debate statement was more general, encompassing all energy supplies.

We found that if you look at all fossil fuels, not just crude oil, part of Langevin's statement was correct.

The United States produced 60.1 quadrillion British thermal units of fossil fuel energy in 2011, more than any year in the EIA database going back to 1949, according to the agency's latest data, which is preliminary. (Using the BTU scale allows a comparison between different types of energy.)

Fossil fuel production is higher than ever before because coal production has been rising steadily (except for the past few years) and natural gas production has increased dramatically, in part because companies are using the controversial technique of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to pull more gas from the ground.

However, Langevin's statement saying that this happened ""under the Obama administration"" suggests that the administration was responsible for this trend.

As we have stressed in the past, market forces play the biggest role in determining energy production. In this case, high prices for fossil fuels have encouraged production.

Our Ruling

U.S. Rep. James Langevin, during a discussion that touched on energy policy, said, ""Under the Obama administration, we are drilling and producing more domestic energy supplies than we ever had before.""

Crude oil production in the United States has, in fact, risen recently after a 38-year decline but it is far from its historic high.

However, overall fossil fuel production is the highest it’s ever been, thanks mostly to a sharp increase in natural gas production since 2005.

Langevin may have thought he misspoke, but he actually had the larger trend right.

What he got wrong was the suggestion that the Obama administration was responsible when, in fact, the role of any administration in such matters is usually limited.

Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

The battle between two South Florida congressional candidates -- Republican Adam Hasner and Democrat Lois Frankel -- is largely about who is on the side of the middle class.

Frankel tries to speak directly to middle-class taxpayers boasting in one ad: ""I always take your side"" and promises to strengthen Social Security and defend Medicare. She tries to portray Hasner as the pal of the rich and says in her ads that he ""is never on our side.""

That message is counter to the image he has emphasized of understanding the struggles of the middle class. He says his public school teacher parents in Brooklyn only had $31 to their name when Hasner was born, and he vows to help small businesses and told the Miami Herald’s editorial board that his own home is ""severely under water.""

Here, we will look at a claim from a Frankel ad called ""Real"": ""Hasner gives the wealthy tax breaks worth $250,000 a year but hikes middle class taxes $2,000.""

We wanted to check to see if Frankel accurately characterized Hasner’s record on federal taxes.

The Ryan and Romney tax plans

When we asked the Frankel campaign for evidence of its claim, they pointed us to Hasner’s stated support for a budget plan written by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis,. who later became Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s running mate.

Ryan’s plan doesn’t explicitly call for tax increases. Instead, it says that overall tax rates should be lowered -- Ryan suggests two new tax brackets 10 and 25 percent -- while eliminating loopholes, deductions and exemptions.

Romney’s tax plan is similar, in that it too recommends across-the-board rates cuts in exchange for eliminating loopholes, deductions and exemptions.

The idea behind both plans is to simplify the tax code while bringing in about the same amount of revenue, so as not to drive up the deficit.

But at least two studies have suggested that the middle class would see tax increases if the most common tax breaks were eliminated, even if their overall tax rates drop.

Frankel’s ad cited an ABC News report about one such report by staff for Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., which examined Ryan’s plan.

The Casey report concluded that for those earning more than $200,000 a year ""their net taxes fall significantly,"" while it is likely that those earning less than $200,000 would face an increase.

A study by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that analyzes tax plans, estimated that those earning at least a million dollars would receive an average tax cut of $265,000 under the Ryan plan. But the Tax Policy Center report also showed that Ryan’s plan would mean a net tax cut for every income group over $30,000 a year -- not a tax hike for the middle class, as Frankel claims.

The discrepancy stems from a huge difference in methodology between the Casey report and the Tax Policy Center analysis of Ryan’s plan.

The Casey report assumes -- without really knowing -- that Ryan and fellow Republicans would eliminate current deductions for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions, remove the employer‐provided health insurance exclusion, and tax 401(k) contributions.

But that approach amounts to taking the worst-case approach to make the point.

The Tax Policy Center, on the other hand, attributed no elimination of deductions to Ryan’s plan, noting that his plan doesn’t specify what Republicans would do. (Ryan’s plan does strongly suggest that some tax breaks would go and others would remain, but specifics are lacking).

Democrats have made similar claims that Romney’s tax plan would give millionaires a tax break while raising them for the middle class. Romney’s plan has also lacked details making it difficult to analyze.

What Hasner says

So has Hasner explicitly supported the Ryan or the Romney plans?

We should note that Hasner served in the Florida Legislature, not in Congress. So he’s never taken a vote on the Ryan plan.

But in the past, Hasner clearly said he supported the Ryan plan. When he was running for the GOP primary for U.S. Senate, he repeatedly voiced his support for it. In 2011, the Washington Post The Fix blog-- one of the citations in Frankel’s ad -- said that Hasner ""fully embraced"" Ryan’s budget ""a rare Senate candidate willing to take such a step.""

Hasner said he would vote for the plan ""without hesitation"" and suggested the plan ""does not go far enough.""

And he chastized Republicans who were backing away from it: ""A lot of Republicans are starting to waffle on this question. Some are backing away, some are hedging their bets, some are sticking their finger in to test the political winds. I want you to know that I fully support the Paul Ryan plan.""

But trailing behind in the Senate primary, Hasner switched to the congressional race in February 2012. Now as a candidate running in a left-leaning district where he needs the independent vote, Hasner often talks about his support for the ""bipartisan Wyden/Ryan"" plan.

Is Ryan -- the GOP vice presidential candidate and hero of conservatives -- actually the author some sort of bipartisan plan? Well, sort of -- on paper. But that was a white paper about reforming Medicare -- not a detailed tax plan.

Hasner told us in an interview that he supports extending expiring tax cuts, sometimes called the Bush tax cuts, for all incomes.

""I support extending the current tax rates just like President Obama supported extending them back in 2010,"" he said. (That’s different than Frankel, who has repeatedly said like Obama she wants to get rid of tax cuts for those earning above $250,000.)

Hasner said he supports the general principle of eliminating exemptions and cutting tax rates, but he declined to endorse the specific targets set forth in the Romney and Ryan plans.

Hasner also said: ""I will never support any tax increase on middle-income earners ever. ... If you're not going to eliminate loopholes and exemptions, then I wouldn't support lowering rates.""

Hasner said he was ""not afraid"" of more revenues coming into the government because revenues as a percentage of GDP are below historical levels. He says he supports ""a responsible approach."" The claim is the ad is ""misleading and false,"" he said.

Would Romney's plan result in tax increases on the middle class?

""Not only do I believe the Romney plan doesn't do that, but I would never do that.""

Hasner wrote on his campaign website: ""Reducing marginal rates while broadening the tax base through the elimination of loopholes and exemptions will produce enough revenue to ‘pay’ for cutting everyone’s tax rates and would not require any middle class tax increase, nor would it produce a net windfall for high income taxpayers.""

Hasner told us in an interview he supports maintaining exemptions for mortgage and child tax credits. He would support eliminating an exemption for employer-sponsored health care and putting in place a new health care tax credit.

""I want to level the playing field for people who want to purchase health insurance as individuals and that means eliminating the exemption for employer-sponsored health care,"" he said.

Our ruling

Frankel’s ad says ""Hasner gives the wealthy tax breaks worth $250,000 a year but hikes middle class taxes $2,000.""

The ad bases its claim on a proposal put before Congress by Paul Ryan, now the vice presidential nominee, which Hasner has praised in the past. The plan addressed many aspects of the federal government, including simplifing the tax code by repealing exemptions and cutting tax rates.

But the impact of Ryan’s plan for the middle class is muddled. It’s not clear that it would result in a tax hike for the middle class, though some say it will. The tax plan lacked specifics, which makes it difficult to evaluate. Hasner says he won’t vote for a tax plan that includes middle-income tax increases.

Meanwhile, the ad doesn’t mention the Ryan plan as the source of its claims and states without qualification that Hasner supports tax increases.

We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/oct/15/lois-frankel/lois-frankel-says-adam-hasner-gives-rich-hefty-tax/
"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie: Bridgegate investigations back up my story
","Aside from the national media, no one cares about Bridgegate, says New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. On MSNBC’s Morning Joe July 6, host Joe Scarborough said he generally hasn’t noticed New Hampshire voters asking the Republican presidential candidate about the September 2013 bridge-closing scandal. ""Nobody cares,"" Christie responded. ""They don't care because they know that there’s now been three independent investigations all of which have said exactly the same thing I said the day after it happened. And so, at some point people just say well, you know, after three investigations -- two of them run by folks who were Democrats, Democratic legislature and Democratically appointed U.S. attorney -- you know, after a while people just say, ‘Okay, I guess he's telling the truth.’ "" Multiple New Jersey officials close to Christie have been accused of devising a scheme to close parts of the George Washington bridge, under the guise of conducting a traffic study, causing a week of massive traffic jams in September 2013. The maneuver is widely believed to have been political retribution against officials in Fort Lee, N.J., which was most impacted by the lane closures. Since the week of the closures, Christie has consistently denied that he knew anything about the lane closures until after the fact. In the first few weeks after the lane closures -- before many details came to light -- Christie said the extensive press coverage was overblown. ""I had nothing to do with this: No knowledge. No authorization. No planning,"" he said in a radio interview in February 2014, adding that he learned about the closures from media reports afterward. Have three investigations agreed with him? Christie’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment. But we have a good idea who conducted the three investigations: A Manhattan law firm, the New Jersey legislature and the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. One of these investigations has shut the door -- saying Christie had no involvement -- but the other two left the question open-ended. Gibson Dunn and Crutcher Christie’s administration commissioned law firm Gibson Dunn and Crutcher to conduct an internal probe in January 2014, soon after it came out that members of Christie’s senior staff knew about or were involved in the lane closures. The results of that investigation support the contention that Christie himself had nothing to do with the scandal. ""Our investigation found that Gov. Christie did not know of the lane realignment beforehand and had no involvement in the decision to realign the lanes,"" the report said. ""He does not recall becoming aware of the lane realignment during the period the lanes were closed, but would not have considered a traffic issue memorable in any event."" A Port Authority official -- who later pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the scandal -- said he told Christie about the closures while they were happening, when the two were together at a Sept. 11 memorial event. Christie said he didn’t remember the conversation. ""Gov. Christie’s account of these events rings true,"" the report continued, noting that document reviews and witness interviews fully corroborated Christie’s story. According to the Wall Street Journal, Gibson Dunn attorney Randy Mastro said, ""Our findings today are a vindication of Gov. Christie.""   New Jersey Legislature A December 2014 report out of the New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation came to a much less definitive conclusion on Christie’s involvement. The investigation found ""no conclusive evidence"" as to whether Christie knew about the lane closures in advance or while they were happening. The report said a lack of information from some key witnesses ""leaves open the question of when the governor first learned of the closures and what he was told."" The inquiry found no smoking gun implicating Christie, but the committee concluded that it is ""not in a position currently to conclude what Gov. Christie himself knew about the lane closures or when and how his knowledge of these events developed."" U.S. Attorney investigation A U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey investigation, made public in May 2015, did not find evidence that Christie was criminally involved in planning or concealing the bridge scandal. The investigation resulted in charges of conspiracy and other crimes against three state officials: Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie’s former chief of staff; Bill Baroni, a Christie-appointed executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; and David Wildstein, another Port Authority executive and one of Christie’s political allies. Wildstein pleaded guilty. But the U.S. Attorney’s Office didn’t indict Christie. ""Today’s charges make clear that what I’ve said from day one is true, I had no knowledge or involvement in the planning or execution of this act,"" Christie said following the indictments against his former staffers, according to the Wall Street Journal. Some critics have suggested that because still more evidence could come forward, Christie is not yet fully in the clear. It’s possible that now under the pressure of criminal charges, Kelly and Baroni could reveal information that implicates Christie, wrote Tim Moran, editorial page editor of New Jersey’s Star-Ledger newspaper. At the time, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said, ""We’re always going to be receptive to new evidence, what I will say is this though: Based on the evidence currently available to us, we’re not going to charge anyone else in this scheme."" Fishman also declined to comment on whether others (including Christie) will continue to be investigated for involvement. Our ruling Christie said, ""There’s now been three independent investigations (into the bridge scandal) all of which have said"" that Christie did not have prior knowledge of or involvement in the lane closures. Christie has said since day one that he had no knowledge of the scandal before or during the closures themselves. Three investigations -- a law firm commissioned by Christie, the state legislature and the U.S. attorney’s office -- found no evidence to suggest otherwise. However, only the law firm investigation expressly stated that Christie had no knowledge of the lane closures. In contrast, the legislature’s investigation suggested that it’s still a possibility if more evidence emerges, and the U.S. attorney didn’t say the case is definitively closed. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d659490-7a00-4208-9747-2a9f204e6f8e",/factchecks/2015/jul/09/chris-christie/chris-christie-bridgegate-investigations-back-my-s/

Mark Pocan says most states don’t have workplace protection from sexual orientation discrimination
","After the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision making same-sex marriage the law of the land, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan called for additional rights to be recognized for gay Americans. Pocan, a Democrat from Madison, has long been an advocate of government allowing same-sex marriage. Years after Pocan married his partner in Canada, he made headlines in 2013 when his husband was issued an ID given only to spouses of members of Congress. Pocan issued a statement on June 26, 2015 praising the high court’s landmark ruling, but also to argue the fight for gay rights is not over. ""Today, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed what a majority of Americans already know: all couples should have the right to marry, regardless of who they love. ""As we celebrate this victory, we must also recognize that we still have work to do to ensure all Americans are treated fairly under the law, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity."" The next step in the gay rights movement: ""In a majority of states you can now marry freely,"" Pocan said, ""but can still be fired because of who you love."" The first part of Pocan's claim refers back to the Supreme Court ruling. And after the ruling, Pocan is obviously on point -- not only is same sex marriage permitted in a majority of states, it is allowed everywhere. But what about the second half of the claim, which focuses on workplace discrimination. Can someone be legally terminated in most states because of their sexual orientation? Let’s take a look. The legal landscape The Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects workers from discrimination at the federal level. Title VII of the law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. Title VII's definitions of ""because of sex"" and ""on the basis of sex"" do not mention sexual orientation.   So, there is no federal law that explicitly forbids employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. Legislation has been proposed and failed in nearly every Congress since 1974 that would prohibit employment discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity. In the 1989 Supreme Court case Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, the court ruled sex stereotyping is a form of discrimination protected against under Title VII. Some extend this ruling to protect gay workers who do not conform to gender norms. Gwendolyn Leachman, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said evidence showing the employee was discriminated against for failure to conform to gender stereotypes is necessary. ""If the employer can show that the harassment or other adverse action was motivated ‘purely’ by sexual orientation, then the employee is out of luck,"" Leachman said. Some courts follow the EEOC interpretation. In Terveer v. Billington, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in March 2014 that the discrimination based on someone's status as homosexual was based on gender stereotypes and was covered under Title VII.   But not all courts agree. In fact, Terveer v. Billington is an outlier. And the Supreme Court has yet to hear a case on this matter. Nearly every state has adopted an anti-discrimination law similar to the federal Civil Rights Act. Indeed, many of the state laws provide additional protection for sexual orientation. In a June 2014 fact check of another statement made by Pocan, we learned Wisconsin was the first state to enact a law banning discrimination because of sexual orientation. So how many states followed suit?   Pocan's team sent  a map from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT civil rights advocacy group, to support his claim.   The map showed that 22 states have explicit laws protecting workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. That means 28 states -- a majority -- do not have explicit laws protecting workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Our rating Pocan said, ""in a majority of states you can now marry freely, but can still be fired for who you love."" Federal law does not explicitly protect against this discrimination, though the agency tasked with enforcing the law has interpreted federal protections to include sexual orientation. Meanwhile, 28 out of 50 states do not have such laws. We rate Pocan’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/09/mark-pocan/mark-pocan-says-most-states-dont-have-workplace-pr/

Ron Paul says death penalty trial fueled Texas county's tax hike
","More than a decade ago, three men were prosecuted by an East Texas county for the racist 1998 dragging death of James Byrd Jr. One drew a life sentence, two were sentenced to death. Now comes Ron Paul of Texas, the former Republican U.S. House member and presidential candidate, hammering the fiscal impact of that case. Paul, whose senator-son, Rand, seeks the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, wrote in a June 2015 opinion column: ""It is hard to find a more wasteful and inefficient government program than the death penalty."" By way of example, he offered: ""Jasper County in Texas raised property taxes by 7 percent in order to pay for one death penalty case!"" A reader asked us to check on whether such a case had that tax impact. News stories mention tax hikes We didn’t hear back from Paul about how he reached his conclusion. But searches starting from the Nexis news database led us to a couple news stories suggesting the county bore the costs of three Byrd-related prosecutions and legal appeals by raising its property tax rate. In March 1999, correspondent John Burnett of National Public Radio reported the county, which had then finished one Byrd-related trial, ""has had to raise property taxes 8 percent to pay for the three prosecutions, which are expected to surpass half a million dollars"" in costs, Burnett said. His report included comments from Johnetta Nash, then the Jasper County auditor, saying the county had put off priorities including computer upgrades and a jail addition. A 2002 Wall Street Journal news story presented a percentage tax increase like the one Paul declared. The story said the county’s costs of prosecuting Byrd’s murder had exceeded $1 million with more expenses expected, straining its $10 million annual budget and ""forcing a 6.7% increase in property taxes over two years to pay for the trial."" Generally, the Journal story said, death penalty cases are expensive because sentencing someone to death requires two proceedings; the first determines the accused person’s guilt, the second whether the convicted individual deserves the death penalty. ""A death sentence,"" the story said, ""is typically followed by years of appeals, and sometimes the entire case is retried."" Jasper County official provides costs document Next, we queried officials in Jasper County, including Renee Weaver, the current county auditor, who emailed us an undated document she said she found in her files. The one-page document, titled ""Capital Murder Costs - Jasper County,"" noted the county had six capital murder trials from 1998 to 2000 without more specifics. So we couldn’t tell exactly which trials were covered by the figures. From 1998 through 2000, according to the document, the county spent $873,669 on capital murder costs across 20 itemized categories including salaries, court-appointed attorneys, investigation expenses, courtroom security and telephone charges. The document shows $118,863 in additional costs in 2000 and nearly $124,300 in costs accrued from 2001 through May 2003. Subtracting $298,916 in grants provided by outside agencies to help cover costs leaves the declared unreimbursed county spending over five years at more than $817,000. Uncertain impact on tax rate? Unfortunately for our purposes, the document presented no information on whether changes in the county’s tax rate were influenced by the Byrd-related trial costs. Hoping for illumination on that front, we reached out to current and former county officials. Joe Folk, who was the county’s top elected official as Jasper County judge from 1995 through 2006, said he didn’t recall any tax hike driven by the county’s prosecutorial and appellate costs, though it’s possible. ""It cost us a pretty good sum,"" Folk said. ""We probably had to raise the rates some. But it wasn’t a great amount."" Folk guided us to Nash, the former official who spoke to NPR. She told us she wasn’t sure about any specific hike due to the trials and urged us to consult David Luther, who has long been the chief appraiser of the Jasper County Appraisal District. To our inquiry, Luther provided a chart showing the county’s tax rate changes in those years and, separately, the degree to which each adopted rate exceeded the rate needed to bring in the revenue the county raised from taxes the year before. Taxes did go up. A few months after Byrd’s death, according to the chart, the county increased its general tax rate nearly 12 percent from the year before--from 31.72 cents per $100 valuation to 35.405 cents per $100 valuation. Significantly, Luther elaborated, that rate was about 7.25 percent higher than the rate of 33.012 cents per $100 valuation that would have generated the revenue the county gathered the year before--with the county’s budgeted costs for the Byrd matter, he said, accounting for more than 80 percent of this difference. Luther said he knows how one of the Byrd cases played into the tax rate that first year thanks to his January 1999 letter to a Jasper County prosecutor about how much the judge overseeing that Byrd-related trial was going to have to pay in additional county property taxes on his home due to the county’s trial expenses. At issue, he recalled, was a motion to have the judge recused from the case because of potential bias caused by the tax increase on his homestead. Luther’s letter said the county budgeted about $292,000 for the costs of the trial  during 1999 which, he wrote, translates to about two cents per $100 valuation of the tax rate. For an average local homeowner, county property taxes for the year attributable to those budgeted costs, Luther wrote, broke out to $5.10. ""So,"" Luther told us by email, ""you could say that taxes were increased due to the trial costs by 6.05%."" He acknowledged by phone that this calculation reflected just the first part of the county’s spending on prosecutions and appeals, which extended over several years. Our ruling Paul said Jasper County ""raised property taxes by 7 percent in order to pay for one death penalty case."" The chief appraiser’s research and letter demonstrates there was nearly a 7 percent first-year increase in taxes attributed to the costs of a death penalty trial. We rate Paul’s claim True.

"['National', 'Poverty', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Sanders: Child poverty is higher in America than any other major country
","One plank of Bernie Sanders’ increasingly popular presidential platform is his focus on decreasing poverty and income inequality in America. In a recent appearance on CNN, he decried the influence Wall Street has had on economic policy, and the wealth disparities and class differences that have arisen in the United States. The junior senator from Vermont promised that his administration would look elsewhere to alleviate Americans’ economic problems: ""There are a lot of great public servants out there, great economists who for years have been standing up for the middle class and the working families of this country, who know that it is an international embarrassment that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth."" Sanders’ remark about the American rate of childhood poverty surprised us. But it’s not the first time Sanders has made this claim, so we decided to see if we could corroborate it. Different surveys, but America always near the top Jeff Frank, Sanders’ press secretary, clarified that when the senator said ""major country,"" he meant a member nation of the OECD, an international economic group composed of 34 generally wealthy countries. (OECD stands for the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.) Frank also said that Sanders was referring to a 2012 UNICEF report on childhood poverty in which the United States ranked 34th out of 35 countries with a childhood poverty rate of 23.1 percent, besting only non-OECD member Romania. The report primarily uses data from 2009. According to that report, Sanders’ statement would be true; however, a later UNICEF report from 2014 with more recent OECD data put the U.S. rate of childhood poverty lower than that of Israel, Mexico, Spain, and Greece, as well as that of non-OECD Latvia. (Romania was not included.) The OECD also released its own report on childhood poverty in 2014, using data from 2010. According to that, the United States has less childhood poverty than Chile, Mexico, Turkey, Israel — all of which are OECD members —  and Romania. Matters are further complicated by the fact that the two UNICEF reports use different metrics for determining how to set the threshold for childhood poverty. The 2012 report (and the OECD report) defines impoverished children as those living in households below 50 percent of the median national income. The 2014 report changes this relative poverty line to 60 percent of the 2008 median national income despite its results being from 2012. This is because the report aims to measure the impact of the recession on childhood poverty, something that could not be done if the poverty line were adjusted to the new national income, since incomes would presumably trend downward. Relative vs. absolute poverty Using a relative income line in both studies clarifies the confusion that many Americans may feel in seeing that the United States — with a higher income per capita than most other comparatively democratic nations — has such a high rate of childhood poverty. Since the reports define poverty as a household earning less than a certain percentage of the national income, countries with higher levels of income inequality are also more likely to have higher rates of poverty. The inverse is also true: thus, the Nordic countries, known for the parity of their wealth distribution, have the lowest rates of childhood poverty. As a result of this approach, some commentators have criticized the report for missing the point of a measurement of poverty. One can be less well-off, the argument goes, without being poor, since being poor is defined instead by a lack of access to certain key goods, not by where one’s income falls relative to everyone else’s. Nevertheless, other measures of child well-being tend to confirm what the high childhood poverty rate suggests: According to a UNICEF report on 29 similarly affluent countries, American children rank 25th in safety, 27th in education, and 23rd in housing and environment, among other metrics. These results are less open to charges of political bias; the education ranking, for example, bases its findings mostly on school participation rates and international test scores. The 2012 UNICEF report also defends itself against the charge of primarily measuring income inequality by pointing out that all forms of measuring poverty are relative, because poverty itself is a relative concept, specific to a certain time and place: ""Any poverty line intended to represent a minimum acceptable standard of living in the industrialized world today implies higher standards of food, clothing, housing, water supply, sanitation, health care, education, transport and entertainment than were available to even the wealthiest households of previous eras."" The report also points out that using an ""absolute"" poverty line — determined at some fixed income and pegged only to inflation — becomes less useful as time passes and incomes rise. This is the approach of the U.S. government, which sets a number of different poverty thresholds predicated on the basic needs of different sizes of families. From the 1960s to the year 2000, the fixed poverty line fell from 50 percent to 30 percent of median income. Our ruling Sanders said, ""We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth."" His office later clarified that ""major country"" referred to those nations that were members of the OECD. The 2012 UNICEF report he pointed to agrees with him, but two studies released since then, including another one from UNICEF, show that while the United States does consistently have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the world, there are several OECD members with higher rates, notably Israel and Mexico. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/08/bernie-sanders/sanders-child-poverty-higher-america-any-other-maj/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton says Jeb Bush no longer supports path to citizenship
","In a rare national interview with CNN, Hillary Clinton took aim at Donald Trump’s comments bashing illegal Mexican immigrants and former Gov. Jeb Bush’s stance on pathway to citizenship. ""I feel very bad and very disappointed with (Trump) and with the Republican Party for not responding immediately and saying, 'Enough. Stop it,' "" Clinton said July 7. ""But they are all in the same general area on immigration: They don't want to provide a path to citizenship. They range across a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile toward immigrants."" CNN’s Brianna Keilar then asked: ""But what about Jeb Bush's approach to that?"" Clinton replied: ""He doesn't believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does. As I said, they're on a spectrum of hostility, which I think is really regrettable in a nation of immigrants like ours."" Does Bush no longer believe in a path to citizenship? Jeb’s long history on immigration reform Bush has flip-flopped extensively on the question of a path for citizenship during his long political career. In his 2013 book Immigration Wars, Bush and co-author Clint Bolick wrote that permanent residency ""should not lead to citizenship. It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences — in this case, that those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship."" But in the wake of the book’s release, Bush backtracked. He supported the Senate bill that included a path to citizenship, telling ABC that people entering the country legally ""should be easier with less cost than coming to the country illegally. And if you can create a system like that — as is being discussed in the Senate and in the House — through a path to citizenship, that’s fine."" When we contacted the Bush campaign, the staff referred us to his statement in March in New Hampshire: ""The book I wrote is a pathway to legal status. And we created a conservative alternative to the dead end conversation as to what was going on in Washington, D.C. Now if you could get a consensus done, where you could have a bill done, and it was 15 years as the Senate ‘Gang of Eight’ did, I’d be supportive of that. But the position I have, the view that I have, the one I’ve expressed and the one I continue to express is the one that a path to legal status is more than enough to allow people to come out from the shadows and that’s what they want."" That statement suggests Bush would support a path to citizenship if it were politically viable, but since it’s not, he’s in favor of a path to legal status. On the campaign trail, Bush has said he’s not suggesting a path to citizenship. While ""citizenship"" and ""legal status"" may sound similar, they are not identical. Immigrants who have green cards are allowed to legally stay in the country, while citizenship brings it with it certain extra rights, including the right to vote. Under current immigration laws, once greencard holders wait five years, they can apply for citizenship. A path to only legal status would have to be created, immigration experts told us. ""You could have a program for legal status -- permanent status -- without a path to citizenship,"" said Marc Rosenblum, a deputy director at the Migration Policy Institute, noting that such a proposal in 2006 for a blue card failed. ""It doesn’t exist in current law."" In a May 11 interview, Fox News’ Megyn Kelly asked Bush directly if he supported a path to citizenship. Bush replied: ""No, I’ve said as long as there — if that was the way to get to a deal where we turned immigration into a catalyst for high-sustained economic growth, where we did all the things we need to do in border security, where we narrow the number of people coming through family petition and dramatically expanded a like-kind number for economic purposes, which will help us grow and help the median rise up, in return for that as a compromise, sure. But the plan in the book, and the plan that I’ve suggested when I go out and speak, which is almost every day on this subject, I’m talking about a path to legalized status."" He repeated those comments in a June 16 interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. One final note: In a June 17 interview with David Muir of ABC News, Bush said he would support a path to citizenship for young people brought to the United States as children, often called Dreamers, because proposed legislation that would give them legal status followed by a path to citizenship is known as the DREAM Act. ""DREAM Act kids (are) kids that are here because their parents came, they had no control over it,"" Bush said.""There ought to be some recognition that we're not going to send them back to a country they know nothing about."" Our ruling Clinton said that Bush ""doesn't believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does."" At times, Bush has supported a path to citizenship, and at other times he hasn’t. He has said he might support a path to citizenship if it could make it through the political process. But in recent interviews Bush has emphasized a path to legalized status instead of citizenship. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-jeb-bush-no-longer-supports-p/

In Florida, no-party voters are growing. Question is why
","As the candidate field for the 2016 election continues to grow, the line between Republicans and Democrats is drawn, altered and emphasized. The race toward the primaries and the White House is starting, and the two major parties are, as usual, the ones to watch. Or are they? On a segment of Meet the Press this past Sunday, moderator Chuck Todd brought up a third group that may be just as important as the two major parties in the upcoming election. ""The growing number of voters who don't affiliate with either major political party is reshaping our political system, perhaps more than you may realize,"" Todd said. Todd went on to describe how, according to a recent poll, a larger percentage of Americans identify as independent rather than as Democrat or Republican. Todd cited Florida as a specific example. ""The number of voters (in Florida) who now register as ‘other’ has grown by a million in the last 10 years,"" Todd said. ""Compare that with the Democrats, who only grew by 300,000 and the Republicans who grew by just 200,000."" Has the number of independents really increased by a million? And what do those changes mean? Starting with 2014 as the most recent complete year, PunditFact looked at Florida voter data going back to 2004. We looked at last voter registration report before the November election. The chart below summarizes what we found. Registered Republican voters Registered Democrat voters No Party Affiliation 2004 3,892,492 4,261,249 1,886,013 2014 4,172,232 4,628,178 2,778,547 10-year change 279,740 366,929 892,534 Percent increase 7.19% 8.61% 47.32%   The numbers are relatively close to what Todd said. (After hearing from Todd's staff, the differences mainly appear to be the result of rounding and whether or not you count minor parties such as the Reform Party, the Constitution Party and the Florida Socialist Workers Party, among others.) So the numbers are in the ballpark. Still, there are a few caveats to consider.  No Party Affiliation is a catch-all Florida’s most recent voter registration form became effective in October 2013. In the Party Affiliation box, registrants are asked to choose whether they are affiliated with the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, a minor party, or no party at all. However, if left blank, registrants are automatically registered as having no party affiliation. PunditFact has asked the Florida Department of State how many people are registered with No Party Affiliation because they left the field blank. If we get an answer, we’ll update this item. No Party Affiliation doesn’t translate to no party In an article published in 2014 by Politics in Polk, Kevin Wagner, an associate professor of political science at Florida Atlantic University, warned about some additional nuances that are necessary to consider when talking about independent voters. ""We have leaners or loosely affiliated voters,"" Wagner said. ""Sometimes partisan voters like to call themselves independent. So just asking that question can be inaccurate."" According to one 2009 article, once all the ""leaners"" are taken out of consideration, the pure independents actually end up totaling less than 10 percent of registered voters (with the leaners, independents total about 43 percent of the total registered voters). PunditFact also reached out to John Brehm, a political science professor at the University of Chicago. Brehm said it might be helpful to think of the ""other"" voters Todd mentioned as being divided into two categories. Young voters who have not yet formed a definitive identity mainly constitute the members of the first category. ""The majority of these individuals will eventually come to identify with their parents’ party identities,"" Brehm said. ""Some ... will be influenced by short term forces, typically economic, although sometimes having to do with major foreign policy crises (such as Sept. 11)."" The other category of voters, described by Brehm as those who ""left their partisan identity,"" includes ""longtime Republicans or Democrats who say ‘their party has left them’."" ""Nearly all of these people will come to vote with their prior identities, and another large share will simply not vote,"" said Brehm. As far as not voting goes, the numbers at the polls seem to support this. In the 2014 midterm election, 28 percent of the voter turnout identified as independent. However, at the time, a Gallup poll recorded that independent voters made up 43 percent of registered voters. As Todd even put it during his show, ""Even as the number of Americans identifying as independents has grown, we haven't seen a jump in the number of independent candidates, certainly none that are actually gaining traction, because there are none in the (presidential) race."" Our ruling Todd said that ""the number of voters (in Florida) who now register as ‘other’ has grown by a million in the last 10 years,"" while registered Democrat and Republican voters grew by 300,000 and 200,000 respectively. In Florida, voters who do not indicate affiliation on their registration forms are automatically placed in the No Party Affiliation category, artificially inflating the number of seemingly independent voters. And among voters registered as having No Party Affiliation, many still vote according to partisan lines. Still, the numbers are fairly close, and the trend is certainly spot on. Todd’s statement is accurate but needs some additional information. We rate it Mostly True. Update: We updated this item on July 8, 2015, to add more information explaining how NBC got its figures.",/factchecks/2015/jul/08/chuck-todd/florida-no-party-voters-are-growing-question-why/
"['National', 'Trade', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz changed position on Trade Promotion Authority, also called fast-track
","In a key Senate vote to advance President Barack Obama’s trade agenda, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, cast an unexpected vote that indicates he may have backtracked on fast-track. On June 23, 2015, Cruz voted against Trade Promotion Authority, also known as TPA or fast-track authority, which has been debated in Congress amid efforts by the Obama administration to secure the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with 11 other nations. The very same day as his no vote, Cruz published an op-ed to Breitbart explaining his decision. ""TPA in this Congress has become enmeshed in corrupt Washington backroom dealings, along with serious concerns that it would open up the potential for sweeping changes in our laws that trade agreements do not typically include,"" he said. Cruz’s criticism of fast-track comes as a surprise, considering his public praise of the bill only two months prior. ""We strongly urge our colleagues in Congress to vote for trade-promotion authority,"" Cruz stated, along with co-author Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on April 21. Given that Cruz is a GOP contender for president in the upcoming election, we decided to check how his position on fast-track registers in our Flip-O-Meter. It is important to note that we are not passing judgment on decisions to change positions. Rather, we are just determining whether he did. Cruz in support of TPA Trade Promotion Authority, called fast-track, has been enacted on and off since 1974. If passed, it has a life span of six years, and remains in place regardless of a presidential administration change. Fast-track grants the president freedom to present trade treaties for a straight up or down vote in Congress, freeing him or her from any amendments on trade deals. With negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the works, fast-track was introduced for reauthorization on April 16, 2015, and set to a late May vote in the Senate. In anticipation of this vote, Cruz publicly urged Congress to vote in favor of fast-track authority. ""Congress needs to strengthen the country’s bargaining position by establishing trade-promotion authority, also known as TPA, which is an arrangement between Congress and the president for negotiating and considering trade agreements. In short, TPA is what U.S. negotiators need to win a fair deal for the American worker,"" Cruz and Ryan said in their Wall Street Journal op-ed. Cruz and Ryan also pitched the passage as an important step toward helping the domestic workforce. ""TPA is what U.S. negotiators need to win a fair deal for the American worker,"" they said. ""One in five American jobs depends on trade, and that share is only going to grow."" On May 22, Trade Promotion Authority passed the Senate 62-37 with bipartisan support. Cruz was among the 48 Republicans and 14 Democrats who voted ""yes."" Cruz in opposition to TPA Following the Senate passage, the bill went to the House where it was split into two separate votes: one on TPA and the other on Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA (a program that provides training support, career counseling, allowances, and wage supplements to workers affected by globalization and trade). On June 12, fast-track passed, but Trade Adjustment Assistance was voted down. This stalled and resulted in a motion to reconsider by Speaker Boehner. In a procedural vote on June 23, the Senate passed fast-track once again, 60-38. But this time Cruz cast a ""nay"" vote. The same day, Cruz published his op-ed in Breitbart, a conservative news site, attributing his change of heart on TPA to ""two material changes"" in the legislation. First, he wrote, was the WikiLeaks reveal in June 2015 of the Trade in Services Agreement, or TiSA, which is intended to extend trade in services (as opposed to goods) to address changes and advances in technology since the last major services agreement was implemented in 1995. It is a key part of the trade agenda under negotiations; services include finance, insurance, transportation, telecommunications and other fields.   Cruz wrote: ""Despite the administration’s public assurances that it was not negotiating on immigration, several chapters of the TiSA draft posted online explicitly contained potential changes in federal immigration law. TPA would cover TiSA, and therefore these changes would presumably be subject to fast-track."" Second, he said, were supposed ""secret deals between Republican leadership and Democrats."" ""After witnessing several senators huddle on the floor the day of the TPA vote (on June 23), I suspected that to get their votes on TPA, Republican leadership had promised supporters of the Export-Import Bank a vote to reauthorize the bank before it winds down,"" he said.""I cannot vote for TPA unless McConnell and Boehner both commit publicly to allow Ex-Im to expire -- and stay expired."" Congress debated the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank prior to its expiration on June 30, 2015, and it was a topic of disagreement among GOP members. We asked several international trade experts about Cruz’s claims of undisclosed information about additions to TPA as justification for his switch, and at a minimum, they are in dispute. Gary Hufbauer, an expert in international trade and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics said, ""Inclusion of TiSA under TPA was never a secret. Any immigration changes in TiSA will be limited to L visas (company transfers) and possibly H1-B visas, and be quite limited in number. So this excuse for the flip-flop has zero merit."" ""As for the Ex-Im Bank, Sen. Cantwell’s demand for its inclusion in the TAA-plus bill was rejected, though an eventual vote on Ex-Im was promised by the leadership. Again, nothing new there,"" added Hufbauer. (Cantwell is Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.) Hal Shapiro, a lawyer specializing in international trade practice, said ""the TiSA disclosures by WikiLeaks would be an unusual reason for deciding on TPA."" Hufbauer speculated that Cruz may have changed his vote on TPA to placate his tea party constituents, many of whom are adamantly opposed to TPP. When asked about the reason for his shift in position, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told us, ""Sen. Cruz remains a strong supporter of free trade and fast-track."" Politico and the Washington Post have also noted Cruz’s switch on trade. Our ruling Cruz was a supporter and voted in favor of TPA or fast-track when it was first put to a vote in May. Only a month later, Cruz issued an op-ed denouncing the additions of Export-Import Bank reauthorization and immigration laws, and then voted in opposition. His change of stance is well documented, and we rate his change of position a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2015/jul/08/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-changed-position-trade-promotion-authorit/
"['Immigration', 'PunditFact', 'Harris Faulkner']","
Fox News host: Obama ended program for tracking undocumented immigrants
","When an undocumented immigrant from Mexico allegedly shot and killed a 32-year-old woman in San Francisco July 1, 2015, he triggered a round of finger pointing that variously laid blame on the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House. On Fox News, host Harris Faulkner connected the tragedy with a shift in administration policy last November. The Department of Homeland Security ended a program called Secure Communities that used fingerprints sent by local police departments to flag people who were in the country illegally. ""President Obama in November of last year wiped away the Secure Communities program,"" Faulkner said on Outnumbered on July 6, 2015. ""When you take away a program that allows for shared fingerprinting for those who are behind bars so you know who is here legally and illegally ... you're tacitly saying we don't really care who we have in this country."" Obama did end the Secure Communities program, but state and local law enforcement agencies still send the fingerprints of people they arrest to Washington. What has changed is how federal officials use that information. Secure Communities The Secure Communities program rolled out across the country from late 2008 through 2012. Basically, it had three parts. When state and local officials arrested someone, they would send their fingerprints to the FBI, and from there, those fingerprints would go to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a division within the Department of Homeland Security. ICE would look for matches in its files of people who had broken one immigration law or another, such as attempting to sneak across the border, overstaying a visa or some other violation. If it spotted someone, ICE would issue a detaining order. Local authorities would then hold the person so federal officers could pick him or her up for deportation. Secure Communities racked up big numbers. By 2013, the program had led to the deportations of about 300,000 people. Federal immigration officials using the program had identified about 1.5 million potential violators. But policy and legal setbacks quickly emerged. Many large cities and counties in states from Maryland to California began to refuse to honor the federal detaining orders. They complained that immigrants who were victims of crime were not telling police out of fear that they or people they knew would be caught in the program’s net. In 2014, an Oregon judge ruled that local officials had violated a woman’s Fourth Amendment rights by keeping her without proper cause. In November 2014, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson released a memo that replaced Secure Communities with a more targeted effort called the Priority Enforcement Program. What remained and what changed Specialists in immigration law and a spokesman for ICE explained that Secure Communities was actually a 3-step process. 1: Local and state police share the fingerprints of people they arrest. 2: ICE identifies matches in its database. 3: ICE issues a detaining order. Everything we learned said the first two steps remain in effect. Adam Cox is a researcher and law professor at the New York University School of Law. He and Thomas Miles at the University of Chicago School of Law got into the nuts and bolts of Secure Communities in the course of assessing its impact on crime. ""The core technological innovation of mandatory, nationwide fingerprint screening, is unchanged and here to stay,"" Cox said. A spokesman for ICE, Pedro Ribeiro, confirmed that. Ribeiro explained that fingerprint sharing is standard procedure for just about every police department and sheriff’s office in the country. Some do it faster than others and some have better technology, but it is regular practice to send fingerprints to the National Crime Information Center at the FBI. Once the data is there, it is shared automatically with Homeland Security and other agencies. There’s nothing the locals can do to stop it. In 2014, the FBI’s center averaged 12 million data transactions each day. The system is a basic tool in fighting crime and countering terrorists, and when ICE gets the data, it helps track people in the country without authorization. The American Immigration Council advocates on behalf of immigrants. Mark Noferi tracks enforcement policy for the council and said that elements of Secure Communities shifted to other parts of Homeland Security. ""By February 2014, the Criminal Alien Program was already responsible for the day-to-day management of Secure Communities fingerprint-sharing,"" Noferi said.  ""So, by Nov. 20, 2014, when Secretary Johnson ended ‘Secure Communities as we know it,’ DHS had already operationally combined Secure Communities with another ICE program."" The part of the program that stopped in late 2014 was the practice of issuing detaining orders solely on the basis of breaking the country’s immigration laws. Enforcement was refocused on people convicted of a serious crime, participating in gang activity, selling drugs and so on. We heard from ICE that the process of identifying people who are in the country illegally continues, with database matches flowing to regional ICE centers. What happens to them there depends on the severity of the offense. Our ruling Faulkner said that Obama ended Secure Communities, a program that used fingerprint sharing to identify people in the country illegally. She is correct that Obama ended that program, but outside experts and ICE itself told us that the process of sharing fingerprints and identifying people who are not supposed to be in America continues. What ended was the deportation process that was at the center of Secure Communities. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out a lot of important information. So we rate it Half True. Correction: Kathryn Steinle, the woman slain in San Francisco was in town to visit a sister-in-law who was expecting. The original report had that Steinle was expecting.",/factchecks/2015/jul/08/harris-faulkner/fox-news-host-obama-ended-program-tracking-undocum/

In Wisconsin visit, Barack Obama brags that he reduced federal deficit by two-thirds
","Making an economic speech at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse on July 2, 2015, Barack Obama ticked off a list of his accomplishments as president -- and made a bolder version of a claim we have heard before about slashing the federal budget deficit. ""So, we’ve got a record streak of private-sector job growth,"" Obama said in his remarks, which included veiled criticisms of Gov. Scott Walker on the day Walker filed federal papers as a precursor to announcing his run for president. ""We’ve cut the deficit by two-thirds. Our stock market has more than doubled, restoring 401(k)s for millions of families. This is progress. Step by step, America is moving forward. Middle-class economics works. It works. Yes!""

Here's why the deficit claim caught our attention: In September 2014 in Milwaukee, Obama said he had cut the deficit in half. We rated that statement True, and it has become one of our most-clicked fact checks. Could it be that, less than a year later, the deficit is down by two-thirds? Deficit vs debt Let’s be clear at the top that Obama is talking about the deficit, which has been getting smaller -- not the debt, which is getting bigger. The deficit is an annual number. It’s the difference between what the government collects in revenues and spends in one year. The United States hasn’t seen budget surpluses since the days of President Bill Clinton. The debt, meanwhile, is a running tally -- it’s the total of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses. The nation's debt currently exceeds $18 trillion, and it has risen by more than $7 trillion under Obama. (Here’s a good primer from PolitiFact National on the difference between the two.) Tracking the deficit numbers In reviewing the cut-the-deficit-in-half claim, our baseline was fiscal 2009. That period started on Oct. 1, 2008, when George W. Bush was still president, and ended on Sept. 30, 2009, eight months after Obama took office. We found the deficit was $1.41 trillion in 2009 and $679.5 billion in 2013 -- a drop of more than half. Measured another way, the deficit made up 9.8 percent of the economy (gross domestic product) in 2009 and dropped to less than half of that -- 4.1 percent -- by the end of fiscal 2013. But now we have figures for fiscal 2014. PolitiFact National examined those figures in January 2015, after Obama said in his State of the Union speech that we've seen ""our deficits cut by two-thirds."" Our colleagues rated his statement Mostly True. The 2014 deficit was $486 billion -- a drop of two-thirds from the $1.41 trillion in 2009. And it was 2.8 percent of GDP, a reduction of more than two-thirds from the 9.8 percent in 2009. (In June 2015, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that 2015 will end with a deficit that, as a percentage of GDP, will be the lowest since 2007.) So, math wise, Obama’s two-thirds claim is solid. But there are a few caveats. ""Yes, we reduced the deficit two-thirds from its peak in 2009, but that was after deficits had just increased by nearly 800 percent to their highest level outside of World War II,"" Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget told us. Indeed, Obama helped grow the 2009 deficit with his stimulus spending, although he can take some credit for the economy, which has improved since the Great Recession ended in June 2009 and helped bring down the deficits. And although the Congressional Budget Office projects that deficits relative to GDP will decline slightly over the next few years, they will then rise and add more to the debt. Largely as a result of the aging population and rising health care costs, CBO projects the deficit to grow from less than 3 percent of GDP in 2015 to more than 6 percent in 2040. Our rating Obama said: ""We've cut the deficit by two-thirds."" In raw dollars and as a percentage of the overall economy, the annual federal deficit in 2014 was two-thirds smaller than in 2009, the year Obama took office. But there are several caveats, including the fact that his stimulus spending helped raise the 2009 deficit and the economy, for which he can take some credit, has improved since the end of the Great Recession the same year. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/08/barack-obama/wisconsin-visit-barack-obama-brags-he-reduced-fede/
"['Candidate Biography', 'History', 'PunditFact', ""Dinesh D'Souza""]","
Hillary Clinton with a Confederate battle flag? Nope, an old image was manipulated
","A photograph of Hillary Clinton with the Confederate flag? Could it be real? Conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza appears to have thought so. On Jully7, 2015, D’Souza -- the author of such conservative tomes as The Roots of Obama’s Rage and such films as 2016: Obama’s America -- tweeted an image of the young Hillary Rodham, then a recent Wellesley College grad, seated at home and wearing a rather headache-inducing pair of striped pants. Along with the image, D’Souza attached this message to his 198,000 Twitter followers: ""Look closely at this Hillary photo; isn't that a Confederate flag behind her on the bookshelf?"" There was one problem: The photograph had been doctored, though not by D’Souza. As PolitiFact was looking into this image on July 7, D’Souza had not tweeted a retraction or clarification. He also didn’t respond to an email sent through his website. About four hours after he sent the tweet, he stepped back from it: ""CORRECTION: Disregard the photoshopped Confederate flag in the background of the Hillary photo and simply focus on those glasses and hairdo."" The image came from a series of photographs that Life photographer Lee Balterman took of members of the Wellesley Class of 1969 for a multipage photo essay in the magazine. One image of Clinton from the series ran with the photo essay itself, and at least one other photograph trickled out afterward (it can be seen accompanying this 2007 New York Times article). The photographs were taken at her home in Park Ridge, Ill. It took until 2014 for the full series documenting Clinton -- then known as Hillary Rodham -- to see the light of day, when Life.com published extensive selections from the series here. The important point of all this background is that the images of Clinton taken by Life do not include a Confederate battle flag anywhere. That leaves the only possible option that someone, somewhere along the way, digitally manipulated the image to include the flag, whether through sinister motives or simply for a laugh. Soon after the image started circulating on the Internet -- which occurred as early as July 5 here -- skeptics noted previously posted photographs from that series that don’t show a Confederate battle flag. One contributor to the blog Little Green Footballs wrote, ""5 seconds of Google image search showed that the flag was never in any of the previous images, particularly this one tagged by Getty Images at Huffington Post in 2012."" The blogger added, ""Admit it, you were all dazzled by the psychedelic pants!"" Our ruling D’Souza tweeted out to nearly 200,000 followers a photograph of 21-year-old Hillary Clinton that appeared to feature a Confederate battle flag in the background. But as a look at the original images makes clear, the photograph has been manipulated to include the flag, and D’Souza’s accompanying comment in the tweet doesn’t indicate that he was aware of the fakery. (He later corrected the tweet.) We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2015/jul/07/dinesh-dsouza/hillary-clinton-confederate-battle-flag-nope-old-i/

Meme says Hillary Clinton's top donors are banks and corporations, Bernie Sanders' are labor unions
","As Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gains ground on Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, the two candidates’ supporters have been sparring, including over campaign donations. Recently, a reader sent us a social media meme that paints Clinton’s list of donors as dominated by corporate interests, whereas Sanders’ top 10 donors come largely from labor unions -- a dichotomy that, to Democratic primary voters, puts Sanders in a more favorable light. ""Hillary: Top ten donor list. Representing banks, corporations and media,"" the meme reads, providing a top-10 list with dollar amounts. ""Bernie: Top ten donor list. Representing people."" The meme is topped by each candidate’s presidential campaign logo. (See the meme below.) We can’t tell who produced this meme, but we thought it was worth a closer look. We’ll start by noting that reasonable people can disagree about whether labor unions represent ""people,"" as the meme says, as opposed to just unionized workers, who are a relatively small subset of the entire population. We’ll also note that while this meme may appeal to union supporters and critics of Wall Street and big corporations, it also could be used as evidence that Sanders is just as reliant on one type of donor -- labor unions -- as Clinton is on big corporations. We found that the data cited in the meme refers to cumulative donations over the course of each candidate’s political career as calculated by the Center for Responsive Politics, not just fundraising from the current presidential cycle. (Clinton and Sanders have announced their fundraising hauls for the second quarter of 2015, but have not yet released the full data that is due at the Federal Election Commission by July 15; a more complete analysis of the data will be compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics after that.)  For Clinton, we found a high degree of similarity with the meme when we checked the database on July 6. Clinton’s top 10 cumulative donors between between 1999 and 2016 were, in descending order, Citigroup ($782,327), Goldman Sachs ($711,490), DLA Piper ($628,030), JPMorgan Chase ($620,919), EMILY’s List ($605,174) Morgan Stanley ($543,065), Time Warner ($411,296), Skadden Arps ($406,640), Lehman Brothers ($362,853) and Cablevision Systems ($336,288). That list is quite close to what the meme says. It includes five financial-services companies, two law firms that do a lot of corporate work, two media conglomerates and one group, EMILY’s list, that supports abortion-rights Democratic candidates. It’s worth noting that Clinton was a senator from New York, meaning that some of the donors on her list were not simply Wall Street and corporate behemoths, but also constituents, based in New York. The database results for Sanders are also quite close to what’s in the meme. The data for Sanders goes back to 1989. His top 10 are, in descending order, Machinists/Aerospace Workers union ($105,000), Teamsters union ($93,700), National Education Association ($84,350), United Auto Workers ($79,650), United Food & Commercial Workers union ($72,500), Communications Workers of America ($68,000), Laborers Union ($64,000), Carpenters & Joiners Union ($62,000), National Association of Letter Carriers ($61,000), and the American Association for Justice ($60,500). In the meme, the letter carriers’ union makes the list, but the Center for Responsive Politics has the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees cracking the top 10 instead. Either way, nine of the 10 are unions, and the tenth is the national association representing plaintiffs’ attorneys. During his career, Sanders has received strong support from progressive Democrats, so this pattern of financial backing is not surprising. So the meme is pretty accurate for both candidates. However, we see a few things worth pointing out. As we noted, this data refers to their entire political careers back to the 1990s. Once the full presidential data is released, those figures may show different patterns. ""That is not made clear"" in the meme, said Anthony J. Corrado, a campaign-finance expert at Colby College. ""Most people would assume that this is money raised so far in the 2016 presidential campaign."" Also, the ""donors"" listed are not the ones who gave the money, since that would be against the law. Rather, it was their PACs, employees and those employees’ families. In fact, due to how the forms are filled out, the data is less likely to capture individual donations from union members than from employers of companies. Most individual donations are listed by employer, and if, say, a union carpenter lists his affiliation as his company, the fact that he’s a union member wouldn’t be recorded. Finally, lists such as this ignore that both candidates are collecting many small donations, too. According to the Clinton campaign, she raised roughly $50 million in contributions under $200 during her '08 campaign. Data for the 2016 cycle is not available yet. All told, it’s possible to look at the top donors on the two lists and say both candidates are captive to a particular set of interest groups, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. However, he added, ""labor is a Democratic constituency whose beliefs generally line up with Democratic policies, and we’re talking about a Democratic primary here. So all things being equal, Sanders’ donor list probably looks better, politically, than Clinton’s."" Kondik added that, as the meme indicates, Clinton has a much larger reservoir of money than Sanders has. ""The value of having a large financial advantage over your competitors in a primary setting seems to be worth occasional questions about how the financial advantage was built,"" he said. Our ruling Social media memes say that Clinton’s top 10 donors are mainly ""banks, corporations and media,"" while Bernie Sanders’ top 10 donors are labor unions. This contention fits quite closely with campaign data from the Center for Responsive Politics. However, it’s worth noting that this data refers to cumulative donations as far back as the 1980s, rather than just donations to their current presidential bids.

Florida has reduced carbon emissions by 20 percent since 2005, Bilirakis says
","Editor’s note: While researching this fact check, Rep. Bilirakis’ office on July 2, 2015, provided us with its research methodology using data through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Markets Program Data. Using this database, Bilirakis’ aides showed a 21.82 percent change in carbon dioxide tonnage emitted from Florida power plants between 2005 and 2012. PolitiFact was able to reproduce these results on July 2 when we followed their methodology, obtaining the same database numbers directly from the EPA website. We shared results with numerous sources who agreed the methodology was sound and the results illustrated Bilirakis’ point. We published the check with a Mostly True. Later that day, an EPA contact informed us the 2012 figure used in Bilirakis’ calculation was incorrect. The agency calculated percent change between 2005 and 2012 was 13.87 percent, not 21.82 percent.  When we queried the database again, the figure we received was the number the EPA cited. Neither Bilirakis’ aides nor the EPA could explain the discrepancy. An environmental scientist with the EPA said there had not been a revision of the figures since 2013. The 20 percent figure has been used by Bilirakis and other members of the Florida Republican caucus since at least November 2014, although this is the first time PolitiFact has checked it.  We are seeking an explanation for this discrepancy and will post findings when we have them. Republicans in Congress recently voted for legislation that would prevent the federal government from implementing new emissions regulations on power plants -- in part, some argue, because utilities are already cutting carbon levels on their own. U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, said that HR 2042, known as the Ratepayer Protection Act, would protect states from costly rules that aren’t necessary. The bill would delay the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce nationwide carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 30 percent by 2030. The legislation also would allow states to opt out of the reduced emissions requirement. ""The EPA’s proposal on this rule has drawn widespread concern,"" Bilirakis said in a speech on June 24, 2015, before the GOP-majority House passed the legislation along party lines. ""It placed a heavier burden on Florida than other states, despite the fact that Florida has reduced its carbon emissions by 20 percent since 2005."" Congressional fights over regulations are not new, but we did a double take when Bilirakis said carbon emissions were down 20 percent over the last decade. (A reader sent us his comment and asked us to check it.) We decided to check whether the data fuels his claim. Carbon dating the claim We need to make sure one point is clear: Bilirakis was talking specifically about electricity generating power plants here. That’s important to understand, because the context wasn’t immediately clear to us -- or to some of our sources. The EPA’s new emission goals, which won’t be finalized until August, target power plants for that 30 percent reduction, starting at 2005 levels. The guidelines are part of President Barack Obama’s larger Climate Action Plan to enforce lower levels of air and water pollution. Some states and electricity providers have sued the EPA, saying the new rules are unnecessary and expensive for utilities, and therefore consumers. Enter the House’s Ratepayer Protection Act, which would keep the 30 percent reduction guidelines from going into effect for power plants until the justice system rules whether the EPA plan is legal. Obama has vowed to veto the Ratepayer Protection Act if it passes. A Bilirakis spokesman backed up the 20 percent figure by looking at EPA carbon dioxide emissions data for power plants generating more than 25 megawatts of electricity, which are covered by the EPA threshold for the guidelines. That data showed that between 2005 and 2012, the latest year with complete figures, Florida had reduced its power plant carbon dioxide emissions by 21.8 percent. That seems like a small slice of data, but even experts who were for the stronger emissions regulations told us it’s a valid use of the numbers to back up Bilirakis’ point. Power plants in Florida affected by the Clean Power Plan really have cut carbon dioxide by that much, according to the EPA. Of course, our first reaction to this claim was that all sources of carbon dioxide emissions had receded, which also turns out to be the case, although not at as high a rate. Accounting for cars, commercial and residential use, and a whole range of petroleum products, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says Florida’s overall emissions total have dropped about 15.7 percent in the same time span. The agency told us it’s not hard to imagine the number continuing to drop in subsequent years, but the data doesn’t show a 20 percent decrease. A look at the overall data from the EPA, which is recorded and calculated a little differently, puts the decrease from all sources at about 13.4 percent. What’s driving the downward trend for power plants? Environmental groups point out that there are several causes. Part of the change is because of utilities switching from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas (usage is up 67.6 percent between 2005 and 2012 in Florida) as natural gas prices have fallen. Credit also can go to increased efficiency in everything from air conditioners to washing machines to refrigerators. Some of the new product efficiencies are the result of other regulations, like the federal push to switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs. And while Florida was the second-highest electricity producing state in the country behind Texas in 2014, it still imports power to meet demand. That means if a power plant in another state burns fuel to generate electricity to sell to Florida, those carbon dioxide emissions don’t go against Florida’s total. That may be skewing the use-to-emissions ratio a bit. Finally, critics of the House legislation point out there’s one more caveat to the data Bilirakis cited: There’s no guarantee the state will maintain that drop in carbon dioxide from power plants. ""There is nothing to keep these emissions down to their current levels,"" said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, which opposes the Ratepayer Protection Act. ""If natural gas prices went back up, folks would start running coal plants more and emissions would increase -- absent any CO2 emission regulations."" Our ruling Bilirakis said, ""Florida has reduced its carbon emissions by 20 percent since 2005."" It may not be immediately clear from Bilirakis’ speech, but he’s only talking about carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that would be affected by the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. Those are the guidelines that would be put on hold by the bill passed by the House. EPA data show those Florida electricity generators have cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21.8 percent between 2005 and 2012. Overall carbon dioxide emissions from all sources didn’t decrease quite as much, dropping anywhere from 13.4 to 15.7 percent. Environmental groups also warned that the current reductions aren’t guaranteed. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate Bilirakis’ statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/07/gus-bilirakis/florida-has-reduced-its-carbon-emissions-20-percen/

Agency says low-flow toilets saving millions of gallons of water daily
","Even if Georgia were, ahem, flush with water, the number would have looked impressive. The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District recently celebrated its rebate program that has helped homeowners replace 100,000 older model toilets with water efficient models across the 15-county metro Atlanta region. The total savings: 2.4 million gallons of water every day. ""One of the beautiful things about changing out a toilet is you get a rebate, but you also permanently save on your water bill,"" said Katherine Zitsch, the water district’s director. ""It’s not behavior based. You do what you normally do and you get those savings for as long as the toilet lasts."" And considering the water saved would fill the Georgia Aquarium 90 times a year – clearly nothing to poo poo – PolitiFact Georgia decided to dive in. Going with the flow Today’s toilet regulations date back to the 1992 Energy Policy Act, which required toilets to use 1.6 gallons of water per flush, versus the then-common 3.5-gallon models (and even older models that used as much as 8-gallons for every push of the handle). Early savings didn’t materialize because manufacturers did little more than halve the water used in a flush. Irate homeowners in news stories from the mid-Clinton years griped about having to flush multiple times to get the job done. ""Plumbers were installing and changing out toilets and handing people plungers,"" said Ellen Whitaker, executive director of the Plumbing and Mechanical Association of Georgia. ""It was as bad as it sounds. It just didn’t work. We don’t see those complaints anymore."" Technology wiped out those early problems. High-pressure gadgets, and even vacuum toilets with suction that rivals airplane lavatories, have made it possible for high-efficiency models to use just 1.28 gallons per flush. That lower number qualifies commodes for the WaterSense designation. The privately verified seal, similar to Energy Star ratings for electrical appliances, confirms toilets, faucets and showerheads are the most water-efficient on the market. Exchange of Thrones The water planning district started its toilet rebate program in 2007, well into the era of high-tech toilets but also in the midst of back-to-back droughts in Georgia. Local water utilities fund and run the program, rebating $100 on water bills when homeowners show they have replaced an older toilet with a water-efficient model. Most utilities will offer rebates for up to two toilets, though some will rebate three. The planning district has kept track of the number of toilets – as well as whether the new models are the 1.28-gallon or 1.6-gallon model.. But the district has been conservative in estimating the water saved, counting only one toilet per household, even in situations where records show more than one throne was exchanged. The district then multiplies the water saved per toilet by what its partner, the Atlanta Regional Commission, shows is the average household size in a community. Using a small jurisdiction like Bartow County, which exchanged WaterSense toilets in 49 homes, the math looks like this: Step 1: 3.5 gallon minus 1.28 gallon = 2.22 gallons per toilet. Step 2: 2.22 gallons times 49 households = 108.78 gallons Step 3:  108.78 gallons times 5 flushes = 543.9 gallons per day Step 4: 2.71 average home size times 543.9 gallons = 1,474 gallons per day Bartow also had one home that received a 1.6 gallon toilet. Using the same formula, that translates into 25 gallons a day. The water district rounded up, showing 1,500 gallons per day of savings in Bartow. Similar calculations were done across the region, to arrive at the 2.4 million gallons total, said Paul Donsky, spokesman for the ARC. Cobb and DeKalb counties, which account for 15 percent and 20 percent of the totals exchanged, run their own programs and calculate the totals slightly differently. DeKalb, for instance, assumes 10 flushes per day per toilet, not per person. That translates into more gallons but overall, fewer flushes. The Environmental Protection Agency’s WaterSense calculator uses yet another similar but not quite exact formula for its estimates. That calculator factors in 5.05 flushes per day, showing that a two-person home that switches to a WaterSense model, would save 8,200 gallons of water annually. The water planning district’s math is more conservative. Using the formula, the district arrives an estimate of annual savings of 8,103 gallons. ""They are all estimates but show our effort to reduce water use,"" said Jennifer Colaizzi, the EPA’s WaterSense spokeswoman. ""We want to encourage people to use water more efficiently."" To that end, the water district notes there has not been a slowdown in the number of people seeking and getting the toilet rebate. The program is expected to continue until most homes use the newer, water-sipping flushes. Our ruling The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District recently touted that the region saves 2.4 million gallons of water every day, based on its toilet rebate that has replaced 100,000 commodes with more efficient models. That’s enough to fill 1,363 Olympic-size swimming pools every year. But the district’s own math backs it up. And a comparable federal calculator shows that the district is being conservative in estimating the region’s move toward water efficiency.

Trump immigration claim has no data to back it up
","Despite the backlash, Donald Trump has remained steadfast in his position that illegal immigrants from Mexico bring rampant crime to the United States. ""You have illegal immigrants pouring through the country,"" the ultra-wealthy businessman and Republican presidential candidate said on Fox Business Network July 1. ""They're incarcerated. Many of them are in jails. You have hundreds of thousands of people going to state and federal penitentiaries. That just came out in a Homeland Security Report."" We wondered if Trump was right that there are ""hundreds of thousands"" of illegal immigrants in the nation’s state and federal prisons. We polled experts and asked government agencies and found no data that speaks to this claim conclusively.   ""The basic claim is at best unsustainable or more likely pure fiction. A fact created out of thin air,"" said Ramiro Martinez, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University. ""There is no substance to the Donald Trump assertion since the data do not exist."" We reached out to Trump’s staff multiple times and didn’t hear back, though he did cite a recent Department of Homeland Security report. However, it doesn’t seem like such a report exists. Turns out Homeland Security doesn’t regularly track the number of incarcerated illegal immigrants, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement Press Secretary Gillian Christensen. The most recent comprehensive number we could find comes from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In total, there were around 90,000 noncitizens incarcerated in federal and state prison systems at year end in 2013. But this doesn’t tell us much; the noncitizen group includes both legal and illegal immigrants, and the report does not separate the two. But in any case, we know that there are definitely not ""hundreds of thousands"" of illegal immigrants in state and federal penitentiaries. The Bureau of Justice Statistics report also does not talk about immigrants among local jail population, which Trump mentioned. A 2011 Government Accountability Office report gets us a tiny bit closer. In 2009, state prisons reported about 90,000 incarcerated individuals of illegal or unknown immigration status, and local jails reported about 204,000. While this might seem to add credence to Trump’s claim, the GAO data does not represent the number of unique individuals because a person could be incarcerated multiple times within one or more districts. Additionally, the report admits there are no fully reliable sources for state and local incarcerated populations. It’s also worth noting that in fiscal year 2014, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported just under 178,000 illegal immigrants convicted of a crime, about 56 percent of all deportations. This is similar to previous years. So in Trump’s defense is the fact that there might be, at any given point, more than 100,000 immigrants in the United States convicted of a crime. The fact that many immigrants are detained for immigration violations awaiting deportation -- as opposed to committing some other type of crime -- makes incarceration statistics hard to evaluate, said Mary Waters, a sociology professor at Harvard University. The GAO study found that immigration violations were the most frequent offense leading to detention, followed by drug and traffic violations. We also wanted to note that every expert we polled said there is a consensus among scholars that undocumented immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens. They sent quite a few studies our way. (If you’re curious, the May 2014 issue of Criminology and Public Policy has a good roundup of the latest research.) The near certainty that an undocumented immigrant will be removed if convicted of a crime has been found to be a strong crime deterrent among immigrants, according to a paper co-authored by Waters. One 2007 study out of the Immigration Policy Center, a pro-immigration think tank, found that American men of Mexican descent ages 18 to 39 had an incarceration rate of 5.9 percent, while foreign-born Mexicans living in the United States had an incarceration rate of 0.7 percent. The overall incarceration rate for American-born men ages 18 to 39 is 3.5 percent. In 2009, the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, published a report analyzing government and academic data that found higher rates of criminality among immigrants, though noting, ""The overall picture of immigrants and crime remains confused due to a lack of good data and contrary information."" But the bottom line on Trump’s specific claim is that there’s no definitive number, or even a good ballpark figure, of how many illegal immigrants are currently incarcerated. Our ruling Trump said ""Hundreds of thousands of (illegal immigrants are) going to state and federal penitentiaries.""   In 2013, there were fewer than 100,000 noncitizens -- legal and undocumented -- in federal and state prisons. If you add in local jails, it’s quite possible but uncertain that the total number of incarcerated illegal immigrants is above 100,000, though it’s also possible that many of these individuals are held for immigration violations as opposed to other crimes. We just don’t have solid data on this point. Without any good information to back it up, Trump’s claim falls flat.

Yep, Greece and Miami metro have about the same GDP
","Greek voters stuck a wrench into European finances with their rejection of an austerity-bailout package on July 5, 2015. With the referendum results all in, the possibility that Greece might ditch the Euro, the European Union’s common currency, became more likely than ever. Before the vote though, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman warned that the greatest worry might have less to do with Greece than with other shaky economies in the Euro zone. On ABC’s This Week, Krugman downplayed the impact of the Greek economy per se. ""Greece is not a big economy,"" Krugman told host George Stephanopoulos, ""It's about the size of metropolitan Miami. So if you asked how much direct spillover there is from whatever happens in Greece, not that much."" But if Greece bailed on the Euro, Krugman said, Spain and Portugal might follow, which would gut the idea of a unified pan-European economy to compete with the powerhouses of America and China. Our focus is decidedly more humble than the future of Europe. We wanted to check Krugman’s comparison of Greece to the greater Miami area. Krugman has not rested on his Nobel Prize laurels. He is correct. The latest estimate of the Gross Domestic Product of the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area, according to Washington’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, was $281 billion in 2013. The same year, the CIA estimated the size of the Greek economy at $282.6 billion in 2013. Another estimate, from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, put Greece’s GDP at about $283 billion. Either number supports Krugman’s point. The only caveats are technical. The CIA and OECD estimates are based on ""purchasing power parity,"" a set of formulas that adjust for how much it costs to buy exactly the same basket of goods in two countries using different currencies. The OECD says that filtering out price differences gives a more accurate comparison of the economies of the two countries. If you measure the Greek economy strictly by the market exchange rate, the numbers shift. According to the World Bank the country’s GDP was $242.2 billion in 2013. Compared to the total Euro zone economy, Greece represented about 2.2 percent of the zone’s $12 trillion-plus GDP in 2013. By the way, if the size of the Greek economy is about the same as that of the greater Miami metro region, that’s the extent of the similarity. The average person in Miami was much better off financially with a per capita GDP of $48,225. In Greece, it was $25,666. Our ruling Krugman said that the economy of Greece is about a big as that of the Miami metropolitan area. Based on a common measure of Gross Domestic Product, that is accurate. The GDP of Greece was about $282 billion in 2013, and the Miami metro area had a GDP of $281 billion.

Is Donald Trump's 'Art of the Deal' the best-selling business book of all time?
","Appearing on CNN to defend his controversial comments on ""rapist immigrants,"" Donald Trump said he doesn’t understand why Republican party leaders are so quick to publicly dismiss him. After all, Trump reasoned, he’s surging in the polls and has had a track record of success: He  attended one of the best business schools in America, created a hotel and entertainment empire, and is a bestselling author to boot. ""They like to say, well, we don't consider him a serious candidate. Why wouldn't I be?,"" Trump said on July 1. ""I went to the Wharton School of Finance, I was a great student. ... I go out, I make a tremendous fortune. I write a book called The Art of the Deal, the No. 1 selling business book of all time, at least I think, but I’m pretty sure it is. And certainly a big monster, the No. 1 bestseller. I do The Apprentice, a tremendous success, one of the most successful shows."" We were curious about Trump’s literary credentials. Did he pen the top-selling business book of all time? The Art of the Deal, a memoir that offers readers 11 steps for business success, was a smash when first published in November 1987. Trump hosted a celebrity-filled launch party, landed on the covers of magazines and toured the late night talk show circuit to promote and discuss the book. ""The momentum around the book was tremendous,"" wrote journalist Timothy L. O’Brien in a biography of the mogul. ""The voice that sprang from the pages was entirely original, seemingly candid, relentlessly boastful and refreshingly unafraid to take swipes, settle scores, and opine with an I-am-what-I-am gusto. The Art of the Deal was a tour of the business world according to Mister Id, and readers ate it up."" It spent 51 weeks on the New York Times' bestseller list and, according to some reports, sold 1 million copies. Neither the Trump campaign nor the book’s publisher got back to us, so we were unable to verify this figure. Instead, we looked at data from Nielsen Bookscan. The data isn't perfect. For one, it counts sales only since 2001. And for another, it only tallies the number of print copies sold by major booksellers (about 85 percent of the market).  According to Nielsen data, The Art of the Deal has sold about 177,000 copies in all its editions: Published Binding type Publisher Sales since 2001 Nov. 1, 1987 Hardcover Random House 17,000 Jan. 1, 1989 Mass market paperback Random House 90,000 Dec. 1, 2004 Mass market paperback Hachette Book Group 70,000 It’s difficult to weigh Trump’s opus against other ""business books"" for two reasons. One, best-seller lists are almost always periodical. Amazon tallies sales by the hour, while the New York Times’ lists are by week or by month. Greg Cowles, who writes for the New York Times ""Inside the List"" column, says the paper doesn’t track all-time sales. Second, the genre called ""business books"" is nebulous and can range from memoirs and essays to financial tips and management strategies. Trump’s book can certainly be shelved in the business section, as it’s both a memoir by a business executive and offers business advice. But experts say it can hardly count as influential in the subcategories or important in the broader genre. ""Trump is full of B.S.,"" said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of business management at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business. ""The best selling/most important business books would have to be In Search of Excellence by (Thomas) Peters and (Robert) Waterman that started the genre, Built to Last by Jim Collins, The One Minute Manager by Ken Blanchard and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey."" The Art of the Deal isn’t used in business schools like Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy, nor is it a text business executives find useful like Machiavelli's The Prince, said Lawrence White, a business and economics professor at New York University's Stern School. As for prominent biographies of business executives, Daniel Raff, who teaches at Trump’s alma mater of Wharton, listed books about Steve Jobs and by Lee Iacocca. We looked at some of these titles and, for good measure, threw in Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends & Influence People, which promises pathways to attain professional goals (Warren Buffett is a fan), and Robert Kiyosaki’s personal finance guide, Rich Dad Poor Dad.  The authors and publishers of these popular books offer self-reported estimates; we’ve also included the independently compiled Nielsen data. Here’s how Trump’s book stacks up: Title Published Estimated sales Nielsen data (since 2001) How to Win Friends & Influence People 1936 15 million 2.27 million The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People  1989 10 to 25 million 2.18 million Rich Dad Poor Dad 2000 4 million (as of 2004) 6.99 million Steve Jobs (hardcover edition) 2011 3 million 1.74 million The Art of the Deal  1987 1 million 177,000 Competitive Strategy 1980 NA (60 editions) 71,000 In Search of Excellence 1982 3 million (as of 2001) 54,000 Whether you’re looking at estimated sales or actual figures from Nielsen BookScan, The Art of the Deal has sold fewer copies than at least four other books. Our ruling Trump said his 1987 memoir The Art of the Deal is ""the No. 1 selling business book of all time."" The highest estimate pins the number of sales at 1 million, which we weren’t able to verify. According to one source of sales data, The Art of the Deal sold 184,000 physical copies since 2001. There are no lists of all-time sales, but we weighed The Art of the Deal against other popular books in its genre. While the book was very successful, it comes nowhere near claiming the title of top seller. Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People and Stephen Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People easily outpace it.

Occupy Democrats group says Wisconsin is 'dead broke' due to actions by Scott Walker, GOP
","A Facebook meme posted by a liberal Democratic group puts a new twist on an old claim that the state of Wisconsin is ""broke."" The post by Occupy Democrats includes a photo of Republican Gov. Scott Walker and this statement: ""Last year, Republican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker signed a $541 million tax cut for millionaires and corporations. Today, Wisconsin’s budget is $283 million in the red, funding for education is being slashed, government programs are being gutted, and the state is about to miss a $108 million debt payment -- because it is dead broke."" In the comments below the meme, the group posted: ""Governor Scott Walker is committing political malpractice against the people of Wisconsin."" Readers are directed to a Feb. 18, 2015 Washington Post story that looks at the state’s finances. Occupy Democrats was founded by Omar Rivero, an unsuccessful 2014 Democratic nominee for the Florida state House. The group frequently posts provocative memes that draw considerable attention. The March 15, 2015 ""dead broke"" post continues to make the rounds and had been shared more than 18,000 times as of July 1, 2015. The group did not respond to an email asking for backup for the claim. The claim Wisconsin is ""broke"" is familiar  -- though in the past we have heard it from the other side of the aisle. Walker and other Republicans have used it to describe the condition of the state’s finances when they took office in 2011. When we reviewed those claims -- from Walker in 2011 and Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke in June of 2015 -- we rated them False. The state wasn’t out of money and its financial condition didn’t match the definition of ""broke,"" which suggests at or near bankruptcy. What’s more, the state had numerous tools available to deal with any shortfall -- even if some of the options, such as tax increases, were declared off limits by Walker and Republicans. So what about the Occupy Democrats claim that various actions by Walker have left the state ""dead broke""? Behind the claim Before the group gets to its central point, it lays out a list of assertions that amount to its evidence. Some of them -- education being ""slashed"" and government programs ""gutted"" -- are offered without specifics. In the cases where details are provided, the picture is not always so clean. Take the tax cut. Walker did sign a $541 million tax cut approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature on March 24, 2014. The package cut property and income taxes for families and businesses, and zeroed out all income taxes for Wisconsin manufacturers. It also reduced the amount of state taxes withheld from workers’ paychecks. Thus, the package wasn’t directed exclusively at ""millionaires and corporations,"" as Occupy Democrats claimed. Citing a memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick noted ""the largest percentage of tax reductions went to those making between $15,000 and $20,000."" At the time the 2014 tax cut was approved, projections showed that the state was on track to have a $1 billion budget surplus in June 2015. Times changed, and so do budget projections. In November 2014, the Walker administration said that surplus had melted into a $132 million shortfall. In January 2015, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau said the shortfall was $283 million because tax collections were $173 million lower than expected. To close the gap, in February 2015, Walker's administration said it would skip $108 million in debt payments in May 2015. That, too, was cited as evidence of being broke by Occupy Democrats. Other steps were taken as well, including refinancing of state debt. At the time, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau said  under the move the state would only pay the interest on certain obligations. Such a delay is allowed under terms of the borrowing, an administration spokesman said. However, taxpayers would need to make higher principal and interest payments in the future, starting with an additional $19.3 million in the two-year budget that began July 1, 2015. But this deferral strategy is nothing new. It has been employed for years by Walker and previous governors, including his predecessor Democrat Jim Doyle. It’s even got a nickname: ""Scoop and toss"" -- as in scoop up the debt and toss it into the future for others to address. So, while it’s true that Walker skipped a payment, it’s a financing move that’s not unusual, and not an indication of bankruptcy or similar financial calamity. Indeed, the move helped bring the 2013-15 budget into balance. That points us back to the group’s ""dead broke"" claim. In our earlier items, we noted that dictionaries define ""broke"" as ""having no money; bankrupt"" and ""without money; penniless."" But the state is still paying its bills and there has been no indication that it's on the brink of bankruptcy or insolvency. Further, under federal law, the state is not allowed to make such a declaration.
