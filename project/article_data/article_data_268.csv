Image of Michelle Obama is absolutely altered
","An Instagram photo is spreading a false rumor that former first lady Michelle Obama was a man prior to marrying her husband, former President Barack Obama.  The posted image is of the Obamas early on in their relationship. In the photo, Michelle Obama is seen with altered features -— her forehead, eyes and hair have been edited to appear more traditionally masculine. The photo appears grainy with added text, ""Just two dudes, before they were husband and wife!"" Spotting the fake edits on this didn’t take long, especially since Barack Obama tweeted the original throwback image on Jan. 17, 2019, to celebrate his wife’s birthday. That original picture was reshared more than 164 thousand times.  Plenty of other images of Michelle Obama in her childhood, adolescence and womanhood further debunk this claim, including many photos that she’s posted to her own Instagram page. For example, a throwback photo of her as a student at Princeton University went viral. This isn’t the first time that this photo of the Obamas has been doctored. — On Oct. 12, 2020, Lead Stories reported that Michelle Obama’s face had been altered in another way to appear masculine.  This post is Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2021/may/28/instagram-posts/image-michelle-obama-absolutely-altered/

Student debt forgiveness is not in Biden’s 2022 budget, but it’s still in play
","New college graduates had just moved their tassels from one side to the other when they were hit with a cold reality check about student loans.  It came in this attack from the left on President Joe Biden: ""Biden just dropped student debt cancellation down to zero. That’s right, the Biden administration has decided to cancel $0 in student debt."" The claim was made May 24 in a tweet that was widely shared on Instagram, including in a post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden did not include student debt forgiveness, one of his campaign promises, in his 2022 federal budget proposal.  But he is still pursuing forgiveness options, including determining whether it would be legal to do so through an executive order and calling on Congress to act. The White House has asked Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to review the president’s legal authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student debt per borrower. The critical tweet came from the Gravel Institute, whose ""mission is to build the institutions the left needs to win."" It is named for Democrat Mike Gravel, the former Alaska senator and presidential candidate. The tweet was followed by another stating that Biden took student loan cancellation out of his budget because Congress won't pass it — an apparent reference to the difficulty of getting Republican support for such legislation in the Senate. Hopes for relief are high because of the rise in student debt and Biden’s pledge to tackle it. Student loan debt exceeded $1.73 trillion in the first quarter of 2021, nearly double what it was 10 years earlier, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The median amount of education debt in 2020 among those with any outstanding debt for their own education was between $20,000 and $24,999, according to a Federal Reserve Board survey. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden promised ""for debt-holders earning up to $125,000"" to ""forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt"" from two- and four-year public colleges and universities; and from private historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions. He also pledged to take other steps to help student borrowers. Less than a month after Biden took office, a widely shared Facebook post claimed that Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt. We rated it False. He extended a pause on federal student loan payments, but did not cancel debt. Three days before the Gravel Institute’s tweet, the Washington Post reported that student loan debt forgiveness was expected to be left out of Biden’s 2022 federal budget proposal, according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity. Biden’s budget was released May 28 and contained no mention of student loans. But for student debt forgiveness, Biden is also pursuing a possible executive order and has expressed desire for Congress to take action. He has also drawn limits. New York Times columnist David Brooks recently interviewed Biden and described him as suspicious of generous college debt forgiveness plans suggested by the left. ""The idea that you go to Penn and you’re paying a total of 70,000 bucks a year and the public should pay for that? I don’t agree,"" Biden said, referring to the University of Pennsylvania, a private Ivy League school. Bankrate said the news of Biden’s budget plan led ""experts to believe that cancellation may not happen anytime soon."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in April: ""The President continues to call on Congress to cancel $10,000 in debt for student loan borrowers. That’s something Congress could take an action on and he’d be happy to sign. We’re still taking a closer look at our options on student loans."" A widely shared social media post claimed: ""The Biden administration has decided to cancel $0 in student debt."" Biden’s 2022 federal budget proposal does not include a provision for student debt forgiveness. But Biden is still considering options, including an executive order, for student debt forgiveness. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/may/28/facebook-posts/student-debt-forgiveness-not-bidens-2022-budget-it/

No, there is no Congressional program providing 'generous mortgage relief' to veterans
","With Memorial Day just around the corner, social media posts targeting veterans and their loved ones are cropping up online.  ""Congress gives veteran homeowners a generous mortgage relief program,"" claims one May 7 Facebook post. ""You'll be happy when you see how much you could save."" Next, the post — which originated from a Facebook account called ""Veterans Loans Online"" — goes on to encourage people to ""Select military branch to start calculating new house payment,"" before listing different branches and providing a separate link for each one. It also includes a video with a caption that says ""Biden approves billions in mortgage financial assistance for struggling U.S. homeowners."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that Congress established ""a generous mortgage relief program"" for veterans that would qualify those who served to significantly reduce their house payments. The Facebook page responsible for the post is managed by LowerMyBills, according to Facebook’s page transparency information. It’s not the first time the company’s online promotion strategy has been called into question. A quick look at old posts on the ""Veterans Loans Online"" page shows that Facebook users have called out their practices in the past.  The people behind the Facebook page did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, and LowerMyBills’ website provides no contact information — for media or otherwise. In January 2020, Lead Stories debunked an ad paid for by LowerMyBills (that was also shared on Facebook by the ""Veterans Loans Online"" page). Similar to the Facebook post we are examining, the ad claimed veterans could utilize ""an ample mortgage relief program"" established by Congress to ""pay off a house rapidly."" Lead Stories ultimately concluded it was ""misleading"" and a ""fake ad."" When Lead Stories contacted LowerMyBills for comment, the company pointed to the ""Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan Program,"" which is available through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The program was established more than 40 years ago as part of the Veterans’ Disability Compensation and Housing Benefits Amendments of 1980.  According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Affordable Mortgage Lending Guide, the program ""generally lowers the interest rate by refinancing an existing VA home loan. By obtaining a lower interest rate, the monthly mortgage payment should decrease."" On its website, LowerMyBills says the benefits of this refinance program include ""very little paperwork"" and ""almost no"" out-of-pocket costs. The website doesn’t mention significant or ""generous"" savings for homeowners. Organizations such as the VA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  AARP and MilitaryBenefits.info warn veterans against offers to refinance VA loans, particularly when terms seem too good to be true. A few red flags to watch out for include: offers to skip a mortgage payment or two (VA-approved loan lenders are prohibited from offering this), extremely low interest rate offers or promises that there will be no wait time and no out-of-pocket costs. In responses to complaints on the Better Business Bureau’s page for LowerMyBills, the company repeatedly explains that it is an ""online financial services marketing platform"" that ""operates an online lead generation service whereby consumers interested in comparing mortgage or financial services products, rates and services can fill out a form online to be matched with up to five different mortgage brokers and/or lenders.""  If you follow the links provided in the Facebook posts, LowerMyBills includes disclaimers indicating that they do not, in fact, provide calculations for a ""new house payment"" as the post claims. ""LowerMyBills is not acting as a lender or broker,"" the disclaimer at the bottom of veteranloansonline.com reads. ""The information provided by you to LowerMyBills is not an application for a mortgage loan, nor is it used to pre-qualify you with any lender."" In reality, LowerMyBills provides information to loan companies, which can then contact veterans.  A Facebook post claims that ""Congress gives veteran homeowners a generous mortgage relief program,"" which could help veterans lower their house payments.  There is no evidence that Congress established a program that would substantially reduce veterans’ mortgage payments.  In the past, the company making the claim has said it was referring to a program that allows veterans to lower their interest rate by refinancing their existing VA home loan. While legitimate options to refinance VA home loans exist, veterans are advised to be cautious and remain on the lookout for predatory lenders.

Joe Biden exaggerates U.S. rank in world coronavirus vaccinations
","During a speech in Cleveland, President Joe Biden earned applause with a line about how well the United States has been doing in vaccinating people against the coronavirus. ""We've created more places to get vaccinated …  and now, 50% of all of America — more than any other country — is fully vaccinated,"" Biden said in his May 27 speech. The United States’ vaccination program is faring well by international standards, but Biden’s assertion is exaggerated on two counts — both on the percentage of Americans who are fully vaccinated, and on the United States’ international ranking.  Biden flubbed this talking point. According to data for May 27 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 40% of the U.S. population is now fully vaccinated, not 50%.  Two other statistics do hover around 50%: Almost 50% of the population has received at least one dose, and slightly over 50% of all U.S. adults are fully vaccinated. (Americans younger than 12 cannot receive a vaccine yet, and the government only recently approved those between 12 and 15 to receive a vaccine. This explains why the adult vaccination figure is higher than it is for the overall population.) But these statistics would not fit in this context, because Biden said ""all of America"" and ""fully vaccinated."" The U.S. scores well on international vaccination percentages, but it is not No. 1 in the world. According to statistics compiled by Our World in Data, five countries had higher full-vaccination rates than the U.S. on May 27.  Three are small and aren’t really comparable to the U.S. — Aruba, Bahrain, and Curacao — but two are developed, industrialized nations, Israel and Chile.   On Biden’s broader point, the U.S. does have a higher full-vaccination rate than all members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — a group of higher-income nations that is often used as a proxy for major nations — except for Israel and Chile.   The White House told PolitiFact that in raw numbers of vaccinated individuals, the U.S. does rank No. 1. That number is backed up by Our World in Data, which reported that on May 27, the U.S. had administered 165.72 million shots, which surpasses second-place India, which had given 158.78 million shots. However, in his statement in Cleveland, Biden explicitly referred to a percentage, not a raw number, and he specifically said ""fully vaccinated,"" which is a different measurement than the simple number of shots administered. Biden said, ""Now, 50% of all of America — more than any other country — is fully vaccinated."" The United States’ vaccination program is faring well by international standards, exceeding all but two advanced industrialized nations in the percentage of residents who are considered fully vaccinated. But Biden has exaggerated on two counts. The percentage of Americans who are fully vaccinated is 40%, not 50%. And five other countries have higher rates for full vaccination than the United States does.

Facebook post makes unproven claim about police funding and homicides
","A Facebook post shows a chart of ""skyrocketing murder rates"" in major U.S. cities and suggests that’s a result of cities ""defunding"" police departments. ""How’s all that defunding going you knuckleheads,"" said the caption of the May 26 Facebook post. The chart said it was comparing year-to-date homicides in 2021 compared with 2020. It lists as its source ""department data"" and says the data is as of May 25, 2021. The post claims the following murder rate increases: Philadelphia, 40% Minneapolis, 56% Portland, 800% New York City, 22% Chicago, 22% Los Angeles, 27% Washington, D.C., 35% This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post gets this point right: Homicide is up in all seven places (though some of the percentages it listed were imprecise). That is clear. What’s less clear is whether that crime increase is exclusively the result of changes in police budgets. If there is a direct link, it hasn’t been proven yet.  Criminologists caution against oversimplification and emphasize the value of studying the topic carefully and with sufficient data, not just short-term numbers. A proper evaluation of budget changes and their impact on crime would require a study that controls for multiple factors that influence criminal activity, Charis E. Kubrin, a criminologist at the University of California, Irvine, previously told PolitiFact. Those factors include poverty, joblessness, drugs, gangs, guns, housing insecurity and demographic shifts, she said. ""These comparisons of crime increases with reductions in police budget or personnel are strictly anecdotal. ...They are at best correlations between crime changes and policing. They say nothing about whether or how the changes to policing caused the crime changes,"" said Richard Rosenfeld, a University of Missouri-St. Louis expert on crime trends. He talked to us when we examined a similar argument made by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In 2020, several cities across the nation, including the ones mentioned in the Facebook post, reduced or redistributed police funding for fiscal year 2021 as they grappled with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic plus activists’ calls to ""defund the police."" In some cases, cities reduced police funding by not filling vacant positions, eliminating funding earmarked for overtime pay, or transferring duties from the police department to other departments. They did not abolish police departments or cancel their entire budgets. Cities start their fiscal years at different times; some of the budget changes began in the summer or fall of 2020, others began in January. Some places are still in the process of shifting money from their respective police departments. Also, homicides were already up in 2020, before cities decided to change their budgets, and cities that did not cut police budgets have also seen homicides go up. Nationwide, murder went up every quarter of 2020 compared with the respective quarters in 2019, according to preliminary FBI data. It’s possible that crime increases are the result of the ""social disorganization"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Samuel Walker, an emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, recently told us. Social disorganization involves a weakening of the basic bonds of social control, such as good employment and stable families, he said. A Facebook post claimed that police budget cuts are to blame for ""skyrocketing murder rates"" in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Portland, New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. The statement contains an element of truth: Homicides are up in these cities and police funding is down. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, including the details of numerous other potential contributing factors, such as poverty, joblessness and housing insecurity, all of which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most importantly, the claim implies that there is a direct link between defunding and homicide rates that has not yet been established. The post oversimplifies a complex issue that requires further study, beyond just looking at the raw numbers.

COVID-19 vaccine recipients can donate plasma
","Numerous social media posts have recently claimed that people who get the COVID-19 vaccine can’t donate plasma, but that’s wrong.  These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We previously looked into claims that COVID-19 vaccine recipients can’t donate blood. That’s also wrong. Generally, vaccine recipients can donate blood, platelets and plasma if they’re feeling healthy and well, according to the American Red Cross. If you don’t know the name of your vaccine manufacturer, the Red Cross will ask you to wait two weeks before you donate. But if you received one of the three COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States, there’s no deferral period.  Blood plasma is often given to trauma, burn and shock patients because it helps boost blood volumes, which can prevent shock and help with blood clotting, according to the Red Cross. Convalescent plasma, meanwhile, involves blood from people who’ve recovered from an illness to help others recover.  It’s being used to help people with COVID-19. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for convalescent plasma therapy to treat the disease. The FDA allows people who have received the COVID-19 vaccine to donate convalescent plasma within six months of their infection of the virus. Convalescent plasma is used to help treat people with COVID-19  But some people may be confused over whether vaccine recipients can donate plasma or not because the Red Cross said it wasn’t accepting convalescent plasma donations from people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine. The Red Cross wants convalescent plasma from people that have not received the COVID-19 vaccines to ensure that there are enough antibodies directly related to their immune response to a COVID-19 infection. That’s because the antibodies someone produces after a COVID-19 infection are slightly different from the antibodies someone produces when they’ve been vaccinated, said Katie Wilkes, a spokesperson for the Red Cross.  The Red Cross stopped dedicated COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations in March ""due to declining hospital demand and sufficient industry supply,"" Wilkes said, but it still tests all blood donations for COVID-19 antibodies and plasma from routine blood and platelet donations that meet certain requirements maye be used as convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 patients.  We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2021/may/28/instagram-posts/covid-19-vaccine-recipients-can-donate-plasma/

There have been no reports of a database leak or hack related to the Sputnik V vaccine, and there is no evidence that any of the COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips.  In fact, microchips are too big for the syringes used in administering the vaccine and other immunizations. The world's smallest microchip is 1 mm x 1 mm large, whereas the inner diameter of the needle typically used in vaccinations is about .41 mm, according to Nebraska Medicine, a nonprofit hospital affiliated with the University of Nebraska. Additionally, none of the ingredients listed for the Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Sputnik V suggests they have technology that can connect to a cellular network. Conspiracies about the vaccines containing microchips and being related to the 5G network have been persistent; it prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to include an entry in its COVID-19 vaccine FAQ that says they don’t contain microchips.  ""There may be trackers on the vaccine shipment boxes to protect them from theft, but there are no trackers in the vaccines themselves,"" the agency says. Turner posted a video on his website that claims to show a Russian hacker accessing information from a microchip that was injected into someone when they received a COVID-19 vaccination.

Harris right on American Jobs Plan being largest increase in research and development
","Most of the discussion around President Joe Biden’s proposed $2 trillion American Jobs Plan has been around infrastructure and spending on areas such as child care and long-term care for adults.  But the package also includes $180 billion for accelerating research and development. The aim is that the spending will help keep the United States competitive within the world economy, according to a fact sheet on the American Jobs Plan released by the White House.   ""Public investments in R&D lay the foundation for the future breakthroughs that over time yield new businesses, new jobs and more exports,"" the fact sheet says. ""However, we need more investment if we want to maintain our economic edge in today’s global economy.""  Vice President Kamala Harris touted the research and development component in a May 5, 2021, visit to a lab at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. ""The president has made it a priority of our administration to really seek out and lift up the great work that American universities and technologists and innovators are doing,"" Harris said. ""We are prepared, in fact, to invest what will be the biggest nondefense investment in research and development in the history of our country.""  Biden made a similar statement during his April 28, 2021 address to Congress, adding that  ""We will see more technological change in the next 10 years -- than we saw in the last 50 years.""  Is Harris right? Does the administration’s American Jobs Plan propose the largest nondefense investment in research and development?  When we contacted Harris’ office for backup, staffers pointed to data compiled by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  According to the group, government spending in the area steadily increased over the last 48 years, but never tallied more than $11 billion at a time. (Note: The study controlled for inflation, so the $11 billion is in today’s dollars) Indeed, some years saw decreases instead of gains.  Matthew Hourihan, director of the group’s R&D Budget and Policy Program, said Biden’s proposed investment is very likely to be the largest in history, but noted that final numbers on how the $180 billion would be divided have not been released. He highlighted a line item in the plan, $50 billion for semiconductors, which includes funding for research and development, but also for manufacturing. The separate totals for each haven’t been released.  By the numbers, the largest increase -- equivalent to $11 billion today -- came in 1964, which was a direct response to the space race. Since then, the largest normal increase in R&D spending came in 2003, with a $6 billion increase in spending, Hourihan said.  The data is the most extensive available, but -- of course -- does not go back to the start of the nation.  Another complicating factor to the claim: The money proposed in Biden’s plan may be spent over multiple years, making it tricky to compare the full package against single-year totals from the past. Meanwhile, it’s possible that the spending will move forward at a lower level, or in a separate bill entirely. In one counter proposal from a group of Republicans, all funding for research and development would be removed and carried forward as separate legislation, according to a May 21, 2021 Vox report. And, in a White House memo on a potential compromise for the American Jobs Plan, shared to Twitter on May 21, 2021 by CNN reporter Phil Mattingly, the administration offers taking research and development out of the plan in favor of separate legislation, calling the investments ""critical to securing our economic competitiveness.""  In any case, we evaluate claims based on information known at the time. And the key element here is whether the proposal stacks up as Harris claimed.
  In a visit to Milwaukee, Harris claimed that the American Jobs Plan would be the largest investment in American research and development the country has ever seen.  While a detailed breakdown of all the spending in the plan has yet to be released, experts say the $180 billion earmarked for American research, development and manufacturing will likely contain far more money for research and development than ever before.  And while a compromise could put the money into a separate bill, that doesn’t negate the size or the claim Harris made about it. We rate this claim Mostly True, which means the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. ",/factchecks/2021/may/28/kamala-harris/harris-right-american-jobs-plan-being-largest-incr/

Claim of ballots in “error” in Fulton County, Ga., is based on unproven allegation
","After a judge in Georgia granted a request by a self-proclaimed election watchdog to inspect absentee ballots from the state’s largest county, social media users began circulating claims about the judge’s possible rationale. ""21% of 140,000 ballots were found to be in error in GA,"" states a May 22 Facebook post, adding: ""all hell is about to break loose."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  There has been no official finding to that effect. The claim is based on uncorroborated allegations made by a witness for the plaintiffs in the case.  Fulton County, which includes much of Atlanta, voted overwhelmingly for Democrat Joe Biden. The lawsuit seeking a review of the county’s general-election absentee ballots was filed by nine plaintiffs, including Garland Favorito, co-founder of a group called Voter GA.  Favorito, a longtime critic of Georgia’s election infrastructure, has promoted conspiracy theories about 9/11 and other topics, according to Georgia Public Radio, the New York Times and the Associated Press. Favorito told PolitiFact he voted for a third party write-in candidate in November, but his legal case to inspect ballots has drawn support from Republicans. Henry County Superior Court Judge Brian Amero issued an order May 21 allowing the plaintiffs to inspect and scan the absentee ballots. The Facebook posts and similar statements on Twitter suggested that the ruling followed an official finding of erroneous ballots. But that’s not the case. Nothing in Amero’s two-sentence order says anything about ballots in error. One of the Facebook posts we saw with the 21% claim linked to a one-minute clip of an interview with John Fredericks, a conservative radio journalist. Fredericks cited affidavits from election officials who said they ""believe"" up to 30,000 ballots were ""counterfeit.""  The statements in the affidavits have not been corroborated or verified. They are simply allegations. The affidavits signed by people who worked at the polls or served as observers are filled with speculative statements about the integrity of absentee ballots, suggesting they were not properly marked or weren’t printed on normal paper. For example, one recount observer said the ballots were ""perfectly filled out as if they were pre-printed.""  The statement about 21% of ballots being in ""error"" stems from the May 21 court testimony of plaintiffs witness David Sawyer, a forensic accountant. Sawyer testified that he compared batches of scanned images of ballots and batches from the state’s risk-limiting audit and found a discrepancy in the numbers. Sawyer said there was a possibility that there were missing batches of ballots that might not have been counted and testified that he found a 21% error rate.  Ari Schaffer, a spokesperson for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, said the plaintiffs are misrepresenting the facts. ""The allegation that there was a 21% error rate for Fulton County’s absentee ballots is false,"" Schaffer said. In a court document filed on behalf of Raffensperger before the court hearing, the state called the plaintiffs’ request an ""unlawful fishing expedition."" Raffensperger didn’t object to allowing an inspection of ballot images, but didn’t want the actual ballots handed over. The state wrote that any legal challenges to the results are moot since the results have already been tabulated, audited, recounted and certified.  For months, Raffensperger and other statewide election officials have said they found no evidence of systematic voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The roughly 5 million ballots cast in Georgia were counted three times, including once by hand. The hand recount uncovered more than 2,600 uncounted votes, most of which favored Trump, in Floyd County, Ga. But election officials said the mistake was due to human error, not voter fraud. State election officials debunked various falsehoods including about secret ""suitcases"" full of ballots or ballots being shredded. In the end, the certified results showed Biden beating Trump by 11,779 votes in the state. Lawsuits seeking to invalidate results failed in Georgia.  Still, Raffensperger showed some support for the plaintiffs’ case seeking to inspect the ballots. Raffensperger said Georgians have a right to pursue legal cases and that Fulton County ""has a longstanding history of election mismanagement."" A consultant hired by the state elections board to observe Fulton’s processes in the recent elections found no ""dishonesty, fraud, or intentional malfeasance"" but ""myriad problems"" with the processing of absentee ballots. Exactly how the ballot inspection will take place in Fulton County isn’t clear. In his brief order, the judge said he will issue a further order on protocols and practices. A May 28 meeting to discuss logistics was canceled after Fulton County officials filed motions to dismiss the case, Georgia Public Radio reported.  Georgia election officials have expressed optimism that the process will be more secure and transparent than the ongoing audit of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County, Ariz., organized by GOP lawmakers there. Election officials, including some Republicans, have criticized that audit as lacking transparency and possibly illegal.  Facebook posts said ""21% of 140,000 ballots were found to be in error in GA."" There has been no official finding to that effect. The claim appears to be based on uncorroborated allegations by a plaintiffs witness in a lawsuit seeking to inspect absentee ballots cast in Fulton County. The Secretary of State’s office rejected the witness’s claim as false. A judge granted the plaintiffs’ request, but his order didn’t mention anything about the alleged error rate. Georgia’s top statewide election officials, who are Republicans, have audited, certified and stood by results showing that Biden won the state. The Facebook post cites a speculative claim about a 21% error rate. We rate this statement Mostly False.

Thaddeus McCotter says lenders lose 30 percent on foreclosures
","
First things first: You may not have heard of Thaddeus McCotter if you're not from Michigan. He's a Republican House member who's also running for the Republican nomination for president.

McCotter wrote an op-ed for the National Review, published Aug. 16, 2011, laying out some of his ideas for restoring the nation's economic vitality. Some of his ideas are widely held by the Republican Party, such as reducing federal spending. But others are not: He suggests new regulations requiring banks to have 20 percent of their assets in the form of readily available capital. 

McCotter also has ideas for addressing the nation's foreclosure crisis: 

""Nearly 30 percent of homeowners have mortgages that exceed the value of their home. This is not necessarily their fault, as we have lived through the largest decline in home values in our history. Life savings have been wiped out. We need to take action to stop this devastation. When lenders foreclose on homes, they typically suffer losses that exceed 30 percent of the value of the home,"" McCotter writes. ""Therefore, we need a voluntary program to offer homeowners a deal whereby, in exchange for reducing their mortgage debt to a level equal to 90 percent of home value, they would commit to pay their lender half of any future sale or refinance proceeds they receive.""

Such a plan would help lenders save on foreclosure costs and gain from future appreciation, he said. 

""Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which currently own over half of home mortgages and are controlled by the federal government, should immediately make this offer to all their customers, and our bank regulators should adopt a rule assuring any bank that makes this offer to its mortgage borrowers that it will not suffer a reduction in the regulatory capital value of the mortgage. Any issues arising from implementing this proposal for mortgage-securities pools should be addressed so as to remove the obstacle,"" he said. ""This plan will end the devastating foreclosure fever and stem the erosion of home values, once and for all.""

We can't say if McCotter's plan would work, but we were curious if foreclosures meant lenders suffered ""losses that exceed 30 percent of the value of the home."" So we decided to check it out. 

When you think about it, it's not an easy number to uncover, given the large numbers of transactions and lenders. A report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service summed up the situation like this: ""Obtaining an estimate of foreclosure costs that can be attributed solely to the lender is difficult without proprietary data that is closely held by lenders and financial institutions. Many studies may provide a dollar value associated with foreclosure costs, but it is difficult to know how cost estimates were obtained without access to the proprietary data used in the studies.""

A 2008 briefing paper from Mortgage Bankers Association noted the many different costs lenders face in a typical foreclosure: lost principal and interest payments from the homeowner; continuing obligations for tax and insurance payments; costs for maintaining the property; lost service fees for handling normal mortgage payments; legal and administrative costs; costs for restoring the property to good condition for sale; and real estate commissions once the sale is complete.

That's a lot of data to calculate as part of lender losses, and we found no national report that fully accounted for all of them.

Having said that, there's still a good bit of evidence that suggests McCotter's number is likely right. It possible it's even too low.

For one thing, the average sales price of foreclosures are running about 30 percent below the average sales price of non-foreclosure homes.

RealtyTrac, publisher of the monthly U.S. Foreclosure Market Report, found that during the first three months of 2011, the average sales price of foreclosure properties was nearly 27 percent below the average sales price of properties not in foreclosure. That was unchanged from a 27 percent foreclosure in the fourth quarter of 2010 and up only slightly from the 26 percent foreclosure discount a year earlier.

Daren Blomquist of RealtyTrac told us there are generally three reasons foreclosure properties fetch lower prices. The properties often are not in good condition. Lenders ask a lower price because they aren't as emotionally attached. And finally, buyers just expect foreclosure properties to be priced lower and won't pay the same price as a non-foreclosure property.

Whatever the reason, those lower prices are in addition to the costs the lenders have to shoulder while the foreclosure is in process, which means McCotter's estimate very well could be on the low side. 

Another study we found looked at only the state of Massachusetts, but it looked at 20 years worth of data and controlled for the different types of houses sold. It concluded that foreclosure discounts are on average 27 percent of the value of a house. Again, this is a measure of prices, not a measure of what losses the lender actually realizes. McCotter's staff referred us to this study when we asked for evidence about his statement.

Finally, the briefing paper from Mortgage Bankers Association said that lender losses could be 30 percent, or even more. ""While losses can vary widely, several independent studies find them to be generally quite significant: over $50,000 per foreclosed home or as much as 30 to 60 percent of the outstanding loan balance.""

The report's conclusion also backed up McCotter's broader point: ""For all the parties involved — the homeowner, the community, or the mortgage industry participants — foreclosures are a losing economic proposition. ... (It) is clear that lenders share the interest of homeowners and their communities to avoid foreclosure.""

In ruling on McCotter's statement, we want to be clear that we found no definitive national studies on what lenders lose when they foreclose on homes. Still, the evidence on pricing suggests that it could be in excess of 30 percent. Industry estimates also put the number at 30 percent or higher. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/23/thaddeus-mccotter/thaddeus-mccotter-says-lenders-lose-30-percent-for/

Trio of county district attorneys says that only a quarter of felons spend time behind prison bars
","
Gov. John Kitzhaber recently announced the creation of a new commission to examine the state’s sentencing laws. Not long after, two advocacy groups released a joint report calling Oregon's Measure 11 ineffective and discriminatory when it comes to the state’s youth.

Mandatory sentencing laws -- ever the point of contention -- are receiving renewed public attention. And in a recent guest column in The Oregonian, three county district attorneys -- including Multnomah’s Michael Schrunk -- offered some context, noting ""this is an issue with which we have great experience and expertise.""

While expressing some disappointment that the governor was not including elected district attorneys on the commission, the three wrote ""contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal. Under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison. They are put on probation in the community.""

That statistic caught the eye of at least one reader who asked PolitiFact Oregon to take a look.

The DAs said they got that figure courtesy of Oregon’s Criminal Justice Commission, so that’s where we started.

It didn’t take long before Michael Wilson, the commission’s economist, sent us a breakdown of felons and their sentences for 2010.

At first blush, it looks like Schrunk and the other DAs -- John Foote of Clackamas and Bob Hermann of Washington -- were right. (It should be noted, nine others endorsed the letter, as well.) Of the 17,622 convicted felons in 2010, just over 4,000 were sent to prison. As a percentage, that’s about 23 percent.

But, as Craig Prins, the director of the justice commission put it, ""the simple answer isn’t always the most informative answer."" There are a few caveats to consider before you go shouting that number from any rooftops.

For starters, that 23 percent figure doesn’t include the 8 percent of felons who serve state time, but do it in local jails. Those 8 percent serve less than a year, but it’s still worth noting. Take that into account and at least 30 percent are serving state time -- just not necessarily in a prison.

Next, it should be noted that there are different categories of felonies, and as you drill down into them, you start to notice that certain sorts of felons are more likely to receive time in a prison.

Of the felons convicted of ""person crimes"" (think: robberies, assaults, sex crimes, murder and others), 43 percent go to prison, and another 3 percent spent time in a local jail. For felons convicted of property crimes, 30 percent wind up in prison and another 5 percent in local jails.

The overall figure gets pushed down some by drug offenders who are sentenced to prison at a rate close to 8 percent with another 10 percent going to local jails for less than a year. The national rate for the same group is considerably higher, Prins said. In 2006, for instance, nationally drug offenders were being sent to prison about 40 percent of the time, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

""In Oregon, we’ve always kind of prided ourselves on the fact that, policy-wise, it does not make sense to put such people in prison,"" Prins said. Same goes for people who commit lower-level property crimes. Is it worth spending $30,000 to incarcerate somebody who stole $1,000? Prins asked. The priority are those who commit violent crimes.

And, indeed, if you exclude drug offenders from the equation, 33 percent of convicted felons serve time in prison while 7 percent serve time in local jails for a total closer to 40 percent.

That’s not to say that drug offenses aren’t felonies -- but it’s still important context, especially given that the word ""felony"" can describe a number of crimes.

There’s one last bit to consider: About 69 percent of all convicted felons wind up with probation. But that doesn’t mean they get off without serving any time behind bars, which seems to be an implicit part of the DAs’ critique when they note ""contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal.""

According to Wilson, about 63 percent of the offenders who received a probation sentence in 2010 received a jail sentence as well. The average stay, he said, was just over a month.

Put another way, only 25 percent of convicted felons actually manage to avoid time behind bars as part of their sentence. Even then, Charles French, a deputy district attorney with Multnomah County who deals a lot with crime statistics, said he’d be surprised if those 25 percent don’t serve at least some time in jail, if even a night, after their arrest.

""I think most people who commit felonies do serve time in jail,"" he said. ""But most of them do not serve time in prison. And, frankly, the idea of a jail sanction as a condition of probation is reformatory, in theory.""

It’s important, he added, that the public has access to these sorts of figures, even if they require some context. ""I think the more information the public has, the better.""

As for our ruling, the DAs were very specific in their statement that ""75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison."" Technically they’re right, but the number of felons the DAs ""lock up"" is considerable higher and that’s an important piece of missing context. We’ll give this one a Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/23/michael-schrunk/trio-county-district-attorneys-say-only-quarter-fe/

U.S. students in big trouble, Georgia pol says
","
Americans don’t like finishing second to any nation in anything.

When the Soviet Union became the first nation to send a man into outer space, the United States responded by landing on the moon. When we started to lose to other countries in basketball, America created the Dream Team and crushed the competition in the 1992 Summer Olympics.

In recent years, politicians have lamented America’s education standing with the goal of doing better. Georgia state Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers talked about the problem -- and offered some ideas -- at a Republican Party-led ""Solutions Summit"" in Athens last month.

An Athens Banner-Herald article included a claim by Rogers, a Republican from Cherokee County, that the U.S. is near the bottom of developed nations in education.

Near the bottom! U.S. students can’t be performing that poorly?

The article paraphrased Rogers, so we asked his office whether the newspaper got it right. It did, said Rogers’ chief of staff Adam Pipkin.

""Recent international reports show the United States near the bottom among industrialized nations for k-12 academic achievement,"" Rogers said at the meeting.

Rogers’ office showed us the information he used to back up his claim: a weblink from a prominent education foundation that compared America’s top math students with top math students in other nations. The link, from the Broad Foundation, says eighth-graders in America are two years behind in the math studied in other countries.

Let’s focus on the first part of what was on the foundation’s page. The ranking came from a 2006 study of students for the Program for International Student Assessment, which examines the academic performance of 15-year-old students in math, reading and science in more than 60 nations. Students were asked the same questions, such as estimating the size of Antarctica or determining the best route between various rail stations. An international contractor randomly selects schools to take the exam, PISA organizers say. The selection of schools and students, they say, is said to be as inclusive as possible. U.S. Department of Education officials say 5,233 U.S. students took the 2009 exam.

The most recent assessment, however, was done in 2009. That study focused on about 60 nations. We focused on about 30 countries, since the rest are not on the United Nations’ and/or CIA’s lists of developed nations. In that assessment, American students, on average, indeed ranked near the bottom of about 30 developed nations in math. American students ranked in the middle in science and in the top half in reading. The 2009 report was released in December 2010.

Pipkin countered that the 2009 PISA report included U.S. students in public and private schools, ""so it is difficult to determine where the public school students would have ranked as an individual group."" Rogers, however, did not say he was specifically speaking about public school students.

Pipkin had another concern about the 2009 report. He said it included nations such as Chile, Estonia, Israel and Slovenia that he said aren’t ""international competition"" and helped boost the U.S. into the middle in the science category. We did use Israel, but not the others for our comparison. The U.S. still ranked in the middle in science.

We then reviewed a report on the U.S. Department of Education’s website that tracked fourth- and eighth-grade U.S. students against their counterparts in other countries in math and science. The report, called the ""Trends in International Math and Science Study,"" was from 2007. American fourth-graders ranked in the top third in both subjects. The eighth-graders did as well in math but were in the middle in science. As with the PISA exam, we excluded countries not on the CIA’s and/or United Nations’ lists of developed nations.

The tests are said to be administered the same way in all countries. Officials acknowledge that some countries, such as the U.S., have a higher percentage of immigrant students, which may be a factor in the scores since they are not taking the exam in their native language. Students in each country are selected from a national probability sample of all students in the particular grade or of a particular age. The exam is voluntary.

Now, to the claim about eighth-graders. That came from a 2003 report by Michigan State University professor William H. Schmidt that is on the U.S. Department of Education’s website. Schmidt wrote American 12th-graders ranked near the bottom internationally on a math literacy exam. American eighth-graders were also below average internationally.

We were initially dubious of the article, since he mentioned studies done in 1995 and 1999. That seemed like such a long time ago. A student could have begun first grade in 1999 and graduated this year. Schmidt, a distinguished professor of statistics and math, explained he prefers the earlier research to the 2007 study. He said the earlier studies include more nations that are a better comparison for U.S. students.

Schmidt believes much hasn’t changed since the reports from the late 1990s.

""The best [U.S. students] in some indicators are in the middle of the pack, but at the worst, at the bottom,"" he told us.

Schmidt believes some developed nations such as Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands are better at math and science because their educational systems are more focused with rigorous standards for their students. For example, he said eighth-graders in some nations are learning algebra and geometry while American students are still focused on less complex arithmetic. Schmidt also said most American eighth-grade teachers are not as versed in math as their counterparts in many nations.

Schmidt said there is hope for U.S. students to make a Rocky-like comeback in math. He said about 40 states have adopted the Common Core State Standards -- national expectations for what students should learn and be able to do in every grade level and subject. In July 2010, Georgia’s Board of Education approved Common Core Standards in English and math.

So back to Rogers and his claim. The most recent international reports that include developed nations show American students are in the bottom third in math, in the middle in science and in the upper third in reading. The results don’t entirely back up the senator’s claim. They show he’s partially accurate. We rate his claim as Half True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/23/chip-rogers/us-students-big-trouble-georgia-pol-says/

Rail transit advocacy group president claims NJ Transit fares rose this year between 25 and 47 percent
","
As far as Albert Papp Jr. is concerned, any fare increase placed on commuters is a tax increase -- including the hikes that Papp said were imposed this year by NJ Transit.

The president of the 31-year-old New Jersey Association of Railroad Passengers, Papp appeared on News 12 New Jersey’s Power & Politics show this past weekend to provide his take on the toll hikes recently approved by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Gov. Chris Christie had said a toll increase is not a tax increase, but Papp wasn’t buying that argument.

""Our group believes that any fare increase is a tax increase. Last year -- actually, this year in May -- we saw New Jersey Transit fares rise anywhere from 25 percent to 47 percent,"" Papp told guest-host Luke Margolis. ""Unfortunately, the petroleum tax, the gas tax in New Jersey, on motorists has stayed constant and we're now the third-lowest in the country.

""So from our ridership perspective, from our membership's perspective, we basically think that we have seen a tax increase,"" Papp continued. ""And the governor made a very, very strident point that under his administration, we would not see these tax increases. All we're trying to say is we want social equity for the mass transit rider, especially the rail rider.""

PolitiFact New Jersey checked out Papp’s comments on NJ Transit fares, and quickly found that he made two mistakes: fares increased in May 2010, not this year, and the increases for all NJ Transit services varied more widely than the figures provided by Papp.

Papp acknowledged in a phone interview how, referring to when the fares increased, he made an ""incorrect correction.""

""That was my fault,"" Papp said. ""I was right the first time.""

First, let’s talk about those NJ Transit fare increases.

Faced with an anticipated $300 million budget gap, NJ Transit officials last year hiked fares on buses and trains.

Effective May 1, 2010, fares went up on average by 10 percent for local buses, light rail trains, and buses run by private carriers. Fares went up by 10 percent as well for the Access Link service for the disabled. 
Rail fares increased by 25 percent, and fares for interstate/commuter buses also rose on average by 25 percent.

In July 2011, NJ Transit approved a spending plan for fiscal year 2012 that keeps fares frozen.

So, Papp’s statement did not reflect the 10 percent increases, but how did he get to 47 percent? Papp told us that higher percentage is an average based on the fact that NJ Transit eliminated off-peak round-trip rail discounts.

NJ Transit spokeswoman Courtney Carroll confirmed the impact of cutting the off-peak discounts.

""Yes, the elimination of the rail off-peak discount resulted in an approximate increase of 47 percent (fare change plus discount eliminated) for some customers,"" Carroll wrote in an email.

However, it’s worth noting that only about 13 percent of total weekday rail trips used the off-peak discount, according to Carroll. Off-peak discounts were utilized for 17 percent of total rail trips, Carroll said.

In other words, the vast majority of people riding the rails were not impacted by those higher increases.

The ruling

Papp claimed that NJ Transit fares increased this year between 25 and 47 percent, but he was wrong about the timing of the increases. NJ Transit fares actually went up in 2010 and remain frozen this year.

Papp did not mention the 10 percent hike for local buses, light rail trains and the Access Link service. But for the most part, his figures are on target for the rail passengers represented by his organization.

At a time when the Port Authority’s tolls are on the rise, NJ Transit customers have been digging further into their pockets as well. We rate the statement Mostly True.

Caller accuses Gov. Rick Scott of using tax dollars for his robocalls
","
After Republican Gov. Rick Scott launched robocalls in 2011 talking up his efforts to get Floridians jobs and his vetoes of ""special interest projects,"" an anti-Scott group declared robocall revenge.

Pink Slip Rick encouraged Floridians to call Scott back. And lots of Scott critics responded.

On Aug. 17, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow played some of Floridians' calls posted on Pink Slip Rick's website. One of those calls was from Debra B:

""Uh yeah, Gov. Rick Scott, you've got a lot of nerve spending a quarter of a million of our tax dollars to robocall people and tell them how good a job you're doing.""

Did Scott spend $250,000 in taxpayer money to make robocalls? (In a related Truth-O-Meter item, we rate another caller's claim that Scott cut state funding for PBS.)

Typically robocalls occur during the height of campaign season. But Scott started his months after he won election, as part of an image makeover in the wake of low approval ratings and his efforts to speak directly to voters. 

The Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times first reported the robocalls May 27 and described them this way June 29: 

The calls have been coming most every week, the same amiable voice on the other side of the line.

""Hi this is Gov. Rick Scott. I wanted to personally call and share some very encouraging news about our efforts to get Florida back to work. ... Unemployment is down for five straight months, bucking the national trend.""

Scott's calls have also talked about property tax cuts, fighting drug abuse and vetoing ""wasteful special interest projects"" by GOP legislators.

Pink Slip Rick then encouraged Floridians to call back and posted many calls on its website.

The Pink Slip Rick campaign is sponsored by Florida Watch Action, a progressive group. The executive director of Florida Watch Action is Susannah Randolph, wife of state Rep. Scott Randolph, D-Orlando, and former campaign manager to former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson. The Truth-O-Meter gave Pink Slip Rick a Pants on Fire for its April 2, 2011, claim that Scott lost 331,227 jobs.

About 300 people left messages for Scott in August and Pink Slip Rick then forwarded them on to the governor, Susannah Randolph told us in an interview. 

How the robocalls were funded 
Now to the meat of the claim -- who paid for Scott's calls?

The Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times, the Orlando Sentinel and the Palm Beach Post reported that the Republican Party of Florida paid for the robocalls.

""Technically, it's political party intrusion, not government intrusion, because state party campaign donations are paying for the calls, which can cost as little as 2 cents each,"" the Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times wrote June 29.

RPOF spokesman Brian Hughes confirmed for PolitiFact Florida in an Aug. 18 e-mail that RPOF -- not the state -- paid for the robocalls. He also sent us a link to a July 21 St. Petersburg Times blog post that stated RPOF spent $149,450 for the past three months on the robocalls -- and confirmed the blog was accurate.

The Palm Beach Post said in an Aug. 5 article that ""Since the May poll, the Republican Party of Florida spent more than $500,000 on robo-calls, polling and Google ads touting Scott's achievements."" 

""I would say $500,000 for a variety of communication and outreach to the voters of Florida seems accurate,"" Hughes wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida.

Randolph said she knew that, in this case, the caller had her facts wrong and that the party paid for Scott's robocalls. But Randolph said that the only calls that were omitted from the Pink Slip Rick website were a couple that were profane.

""A lot of calls were opinions about the governor -- their own personal stories about what they are going through,"" Randolph said. ""A lot of folks calling in are average middle-class Floridians who don't follow politics the way we follow it. ... We are not going to fact-check people's personal stories.""

Caller says Gov. Rick Scott cut funding for PBS
","When the progressive group Pink Slip Rick urged Florida voters to call Gov. Rick Scott, Floridians sounded off about layoffs of government workers, the state of public education and the governor's own wealth. But one caller was tuned in to another issue: public television.

On Aug. 17, 2011, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow played some of Floridians' robocalls that are posted on Pink Slip Rick's website, including a call from Chris S:

""I really can't believe that you cut PBS of all things. My kids sit around and watch PBS in the early morning. They learn so much from it. And to have the state cut funding for PBS is despicable.""

Did the jobs governor give Cookie Monster the pink slip? (In a related Truth-O-Meter item we rate a claim made by Debra B., who said Scott spent taxpayer dollars to robocall Floridians.)

Scott's veto

On May 26, 2011, Scott announced more than $600 million in budget vetoes including $4,799,110 for public radio and television. (That veto included money for WLRN, a public radio station affiliated with the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner.)

The veto meant that the 13 public radio stations each lost about $62,000 and the 13 public TV stations each lost about $307,000 (the impact on the stations varied depending on their total budget). These public stations are generally funded by state and federal dollars as well as membership donations and corporate support.

One piece of public programming was spared Scott's budget ax. WFSU in Tallahassee has a contract for The Florida Channel, which covers the state legislative session and public hearings about redistricting. WFSU lost money along with the rest of the stations but production money for The Florida Channel was not cut, said Janyth Righter, executive director of Florida Public Broadcasting Service Inc.

After his vetoes, Scott launched robocalls to highlight the cuts. A progressive group, Pink Slip Rick, invited Floridians to robocall Scott back. 

The Pink Slip Rick campaign is sponsored by Florida Watch Action, a progressive group. The executive director of Florida Watch Action is Susannah Randolph, wife of state Rep. Scott Randolph, D-Orlando, and former campaign manager to former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson.

Impact of the cut

In Florida, public radio stations reach 1.3 million listeners weekly, covering local news and airing NPR programs such as Morning Edition, All Things Considered and Car Talk. The TV stations, which reach 11 million viewers weekly, also include local content such as town hall meetings and national PBS programs about news, history and culture. The TV stations also buy and air PBS programs that teach children about the alphabet, reading, vocabulary, math and science among other shows including Sesame Street, Clifford the Big Red Dog, It's a Big World and Curious George.

Florida's PBS stations also provide workshops for teachers with a focus on at-risk and low-income families and provide books to Florida's neediest children. 

The impact of the veto isn't fully known yet, said Righter, executive director of the Florida Public Broadcasting Service, which represents all of the stations.

""People are going to be laid off and have been,"" she said. ""Stations are still trying to come up with how to fund some of these things.""

But Righter said she doesn't expect that the TV stations will drop children's programs such as Sesame Street.

""The way the programs are packaged, we really won't lose our kids programs unless something else happens that creates a big drop in revenue,"" she said. ""We have a big commitment to that childrens block. We plan to continue that.""

It's the face-to-face outreach with people in the school districts that may not continue, she said. The TV stations have educators who go into schools to provide workshops for teachers to show them how to use PBS programs to help children engage in reading. The cuts will also probably impact local program production, Righter said.

John Labonia, general manager at WLRN in Miami, said the veto won't affect children's programming at his station.

""Stations pay PBS for the rights to carry those programs. In our case we didn't use any of the state money to purchase programs,"" he said.

Our ruling When Pink Slip Rick put out the call to robocall Gov. Scott, Chris S. was among the callers. He said to Scott: ""I really can't believe that you cut PBS of all things. My kids sit around and watch PBS in the early morning. They learn so much from it. And to have the state cut funding for PBS is despicable."" 

The caller is right that Scott vetoed $4.8 million in state funding for public radio and TV, but the particular impact the caller cites -- cuts to children's programs -- are not expected.

Rick Perry says more and more scientists are questioning global warming
","Texas Gov. Rick Perry has made it clear he doesn't believe that human beings are contributing to global warming, and he expounded on the issue in detail at a campaign stop in Bedford, N.H.

""I do believe that the issue of global warming has been politicized,"" Perry said. ""I think there are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects. I think we're seeing it almost weekly or even daily, scientists who are coming forward and questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change.""

He added that plans to address climate change by limiting carbon emissions would cost ""billions, if not trillions"" and that America should not spend that much money on ""scientific theory that has not been proven and from my perspective is more and more being put into question.""

Perry is the latest candidate to enter the race for the Republican nomination for president, announcing on Aug. 13, 2011, that he is running. Perry has served as the Texas governor since 2000.

So is Perry correct? Is there significant disagreement on the causes of global warming?

We looked at this question in some detail in a previous fact-check on candidate Tim Pawlenty, who has since dropped out of the race. Pawlenty said, ""The weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... it's fair to say the science is in dispute."" We rated that statement False. This report reviews much of the same evidence.

We'll start with the basics.

One of the most oft-cited reports is from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific body considered the leading international organization on climate science. It includes the scientific consensus of thousands of researchers from 194 countries.

""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations,"" the most recent report states. ""The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone."" (External forcing refers to anything outside of the normal climate system that changes the climate, including the results of human activity, sunspots or volcanic eruptions.)

In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC's conclusions: ""Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.""

Earlier this year, a committee organized by the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences again reviewed the current research on climate change. The committee concluded that climate change is occurring, that it is caused primarily by the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities, and that it poses significant risks for a range of human and natural systems. It specifically rejected the view that that those findings are in some way questionable.

""Although the scientific process is always open to new ideas and results, the fundamental causes and consequences of climate change have been established by many years of scientific research, are supported by many different lines of evidence, and have stood firm in the face of careful examination, repeated testing, and the rigorous evaluation of alternative theories and explanations,"" the committee said.

We asked the Perry campaign for comment on this, but we didn't hear back. In response to similar questions from the Washington Post, the Perry campaign pointed to various writings questioning climate change. But the Post's report noted these writings were anecdotal and ""not evidence of the groundswell of opposition suggested by Perry."" We concur.

To be clear, we're not saying that no scientists -- as in zero -- dispute climate change is caused by human activity.  We looked into the work of the most prominent and best credentialed people who have questioned the IPCC's conclusions on global warming. Generally speaking, even these scientists do not claim that humans are making no contribution at all to rising temperatures. Rather, they tend to make more nuanced points. They question whether carbon emissions alone are driving up temperatures, or whether other human activities contribute as well. They question whether extreme weather events such as storms or floods can be conclusively linked to rising temperatures. And, they question whether significant changes to public policy are necessary as a means of coping with rising temperatures.

Climate change skeptics also have their own petition, commonly called the Oregon petition, that has been endorsed by 31,000 signers opposing restrictions on carbon emissions. But that petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or even proving that all the signatories exist.

Several scientific studies have attempted to quantify just how much agreement there is among scientists when it comes to climate change.

A 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences -- the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences -- found that out of 1,372 climate researchers under review, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change. It also concluded that ""the relative climate expertise and scientiﬁc prominence"" of the researchers unconvinced of man-made climate change are ""substantially below that of the convinced researchers.""

An earlier survey published in the 2009 issue of Eos -- a publication of the American Geophysical Union -- asked scientists from a wide range of disciplines (approximately 3,146): ""Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?"" Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question. Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes.

Perry also charged that scientists have been manipulating data. He could be referring to a 2009 incident when stolen e-mails from the Climatic Research United at the University of East Anglia were released on the Internet. Global warming skeptics said the e-mails showed climate researchers were manipulating data.

But several inquiries debunked those allegations, including investigations by the British Parliament, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania State University and the InterAcademy Council. The inquiries found that, while the scientists had made rude remarks about people who questioned climate change, they were not falsifying data. Some of the investigations recommended greater transparency and sharing of climatic data, but the independent investigations exonerated the researchers of falsifying data.

Perry's remarks give the impression that the science of global warming is in dispute, that some scientists feel one way, and some scientists feel another way. He says that skepticism is growing. In fact, our research shows that's not the case. We found that there is solid consensus among the major scientific organizations and that the skeptics seems to be small minority.

"['Financial Regulation', 'Government Regulation', 'Wisconsin', 'Sean Duffy']","
Rep. Sean Duffy says small banks will have to spend 2.2 million labor hours to comply with Dodd-Frank financial reform law
","
In 2010, Republicans denounced the sweeping financial-reform law that Democrats pushed after a financial crisis that has fueled America’s stubborn economic downturn.

Job-killer, they called it. Failure. Budget buster. Regulatory overkill.

Now, more than a year after President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the GOP is pushing for changes -- and trotting out some eye-popping numbers to back its claim that the measure is anti-business.

Republican U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, a freshman from northern Wisconsin, is among the naysayers -- though not to the point of signing on to the repeal bill offered by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a GOP presidential candidate.

Duffy is claiming the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau actually could hurt consumers and slow economic recovery by piling new regulations on local financial institutions.

""For small community banks and credit unions, like those in Central and Northern Wisconsin, the hundreds of new rules will require an estimated 2,260,631 labor hours just for compliance,"" Duffy wrote in an op-ed piece published by The Washington Times on July 20, 2011. ""Those are hours that your local bank or credit union will spend dealing with some Washington bureaucrat instead of focusing on the needs of customers like you.""

He added: ""Just because Wall Street is in New York and has a bad reputation doesn’t mean it’s right or fair to lump the ‘little guys’ in Wausau, Hayward and Superior in with them.""

More than 2.2 million hours?

That figure has become a talking point for various Republicans. The original source was apparently the House Financial Services Committee, of which Duffy is a member.

""Banks tell us they are adding compliance people to their staffs,"" said Daryll Lund, president and CEO of the Community Bankers of Wisconsin, a nonprofit trade group. ""The vast majority of them are talking about adding staff.""

But does anybody really estimate the time needed to do all the paperwork behind the new safeguards?

The answer is yes.

Under the federal Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, that figure is estimated by each federal agency that puts rules into effect -- and that’s where Duffy’s office pointed us when we asked for evidence to back the claim.

The first batch of about 30-plus rules contains hundreds of pages of detailed estimates of the ""burden hours"" for each. The House Financial Services Committee totalled up the hours just for those rules, and came up with the 2.2 million hours referenced by Duffy, said Bryan Blom, Duffy’s legislative director.

We sampled the calculations, and consulted several academics and lawyers involved in studying Dodd-Frank. The consensus is that the 2.2 million number is reasonable, if not low. Indeed, just one part of one rule had an estimate of 604,800 hours.

But Duffy uses the number in a particular way, stretching its meaning in his claim.

We noticed a couple of big discrepancies.

First, Duffy’s claim attributed the 2.2 million hours to ""hundreds"" of new rules. The first batch of about 30 rule produced that many, so the real number will certainly be higher.

More importantly, Duffy attributes the fallout from all that paperwork to small banks and credit unions. But some of the rules appear to have little to do with Main Street lenders.

For example, several rules in the first batch -- including the one with the 600,000 hour paperwork burden -- regulate the transparency of activities by so-called ""swap dealers.""

Remember swaps?

Swaps transactions became famous -- or infamous -- in the financial crisis. Dodd-Frank tightened reporting of swaps ""because of concerns that unregulated, poorly regulated and poorly managed swaps operations had contributed to the credit market freeze that started in 2007 and the ensuing financial crisis,"" Life and Health National Underwriter reported in May 2011.

Most small banks don’t get involved in swaps and would not be directly affected by the rules on that, said Richard McGuigan, executive vice president of the Community Bankers of Wisconsin. A few might be indirectly affected.

That makes Duffy’s use of the estimate problematic.

A more cautious approach was taken in the House committee report that Duffy cited. It said Dodd-Frank will require small community
and mid-sized regional banks to spend ""thousands of man-hours"" on regulatory compliance. It referenced the 2.2 million hours, but without so closely linking that number to small institutions.

When we talked to experts, we heard over and over that nobody knows the impact yet of the law, which has been called one of the most complex bills ever.

Small banks know they can’t afford to pay someone $100,000 to make sure they comply with everything, said Milwaukee attorney James Friedman, who heads the financial institutions practice group at the Quarles & Brady, which has a large national practice.

And they know that Internet banking, the economy, new regulations could spell an end to many smaller institutions, said Friedman.

But it’s just too early in the life of the law to know the ultimate effect on banks, credit unions or consumers, according to both Friedman and the Community Bankers of Wisconsin.

Let’s cash this one in.

Duffy used the sympathetic ""Main Street"" bankers to illustrate his concerns about the regulatory impact of the Dodd-Frank law. There’s no doubt it will create more work, and Duffy turns to an estimate from a credible source.

But in dramatizing the burden, he misapplies a very precise number to one subset of the many institutions that will be affected by the law. No one knows how many of those hours will land on the small players.

At the same time, he potentially underestimates the burden, attributing the paperwork load of the first batch of rules to the as-yet-uncalculated burden from the hundreds of rules to come.

So there’s an element of truth in the estimates and it’s possible Duffy’s number could turn out to be low.

This reminds us of the joke about two statisticians out hunting who spy a duck. The first fires a bullet -- six inches too high. The second statistician takes aim and fires -- six inches too low. The two statisticians celebrate and say, ""Got him!"", figuring that ""on average"" the two shots hit the duck.

Duffy’s found the trail and is tracking his prey, but this is a blind shot at this point.

We rate Duffy’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/22/sean-duffy/rep-sean-duffy-says-small-banks-will-have-spend-22/
"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'David Pennington']","
Transportation sales tax could be historic for wrong reason, Dalton mayor says
","
Dalton Mayor David Pennington is not on board with the idea of a penny-per-dollar sales tax to fund transportation projects. He fears a higher sales tax will encourage people to shop in nearby Tennessee and spend less money in his North Georgia city.

And he really doesn’t like plans to hold a referendum in November 2012, as opposed to the initial idea of a vote on the transportation sales tax in July.

The people trying to switch the date of the vote, Pennington said, are ""obviously trying to get the Obama Democrats to help pass what could be the largest tax increase in Georgia history: $1.6 billion a year.""

Pennington’s problem with November 2012 is he believes it’s a sly attempt by referendum supporters to get more people likely to vote in favor of the sales tax to cast their ballots. The presidential election will be held in November, and more Democrats are likely to vote then as opposed to July, when election primaries are held. President Barack Obama is not expected to have a primary challenger.

Interesting, but we were more curious about the latter part of his quote. Could this sales tax actually be the largest tax increase in state history?

David Sjoquist, who frequently does research for state lawmakers as director of the Fiscal Research Center at Georgia State University, had several questions about Pennington’s claim, including these: What did the mayor mean by largest increase? In one year? Over the span of several years?

""It’s a tricky comparison,"" Sjoquist said.

Pennington said he was referring to the annual total it’s estimated that the tax could generate. The mayor remembered a presentation last year from state transportation officials that estimated the annual total at $1.6 billion. Georgia Transportation Department officials estimated in June that the sales tax would bring in an at least $1.4 billion a year.

""I don’t even remember in my lifetime a tax that would be as much,"" Pennington told us.

He added in a follow-up conversation: ""I want everyone to know how big of a tax this is going to be.""

The last sizable tax increase of any kind that experts could remember occurred in 1989 when Georgia lawmakers increased the state sales tax from 3 percent to 4 percent. That tax was expected to raise at least $507 million a year. Sales tax revenue increased by about $613 million between 1989 and 1990, state economist Ken Heaghney said, although he pointed out that some of that revenue came from an increase in sales activity in Georgia. Sales tax revenue declined slightly the next two years but has grown steadily in the following years.

Jeff Humphreys, the director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, noted that the sales tax increase was approved with an exemption on food.

""That [sales tax] increase was not as large as it seemed,"" Humphreys said.

There have been a handful of other major tax increases in past decades. But revenue records are hard to find, so it is difficult to say whether others had a bigger financial impact than the proposed transportation sales tax. The last time Georgia’s motor fuel tax was raised was in 1971, by a penny. The corporate tax rate was last changed in 1969, with an increase from 5 percent to 6 percent. Georgia’s income tax was created during the Great Depression.

Georgia created its sales tax in 1951 and set the rate at 3 percent. Total state revenue collections rose from $145.3 million in 1951 to $220.5 million in 1952, a $75 million difference. Adjusted for inflation, that is about $600 million in today’s dollars. We believe it’s safe to say that much of that difference came from the creation of the sales tax.

So we found two cases of sizable increases in revenue from tax hikes. Still, it doesn’t compete with the estimated $1 billion-plus from the transportation sales tax.

Each economist and expert we spoke with noted a potential problem with Pennington’s claim: The tax may not collect $1 billion or more.

The way the referendum works, the state is divided into 12 regions and it’s up to voters in each region to decide whether to approve the sales tax. There’s great debate about the referendum’s chances in the 10-county metro Atlanta region. The tax is projected to raise about $8 billion for transportation projects over the span of 10 years, which is at least one-half of the total statewide.

Pennington conceded the tax ""would be a whole lot smaller"" than $1.6 billion a year if it doesn’t pass in metro Atlanta.

The latest revenue projection from the tax for Pennington’s northwest Georgia region is $140 million a year.

It is possible, if all 12 regions pass the tax, that it could collect more than $1 billion a year, which would be the largest tax increase that we could find. The key will be whether voters in the Atlanta region approve it. Since Pennington said it ""could"" be the largest tax increase, we believe he gets to drive through the safe lane on his claim.

Sen. Sherrod Brown says Wall Street hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a typical sheet metal worker or a teacher
","
The bipartisan plan to raise the nation’s debt ceiling included formation of a 12-member congressional committee to consider cuts in spending and tax reform.

After voting in support of the plan, Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown said in an interview that Congress needed to turn its focus to job creation exclusively. And he said that tax reform should close loopholes that the debt-ceiling deal didn't touch.

For example, he said, ""They didn’t close the tax loopholes for Wall Street hedge fund managers who pay a lower tax rate than does a sheet metal worker in Parma or a school teacher in Cleveland.""

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. Could wealthy Wall Street investors have a lower tax rate on their compensation than average workers?

We asked Brown's office how he supported his remark. Press secretary Allison Preiss responded with a pile of sources.

Let's start the review by identifying our subject. Hedge funds are investment funds similar to mutual funds, but are not subject to the same rules and regulations, are typically more aggressive, and traditionally have been limited to wealthy investors. Most set very high minimum investment levels.

Managers of hedge funds typically charge investors 2 percent for managing their money, meaning that a $10 billion hedge fund takes in $200 million in fees. Managers also can collect a percentage of the profits from trades they make, usually 20 percent.

AR Magazine, the hedge fund trade publication, began estimating compensation in the industry a decade ago, the Reuters news agency said earlier this year, noting that ""calculating the earnings of top hedge fund managers involves a degree of guesswork and alchemy, since funds don't publicly disclose compensation.""

AR's annual report on the 25 richest hedge fund managers said they collected about $22 billion in compensation last year.

Topping the charts in hedge fund pay was John Paulson of Paulson & Co., who earned a reported $4.9 billion. That is billion with a B, and that is for the year 2010.

A study by the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the top 25 hedge fund managers combined appear to have earned more than all the CEOs of the companies in the S&P 500 combined. That study put the average pay at hedge funds for ""highly compensated employees"" -- not just the managers at the top of the scale -- at $3.2 million a year.

Using the federal income tax rate schedule for 2010, a single individual earning $3.2 million (or $4.9 billion) would fall in the top tax bracket that applies to wages, bonuses and other compensation, which is 35 percent. That rate starts at income of about $370,000.

But hedge fund managers typically don’t pay taxes on their income the same way other Americans do, as PolitiFact has noted before.

The bulk of hedge fund managers’ income is typically considered ""carried interest"" -- that is, their share of profits from the funds they manage. When a fund has capital gains and those gains flow to the manager, they are taxed as a capital gain, not as ordinary income.

The tax rate on capital gains is 15 percent, rather than the 35 percent on compensation that would be paid by everyone else, including other types of Wall Street managers. (The taxpayers with the top 400 incomes paid an average rate of 18.11 percent in 2008, according to the most recent update of the Internal Revenue Service, which issues an annual report on the top 400 taxpayers.)

Hedge fund managers don't necessarily pay even 15 percent, however. They can pay no current income tax at all, by leaving their carried interest money in the hedge fund and deferring the tax bill to a later date -- even decades later -- when they eventually cash out of the fund.

What about the other two individuals in Brown's statement?

According to the most recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in May 2010, the average salary for a sheet metal worker in the Cleveland area, spanning Elyria to Mentor, is $47,200.

According to a May 2010 survey by The Plain Dealer, using information from the Ohio Department of Education, the average teacher salary in Cleveland is $65,575.

Using the federal income tax rate schedule, both single individuals and heads of households at those income levels would fall in the tax bracket of 25 percent.

That 25 percent is higher than the capital gains rate of 15 percent that the carried interest tax loophole allows hedge fund managers to pay on their income.

On the Truth-O-Meter, that gives Brown's statement a rating of True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/22/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-wall-street-hedge-fund-mana/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'State Budget', 'Chris Christie']","
Gov. Chris Christie says since he introduced his first budget in March 2010, New Jersey has added 50,000 private-sector jobs
","
For the governor of New Jersey, even a walk on the beach is political.

During a boardwalk stroll in Belmar on Aug. 10, Gov. Chris Christie responded to criticism of his environmental policies from Assemblyman John McKeon (D-Essex), put to him by NJTV’s Michael Aron.

""It is election time and Mr. McKeon needs to have something to say in a state where since I introduced my budget -- first budget -- in March of 2010, we've created 50,000 new private-sector jobs for the people of this state,"" Christie said. ""Where we already have seen that we are beyond the air quality goals that were set by the Corzine administration, Michael. So you should go back and ask Assemblyman McKeon that.""

PolitiFact New Jersey checked the private-sector jobs statistic. Christie’s number is mostly right. But did the introduction of Christie’s first budget play into that increase? As one state policy expert said, ""the burden of proving [that] is rather difficult.""

We’ll start with the numbers.

Christie introduced his first budget in the middle of March, but we’ll look at the whole month since the numbers aren’t broken down further.

At the time Christie made his statement, the latest numbers publicly available were preliminary statistics from June 2011. According to that seasonally-adjusted data, the state had added 42,100 private-sector jobs since March 2010.

However, on Aug. 18, the state labor department released revised numbers for June and preliminary numbers for July. According to the updated figures, from March 2010 to June 2011, the state added 48,000 private-sector jobs. If you include July 2011, the state has added 51,900 private-sector jobs since March 2010.

With any of the data sets, the governor’s point is largely on the mark.

But how much can the governor take credit for that increase in private-sector jobs?

When we asked the governor’s office to explain how the introduction of Christie’s first budget sparked private-sector job growth, a spokesman, Kevin Roberts, told us in an email, ""I think you are reading the Governor’s statement incorrectly, as he is clearly using that as a marker in time.""  

But Roberts then said it’s a ""worthwhile marker"" because it ""represented a break from the old way of doing things in Trenton."" And since the introduction of the budget, Christie has ""built a record of restoring fiscal responsibility and sanity, providing businesses and families much-needed certainty that we will not raise taxes, and providing targeted tax cuts to improve the state’s business climate and create jobs.""

An economist from a conservative think tank and a senior vice president at the New Jersey Business and Industry Association mostly agreed with Roberts’ assessment of the impact of the governor’s first budget. 
Aparna Mathur, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said it’s impossible to argue with complete confidence that the introduction of the governor’s budget had a direct effect on private-sector jobs, but it’s not unreasonable.

She said the governor’s efforts to ""curb spending growth, cut business taxes and provide certainty about economic policies going forward are certainly things that are likely to provide some degree of confidence to firms about the reliability of investing in the state and are likely to spur job creation.""

But a handful of experts from other policy thinks tanks said the process of private-sector job creation is complicated and even if changes in government policy had a direct impact, it would take longer than a year and half to see any effects.

""It isn’t clear a specific governor can take a lot of credit for the new jobs,"" said Kim Rueben, who directs the state and local program of the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. ""I think governors and state governments can change the climate but in general there has been little research showing specific programs (or economic development credits) have actually led to job creation.""

Bob Ward, deputy director of the New York-based Rockefeller Institute of Government, said, ""for better or worse, most of what has happened in New Jersey’s economy in the last 18 months reflects conditions that were already in place. Any state policy changes since then are unlikely to have had a dramatic impact on job totals.""

The ruling

Christie tied the introduction of his first budget to increased private-sector employment in the state, saying that since March of last year, ""we've created 50,000 new private-sector jobs.""

His statistic is mostly correct. But his underlying point that the introduction of his budget spurred that job growth, according to most of the experts we spoke with, is a stretch.

We couldn’t fully blame Christie’s budget if the state lost private-sector jobs, and we can’t fully credit Christie’s budget when the state gains private-sector jobs.

We rate the governor’s claim Half True.

Sheboygan Mayor Bob Ryan says no public official in Wisconsin has been removed from office for reasons other than malfeasance
","
Defiant Sheboygan Mayor Bob Ryan-- whose drinking problems have spurred scorn from citizens, humiliation on YouTube and ridicule from Jay Leno -- says he would become a singular figure in the history of Wisconsin government if his Common Council succeeds in removing him from office.

Wisconsin witnessed a historic set of nine recall elections in the summer of 2011. Voters removed two Republican state senators from office.

But Ryan, whose city calls itself the bratwurst capital of the world, claims his removal would be unique -- partly because it would not involve a recall.

On Aug. 15, 2011, the Sheboygan Common Council launched a process that could eventually take Ryan, who has resisted calls to resign, out of office. If the move plays out, Ryan essentially would be put on trial with the council acting as judge and jury, according to a Sheboygan Press article and Sheboygan City Attorney Steve McLean.

Ryan made his claim to aldermen during the Aug. 15 council meeting, according to WBAY-TV in Green Bay.

""This whole thing stinks. If you want to take me out of office, by all means start your recall,"" he said. ""If you want to go down this path, it's not a threat, it's a fact, it's never been done. There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office. I'm here to do a job. I will continue to do that job. You should know by now, I never quit. Ever.""

For us, the key claim is this sentence:

""There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office.""

Never is a long time.

Ryan didn’t return our call and emails over two days asking him to clarify his claim and to provide evidence for it.

""Public official,"" for example, could mean an elected official or an appointed one, such as a school superintendent. But our sense is Ryan was referring to elected officials like himself being removed by a governmental body, and not the voters.

Ryan has argued that his drinking -- he has admitted to being an alcoholic -- has not affected his duties as mayor.

The saga in Sheboygan, a Lake Michigan community of about 50,000 people 60 miles north of Milwaukee, began in September 2009, six months after Ryan, 48, was elected mayor. He called a news conference to apologize for making a sexually explicit remark about his wife’s sister. Ryan’s remark was captured on video, posted on YouTube, became fodder for Jay Leno and led the Common Council to censure him.

The drama intensified in July 2011, when news surfaced that Ryan was issued a warning by police after a weekend of drinking at taverns in Elkhart Lake, becoming rude and obnoxious and passing out at least once. The Common Council voted to begin the removal process after Ryan refused its call to resign.

To see whether Ryan’s claim is correct, we contacted a number of experts.

They include state government entities -- the Legislative Reference Bureau, the Historical Society, the Department of Public Instruction and the Judicial Commission; statewide associations -- the League of Municipalities, the Counties Association and the Association of School Boards; political scientists -- Dennis Dresang of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Joe Heim of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse; and Milwaukee historian John Gurda.

Here’s what we found:

Fatal shooting: In 1842, six years before Wisconsin became a state, James Vineyard, a member of the Territorial Legislature’s version of the state Senate, shot and killed fellow member Charles C.P. Arndt during an argument after a legislative session adjourned. Vineyard was expelled from the legislature after it refused to accept his resignation, although he was acquitted of manslaughter at trial, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau and the Wisconsin Historical Society.

Given that the shooting occurred on the legislative floor, it could be fairly argued that the removal was related to misconduct in office. So, that one does not directly undercut Ryan’s claim.

Felony crimes: At least four state lawmakers have been removed from office after being convicted of a felony. But under state law, the expulsions were automatic -- no action needed to be taken by the Legislature -- so that makes their removals different than Ryan’s would be.

Crimes not directly related to official duties also have led to removals that were not automatic. For example, the New Holstein School Board fired Christopher J. Nelson, the district’s superintendent, after he was charged in February 2011 with trying to set up a sexual encounter with a person he thought was a 15-year-old boy. That could undercut Ryan’s claim, but Nelson was an appointed official, not elected.

Non-criminal removal: In 1992, the state Supreme Court removed Racine County Circuit Court Judge Jon Skow from the bench after he admitted he was permanently disabled from stress and depression. The high court determined that Skow, who suffered from alcoholism, could not carry out his duties. He previously had been suspended following a number of incidents, including leaving the bench during a trial.

That case does undercut Ryan’s claim, since the judge was not removed for malfeasance in office.

As rare as removals from office appear to be, at least two other Wisconsin mayors have been targeted for removal since 2008.

The Common Council in Montello, 60 miles north of Madison, removed Mayor Frank Breitenbach in August 2008 for reasons related to misconduct in office, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. He faced 15 allegations by city employees and residents, including using profanity with employees and threatening to fire Montello's police chief without legal authority.

In Marinette, a Lake Michigan community 120 miles north of Sheboygan, a Common Council committee recommended hiring a special prosecutor in an effort to remove Mayor Robert Harbick from office. Harbick had pleaded no contest to first-offense drunken-driving, which is a traffic violation in Wisconsin. But the removal process failed to proceed when the proposal to hire the attorney failed in a 4-4 vote before the full council in August 2011.

Let’s review what we’ve found.

The embattled Sheboygan mayor said no public official in Wisconsin has ever been removed from office ""for anything but malfeasance in office."" Ryan’s reference was not to recall elections or automatic removal, but removal by a governmental body such as a city council.

Our sense is it’s likely the mayor was speaking of elected officials, and we could find only one instance, involving a judge, in which a removal was not for misconduct in office. We also found a school superintendent fired by a school board following the filing of criminal charges, but he did not hold an elected position.

This is a statement we could revisit if more information surfaces; after all we’re talking about more than 150 years of history and countless governmental entities in Wisconsin. For now, we feel Ryan’s statement needs a little clarification, but is essentially accurate -- our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/21/bob-ryan/sheboygan-mayor-bob-ryan-says-no-public-official-w/
"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Susan Combs']","
Did Comptroller Susan Combs flip-flop on abortion?
","
Three years before the next Texas lieutenant governor’s election, one possible Republican candidate, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, accused another, Comptroller Susan Combs, of changing her position on abortion. 
In an Aug. 2 letter to Combs seeking clarification of her stance, Staples says recent comments by Combs’ spokesman run ""completely contrary"" to her ""known pro-choice position."" 
Recent comments? Cody McGregor, campaign manager for Staples, pointed us to a July 5 column in the Houston Chronicle that quotes Combs’ political consultant Reggie Bashur as saying that Combs ""wants Roe v. Wade overturned"" and is against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman’s life is in jeopardy. 
Has Combs flip-flopped on abortion? 
Some background: Combs, Staples and others who may vie for lieutenant governor in 2014 are drawing attention now because the incumbent, David Dewhurst, recently joined the 2012 field of candidates for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison. That means Dewhurst hopes he won’t be seeking another term as lieutenant governor two years later. Staples has said that he will compete for the post overseeing the Texas Senate as long as Dewhurst doesn’t. And Combs is considering jumping in, according to Bashur. 
Combs, in her second term as comptroller, previously served as state agriculture commissioner and in the Texas House, where she represented an Austin-area district. 
We first looked into Combs’ past position on abortion. 
In his letter, Staples says Combs’ ""pro-choice position is well documented"" through ""quoted comments in several news reports."" 
Reporter Peggy Fikac’s July 5 Chronicle column cites two earlier news articles. The first is a May 1995 Austin American-Statesman story in which Combs, then a House member, discussed her belief that government had grown too large and powerful. ""We are so casual about government intrusion in our lives,"" Combs is quoted as saying. ""I'm pro-choice for the same reason.'' 
The second news article cited in the Chronicle column was an Associated Press story from November 2003, when Combs was agriculture commissioner. ""Combs supports a woman's right to choose, with exceptions,"" the story says. ""She opposes ‘partial-birth’ abortions and third-trimester abortions and favors parental notification for minors seeking abortions."" 
In an interview, Brooke Botello, communications director for the comptroller's office, told us that the AP story accurately covered Combs' earlier position on abortion. Botello also told us that Combs' position had not shifted significantly during her years as a House member and agriculture commissioner. 
Staples’ campaign also sent us a February 2011 Texas Tribune story that kicks off by asking whether it’s possible for a pro-choice candidate to win a ""high-profile"" statewide Republican primary in Texas. ""Susan Combs might try,"" it says. The article describes Combs’ position as ""anti-abortion but pro-choice"" and says that Combs ""has said Roe v. Wade should stand."" 
That Supreme Court ruling, issued Jan. 22, 1973, struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before viability, the time at which a fetus can survive outside a woman's body. It noted that viability ""is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks)"" of pregnancy ""but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks."" 
After fetal viability, the court said, states could limit abortions provided that their policies met certain requirements, including an exception to protect the life of the woman. Since then, other Supreme Court rulings have affirmed states' rights to impose further restrictions. 
The first sign we found of a possible shift by Combs was in a May 22 Houston Chronicle article on the 2011 regular legislative session. It reported that at Combs’ request, state Rep. Jim Landtroop, R-Plainview, added an amendment to a budget-related bill that would have prohibited businesses from claiming money spent on elective abortions through its employee health plans as an exemption from the state’s franchise tax. When calculating how much they owe under the tax, qualifying companies are permitted to deduct from total revenue certain costs, including health care benefits. 
The article quotes Rep. John Otto, R-Dayton, as saying that Combs sought the change ""to remove what she would consider public subsidies of insurance policies covering abortions. ... In her view, that is subsidizing abortion because that is public money."" 
Botello confirmed that Combs had asked Landtroop to propose the amendment. The overall proposal died, though, and the Combs-backed amendment did not become law. 
About six weeks later, in July, Bashur’s statement that Combs is now against most abortions appeared in the Chronicle column. On Aug. 2, Staples shared his letter to Combs with news organizations, and the next day, Combs was interviewed by the Tribune, which reported that she had ""switched her position on abortion rights, from pro-choice to pro-life."" 
In the interview, Tribune reporter Ross Ramsey says: ""Let’s talk about choice. I understand that your position on this has changed."" 
Combs replies: ""Uh huh."" She continues: ""Twenty years ago, I was pro-choice … because I had concerns about the role of government."" She then says that she changed her mind after ""looking at studies and data and reading books"" and concluding that abortion is being used as ""birth control."" 
""It is stunning to me that we are at the point in this country where in 2011, you have incredibly high numbers of women choosing to abort rather than have a baby or to have avoided the problem in the first place,"" she told the Tribune. ""So I am unequivocal about it. I was wrong, and it's 20 years later, and I feel very strongly about it."" 
Combs’ newly articulated position — in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade and against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman’s life is threatened — mirrors Staples’. And Austin consultant Wayne Hamilton, a former executive director of the Republican Party of Texas, told us that Texas candidates have generally been considered pro-life if they oppose abortion except in those three cases, though some candidates rule out exceptions. 
So, how does Combs’ acknowledged shift rate on the Flip-O-Meter? 
Previously, Combs was in favor of allowing abortions in most cases, excluding those in the final trimester of pregnancy. Now, she opposes abortion in most cases, with the exception of those involving rape, incest or when a woman’s life is threatened.

Assemblyman Gary Schaer claims hair stylists face more government regulations than foreclosure consultants
","
Sit down for a hair cut and you quickly see it: a document telling you this stylist or barber is licensed by the State of New Jersey.

Assemblyman Gary Schaer (D-Passaic) said the state should also be in the business of regulating foreclosure consultants, those who try to help people save their homes.

Following a recent court ruling allowing four banks to resume uncontested residential mortgage foreclosures in state court, Schaer issued a press release on Aug. 17 calling on Gov. Chris Christie to sign a bill aimed at protecting homeowners from foreclosure rescue scams.

Foreclosure consultants could charge homeowners with the promise of helping them avoid or postpone foreclosure. In some cases, clients could end up turning over their homes, paying rent to live there and then getting evicted.

""New Jersey continues to be the ‘Wild West’ of foreclosure consulting,"" Schaer, one of the bill’s sponsors, said in the press release. ""Hair stylists are required to undergo more government scrutiny than foreclosure consultants.""

Could hair stylists really face more government requirements than foreclosure consultants?

PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Schaer’s claim was accurate. Hair stylists must receive a license and follow other regulations, while Schaer’s bill would actually outline the first regulations for so-called ""foreclosure consultants.""

However, individuals providing such consulting services as ""debt adjusters"" face state regulations, and a new federal law already imposes requirements similar to those under Schaer’s bill.

First, let’s talk about the regulatory environment faced by hair stylists.

According to 23 pages of state regulations, hairstyling and other related positions require a license from the New Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling. Hair stylists and barbers must complete an educational course, and pass an exam conducted by the board.

By contrast, there are no state regulations for ""foreclosure consultants,"" because the term doesn’t exist under state law, according to Marshall McKnight, spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Banking & Insurance. The bill sponsored by Schaer would define that term and lay out the new regulations, McKnight said.

Under the bill, known as the ""Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Prevention Act,"" the new requirements for foreclosure consultants would include securing a license from the Commissioner of Banking & Insurance and undergoing a criminal background check.

""People are being scammed on a constant basis,"" Schaer said in a phone interview. ""There’s no oversight at all.""

But most of the foreclosure consultants’ activities listed in the bill are covered by the state’s Debt Adjuster Act, which requires ""debt adjusters"" to be licensed to act as intermediaries between a debtor and his creditors. In essence, debt adjusters can perform a type of foreclosure consulting, but they must be licensed -- just like hair stylists.

In 2008, state officials issued warnings about individuals or entities advertising or performing foreclosure consulting and other services. Those warnings indicated that providing such services requires a debt adjuster’s license.

Peggy Jurow, a senior attorney with the Anti-Predatory Lending Project at Legal Services of New Jersey, said foreclosure consultants are subject to the state’s Consumer Fraud Act, but otherwise, they’re not regulated.

So, Schaer’s bill marks new territory in regulating ""foreclosure consultants.""

Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts said the governor has until Thursday to take action on the legislation, which was passed unanimously by the Legislature on June 29.

""As with all pieces of pending legislation, it is receiving the careful review of our counsel’s office prior to the Governor taking action,"" Roberts said in an email.

Now, even though Schaer’s statement refers to state regulations, let’s take a quick look at how federal law regulates foreclosure rescue services.

Federal regulations don’t require licensing or background checks for foreclosure rescue consultants, but a new law from the Federal Trade Commission mandates requirements similar to those under Schaer’s bill.

Called the Mortgage Assistance Relief Services (MARS) Rule, that law prohibits foreclosure rescue service providers from receiving fees until homeowners get a written offer from their lenders. All of the rule’s provisions were in effect as of Jan. 31.

The ruling

Schaer claimed hair stylists must ""undergo more government scrutiny than foreclosure consultants."" He’s right, because there are no existing state regulations governing foreclosure consultants. That term and the regulations would come from Schaer’s bill.

Foreclosure consulting done by ""debt adjusters"" requires a state license, but since Schaer’s statement was in reference to ""foreclosure consultants,"" we rate the statement True.

Incoming economic development director says Providence's port is the closest to Europe
","Rhode Island has a lot going for it. Really.

But we never knew we were so close, in terms of geography, to Europe.

Our proximity was highlighted by the newly named economic development director for Providence, James Bennett, who was hired to give some direction to economic growth in the capital city. During a news conference announcing his appointment, he pointed to one advantage the city -- specifically its port -- has over its competitors.

""Providence has got a number of assets. . . . The port [is] 200 miles closer to Europe than any other Eastern port,"" he said. ""We need to, I think, focus on turning that into an economic engine.""

The statement sent us scrambling for our maps.

We're not cartographers, but it seemed to us that Boston is a bit east of Providence. And what about ports in Maine or New Hampshire?

We got a list of ports from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

Next we tracked down the westernmost part of Europe. Lisbon, Portugal, seemed to be the best candidate. Actually, it’s Cabo da Roca, about 26 miles west of Lisbon.

But because of Earth's curvature, that's not the closest point to New England. Dublin, on Ireland’s eastern coast, is 171 miles closer to Providence than Cabo da Roca. Ireland’s western coast is even closer.

So we turned to Google Maps, and asked for the distance, as the crow flies, to Dublin (to pick a relative landmark). Here's the result:

From Providence: 3,030 miles (and a very tired crow)
From Boston: 2,993 miles (37 miles closer than Providence)
From Portsmouth, N.H.: 2,950 miles (80 miles closer)
From Portland, Maine: 2,906 miles (124 miles closer)

When we contacted Bennett, he promised to call us back in five minutes. Four minutes later, we got a call instead from the spokesman for Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, David Ortiz, saying he would handle the question. A day later, Ortiz wrote us to say Bennett ""regrets the narrow error of fact.""

""Mr. Bennett misspoke; he picked up the incorrect information about the Port of Providence’s geographic proximity to Europe in a recent conversation about the port’s assets, competitive advantages and potential to compete with other major Eastern commercial ports for the European market,"" Ortiz said.

In short, Bennett said Providence's port is 200 miles closer to Europe than any other port on the East Coast.

The only way that's true is if you ignore the ports in every coastal state north of us.

It's not even true when you consider the major port facilities in New York, which are about 155 miles to our west, not 200.

So, whether you're looking east or looking west, Bennett's statement is plain wrong. His spokesman may call it a ""narrow error of fact,"" but we hope that when he gives a pitch to a developer in his new role, he avoids such errors, narrow or otherwise.

Our compass, the Truth-O-Meter, points to False.

Arne Duncan says class sizes in Texas have grown massively
","
The nation’s education secretary says Texas students have struggled on Gov. Rick Perry's watch.

In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Al Hunt touching on the new Republican presidential candidate, Arne Duncan said: ""Far too few of their high school graduates are actually prepared to go on to college. I feel very, very badly for the children there.""

Duncan, the former chief executive officer of the Chicago public schools, continued: ""You have seen massive increases in class size. You’ve seen cutbacks in funding. It doesn’t serve the children well. It doesn’t serve the state well. It doesn’t serve the state’s economy well. And ultimately it hurts the country.""

The college-readiness of Texas high school graduates is a rich topic. For instance, The Dallas Morning News, citing a report, noted Aug.ust 17, 2011, that a majority of Texas high school graduates who took the ACT college-entrance exam this year lacked the skills to pass introductory college courses in math, reading and science.

Too, the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature did not provide billions of dollars in state aid to school districts that the schools would have fielded for enrollment growth under existing funding formulas.

We wondered if Duncan was accurate about Texas seeing massive increases in class size.

Some background: A 1984 overhaul of Texas education laws capped the size of classes in kindergarten through fourth grade at 22 students per teacher, though districts were permitted to request waivers. According to the Texas Education Agency, 168 of the state’s 1,000-plus school districts were granted a waiver in 2010-11, a total that has not changed much year to year, according to agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe, who told us most waiver requests are sought for one or two campuses in a district.

This year, Republican legislators made a push to let districts automatically have some classes exceed the limit; it did not pass into law.   

After asking the U.S. Department of Education how Duncan reached his conclusion, we checked Texas class sizes for each school year from 2005-06 — about halfway through Perry’s decade-plus as governor — through 2009-10, the latest year of available data recorded by the state on its Academic Excellence Indicator System.

The annual reports list average class sizes for every elementary grade, including classes combining students from different grades, plus high school classes in English/language arts, foreign languages, mathematics, science and social studies.

We saw little change over those years.

For example, kindergarten classes averaged 19.3 students in 2005-06, bumped up to 19.5 students in 2006-07, then dipped to 18.9 students in 2007-08 before averaging 19 students in 2008-09 and 19.3 students in 2009-10.

Among the grades affected by the 22-1 class-size mandate, fourth-grade classes were the biggest in 2009-10, at 19.9 students. Over the previous four years, fourth-grade classes ranged in size from 19.3 students in 2005-06 to 20.2 students in 2006-07.

Fifth- and sixth-grade classes averaged 21 to 22 students over the five years, while mixed-grade classes averaged up to 25.7 students, in 2005-06.

In 2009-10, high school class sizes ranged from an average of 17.8 students in English/language arts to 20.4 students in social studies. Over the four previous years, the size of the classes averaged 19.6 students to 22.5 students.

So, there was no massive ballooning, the figures suggest, with early elementary classes remaining smaller than required by law.

We wondered if classes were bigger than in 2000-01, the year Perry became governor.

That year, according to the state, classes in kindergarten through fourth grade were slightly smaller, on average, than in 2009-10, with the biggest difference in first grade, which averaged 18.1 students then, 19.1 in 2009-10.

Classes in all but one higher grade, including each of the high school subjects, were larger in 2000-01 than in 2009-10. Mixed-grade classes averaged 23.2 students then, 24.7 students in 2009-10.

By email, Ratcliffe said the state education agency is ""perplexed"" by Duncan’s claim.

We failed to connect with Duncan, though a spokesman for the Houston school district called us, he said, at the nudging of a Duncan aide. Jason Spencer said the Houston district, which serves about 200,000 students, has not experienced massive class-size increases to date, ""but heading into this fall, it’s safe to say we will have an increase in at least some class sizes.""

Houston’s teacher workforce is down 400 from last year, Spencer said, even though student enrollment is expected to stay steady. He said the reduction is due to fallout from the state budget. Perry signed that budget into law this summer.

""We are looking at having fewer teachers and a growing student population,"" Spencer said. ""That means a higher student-to-teacher ratio.""

It makes sense that the size of some classes could grow as districts adjust to teacher cutbacks.

But Duncan’s statement says classes have already grown massively, a claim contradicted by state figures indicating elementary school classes might be slightly bigger than they used to be — and some high school classes are smaller than they were in earlier years.

We rate the secretary’s claim False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/19/arne-duncan/arne-duncan-says-class-sizes-texas-have-grown-mass/

Jon Huntsman says more English speakers in China than United States
","
Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. undoubtedly knows more about China than any other presidential candidate. 
After all, the 51-year-old Republican served as President Barack Obama’s first U.S. ambassador to China before returning in the spring to run for president. He's also been deputy assistant secretary of commerce for Asia, U.S. Ambassador to Singapore and deputy U.S. trade representative. He speaks Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Hokkien. His ties to the region date back to 1979, when he lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, and he first visited mainland China three decades ago. 
In a July 26, 2011, appearance at Dartmouth College, Huntsman made a surprising claim about China during a question-and-answer session following his speech. 
When an audience member who had recently traveled to China asked Huntsman for his thoughts about the ""huge imbalance"" between the millions of Chinese studying English and the far fewer number of U.S. students studying Chinese, Huntsman replied: ""Would you like the answer in Chinese or English? It’s interesting to note that the largest English-speaking nation today, or soon to be, is China."" 
Huntsman went on to say he had visited Chinese universities ""and I always found that they were keenly interested in English, in our political system, in our economic system, in trying to figure out what makes America so unique. In order to crack that code, they had to master English. So you found  lot of students who were very, very interested in learning English.""

The same enthusiasm, he asserted, was also evident in Chinese high schools and middle schools.

Yo, it’s painful enough that our blenders are made in China, but could this mean that even our slang is soon to be imported from Guangzhou?

For Huntsman’s statement to be accurate, China, with a population of more than 1.3 billion, would need roughly 300 million English speakers to best the United States, which has the third-largest population in the world. That’s because most, though by no means all, U.S. residents (population 309 million in the 2010 Census) speak English.

Then there’s India, a former British colony with a population of 1.2 billion, second only to China. The most popular language in India is Hindi, spoken by 41 percent of the population, and there are 14 other official languages, ranging from Bengali to Sanskrit, according to the CIA Factbook. English is a ""subsidiary official language"" in India ""but is the most important language for national, political, and commercial communication,"" the Factbook reported.

Asked for substantiation of China’s mega-English status, Huntsman’s New Hampshire spokesman, Michael Levoff, cited a a 2011 ""English Proficiency Index"" from EF, or Education First, a company that offers language training in more than 50 countries.

""Indeed, although it is very difficult to measure the number of people who speak English in each country because of different definitions of proficiency, the British Council estimated in 2010 that India had anywhere between 55 and 350 million English speakers while a report published by Cambridge University Press estimates that China has 250 to 350 million English learners,"" the EF English Proficiency Index stated. ""It appears that China is poised to surpass India in the number of English speakers in the coming years, if it has not already done so.""

But academic experts who follow the globalization of English said the issue of proficiency cannot be ignored. It’s one thing to be an ""English learner,"" another to be a skilled ""English speaker.""

Put another way, plenty of Americans took four years of high school Spanish and were ""learners"" at the time, not ""speakers."" Now they visit Cancun and can barely remember, ""¿Dónde está el baño?"" (""Where is the bathroom?"")

David Crystal, an honorary professor of linguistics at the University of Wales-Bangor, and author of The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language, said by e-mail that he believes ""India is still ahead of China at present,"" and that Huntsman’s use of ""or soon to be"" is ""the operative phrase.""

Equally important, Crystal said statistics about both countries are ""very much guesswork"" and he noted that both India and China are cited as ""low proficiency"" countries in the EF Index.

""On the whole, proficiency in India is greater than in China, and English teaching measures are more solid. So I’d be distinctly suspicious of claims being made about China,"" Crystal wrote.

Indeed, a 2006 Cambridge University Press paper by Jian Yang of Seattle University, ""Learners and Users of English in China,"" concluded that China had a ""huge English-knowing population of 200-350 million,"" but that most were not ""proficient bilingual users of the language.""

But, as Huntsman said, interest in English is growing fast in China, and five years is a long time in that context.

Victor Mair, a professor of Chinese language and literature at University of Pennsylvania, said by e-mail that English ""is widely used"" by Chinese companies, that many radio and TV programs are presented in English, and that ""the craze for learning English is palpable.""

A 2009 forum sponsored by the British Council reported that there are approximately 50,000 English language training institutes in China, and that People’s Daily in 2008 said there are about 300 million  ""consumers"" of English language training in China, mainly between the ages of 20 and 40, with another 350 million children of school age offering a huge potential for further growth.

But again, those are learners, not necessarily speakers.

Mair said he agreed with Crystal about the quality of English in India as opposed to China, but also said there is credence to Huntsman’s claim.

""Countless Indians speak the most beautiful English you can imagine, but there are few Chinese who do so,"" said Mair, who estimates that each country now has around 350 million English speakers.

English translations in China are sometimes so notorious that they’ve come to be known as ""Chinglish."" One often-cited sign meant to say ""Be Careful Not to Slip and Fall,"" but it reads, ""Slip and Fall Down Carefully.""
