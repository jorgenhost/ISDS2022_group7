These video clips do not show Russia’s attack on Ukraine. They’re simulations from video games
","As Russia unleashed a full-scale attack on Ukraine, videos and images have started to flood the internet with claims that they depict devastating scenes of bombings and heavy fire throughout the eastern European country.  But while the invasion is very real, not all of these videos are authentic. ""OMG Russia just attacked Ukraine. Look at this footage,"" reads the caption of what is supposedly a live Facebook video showing a jet dodging heavy gunfire. ""Russian attacks Ukraine just now,"" reads the caption of a different Facebook video that features three seperate clips that supposedly show the attack. The last clip appears to show a barrage of missiles being launched into the air. The videos were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Both videos linked above include animated scenes taken from video games. One clip of the jet dodging heavy artillery fire comes from a simulation of a military shooter video game called Arma 3. Similar clips of the gameplay can be viewed on YouTube. The second video of the missiles has been circulating on the internet since at least December 2021 and depicts a teaser clip from a video game named ""War Thunder."" Readers and social media users should always be cautious when seeing or sharing images and videos in breaking news scenarios.   These clips aren’t real and do not show the current fighting in Ukraine.

No, a news report didn’t ‘reveal’ that doctors gave Queen Elizabeth a banned COVID-19 treatment
","An Australian news outlet’s video-editing mistake reignited persistent claims that the anti-parasitic ivermectin is an effective treatment against COVID-19. On Feb. 20, Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Elizabeth II, 95, had tested positive for COVID-19 and was experiencing ""mild coldlike symptoms.""  In its coverage of the queen’s diagnosis, Australia’s A Current Affair news program included a segment of an interview with a doctor who warned that patients in their 90s are in ""significant danger"" of the bad outcomes of COVID-19. A reporter then says: ""Dr. Mukesh Haikerwal says a COVID patient the queen’s age should be isolating and might benefit from new medicines currently approved for high-risk patients at Australian hospitals."" As the reporter is speaking, video shows two small vials of the drug Sotrovimab, then a box of Stromectol tablets, which contain ivermectin. The news video prompted some social media users to spread claims about the queen’s course of treatment. ""News report accidentally reveals doctors giving ‘banned’ COVID treatment to the Queen,"" read the headline of some posts sharing the segment.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Buckingham Palace has not provided details about the queen’s treatment, but she is believed to be fully vaccinated and boosted. The clip of the ivermectin drug was included in A Current Affair’s report ""as a result of human error,"" according to a clarification the network posted to its online story.  ""We were highlighting an approved infusion medication called Sotrovimab and the report accidentally cut to a shot of Stromectol — a product which contains ivermectin,"" the clarification said.  The network said its programs have highlighted concerns about taking ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19 and that it ""did not intend to suggest"" that Haikerwal endorsed Stromectol. ""We do not suggest the Queen is using ivermectin,"" the network also said in its clarification. Haikerwal is a Melbourne-based general practitioner and a former president of the Australian Medical Association.   Haikerwal told PolitiFact that in the A Current Affair interview, he was not speaking to the queen’s diagnosis or treatment protocol. In the TV interview, he also did not make any specific treatment recommendations for COVID-19 patients in their 90s. Claims that A Current Affair’s piece ""accidentally revealed"" that doctors had given the queen an unapproved COVID-19 treatment have been repeatedly debunked by news organizations. Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration, which assesses drug safety, provisionally approved the monoclonal antibody treatment Sotrovimab to treat COVID-19 in August 2021. In contrast, the Australian Department of Health does not recommend the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19.  ""There is not enough evidence to support the safe and effective use of these drugs (separately, or in combination) to prevent or treat COVID-19,"" it said of ivermectin, doxycycline and zinc. Ivermectin is also not listed as an available treatment for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, where the queen resides, according to the National Health Service. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration also has not approved ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19. Social media posts claimed, ""news report accidentally reveals doctors giving ‘banned’ COVID treatment to the queen."" An image of a drug containing ivermectin was erroneously included in a news report about the queen’s COVID-19 diagnosis, said the network that aired the news segment. Ivermectin is not approved to treat COVID-19 in Australia nor in the U.K. (It’s also not approved as a COVID-19 treatment in the U.S.) We found no evidence to suggest the queen has been given ivermectin to treat COVID-19.

Contrary to Youngkin, more than a 'handful' of states tax military pensions
","Gov. Glenn Youngkin recently visited the Leesburg Diner in Loudoun County to rally public support for a series of tax cuts pending in the General Assembly. One item on his agenda is cutting state income taxes on military pensions. ""We are one of only a handful of states that actually taxes our veterans’ retirement,"" Youngkin, a Republican, told the crowd on Feb. 17.  Youngkin’s press secretary, Macaulay Porter, told us the governor’s information comes from Military Benefits, a privately-run website that specializes in what its name says. We found almost identical information on another private site called The Military Wallet. Virginia is among three states that fully tax military pensions, according to the web sites. It joins California and Vermont. Another 12 states tax the retirement pay, but at reduced levels. All told, 15 states including Virginia tax military pensions in some way. That’s certainly  more than the imprecise ""handful"" Youngkin claimed. Nine states have no income tax, while 26 with the levy fully exempt military pensions.  The House and the Senate unanimously passed bills in February that would reduce - but not end - the state income tax on veteran pensions. Because the bills are different, the chambers will have to work out a compromise. The House bill follows Youngkin’s proposal to shield from taxation up to $40,000 a year in pensions. The plan would be phased in over three years, with $20,000 protected in this year and $30,000 next year. Fully implemented in 2024, the plan would save military veterans as much as $2,500 a year, depending on their other income. It would cost the state about $250 million a year. The Senate bill is less generous. It would be limited to military retirees who are at least 60 and would shield up to $20,000 from income taxes - half as much as the House. The plan would be phased in over four years. Fully implemented in 2025, it would save military retirees as much as $1,250 a year, depending on their other income. It would cost the state $122 million a year. Youngkin garbled facts when he said, ""We are one of only a handful of states that actually taxes our veterans’ retirement."" Virginia is one of three states that fully tax military pensions. Twelve more states tax the pensions at reduced rates, which is what Youngkin wants to do in Virginia. All told, 15 states tax military pensions. That’s a minority, but certainly more than the ""handful"" Youngkin describes.

No, the CDC is not collecting human DNA from COVID-19 PCR tests
","To explain what happens after a nasal swab test for COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control tweeted that ""there’s a 10% chance"" that it was sent to laboratories across the U.S. for genomic sequencing analysis.  Genomic sequencing is a process that analyzes the genetic makeup of a virus to track its spread and mutations, according to the CDC.  Some people who saw the CDC’s tweet questioned whether the agency is using a lot more personal information from the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests than it lets on. ""Largest collection of human data in history, with NO consent. Figures. Anyone else not done a single test?"" tweeted Stanton Hom, a prenatal and pediatric​​ chiropractor on Feb. 17, 2022.  Screenshots of the tweet were shared on Instagram, where they were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.) The post falsely suggested that the CDC had amassed an enormous collection of people’s DNA through the use of PCR tests.  The CDC is ""talking about sequencing the virus,"" said Dr. David Fisman, professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto. ""It has nothing to do with human genomes."" The CDC made the same point in a follow-up tweet. The ""tweet regarding genomic sequencing led some people to believe that personal identifying information was included in samples processed in the sequencing program,"" a spokesperson for the CDC told PolitiFact. ""That is not the case.""   A PCR test is used to detect genetic material from the virus, according to the Cleveland Clinic. When conducting a PCR test, a health care provider uses a swab to collect respiratory material from a person’s nose.  The sample is tested for the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. U.S. public health agencies then send a small percentage of these samples to the CDC.   The CDC then conducts genetic sequencing of these samples to identify variants, monitor their spread and track hotspots, and determine their ability to evade medical treatments and vaccines.  In the past year, the agency has used genomic sequencing of PCR tests to estimate the percentage of COVID-19 cases caused by the delta and omicron variants.  Though the swabs contain human DNA, one of the first steps in the sequencing is to isolate the coronavirus genetic material from the rest of the sample.  It is also worth noting that while genomic sequencing can be conducted on DNA, COVID-19 has ribonucleic acid, or RNA, according to the CDC.  ""This is targeted specifically to the viral RNA, and human genes are not copied or sequenced,"" said Cindy Prins, clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida. ""The end result is just the sequence of the COVID-19 genes, which allows scientists to determine what variant was in the sample."" An Instagram post said that the CDC had the ""largest collection of human data in history"" from COVID-19 PCR tests.  The post referenced a tweet from the CDC that said that a small percentage — about 10% — of PCR tests were sent to the agency to conduct genomic sequencing on the virus. Genomic sequencing is used to track the virus and its variants.  While the swab used in the PCR test would likely possess some human DNA, the sequencing is carried out on the coronavirus. One of the first steps of genomic sequencing is to isolate and extract the coronavirus genetic material from the sample.  The CDC clarified that personal identifying information is not extracted.

New Milwaukee officers maintain, not increase, police staffing
","In 2021, Milwaukee experienced 205 homicides, an uptick in gun violence, more than 10,400 car thefts and 43 reckless driving related deaths. So, it’s not surprising that the size of the city’s police force is front and center in the mayoral race – and will likely continue to be. In the Feb. 15, 2022 primary, Acting Mayor Cavalier Johnson led the field, and will face former Ald. Bob Donovan – who has struck a law-and-order theme – in the April 5 general election. In his second TV ad, released Jan. 6, 2022, Johnson declared: ""I led the fight to add 200 new police officers to make our city safer."" Is he right? Let’s start with some background on the police force, and why the number of actual officers on the force at a given time is always changing. That’s because officers retire at various points in the year, and new ones are brought on in bunches, as recruit classes finish their training. But in recent years, there has been an unmistakable downward trend. In 2019, there were an average 1,832 officers on the force. That fell to 1,738 in 2020 and then to 1,632 in 2021. As of Jan. 28, 2022, the Milwaukee Police Department had an estimated 1,629 sworn officers. On Nov. 5, 2021, the Common Council voted 13-0 to approve a $1.76 billion budget for 2022 that aimed to limit the decrease in police officer positions by authorizing 195 new recruits funded from the tax levy, not from federal funds. That budget was introduced by then-Mayor Tom Barrett and passed by the council while Barrett was still in office. The budget office was still expecting an overall decrease of about two-dozen officer positions in 2022, even with the additional 195. After the vote, when he was still presiding as Common Council president, Johnson described it this way: ""We maintained (Milwaukee Police Department) strength."" Keep that phrasing in mind as we look deeper. There are really two parts of the claim by Johnson: That he led the fight for the new officers and whether those officers can fairly be described as ""new,"" which suggests an increase in the size of the force. When we asked Johnson for backup, his campaign adviser, Sachin Chheda, cited two things: The 195 officers added in the budget and an additional 30 hired through what is known as a COPS grant – federal money that was meant to bring on new officers to facilitate the reassignment of experienced officers to task forces related to a federal program to address violent crime. The 2020 COPS Hiring Program Grant – a three-year grant that provides 30 new police officers – went through a drawn-out legislative process between 2020 and 2021. The file failed when it was before the Common Council, but it was then reconsidered and approved and later signed by Barrett on Jan. 19, 2021. While Johnson was not the sponsor – the Barrett-administration was – he consistently voted in favor of the grant while it was in front of the Common Council. As for the 195 officers, those, too, were requested by Barrett. He proposed spending $6 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds for the three recruit classes instead of putting the cost on the tax levy. Johnson put forward legislation during the ARPA deliberations and the subsequent fall budget process to fund the 195 officer positions in 2022. Said Chheda: ""Without his leadership, the city would have seen more than 200 fewer officers on the street. He will continue to address public safety as his top priority in the weeks and months to come."" So, Johnson played an important role in assuring funding for the recruit classes. But in the TV ad, viewers may be left with the impression the size of the force increased, since it talks about ""new"" officers ""to make our city safer."" And the bottom line is that the measure will maintain the department’s strength, not increase it. In a TV ad, Johnson claimed that he ""led the fight to add 200 new police officers to make our city safer."" Johnson played an important role in the approval of 195 recruits, as well as the officers covered by the 2020 COPS grant. But based on expected retirements, those recruits will simply maintain the department’s size, not increase it.

Marjorie Taylor Greene falsely claims Ukraine was ‘No. 1 donor’ to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign
","Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., falsely claimed that when Hillary Clinton was running for president against former President Donald Trump, Ukraine was her top donor. Greene’s remarks came before a rally for a congressional candidate in Texas, where she toggled between attacks on Democrats and critiques of the media. ""They would rather talk about Russia, Russia, Russia, and Ukraine, and talk about possible war, than talk about the real truth that Ukraine — don’t forget this — Ukraine was the No. 1 donor to Hillary Clinton when she was running for president,"" Greene said Feb. 19 in comments captured by Right Side Broadcasting Network, a right-wing website known for streaming Trump’s events.  That’s not the real truth. The claim about Clinton was part of a torrent of falsehoods from Greene that also included inaccurate claims that the southern U.S. border is ""wide open""; that President Joe Biden has ""dementia""; and that Clinton and her campaign ""hacked into the White House and spied on the president of the United States."" Clinton did not report receiving any campaign donations from the Ukrainian government or Ukrainian nationals during her bid for president in 2016, said Anna Massoglia, the editorial and investigations manager at OpenSecrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks money in politics.  ""Such contributions are illegal under federal law,"" said Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine. The law prohibits contributions, donations, expenditures and disbursements from foreign nationals in connection with any U.S. election. OpenSecrets’ website shows the actual top donations made to Clinton’s campaign, as well as a breakdown of donations by geographic location. The breakdown shows that all the locations are in the U.S.  Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Sept. 8, 2016. (AP) In an emailed response to PolitiFact’s inquiry, Greene spokesperson Nick Dyer did not cite any donations that Ukraine’s government or Ukrainian nationals made to Clinton’s campaign.  Instead, he cited a 2015 chart from the Wall Street Journal that dealt with donations to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit organization founded by former President Bill Clinton. But the donations listed in that chart were not from the Ukrainian government, and they did not happen while Hillary Clinton was running for president against Trump. The chart was part of an article examining ""large donors to the Clinton Foundation"" in the years after Hillary Clinton became former President Barack Obama’s secretary of state in 2009.  The graphic mapped individual contributions of more than $50,000 that foreign donors sent to the Clinton Foundation between 1999 and 2014, grouped by nationality. It showed people of Ukrainian nationality contributing at least $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, more than any other nationality. Helping push Ukraine to the top of that list were donations between 2009 and 2013 from a foundation created by Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian steel mogul and former parliamentarian. Those contributions accounted for at least $8.6 million, the Journal reported at the time.  But misinterpretations of the graphic inspired a flurry of misinformation in 2019 and again in 2020, as Trump was impeached in the House for conduct related to Ukraine. Conservative websites and social media posts wrongly claimed that the Ukrainian government threw millions of dollars at the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton worked in the Obama administration. As FactCheck.org, Snopes and PolitiFact reported, the Wall Street Journal chart ranked the top donations by nationality — not by foreign governments.  ""A false meme from 2019 asserted that the Clinton Foundation received $10 million from the government of Ukraine,"" the Clinton Foundation press office told PolitiFact for this fact-check.  ""The Clinton Foundation has never received any funding from the government of Ukraine."" The time span covered in the chart also ended the year before Clinton announced the launch of her 2016 presidential campaign on April 12, 2015. So the chart Greene’s spokesperson cited doesn’t support her claim about donations while Clinton was running for president. Greene said, ""Ukraine was the No. 1 donor to Hillary Clinton when she was running for president."" Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign did not report any donations from Ukraine or Ukrainian nationals — a move that would have broken the law. Asked for evidence to support Greene’s claim, the congresswoman’s spokesperson did not cite any campaign donations. He pointed instead to a Wall Street Journal chart that mapped large individual donations between 1999 and 2014 to the Clinton Foundation, a nonprofit organization. The chart was a ranking of the top foreign donors by nationality, not contributions from foreign governments.  The Clinton Foundation said it has never received any funding from the Ukrainian government.

Maria Shriver: 2 in 3 U.S. families 'rely on the mother's income to stay above the poverty level'
","What better way to honor moms on Mother’s Day than to mark how much they do to keep the country on even keel. On Meet the Press, NBC correspondent Maria Shriver tried to underscore the pivotal economic role mothers play. ""Two-thirds of American families rely on the mother's income to stay above the poverty level,"" Shriver told host Chuck Todd, as a graphic highlighted the same message. That’s a powerful message -- that two in three American families would fall below the federal poverty line if it weren't for Mom. Unfortunately, it’s incorrect. Shriver botched the wording of a different stat from the Shriver Report, a regular publication focused largely on the status of women. For the 2014 edition, Shriver partnered with the liberal Center for American Progress. That report claimed that ""In an era when women have solidified their position as half of the U.S. workforce and a whopping two-thirds of the primary or co-breadwinners in American families, the reality is that a third of all American women are living at or near a space we call ‘the brink of poverty.’ "" That passage may sound like it supports Shriver’s point. But it doesn’t. So what's the real number? We asked Philip Cohen, who researches inequality and families at the University of Maryland, to see if he could find the actual percentage of families who rely on a mother’s income to stay above the poverty level. Using Census Bureau data from the March 2014 Current Population Survey and comparing it to poverty threshold statistics, Cohen identified 33.6 million U.S. families that included at least one child and a mother. In 6.7 million of those households, the mother’s income was vital in the way Shriver stated. That’s a shade under 20 percent -- far from two in three. ""You could say 20 percent of families with mothers and children rely on the mother’s income to remain above the poverty line,"" Cohen said. ""The rest either were poor already, 16 percent, or still wouldn’t be poor even without the mother’s income, 64 percent, because of income from the father or other family members."" Cohen tried a slightly different approach and started just with the families that were not in poverty, which created a pool of 28.2 million households. That would boost the percentage of families who rely on a mother’s income to stay out of poverty to about 24 percent. ""I don’t see how you can get to 67 percent, or two-thirds, as Shriver said,"" Cohen told us. Cohen agreed with Shriver’s main point -- that mothers in many families make a huge difference in the family’s standard of living -- but said she got the specific statistic wrong. After contacting Shriver, she tweeted a correction. Shriver wrote, ""Clarifying what I said on @meetthepress: 2/3 of U.S. families rely on a mother's income that keeps many families out of poverty, but not all."" Our ruling Shriver said that for two-thirds of families with children, the mother’s income keeps them out of poverty. According to an analysis of Census Bureau data, the actual figure is closer to one-fourth. The mother’s income matters, but not to the extent she said. An expert said there was a grain of truth to Shriver’s claim -- a mother’s income makes a big difference in a family’s standard of living -- but not at the percentage Shriver said.

"['Education', 'Wisconsin', 'Katrina Shankland']","
Democrat says Republicans cut three school budgets in a row
","When new tax revenue failed to materialize during budget deliberations, Democrats in the state Legislature reminded voters that majority Republicans had pledged to backfill some of Gov. Scott Walker’s cuts to public education. ""Now Republican legislators must answer to the people of Wisconsin: Where is the money they promised and why are our public schools last in line?"" asked state Rep. Katrina Shankland, D-Stevens Point, who is assistant Democratic leader. ""Republicans have already cut our neighborhood public schools three budgets in a row,"" Shankland said in a news release on May 6, 2015. ""They’ve perpetrated the largest cut to public education in our state’s history while funneling millions of public dollars into unaccountable private schools."" That’s a lot to chew on. In 2012 we rated True a claim by Democrat Kathleen Falk that in his first two-year budget, Scott Walker enacted ""the biggest cuts to education in our state’s history."" That claim covered both kindergarten-12th grade schools and the public university system. But experts said Walker’s K-12 cuts were the biggest ever. Now we’ll rate Shankland’s claim that ""Republicans have already cut our neighborhood public schools three budgets in a row."" It’s clear she meant Walker’s first two budgets, plus the proposed 2015-’17 budget that legislators are still working on: Republicans have controlled the Legislature and governor’s office since Walker’s election in 2010. Asked to back up the claim, Shankland aide Annika Petty explained that according to the office’s calculations, Walker and fellow Republicans have cut general state aid to local schools by $1.4 billion under the 2011-’13 and 2013-’15 enacted budgets plus the governor’s proposed 2015-’17 plan. She gets that number by comparing the funding level before Walker’s arrival to that in each of the six years since, and adding up the difference. The funding, in each of those six years, is lower than the amount from the last pre-Walker budget year, 2010-'11. So in that sense, Republicans have come up short of the Doyle mark in each of the last three budgets (though the outcome of the current budget is pending). But there’s another much more common way to view this: Looking at how each budget compares to the final year of the previous budget. That’s typically the framework legislators use during budget deliberations. Each new budget uses the expiring budget as a starting point. Walker’s first enacted budget cut general aids by 8 percent compared to the pre-Walker base year. But the second budget enacted under Walker actually added back some of the cuts. Funding went up 2 percent over the first Republican budget. In the third, pending budget, there’s a 2.6 percent increase over the previous budget. So by the typical way of looking at budgets in Madison, Republicans have cut once and added back twice. (Two notes: Doyle cut general school funding in his last budget, breaking with decades of increases. And general-aid trends vary by school district. In the last four years, between 56 percent and 97 percent of school districts saw aid reductions from 2011 to 2013. In 2014, that trend flipped; a bare majority saw increases). Budget watchers with the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research organization, said Shankland’s method overstate the cuts because of the way it takes a base year and compares it to six subsequent years. Todd Berry, president of the group, also noted that some of Walker’s Act 10 law resulted in significant savings for many school districts, helping to offset some or all of the cuts. But Berry said the aid money Republicans added back might not have mattered in many cases because the state placed tight limits on what school districts could raise in total from property taxes and state aid. Finally, we note that Shankland focused on general state aid, but school officials say that Walker’s pending budget would cut a more crucial form of special-purpose aid (categorical aids, in Madison parlance) over the two years from 2015-'17. Our rating Shankland claimed that ""Republicans have already cut our neighborhood public schools three budgets in a row."" There’s an element of truth in her claim in that general school aid is lower in Walker’s proposed third budget than it was before he took office. But it’s misleading to say three budgets ""in a row"" made cuts, when two of them actually restored some of the general aid lost in Walker’s first budget. We rate Shankland’s claim Mostly  False.",/factchecks/2015/may/11/katrina-shankland/democrat-says-republicans-cut-three-school-budgets/
"['Social Security', 'Virginia', 'Mark Warner']","
Warner says millions of Social Security numbers still active for people 112 or older
","People die, but their Social Security numbers often linger on. So says U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who recently introduced a bill that would require the Social Security Administration to do a better job of tracking the departed to make sure their federal benefits don’t survive. ""The SSA (Social Security Administration’s) Office of the Inspector General reported last month that, according to the agency’s own records, there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older,"" Warner said in an April 23 news release. That’s more than twice the of population of Chicago -- filled with people at least 112. It’s especially remarkable when you consider that the Gerontology Research Group says it knew of 42 people in the world who were alive last October at 112 or older. Fifteen of them lived in the U.S. The immortal Social Security numbers, Warner said, open avenues for fraudulent benefit claims. We wondered whether the senator’s Social Security figures were correct. Warner’s office pointed us to a March 4 report issued by Patrick O’Carroll Jr., the Social Security Administration’s inspector general. O’Carroll testified about the agency’s death records during a March 16 hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He stated that the agency maintains an electronic record on each person given a Social Security number and is supposed to update it when they die so their number can no longer be used. The agency gets its death information from a variety of sources, such as family members, funeral homes and financial institutions. It maintains a ""Death Master File"" with nearly 90 million electronic records that’s shared with other federal agencies to prevent erroneous benefits and sold to credit reporting companies to guard against fraud. Sometimes the Social Security Administration prematurely declares people dead, as recently reported on CBS’ 60 Minutes, causing bureaucratic nightmares when those people try to open bank accounts or do myriad other things requiring a valid Social Security number. The agency’s internal auditor found in 2008 that 20,000 people had been wrongly listed as dead. And sometimes the opposite is true, O'Carroll said in his testimony, and the agency fails to take away Social Security numbers from the dead -- even when  the agency has been informed of the deaths. It all came to a head a few years ago when O'Carroll’s office learned that a bank reported that a man had opened accounts using the Social Security numbers of two different people -- one born in 1886 and the other in 1893. The auditors did a little research and found that the world’s oldest living man at the time was 112. So they chose the age as the entry point of their investigation. The auditors indeed found, as Warner claimed, that 6.5 million cardholders were listed in Social Security records as being at least 112. All but about 100,000 of the numbers were issued prior to 1972, when the agency started using electronic records. The good news is that the auditors found no instances of people illegally collecting Social Security through one of these old numbers. The bad news is that the potential for abuse is high and, according to the report, ""thousands"" of the numbers ""could have been used"" to commit other types of identity fraud. Auditors found that 66,920 of the numbers had been used by people for whom the government received wage reports from 2006 and 2011. One of the numbers appeared on 613 different wage reports. That means people were using the numbers in job applications and 3,873 of the numbers turned up in E-Verify inquiries, an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine whether potential hirees are entitled by immigration laws to work in the U.S. Final notes: If you’re wondering, the verified oldest person in the world at this writing is Jeralean Talley of Michigan, whose 116th birthday is on May 23.  The oldest man is Sakari Momoi of Japan, who turned 112 in February. The verified oldest person ever was Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at 122 years, 164 days old. The oldest man was Christian Mortensen of Denmark, who died in 1998 at 115 years, 252 days. Our ruling Warner said the Social Security Administration’s Inspector General found ""there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older."" The audit Warner cites indeed found that there are an implausible 6.5 million active Social Security numbers belonging to people who would be at least 112.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Economy', 'Carly Fiorina']","
Carly Fiorina fights back against HP layoff claims, says she doubled size of company
","Carly Fiorina is fighting back against critics, including a cyber-squatter, who accuse the Republican presidential candidate of slash-and-burn tactics in her time as CEO of computer company Hewlett-Packard. The cyber-squatter purchased the website carlyfiorina.org to highlight nearly 30,000 layoffs that occured while Fiorina led the computer giant from 1999-2005. Fiorina later was fired by HP’s board. On Meet the Press Sunday, host Chuck Todd asked Fiorina why she was fired. Fiorina used the question to list her accomplishments at HP. ""What people fail to comment on is the fact we doubled the size of the company, took the growth rate from 2 percent to 9 percent,"" she said. ""We tripled the rate of innovation to 11 patents a day and went from lagging behind to leading in every product category. We grew jobs here in the U.S. and all over the world. You can't just leave those facts out -- they are as vital to the record as the fact that yes, indeed, I had to make tough calls during tough times. Tough times that many technology companies didn't survive at all."" Given Fiorina’s dismissal and other issues at HP, we were interested in that first claim -- that under her leadership, the company doubled in size.  Fiorina's claim is not referring to the number of employees (you can read a good primer on that from our archives here). In this case, staff at Carly for America (Fiorina’s political action committee) said she was referring to the revenues created by the company. By this specific measure, HP did double. In 1999, when Fiorina became CEO, HP’s annual revenue was $42.4 billion, according to annual Securities and Exchange Commission filings. With the exception of a slight dip in 2001 (at the end of the dot-com bubble), revenue increased each year -- to $86.7 billion in 2005, the year she left. That’s a little bit more than double. But that doesn’t tell the entire tale. There are a few critical caveats. Where the growth came from Why such growth? Well, Fiorina spearheaded a major $25 billion acquisition of HP’s rival, Compaq, to increase the company’s share of the personal computer market. The merger was publicly controversial, in part because it tipped HP’s focus toward computers (a tough market) and away from its most successful product, printers. The merger went through, and the company grew. In 2001, the year before the merger, revenue was $45.7 billion, and the Compaq revenue was about $40 billion. In 2003, after the two companies merged, revenue was $73 billion. Stephen Morrissette, a business professor at the University of Chicago, noted that the fact that so much of the revenue growth was a result of the merger casts some shade on Fiorina’s claim. ""Most executives would likely not use the phrasing ‘doubled the size of the company’ to describe their performance if the increase was all or mostly due to an acquisition,"" Morrissette said. Doubled revenues, but not necessarily stronger Despite the increased revenue, the HP-Compaq merger led to sluggish stock prices and missed profitability targets. The merger also led to the thousands of firings often cited by Fiorina’s critics. The merger was widely seen as a bust at the time, and it contributed to the HP board’s decision to fire Fiorina. (HP stock value plunged by nearly half during her tenure and rose again after she was fired.) HP had $42.4 billion in revenues and $3.1 billion in net earnings in 1999. When Fiorina was ousted in 2005, yes, the company reported $86.7 billion in sales. But that year HP had only $2.4 billion in earnings. Lastly, the employee head count gets a bit complicated. According to SEC filings, HP had 84,400 employees worldwide in 2001, the year before the merger. In 2001, Compaq had 63,700 full-time employees. That comes to a total of 148,100 workers. In 2005, just after her departure, HP's worldwide workforce reached 150,000. That includes acquiring some other companies, the Los Angeles Times reported. Some analysts have seen the merger more favorably in recent years, noting that it accomplished Fiorina’s goal of increasing HP’s share of the personal computer market even though Fiorina’s execution failed. Fiorina ""is taking credit for something she launched and got started,"" Charles House, co-author of The HP Phenomenon, told the San Jose Mercury News in 2011. ""But I think you obviously have to give a hell of a lot of credit to (her successor) for making it successful. I'd be loath to say it would be the same with her there."" Our ruling Fiorina said that while she was CEO of HP, the size of the company ""doubled."" That's correct when discussing one specific aspect, revenues, but you could argue that's a bit of a red herring. The revenue growth was largely thanks to a controversial merger with Compaq and not organic. Moreover, the new revenue did not come with proportional increases to either profits or the number of HP jobs. Fiorina’s figures are accurate, but standing alone, they don’t tell the whole picture. We rate her claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/may/10/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-fights-back-against-hp-layoff-claims/

Lincoln Chafee says, as R.I. governor, only four states had bigger drops in unemployment rate
","Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee went on CNN April 12 after announcing that he was thinking about running for president. CNN’s Dana Bash was ready for him. After some discussion about issues such as the second war in Iraq and the shrinking middle class, Bash noted that Chafee had left office after only one term with an approval rating of just 25 percent. Then she asked: ""If you have that kind of low standing in your own state, how are you going to get support around the country?"" Chafee talked about the ""tough times"" that Rhode Island faced when he took office. And he said ""every little thing was difficult"" as he attempted to turn Rhode Island around by, in part, doing unpopular things like raising taxes and hiking beach fees. ""But, at the end, and that’s why I’m running, Rhode Island is better off,"" he said. ""We had the biggest drop of unemployment, the rate of unemployment, of all but four states. That’s a great record of accomplishment."" We wondered if Rhode Island had experienced the ""biggest drop of unemployment ... of all but four states"" during Chafee's tenure. But first we had to pin down the time period he was referring to. Chafee’s spokeswoman, Debbie Rich, told us that the time period was from January 2011, when Chafee took office, through February 2015, covering the most recent unemployment report at the time of the CNN interview. And she pointed us to the unemployment rates for those months. Rhode Island’s unemployment rate for January 2011 was 11.2 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate for February 2015, a preliminary number subject to change, was 6.3 percent when Chafee spoke. So the difference between the higher rate and the lower one – the way Rich indicated that Chafee chose to figure the change – is 4.9 percentage points. (He could have, and maybe should have, measured the improvement as a percentage, but we’ll get to that later.) So how did that drop of 4.9 percentage points compare with other states?   Only three other states, not four, had a bigger percentage point drop during the same time period, according to the numbers on file at the bureau as of April 20. Two other states also had declines of 4.9 percentage points. So with that timeframe, Chafee would have been correct to say: ""We had the biggest drop of unemployment, the rate of unemployment, of all but three states."" Ok, so Chafee was off a bit. But there's more than one way to gauge the drop in unemployment. Instead of looking at the percentage point drop, you can calculate and compare the change as a percentage. We asked URI economist Leonard Lardaro, a leading expert on the condition of the Rhode Island economy, which method was better.   Lardaro says it is more legitimate to calculate and compare Rhode Island’s improvement as a percentage. That’s because Rhode Island had one of the highest unemployment rates to begin with, and therefore, improvements in percentage points are easier to come by. As a percentage, Rhode Island’s drop from 11.2 percent to 6.3 percent is an improvement of 44 percent. That's pretty good. But 12 other states did better. By that measure, Chafee was way off. During his appearance on CNN, Chafee didn't specify how he was calculating his statistic, leaving his statement open for interpretation. Calculated in percentage points, Rhode Island’s ranking was better than he said. Calculated as a percentage, it was worse. Because his statement contains some element of truth, if looked at one way, but falls apart if viewed in a different way, we rate it Mostly False.

"['New Hampshire', 'Financial Regulation', 'Jeb Bush']","
Jeb Bush says he met NH man who founded only U.S. bank since Dodd-Frank
","At an appearance in Concord in mid-April, former Florida governor Jeb Bush talked banking -- and the legislation meant to reform it. ""On my last trip to New Hampshire I think I met the guy who founded the first and only bank since Dodd-Frank passed, since the financial crisis,"" Bush said at his speech at Saint Anselm College’s Politics and Eggs event April 17. ""One bank in the country."" The banking reform legislation known as Dodd-Frank became law on July 21, 2010, nearly five years ago. We decided to look into Bush’s statement that only one bank had been founded since that time. We checked with Bush’s camp and according to spokesman Matt Gorman, Bush met with businessman Bill Grenier when he was in the state March 14. Greiner, of Bedford, filed last year with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to charter an entirely new bank named Primary Bank. ""We’re going against the grain, and we’re okay with that because we see a need,"" he told the Wall Street Journal in December. So would Primary Bank be the nation’s ""first and only"" since Dodd-Frank? Not exactly. Depending on the data set you choose, it’s either the second, fourth, ninth or 20th. The Journal  and other media sources have said the first bank founded after the law’s passage is in fact the Bank of Bird-in-Hand, Pa. It mainly serves the area’s Amish community. And yes, it includes a drive-through window for horse-and-buggy. This was included in the information forwarded to us by Bush’s spokesman. But we decided to ask the FDIC itself. Greg Hernandez, an agency spokesman, offered further details. First, off, when Bush and others talk about new banks, they’re referring to de novo banks, or banks issued a new charter by the agency. Not counting Grenier’s startup, the FDIC actually lists three banks issued charters since 2010. The oldest, Lakeside Bank of Lake Charles, La., had its charter approved in October 2009, before Dodd-Frank’s passage. But the charter wasn’t consummated until late July 2010, after the bill was signed into law. The next bank on the FDIC’s list is Start Community Bank of New Haven, Conn. While its charter was approved in December 2010, the bank itself says its origins date to 2004, with the founding of its parent company. The Bird-in-Hand bank’s charter was both approved and consummated in November 2013. It seems fair to call Primary Bank the second of all-new bank approved by the FDIC since Dodd Frank’s passage. But if you include the two others that the agency itself lists, Primary Bank would come in fourth. The FDIC lists five other banks as having been established since mid-2010, including one in Kansas City, Mo.; Brockton, Mass,; and Easley, S.C., according to Hernandez. These banks, however, didn’t apply for new charters. ""Other banks can be established through a shelf charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,"" Hernandez wrote in an e-mail. ""That would be when a private equity group purchases a failed bank. Also, (newly) established banks can be the result of a merger or acquisition."" If you use that criteria, and include the five other banks mentioned, Primary Bank would be the ninth bank started after Dodd-Frank. And finally, while they’re not called banks and are regulated by a different agency, consumers generally see credit unions as the equivalent of banks (and credit unions are affected by the law, too). According to John Fairbanks of the National Credit Union Administration, there have been at least 11 credit union charters approved since the start of 2011. That would make Primary Bank at least the 14th and at most the 20th such institution started since Dodd Frank overhauled the banking industry. None of these different contexts would make Grenier’s bank the first one established since the passage of Dodd-Frank. And there’s the implication that new banks aren’t being created because of Dodd-Frank, which raises the question: What does the law actually do, and why is it important? The full name of the law is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and it passed on July 15, 2010. President Obama signed it into law on July 21. While the financial crisis mentioned by Bush predated the law by a couple of years, Dodd-Frank itself has been fiercely criticized by Republicans, who say it stifles growth in the financial sector. The law itself was meant to prevent another financial meltdown like that of 2008-9. According to an overview from CNBC, the law was meant to avoid banks becoming ""too big to fail,"" regulate risky trading and created new oversight bodies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The banking industry blames the law, in part, for the lack of new banks. Frank Keating, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, criticized government regulations on the financial sector in a recent column for The Hill. After mentioning the New Hampshire bank, he gets down to business. ""Investors are reluctant to shoulder the cumulative regulatory burdens -- both from new laws and from a more stringent approach by regulators themselves -- and the rising legal risks associated with running a bank these days."" Keating doesn’t mention Dodd-Frank by name, but the implication is clear. He also highlights the dropoff of bank creation post-2010, pointing out that ""the average from 2002 to 2008 was closer to 100"" per year. According to a Motley Fool explainer piece, ""between 1990 and 2006, the FDIC approved an average of 152 bank and thrift charters a year."" That being said, there isn’t universal agreement that regulation is behind the drop in new bank creation. Keating acknowledges that in his column, noting toward the end that ""the low interest rate environment is challenging for bank startups. And the number of banks has been steadily falling for decades due to a wave of mergers and acquisitions."" According to a report from the Richmond Federal Reserve bank, there could be several factors at work. One is the Federal Reserve’s policy of keeping interest rates low. That lowers interest rates overall, making it harder for banks to earn money. (The Motley Fool suggests that’s the main reason for the drop.) The research raises the possibility that the cost of complying with regulations has gone up, but says ""it is unclear"" whether that is driving down the creation of new banks. Finally, though, it mentions that the FDIC itself has changed its policies for new banks, in a move that predates the passage of Dodd-Frank. ""In 2009 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation increased the length of time -- from three to seven years -- during which newly insured depository institutions are subject to higher capital requirements and more frequent examinations,"" the paper’s authors write. Our ruling Former Florida governor Jeb Bush said ""I met the guy who founded the first and only bank since Dodd-Frank passed, since the financial crisis. One bank in the country."" He’s certainly got a point that there has been a sharp dropoff of newly chartered banks since Dodd-Frank became law in the summer of 2010, but it’s incorrect to say Primary Bank would be the first in the country. There is at least one other in the nation, and possibly several more. It is certainly the first bank chartered in New Hampshire during that time. The suggestion that Dodd-Frank has caused the drop-off in new bank formation is also debatable. While regulation has perhaps played a role, FDIC policies set before the law’s passage may have had a more direct effect.

No gender identity protection in Wisconsin anti-discrimination law, Democratic chair candidate says
","On June 6, 2015, delegates attending the Wisconsin Democratic Party’s annual convention will elect a chairman to succeed Mike Tate, who is stepping down after six years. The youngest of the five candidates is 28-year-old Jason Rae of Milwaukee -- who, at 17, was the youngest person ever elected to the Democratic National Committee. In an interview on April 21, 2015, Wisconsin Eye host Steve Walters asked Rae, who is gay, if it is a victory for the Democratic Party that ""Wisconsin and the nation have made so much progress""  on same-sex issues. ""I don’t think it’s a problem -- I think it’s a real step forward -- but there's a lot of work yet to be done when you look at LGBT issues,"" said Rae, referring to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. ""You know, we were one of the first states that actually had a non-discrimination ordinance statewide, but it only protected members of the gay and lesbian community; it doesn't protect members of the ‘trans’ community.""    We wondered: Under Wisconsin law, gay, lesbian and bisexual people are protected from discrimination, but not people who are transgender? Transgender explained Transgender, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality, is a broad term for people whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth. A transgender man, for example, refers to a transgender individual who currently identifies as a man. Transsexual, according to the center, is an ""older term for people whose gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth who seeks to transition from male to female or female to male. Many do not prefer this term because it is thought to sound overly clinical."" The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not attempt to count the number of Americans who identify themselves as transgender. An estimate made in 2011, by an expert in LGBT demography at UCLA Law School, put the figure at nearly 700,000, or 0.3 percent of the population. The laws We’ll start our analysis by noting that we have rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison. He said Wisconsin, in 1982, became the first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. That article noted that the law leaves out transgender people. The District of Columbia and 18 states -- including Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa -- have laws that ""clearly prohibit discrimination against transgender people,"" according to the American Civil Liberties Union. By comparison, a map produced by the National Center for Transgender Equality says Wisconsin is among states with laws that protect against discrimination based on sex (gender) or on sexual orientation but don’t have clear protections for gender identity.   We consulted four experts: Larry DuPuis, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin; Rick Esenberg, president and general counsel of the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a conservative, libertarian public interest law firm; Marquette University law professor Paul Secunda, who directs the law school’s labor and employment law program; and attorney Gordon Leech, who heads the civil rights and liberties section of the State Bar of Wisconsin. Here was the consensus: 1. Wisconsin statutes that prohibit discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation in three areas -- employment, housing and public accommodation -- do not expressly include transgender people. (According to Leech, Milwaukee and Madison include gender identity in ordinances that prohibit discrimination in all three areas. Milwaukee County and Dane County include gender identity in housing and employment discrimination ordinances; and Appleton includes gender identity in its fair housing ordinance.) 2. That means that -- unlike gay men, for example, who have a right to file a complaint alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation -- it’s unknown whether a Wisconsin state court would accept complaints from transgender people alleging discrimination based on their transgender status. 3. Instead, a transgender person would have to persuade a judge that transgender people are covered either by state laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex or on sexual orientation. 4. To date, there has not been a published decision by a state judge in Wisconsin stating that transgender people are covered by those anti-discrimination laws. Our rating Rae said Wisconsin's non-discrimination law ""doesn't protect members of the transgender community."" It’s unclear whether a transgender person could pursue in state court a discrimination case using laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex (gender) or on sexual orientation. What is clear is Wisconsin laws do not expressly prohibit discrimination based on a person’s status as transgender.   We rate Rae’s statement True.

Rick Perry flip-flops on support for Export-Import Bank
","In 2014, Rick Perry urged Congress to keep afloat the federal Export-Import Bank. In May 2015, he said let it die. Cue the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter. Perry in 2014 As noted in a June 27, 2014, Dallas Morning News blog post, Perry sent a letter to congressional leaders that month urging them to continue the bank, which was then set to lose its authorization unless members embraced President Barack Obama’s request to extend it. The News’ story pointed out that Republicans were divided on reauthorization: Some seeking to limit the government’s role in the economy on ideological grounds were pitted against those who sought to preserve programs they said help grow the economy. The story quoted Barney Keller of the conservative Club for Growth group saying that like the Small Business Administration and its loans to small businesses, the bank inserts the government into the economy in ways it shouldn’t. ""The Ex-Im Bank is corporate welfare, simple as that,"" he said. ""It should be eliminated."" In contrast, the story said, supporters of reauthorization maintained that  ending the bank would put large U.S. exporters, especially, at a disadvantage with their foreign counterparts. The bank says its mission is to ""ensure that U.S. companies — large and small — have access to the financing they need to turn export opportunities into sales. Ex-Im Bank does not compete with private institutions,"" the bank says, going on: ""We fill gaps in the trade finance market by working with lenders and brokers to ensure that U.S. businesses get what they need to sell abroad and be competitive in international markets."" Perry said in his June 25, 2014, letter to Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate that as governor of ""America’s leading exporting state I encourage you to reauthorize"" the bank. ""I understand some are concerned about this bank, but if there are ways to improve the program by making it more transparent, I would encourage you to do so as part of the reauthorization,"" Perry wrote. ""To unilaterally disarm by not reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank puts American companies at a disadvantage in their ability to compete in the global marketplace, will cost jobs and will drive up prices for American-made goods,"" Perry said. Perry in 2015 Nearly a year later, Perry swiveled. In an op-ed column published by the Wall Street Journal, which came to our attention in a May 5, 2015, Texas Tribune news story, Perry said he ""can't get on board"" with reauthorizing the charter for the 80-year-old bank. The bank was set to shutter if Congress didn’t reauthorize it by July 2015. Perry's piece--headlined: ""Why I’m Changing My Mind and Opposing the Ex-Im Bank""--credited the bank with playing a role in igniting the Texas economy in his time as governor. Since 2007, he wrote, more than 1,200 Texas companies had obtained help from Ex-Im in financing more than $24 billion in exports. Perry also recalled his gubernatorial concern about unilateral disarmament, economically speaking, but then went on to say he could no longer back the bank out of concern for ""revelations of corruption and bribery at the institution"" involving an official pleading guilty to accepting bribes, among factors. He also questioned the bank subsidizing exports by big corporations. ""We won’t have the moral credibility to reduce corporate taxes if we continue to subsidize corporate exports for corporations that already enjoy low effective tax rates, like General Electric and Boeing,"" Perry wrote. ""We won’t have the moral credibility to reform government programs that benefit future retirees if we don’t first reform government programs that benefit big businesses like Caterpillar. We won’t be able to give businesses more regulatory latitude if we continue to operate a government bank with an emerging record of corporate corruption."" Perry closed: ""We could pair Ex-Im’s retirement with corporate tax reform—a more effective way to improve the competitiveness of U.S. companies. We should work with our partners in the World Trade Organization to roll back the use of export-import banks by other countries, so that American exporters don’t face an unfair playing field."" We emailed aides to Perry about his shift and didn't hear back. Our ruling Full change in position? On the Flip-O-Meter, that’s a FULL FLOP! UPDATE, May 8, 2015: We updated this article to quote directly from Perry's May 2015 oped column.

Hillary Clinton says 'not one' GOP presidential contender backs path to citizenship
","During a visit to a school in Nevada, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton positioned herself as an uncompromising advocate for immigration -- and in the process, she took a shot at the Republican presidential field for not joining her. ""This is where I differ with everybody on the Republican side,"" Clinton said during the May 5, 2015, event. ""Make no mistake: Not a single Republican candidate, announced or potential, is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. Not one. When they talk about legal status, that is code for second-class status."" We wondered whether Clinton was correct. So we took a look closer look at where the GOP field stands on the issue. We’ll start by noting that Clinton made some careful word choices here. First, she explicitly distinguishes between eventual ""citizenship"" and a grant of ""legal status."" While those concepts are similar, they are not identical. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two is that citizens would be able to vote, while people with legalized status would not. Second, Clinton emphasized that she’s referring to Republican candidates who have ""clearly and consistently"" articulated support for a path to citizenship. That means she is discounting those who may have said they support citizenship on one or two occasions but have since stopped saying it or have said other things that would seem to undermine their commitment to that position. We found that the other Republican candidates and potential candidates generally fell into one of three categories. 1. Those who unambiguously support a path to citizenship We quickly found one exception to Clinton’s formulation: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who isn’t officially in the race but has said he's likely to run. Graham -- who had been a leading Republican supporter of the ""Gang of Eight"" immigration legislation that passed the Senate but died in the House -- ""has been clear about … his support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants that includes registering with the government, paying fines, learning English and undergoing background checks,"" Brittany Bramell, spokesperson for Security Through Strength, a pro-Graham group. 2. Those who have never supported a path to citizenship Some GOP candidates or potential candidates do not appear to have ever explicitly articulated support for a path for citizenship. This list includes Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, former CEO Carly Fiorina, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. 3. Those who have expressed support for a path to citizenship but have since reversed themselves or expressed ambiguous views. • Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. In 2013, Walker was asked by the Wausau Daily Herald, ""Can you envision a world where, with the right penalties and waiting periods and meet the requirements, where those people could get citizenship?"" He answered, ""Sure. Yeah. I mean, I think it makes sense."" But in February 2015, Walker backed away from that stance, first on ABC’s This Week and then, on March 1, 2015, in an interview with Fox News Sunday, when he said, ""My view has changed. I'm flat out saying it. … Candidates can say that. Sometimes they don't."" When Fox’s Chris Wallace asked, ""So, you've changed from 2013?"" Walker said, ""Absolutely."" • Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Huckabee seemed to support citizenship during a book tour in January 2015. ""I don’t believe that it is a just thing to punish someone who had nothing to do with the breaking of the law. What I want to do is see what can we do to put that person in a position where they do abide by the law and become a citizen,"" Huckabee said. ""I would like that person to become a very generous tax-paying citizen rather than somebody who is going to take taxes away from the rest of us."" However, this does not go as far as Clinton’s position, and on other occasions, Huckabee has framed himself more of a critic of immigration. ""A country that does not have secure borders is really not a country anymore,"" he said at the Iowa Agricultural Summit in March 2015. • New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. In 2010, Christie said on ABC’s This Week that ""the president and the Congress have to step up to the plate. They have to secure our borders, and they have to put forward a commonsense path to citizenship for people."" But appearing on This Week in 2013, Christie sidestepped repeated questions about whether he still held the same view, saying, ""I don’t get to make those determinations."" • Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Jindal wrote in 2013 that ""for folks who came here illegally but are willing to gain proficiency in English, pay a fine, and demonstrate a willingness to assimilate, we should require them to work here and pay taxes for a substantial period of time after obtaining legal status before they have the opportunity to begin the process of applying for U.S. citizenship."" However, Jindal opposed the Senate bill that would have created a path to citizenship. • Physician Ben Carson. Carson has been widely quoted in the conservative media saying he would ""of course allow (illegal immigrants) to have a pathway to citizenship. That’s the only humane and reasonable thing to do."" However, the time and place of that comment is not clear. It does get some support from this passage in Carson’s 2012 book, America the Beautiful: ""Is it moral for us, for example, to take advantage of cheap labor from illegal immigrants while denying them citizenship? I'm sure you can tell from the way I phrased the question that I believe we have taken the moral low road on this issue."" However, since he’s become a presidential candidate, Carson has articulated his position on immigration without referring to a path for citizenship, notably in a column for the National Review. The candidates in this category who are hardest to characterize are the two from Florida, a state whose large population of immigrants makes immigration a somewhat touchier issue: former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio. • Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. As PolitiFact Florida has noted, Bush has flip-flopped extensively on the question of a path for citizenship during his long political career. In the 2013 book Immigration Wars, Bush and his co-author Clint Bolick wrote that permanent residency ""should not lead to citizenship. It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences — in this case, that those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship."" But in the wake of the book’s release, Bush backtracked. He supported the Senate bill that included a path to citizenship, and he told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that ""the basic premise needs to be that coming to the country legally should be easier with less cost than coming to the country illegally. And if you can create a system like that — as is being discussed in the Senate and in the House — through a path to citizenship, that’s fine."" As recently as March 2015, Bush told reporters during a visit to New Hampshire that he could support a path to citizenship. ""If you could get a consensus done, where you could have a bill done, and it was 15 years (to achieve citizenship) as the Senate Gang of Eight did, I’d be supportive of that,"" he said. However, he’s also said some things contrary to that stance. At a Politics and Eggs breakfast in New Hampshire in April 2015, Bush urged, ""Deal with the folks who are here illegally in a rational, thoughtful way. My suggestion is earned legal status. Not earned citizenship, but earned legal status. You don’t create a system where people cut in line in front of those who have been patiently waiting. But you get a provisional work permit, you work, you pay taxes, you pay a fine, you learn English, you don’t commit crimes, and you earn — over an extended period of time — legal status."" A Bush campaign representative did not respond to inquiries for this article. • Sen. Marco Rubio. Rubio was one of the leading Republicans supporting the Senate immigration bill, which included a path to citizenship. Asked for his reaction to Clinton’s claim, Rubio spokesman Alex Conant referred us to several pieces of evidence. One was a January 2015 interview with the New York Times Magazine in which Rubio was asked, ""Are you dropping the idea of citizenship for those who came here illegally?"" He responded, ""Once you have permanent residency, which is a green card, existing law allows you to apply for citizenship."" He echoed that stance in an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation on April 19, 2015. ""After a substantial period of time in that (work permit) status, assuming they haven’t violated any of the conditions of that status, they would be allowed to apply for legal residency, just like anybody else would, not a special process,"" Rubio said. ""And after you’re a legal resident, after a number of years, by law, you’re allowed to apply for citizenship."" However, at a National Review Institute event in May 2015, Rubio didn’t use the term ""citizenship."" He said that after ""securing the border"" and ""modernizing"" the legal immigration system, ""what you would get is the equivalent of a non-immigrant, non-permanent work visa to be in the U.S. and you would have to be in that status for a significant period of time. And at some point, if you choose, you could apply for permanent residency, but you'd have to do it through that modernized legal immigration system and you'd have to do it just like everybody else, not a special process or anything of that nature."" And some have raised questions about whether Rubio’s proposal would be practical, given the long backlog in applications for legal residency -- 4.4 million people are awaiting green cards, according to the State Department. Conant declined to respond specifically to whether Rubio fits into the category Clinton outlined. As for the Clinton camp, spokesman Josh Schwerin indicated that all of the candidates in the third category aren’t clearly supporting a path to citizenship, as Clinton put it. ""Any candidate who is intentionally vague on the issue is, by definition, not clear and consistent in their support,"" he said. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Not a single Republican candidate, announced or potential, is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. Not one."" She's telling voters who want a path to citizenship that there's no one on the Republican side who supports that issue. That is not accurate. There is one -- Graham. She does have a point that the other dozen or so candidates either have never backed a path to citizenship or have sent mixed signals. On balance, we rate Clinton's claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/may/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-not-one-gop-presidential-cont/

CNN's Chris Cuomo: First Amendment doesn't cover hate speech
","Hate speech is not the same thing as free speech, wrote CNN anchor Chris Cuomo on the ultimate forum for public discourse: Twitter. Amid debate about free speech after a shooting at an anti-Muslim protest in Texas , a user tweeted at Cuomo: ""Too many people are trying to say hate speech (doesn’t equal) free speech."" In response, Cuomo, who has a law degree, said, ""It doesn't. Hate speech is excluded from protection. Don’t just say you love the Constitution … read it."" The claim that the Constitution doesn’t protect hate speech incited heavy backlash, so we decided to flesh it out and see if there’s any truth to Cuomo’s statement. Them’s fightin’ words First let’s get the obvious out of the way: The concept of ""hate speech"" -- speech that negatively targets people based on personal traits like religion or race -- is not addressed in the Constitution. The First Amendment of the Constitution, included in the Bill of Rights, says: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."" That may seem cut and dried, but as with the rest of the Constitution, there are nuances to the concept of free speech. In the course of interpreting the amendment, courts have decided that certain speech does not fall under protections offered by the First Amendment. Unprotected speech includes things such as threats, child pornography and ""fighting words"" (speech that would likely draw someone into a fight, such as personal insults). But hate speech is not included in that list. However, sometimes hate speech can also be considered ""fighting words"" or a threat. In those cases, hate speech would be excluded from protections offered by the First Amendment, said James Weinstein, an expert in free speech at Arizona State University’s Sandra Day O’Connor Law School. For example, if someone hurled racial epithets during a heated argument with another individual, that could be considered both fighting words and hate speech, in which case it would not have First Amendment protection. But it would be unconstitutional to ban someone from putting those same words on a picket sign at a protest -- it would still be hate speech, but it wouldn’t fall under one of the unprotected categories. ""With that caveat, the overwhelming understanding is that ‘hate speech’ is constitutionally protected in the United States,"" said Michael Herz, co-director of the Floersheimer Center for Constitutional Democracy at Cardozo Law. ""Indeed, that protection makes this country different from most other countries in the world."" To his credit, Cuomo later clarified his position and said he was referring to the type of hate speech that falls under unprotected categories -- specifically citing the 1941 Supreme Court ruling in Chaplinsky vs. New Hampshire, which excluded fighting words from the First Amendment. (In the Chaplinsky case, the fighting words were not hate speech; rather they were ""God damned racketeer"" and ""damned fascist."") ""Of course the First Amendment does not expressly mention hate speech among its six protections in its text,"" Cuomo said. ""I meant to refer to the relevant case law about the (First Amendment) to see what is protected. There you quickly find that hate speech is almost always protected. The keyword is ‘almost.’ Hate speech can be prohibited; that is why I keep citing the Chaplinsky case and the fighting words doctrine."" (Read his full response on Facebook.) Even with this clarification, Weinstein said Cuomo’s argument isn’t without holes. If a statute bans hate speech, it has to be because it counts as a threat or fighting words -- not simply because it is hate speech. This may seem like a slight nuance, but it’s important. In 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that it’s constitutional for a state to have a statute that bans cross-burning -- but only if prosecutors can prove criminal intent to threaten. They cannot, for example, ban a burning cross used only to demonstrate political ideology. In another cross-burning case, the Supreme Court ruled in 1991 that it’s unconstitutional to up the penalty or charge people with a crime solely because their actions constitute hate speech. ""The fact that something is hate speech or not is irrelevant for First Amendment analysis,"" Weinstein said. Herz, of Cardozo, added that there hasn’t been a fighting words case in the Supreme Court since Chaplinsky in 1941, and he believes it likely would have a different outcome today. Of course, reasonable legal minds can disagree on these nuances. Alexander Tsesis, a First Amendment law professor at Loyola University Chicago, said he believes it can be constitutional to prohibit hate speech, and the 2002 cross-burning ruling is a good example of that. Tsesis said the jury’s still out on whether or not there’s potential for the Supreme Court to ban hate speech more broadly, noting that there’s some potential for laws that prohibit speech that defames an entire group, such as causing a group injury by saying a false stereotype. Although Tsesis believes that would be constitutional, he acknowledged that most scholars disagree. ""In the United States, the only two types of hate speech laws likely to survive are those that are likely to elicit an imminent fight and those that are truly threatening,"" he said. Our ruling Cuomo said, ""Hate speech is excluded from protection"" under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has ruled that certain categories of speech are excluded from constitutional protection, such as a threat or ""fighting words."" Sometimes, speech can be both a threat and hate speech, in which case it would not necessarily have First Amendment protection. But hate speech on its own -- such as on a picket sign or a blog -- is not excluded from protection. It may only be incidentally excluded. Cuomo tried to clarify his point after the fact, giving an explanation similar to the examples we hashed out here. But on his specific claim, the jurisprudence works against him. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2015/may/07/chris-cuomo/cnns-chris-cuomo-first-amendment-doesnt-cover-hate/
"['Poverty', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Is the poverty rate higher now than in the 1970s as Jeb Bush says?
","When asked about the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died following an April 12 arrest in Baltimore, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush turned the subject to poverty. ""We need as a nation to have a conversation about why is it we are creating these big pockets of poverty where people are completely dependent, they can’t live a life of independence,"" Bush told reporters at the North Carolina GOP headquarters May 1. ""And have a meaningful discussion about it -- not saying we need more money. We've had a war on poverty since the 1960s where we've spent trillions of dollars, and there are more poor people today as a percentage of our population than the 1970s."" Are there more poor people today as a percentage of our population than the 1970s? By the official measure, yes, but experts also rely on a different calculation that changes the results.  Poverty rates The U.S. Census Bureau determines national poverty rates using income and the cost of food. Specifically, it compares pre-tax cash income against a threshold set at three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, updated annually for inflation and adjusted for family size. In 2014 for a family of four, for example, the poverty level was about $24,000. The poverty rate is whatever percentage of the population falls below the poverty level. Census figures show that the official poverty rate was 14.5 percent in 2013, while during the 1970s the range was between 11.7 and 12.6 percent. So Bush’s claim about the numbers is correct by the official poverty measure. Ron Haskins, who helped write the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, cited several favors for the increasing poverty rate in his testimony to a U.S. Senate committee in 2012. ""Declining work rates, stagnant wages, the rise of female-headed families, inferior education, and the arrival of millions of immigrants with poor education and low skills are little engines pushing up the poverty rate,"" he said. ""Conditions in the U.S. virtually ensure high poverty rates because the underlying factors that cause poverty have remained very strong."" Bush’s statement referred to the overall official poverty rate, but it’s worth noting that poverty rates for the elderly have fallen since the 1970s while the poverty rate for children has increased. The declining rates for the elderly are related to increases in Social Security, but higher poverty rates for children are more vexing. ""The standard explanation for that is the family breakdown, mothers living alone, a weak job market, globalization, everything that keeps wages down for people who have children,"" said University of Maryland public policy professor Douglas Besharov, who was previously with the conservative American Enterprise Institute.  ""If you are conservative, you talk about poverty by unwed births. If you are more liberal, you talk about poverty as a result of weak job demand. It’s both, and they interact."" Finally, while it’s fair game for Bush to cite the official poverty measure, we also found that some experts think that it doesn’t tell the full story. In the past few years, the Census started testing an alternative measurement of poverty called the Supplemental Poverty Measure. That measure takes into account cash earned as well as government benefits such as as food assistance and tax credit programs. Under this alternative measure, the rate was 15.5 percent in 2013. Columbia University researchers took the 2012 supplemental poverty measure and adjusted it back to 1967. Under that measure, the poverty rate was between 22.1 percent and 17.7 percent in the 1970s, compared with 15.5 percent in 2013. So if we used this adjusted rate, Bush’s statement would be wrong. Our ruling Bush said, ""There are more poor people today as a percentage of our population than the 1970s."" Bush’s figures are correct based on the official poverty rate, which showed the rate was 14.5 percent in 2013, while during the 1970s the range was between 11.7 and 12.6 percent. Some poverty researchers say the official poverty rate between the 1970s and now doesn’t take into account certain benefits that help poor people, such as food assistance and tax credits. However, despite those caveats, it is fair for Bush to point to the official poverty rate. We rate this claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2015/may/07/jeb-bush/poverty-rate-higher-now-1970s/

Bill Clinton: We had the lowest net worth of any president entering office since Harry Truman
","Former President Bill Clinton is back to making claims about his family’s humble financial roots. A year ago, he was defending Hillary Clinton for claiming that they left left the White House ""not only dead broke, but in debt"" (which rates Mostly False). ""I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office,"" Clinton said then (Half True). This time, it’s amid scrutiny of all those lucrative speeches and foreign government donations to his family foundation. ""I'm grateful for our success,"" Clinton told NBC News’ Cynthia McFadden in an interview that aired May 4. ""But let me remind you. When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman."" So, did Bill do better by isolating on presidents since Harry Truman? The answer is yes. A humble haberdasher, Harry S. Truman Detailed financial disclosures were not required for presidents through the 1970s, so we’re left to rely on other resources to get a picture of a commander-in-chief’s financial assets, said Paul Brace, a professor of political science at Rice University. Still, we do know a lot about their lives. Let’s start with Truman since he’s critical. Truman and his wife Bess were not homeowners when he became president. They rented a Washington apartment, and Bess’ mother, who owned the Independence, Mo., home associated with Harry Truman, shared a room with their daughter Margaret, said Alonzo Hamby, a Truman biographer and Ohio University emeritus professor of history. Truman’s journey to public office followed bankruptcy-dodging and a failed haberdashery business in the 1920s. He worked his way up from county judge to a U.S. senator, vice president and president upon Franklin D. Roosevelt’s death in 1945. Even when he was earning $10,000 as a senator in 1935 ($171,000 in 2015 dollars), he could not save the family farm his mother owned.   It was Truman’s post-White House flirtation with bankruptcy that inspired Congress to pass presidential pensions, said Aaron Crawford, a post-doctoral student at Southern Methodist University. Experts can’t pinpoint his net worth to a specific dollar figure, but all the evidence points to the number being quite low. Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, explored Truman’s financial highs and lows using tax returns released by his presidential library. The man from Hope, and his pre-White House wallet The Clintons are certainly unique compared to other first families in modern history for a couple big reasons: They did not inherit sizable family estates, and Hillary Clinton was the family breadwinner as Bill worked as a career politician. Before running for the White House in 1992, Clinton brought in $35,000 a year as Arkansas governor, plus some speaking fees, honorariums and in-kind income, such as living in the governor’s residence. Hillary was a senior partner in the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock at the time, earned $92,000 salary and listed her share of her law firm’s profit-sharing and retirement plan between $100,001 and $250,000, according to a New York Times examination of the couple’s finances in 1992. The Clintons listed their net worth as nearly $700,000 in a 1992 statement, a substantial hike from the $418,692 net worth reported at the end of the 1989, according to the Washington Post.  Lest you worry about the financial wealth of the Clintons, the family was still well off by most any standard. The median household net worth for Americans in 2013 was $81,200 (see page 12), according to the Federal Reserve. Other presidents since Truman The experts we contacted didn’t rattle off hard numbers as they dissected various presidents’ pre-office net worth. Instead, they ruled out the obviously wealthy presidents based on their jobs and family situations. (Truman biographer Hamby used the phrases, ""JFK of course was quite rich,"" ""Reagan was at least quite affluent,"" and ""George H.W. Bush was at least wealthy if not filthy rich."") Eliminating the obvious, experts focused on who might present Clinton with a realistic challenge. Richard Nixon? He had a pretty lucrative law practice in New York. Lyndon B. Johnson? Journalists and historians disagree on exactly how he built his wealth, experts said, but he at least married a wealthy woman whose father owned Texas radio stations. Dwight D. Eisenhower? Nah, they said, as he was doing well for himself after World War II, landing on corporate boards and enjoying a good military pension and sales of his memoir, Crusade in Europe. ""You save the world, you get good royalties,"" said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. Most encouraged us to give presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford a closer look. Carter had earned a good living as the owner of a peanut warehouse business in Georgia before running for the state Senate in 1962, said Scott Kaufman, a scholar of Ford and Carter at Francis Marion University. In 1979’s Jimmy Carter: A Character Portrait, authors Bruce Mazlish and Edwin Diamond wrote that Carter’s fortune was $814,000 when he became president, Kaufman said. That bests Clinton, without even having to break out the inflation calculator. A separate source — a 1976 Washington Post article sent over by the Hillary Clinton campaign — showed Carter had a net worth (when valuing assets at their original cost) of $512,000, which translates to $1.3 million in 1992 dollars, according to 1975 tax returns he released during his campaign against Ford. A document from the Gerald R. Ford presidential library suggests Ford had a more modest net worth compared to other presidents. The document, dated Oct. 29, 1973, (the year before Ford became president), showed a net worth of $256,378, which had the same buying power as about $810,000 in 1992. That’s more than the Clintons, though not by much. Ford’s finances and dealings were part of the most intense background checks for anyone ever screened for the vice presidency, Kaufman said, coming off the resignation of Nixon vice president Spiro Agnew earlier that month and amid looming worries about legal implications for Nixon in the Watergate scandal. ""They didn’t want to appoint someone who might also have problems,"" Kaufman said. Our ruling Bill Clinton urged Americans to remember the Clintons’ more modest beginnings with his family’s fattened finances in the limelight, saying, ""When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman."" You can decide whether his point is relevant, but Clinton has improved the accuracy of his factoid since making a similar claim last year. We could not find evidence of a president after Truman whose inflation-adjusted net worth was smaller than the Clintons’. We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2015/may/07/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-we-had-lowest-net-worth-any-president/

Twin River chairman John Taylor says Tiverton voters have strongly supported gambling referenda
","A month after announcing an agreement to purchase the Newport Grand slots parlor for an undisclosed price, owners of the Twin River casino in Lincoln unveiled a plan on April 21, 2015, to move the Newport Grant operation to Tiverton, building a new facility near the town's northern border with Massachusetts. Why move to Tiverton? John Taylor, chairman of the board of Twin River, was asked that question during WPRI-TV's Newsmakers during a show recorded April 24. ""We were looking for a place with minimal impacts to the local community,"" Taylor said. ""We were looking for a location which was proximate to where Newport Grand's customers primarily come from, and today those customers come from Southeastern Massachusetts and Aquidneck Island,"" which covers Portsmouth, Middletown and Newport. ""One of the other things we looked at is propensity in the past to support gaming measures, and the people of Tiverton have historically supported [such measures], at a rate higher than the rest of the state, which demonstrated in our mind an openness to the issue,"" he said. We were interested in whether Taylor was accurately characterizing Tiverton's past support for gambling measures, particularly because it might indicate whether voters there might give it the local approval required for a casino to be built there. We contacted Twin River spokeswoman Patti Doyle and, while waiting to hear from her, we went looking for gambling ballot questions that might have served as the basis for Taylor's statement. Ballotpedia, the questions website, says there have been five statewide gambling questions since 1996. Four seem relevant to this fact check. (The fifth deals with requiring approval of voters before a gambling establishment can be relocated.) In 2006, Question 1 asked voters to authorize a resort casino in West Warwick. That proposal was defeated. In 2012, two questions -- one allowing casino games at Twin River, the other at Newport Grand -- were approved, although Newport voters rejected the Newport Grand proposal. In 2014, a new proposal to authorize casino gambling at Newport Grand was approved in a statewide vote, but lost again in Newport, where approval was also required for passage. When we checked the votes with the Rhode Island Board of Elections, we confirmed the tallies Doyle sent us and found a clear pattern. Here are the various approval rates: Year Question R.I. Tiverton 2006 Question 1: Gambling in West Warwick 37.0% 41.9% 2012 Question 1: Table games at Twin River 70.8% 74.7% 2012 Question 2: Table games at Newport Grand 66.5% 73.3% 2014 Question 1: Table games at Newport Grand 56.3% 65.8% In every case, Tiverton voters approved gambling provisions by a wider margin than voters statewide. Last year, the number of Tiverton voters approving table games at Newport was nearly 17 percent higher than the state as a whole. The big question, of course, is whether Tiverton voters' degree of support will be as high if the gambling facility is going to be located in their town. Taylor's meeting Monday night with the Town Council didn't offer many clues, but the casino plans aren't going to be firmed up until November. But if Twin River is looking to set up a facility in a community that is receptive to a casino, it looks like Tiverton is a good bet. We rate Taylor's claim as True.

'Clinton Cash' author: Hillary Clinton changed positions on India nuclear deal
","As a senator, Hillary Clinton flip-flopped on a nuclear deal with India -- swayed by donations to her family’s foundation. At least that’s what Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer asserts. Schweizer’s book -- which hit shelves May 5 -- purports to document a series of donations to the Clinton Foundation and other financial gifts that turned into special favors from Clinton while she was a senator and secretary of state. One such allegation, which Schweizer discussed in a May 1 interview with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell, is that Clinton did not support a nuclear deal with India in 2006, but two years and millions of India-based donations to her foundation later, she changed her mind. But is this an accurate account? Mitchell said MSNBC’s research found that Clinton supported the nuclear deal with India all along. Schweizer responded that in 2006, Clinton supported nuclear cooperation -- with restrictions, which didn’t suit the Indian government’s position. But in 2008, she no longer supported those restrictions. This is evidenced by her votes on amendments that would have put limitations on the deal, he said.  ""Amendments she supported and voted for in 2006, she no longer supported in 2008,"" he said. Who’s right here? Did Clinton change position or not? We decided to look for ourselves and see if we could sort it out. Apples and oranges First, a very brief chronology. Congress first took up the issue of a civilian nuclear trade deal with India in 2006. That year, they passed legislation to change existing atomic energy law, necessary for the negotiations to move forward. Then in 2008, following diplomatic negotiations, Congress approved the final deal, which allowed the United States to export to India nuclear fuel and technology. Clinton, a founding member of the Senate India Caucus, supported both measures. In 2006, Clinton released a public statement praising the legislation and voted for the final bill. In 2008, she voted for the deal, and the Indian press said Clinton had expressed her support in meetings with Indian leaders. What about the amendments? In 2006, Clinton did vote in the Senate in favor of three failed amendments that would have placed some limitations on the deal: One required India to end military cooperation with Iran, another called for assurances that the deal would not help India develop nuclear weapons, and the third declared support of a United Nations resolution regarding nuclear disarmament. Some supporters of the deal said these amendments could kill the deal. Schweizer said Clinton no longer supported these amendments when Congress revisited the nuclear deal two years later. However, the 2008 bill only had one Senate amendment, and it was defeated by voice vote, meaning the votes were not recorded. Without a recorded vote, or any public comment from Clinton, it’s impossible to know whether she supported the 2008 amendment or not. Further, the single 2008 amendment was fundamentally different than the amendments voted on in 2006. It laid out implications for the deal in the event that India detonated a nuclear weapon, while none of the 2006 amendments addressed this question. So not only is comparing Clinton’s position on the 2006 and 2008 amendments impossible, given the fact that there is no documentation of Clinton’s support or opposition in 2008 -- but the amendments are apples and oranges that don’t offer a meaningful comparison. We want to note that Schweizer pointed us to two statements of Indian business leaders to show that Clinton did not support the deal in 2006, though they aren’t without holes. On June 29, 2006, the leader of the conservative Indian-American Republican Council, said Clinton had ""made little effort to support the agreement despite being India Caucus co-chair."" However, Clinton put out a press release on the same day that said she intended to vote for the legislation, noting that the Senate version was an improvement upon the White House version. Hotelier Sant Chatwal -- a major fundraiser for the Clintons who was recently found guilty of skirting campaign finance laws -- advocated for the nuclear deal, and he said (in 2010) that Clinton didn’t favor the deal as of May 2006. But again, she expressed public support about a month later. Maybe Chatwal helped change her mind between May and June 2006, or maybe not. Either way this does not show a change in position from 2006 to 2008. Our ruling Schweizer said, ""Amendments (Hillary Clinton) supported and voted for in 2006, she no longer supported in 2008,"" showing she changed positions on an India nuclear deal. We know Clinton voted for several amendments on Indian nuclear deal-related legislation in 2006. The 2008 legislation, however, had just one amendment, and the vote was not recorded. Because we don’t know how she voted, and she did not make any public statements about it, it’s impossible to know her position on the 2008 amendment. Additionally, the 2008 amendment was fundamentally different than any of the amendments the Senate considered in 2006. Even if we knew whether she supported the 2008 amendment, it wouldn’t necessarily show a change in position.  What’s more, Clinton showed public support for a deal in 2006, and she voted in favor of the deal in both 2006 and 2008. We rate Schweizer’s claim False.",/factchecks/2015/may/06/peter-schweizer/clinton-cash-author-hillary-changed-positions-indi/

Gwinnett DA over-reaches on Sheriff Hill shooting statement
","Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill made national headlines running for a second term while facing multiple felony charges such as racketeering and giving false statements. He said the charges were politically motivated, and he kept a relatively low profile after being acquitted on a whittled-down list of charges in 2013. But he was thrust back into the spotlight Sunday. Police said he telephoned 911 to report that he had shot a female acquaintance in a model home near Lawrenceville. Gwenevere McCord, 43, was rushed to the hospital in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. McCord’s family said she and Hill are longtime acquaintances. There was some confusion Sunday about whether police could arrest Hill if they felt charges were warranted. Georgia law says ""a sitting sheriff cannot be charged except by a warrant issued by a Superior Court judge,"" Gwinnett District Attorney Danny Porter told AM750 and 95.5 FM News/Talk WSB, a news partner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, during an interview Monday morning. Porter later said that, after further research, he determined the state law only applies in cases where a sheriff is on official duty when he or she allegedly commits a crime. Hill was in Gwinnett on Sunday for what ""appears to be a completely personal errand,"" Porter said. PolitiFact Georgia was intrigued. Does Georgia give special or different treatment to sheriffs who are suspected of a crime? We’ll look deeper at the law, which Terry Norris, the executive director of the Georgia Sheriffs’ Association, was quick to tell us applies to far more people than just sheriffs. It covers all peace officers, including sheriff’s deputies and police chiefs, as well as teachers and school administrators, Norris said. It states: ""Any warrant for the arrest of a peace officer, law enforcement officer, teacher, or school administrator for any offense alleged to have been committed while in the performance of his or her duties may be issued only by a judge of a superior court, a judge of a state court, or a judge of a probate court."" Norris said he believes the law, which we found dates to the 1860s, was designed to prevent private citizens from obtaining criminal warrants against sheriffs and teachers just because they were mad at them for doing their jobs. Magistrates and municipal judges can issue most warrants. But under these circumstances, the law requires requests for warrants be handled by higher-level probate, state or Superior Court judges, he said. Porter said Tuesday that he purposely proceeded cautiously. ""I was not sure enough of the procedure that was required to arrest the sheriff. I was afraid I would make a procedural error in the case,"" he said. Porter said Gwinnett County has six state court judges and one probate judge, but he would have only considered going to one of the 10 Superior Court judges on Sunday night had he decided then to pursue a warrant against Hill. ""I don’t have a relationship with them (the other judges),"" Porter said, ‘that I could call them on a Sunday night and bring a police officer to their house."" He said he also wasn’t certain whether Hill might claim to be on duty Sunday. ""Police officers make the argument they’re always on duty,’ Porter said. ""The sheriff is elected. I didn’t know if it made a difference. If he is arrested, he’ll probably make the argument that he was in performance of his duties."" The Camaro that Hill was in had police lights and other equipment, Porter said. Professor Ronald Carlson at the University of Georgia School of Law said Porter’s actions made sense, given the statute. There are no Supreme Court rulings on the protections afforded law enforcement and other public officials in the code, Carlson said, leaving it to be followed as purely as possible. ""With a high profile sort of case, and with a high-profile person who may be charged or not, it’s good to go to probably to the highest court listed in statute, and that’s the Superior Court judge,"" Carlson said. ""I think he has the right idea."". Yet the question remained how Hill, as a sheriff, was allowed to leave the scene Sunday night. ""How do you walk away from a shooting without saying anything? A lot of us in former law enforcement are scratching our heads,"" Former DeKalb County District Attorney J. Tom Morgan told the AJC.  ""I don’t think you and I could have walked away from something like that."" Jill Polster, an Atlanta criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor, said it is not unusual for police to not make an arrest until a thorough investigation is done when there is possibility of what attorneys call an ""affirmative"" defense. Those defenses pop up in situations such as the Hill shooting, or in home invasions, when the claim of accidental shootings or self-defense can delay or lengthen investigations as law enforcement conducts interviews to reconstruct what happened. For instance, former Peachtree City Police Chief William McCollom was indicted April 15 on reckless conduct charges from the New Year’s Day shooting that left his former wife paralyzed. McCollom told investigators he had fallen asleep with his gun in the bed when he accidentally shot Maggie McCollom in the back. In the Hill case, there is a living victim, too. Police are likely waiting to talk to her before moving too quickly to determine what happened in a case that includes at least two other eyewitnesses, Polster said. ""In many stand-your-ground cases, or in the Peachtree City case, they take their time because there are a lot of possibilities to investigate,"" Polster said. Porter dismissed any suggestion that Hill’s position and reputation would likewise affect the outcome, saying,  ""Sometimes it’s better off to get it right than to get it fast."" In fact, Polster said, Hill’s being sheriff may mean officers are more comfortable letting him leave a scene than they would someone who could fade away as they conducted their investigation. ""Victor Hill is not going anywhere,"" Polster said. ""He’s a public figure and he’s not going to flee, so they can take their time and complete a full investigation."" Our conclusion: Gwinnett District Attorney Danny Porter said "" A sitting sheriff cannot be charged except by a warrant issued by a Superior Court judge."" He later said he had researched the law and determined that it only applied if the alleged crime occurred during the official performance of duty. Porter’s overarching point is that under Georgia law sheriffs are treated differently when they may have broken the laws they’re supposed to uphold. On that point, Porter is correct. But on the specifics, he’s off base. He had other options. Warrants can be issued against sheriffs by the state court and probate courts judges. PolitiFact defines a statement as Half True when it’s at least partially accurate but missing enough context to be misleading to the average reader. Porter’s statement fits that bill. We rate his statement Half True.

Hillary Clinton says U.S. ranks only 65th in world for gender pay equity
","Hillary Clinton, who wants to become the first woman ever to win the presidency of the United States, gave an address recently at the Women in the World Summit that touched on the gap in pay between men and women in the United States. It’s ""hard to believe that so many women are still paid less for men than the same work, with even wider gaps for women of color. If you doubt what I say, look to the World Economic Forum, hardly a hotbed of feminist thought,"" Clinton said at the April 23, 2015, summit. ""Their rankings show that the United States is 65th out of 142 nations and other territories on equal pay. Imagine that. We should be No. 1."" That sounds pretty bad for a nation that’s considered the world’s economic superpower. We wondered whether the United States is really that far back in the pack. We found a more complex picture than Clinton’s comments showed. One study that surveyed executives supported her point, but another study of wage data actually undermined it.  Framing the wage gap question PolitiFact has written frequently in the past about how much of a pay differential exists for working men and women in the United States. While the exact phrasing has sometimes made a difference in our ratings, we’ve generally rated Mostly True the claims that women earn 77 or 78 cents for every dollar a man does, while we’ve generally rated Mostly False the claims that said women earned 77 or 78 cents for every dollar a man earned for the same work. That’s because the 77 to 78 cent figure refers to earnings by men and women irrespective of the specific job held. The 77 to 78 cent statistic reflects that men and women tend to choose different professions and work different numbers of hours per week -- factors that may be noteworthy for policymakers, but which do not directly reflect wage discrimination on the part of employers for women and men who hold the same job. When you compare men and women who hold the same or similar jobs, the pay gap shrinks significantly, though it does not disappear entirely. Global comparisons The new wrinkle in Clinton’s comments is the international comparison. The study she referred to was released by the World Economic Forum, a Switzerland-based group that describes itself as ""committed to improving the state of the world through public-private cooperation."" It is best known for its annual meeting of world economic and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland. The group’s Global Gender Gap Report 2014 says it quantifies ""the magnitude of gender-based disparities and tracks their progress over time."" The group explained that the gender gap index looks at ""the relative gaps between women and men across four key areas: health, education, economy and politics."" The primary yardstick in the report ranked the United States 20th out of 142 countries. By contrast, the 65th place ranking comes from one of the subcategories. Specifically, that 65th-place ranking came from a survey in which executives were asked to rate on a numerical scale their answer to the question, ""In your country, for similar work, to what extent are wages for women equal to those of men?"" So Clinton engaged in a bit of cherry-picking. By focusing on the United States’ 65th-place ranking, rather than its 20th-place ranking, Clinton painted a much grimmer picture. In addition, the particular data point she used is based on a survey of several hundred business executives in the United States. That means it’s based heavily on perceptions of how much gender-based wage bias exists, not just on hard data showing actual wage differentials. Those executives’ perceptions may or may not be based on accurate assumptions. That said, Clinton does have some justification for citing the ranking she did. On the question of cherry-picking, it does appear that the 65th-place data point is the one most directly focused on gender-based wage discrimination; the other data points refer to elements that are less directly related, such as labor-force participation rates and overall compensation. And on whether it’s appropriate to use a survey rather than wage statistics, doing so does at least has the advantage of recording answers from executives in a wide range of countries across the globe. There does not appear to be comprehensive wage data for all or most countries by gender. The Clinton campaign expressed confidence in the value of the World Economic Forum survey and emphasized that it involved a larger number of countries. Hard data on the ""unexplained"" gender gap However, the more limited hard data that does exist puts the United States in a more favorable light on wage equity than Clinton’s talking point would suggest. That data comes from the International Labor Organization, a division of the United Nations. The group’s Global Wage Report 2014/15 compared data from 29 developed countries, plus Europe as a whole. This data looks not just at gender-based wage gaps, but at how much of that gap can be ""explained"" by demographic factors unrelated to employer discrimination, such as education, experience and the divergent career choices made by men and women. Once you remove the ""explained"" portion of the wage gap, what’s left -- the ""unexplained"" portion of the gender gap -- is considered a more direct approximation of how much discrimination is occurring against women when compared to men who hold the same job. And on this score, the United States rates well. Of the 30 nations studied, only Germany has a smaller ""unexplained"" wage gap than the United States does. By this measure, the United States outpaces such advanced industrialized rivals as the United Kingdom, France, the Scandinavian countries and Europe as a whole. That’s a much less dire picture than the one Clinton painted in her speech. Our ruling Clinton said ""the United States is 65th out of 142 nations and other territories on equal pay."" She has cited a finding from one international survey of executives, but other data -- including actual wage data from more than two dozen advanced countries -- shows the United States second only to Germany in the lack of gender-based wage discrimination for men and women who hold the same job. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/may/05/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-us-ranks-just-65th-world-gend/

How much does Baltimore spend on its schools?
","The Baltimore riot has many people talking about how life could be improved in neighborhoods that have been in the grip of poverty for many decades. Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Md., said on Fox News Sunday that investing in schools is an obvious step. But host Chris Wallace pushed back. ""It’s not a matter of money,"" Wallace said on May 3, 2015. ""One of the things that we learned this week is Baltimore spends the third-highest per capita on its public schools. Baltimore was already spending plenty on public schools, and the schools were still lousy."" To get to ""third-highest,"" Wallace is counting only the 100 largest school districts -- and lopping off more affluent communities in the process. Fox News told us that Wallace relied on a Census Bureau release that compared the 100 largest school districts nationwide. (Wallace misspoke slightly. He should have said per-pupil spending, not per capita.) Among the 100 largest districts, Baltimore does spend more per pupil than all-but two other districts: School district Enrollment $ per pupil New York City 990,145 $20,226 Boston 55,027 $19,720 Baltimore 84,212 $15,287 Anchorage 48,765 $14,963 Montgomery County 146,459 $14,873 The problem is there are more than 15,000 school districts across the country, and there are hundreds that spend more. Among school districts with at least 5,000 students, Baltimore ranks 160th in spending. Or to give another example, Baltimore ranks 20th among the 500 largest school districts: Rank School District Enrollment $ per pupil Rank School District Enrollment $ per pupil 1 Newark 35,543 $23,946 11 Jersey City 27,397 $18,259 2 New York City 990,145 $20,226 12 Brentwood, N.Y. 17,143 $18,034 3 Elizabeth, N.J. 23,386 $20,220 13 New Haven 20,554 $17,615 4 Boston 55,027 $19,720 14 District of Columbia 44,618 $17,468 5 Buffalo 32,723 $18,971 15 Arlington County, Va. 21,892 $17,338 6 Hartford 20,931 $18,843 16 Christina, Del. 16,303 $17,026 7 Yonkers 25,326 $18,798 17 Waterbury, Conn. 18,061 $16,030 8 Rochester 31,432 $18,762 18 Pittsburgh 26,653 $15,615 9 Paterson, N.J. 24,365 $18,590 19 Springfield, Ma. 25,185 $15,374 10 Syracuse 20,491 $18,387 20 Baltimore 84,212 $15,287 The spending vs. results debate Wallace simplified a complex problem when he said improving Baltimore’s schools ""is not about money."" There are studies on both sides of that debate. To pick one that supports Wallace’s view, researchers looked at four years of data on Pennsylvania schools. In 2010, the 21st Century Partnership for STEM Education in Philadelphia compared spending in nearly 500 school districts to 11th grade test results. The strongest predictor of high scores was the fraction of adults in the district with a four-year college degree. F. Joseph Merlino is the organization’s president. ""You would think that spending more money would lead to better outcomes,"" Merlino said. ""But the results are very weak."" The report said ""Spending per pupil, regardless of expenditure category, had either no association with student achievement or at best only a weak positive or a weak negative correlation with student achievement. "" On the other hand, professors at Northwestern University and the University of California-Berkeley looked at four decades in school districts where spending increased under court order. In a report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they said that for low income children who spent all 12 years in schools where spending rose at least 20 percent, graduation rates rose by 23 percentage points. There were also ""25 percent higher earnings, and a 20 percentage-point reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty."" At the same time, increased spending had little impact on the education of children from families making more money. Our ruling Wallace said that Baltimore ranks third in per capita school spending.  That's only true if you look at the 100 largest school districts. Among the top 500, Baltimore ranks 20th. Among school districts with at least 5,000 students, Baltimore ranks 160th in spending. Wallace's claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/may/05/chris-wallace/foxs-wallace-baltimore-ranks-third-school-spending/
