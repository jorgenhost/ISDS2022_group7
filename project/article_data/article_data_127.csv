San Antonio ordinance won’t ‘allow’ men into women’s restrooms
","""San Antonio Ordinance to Allow Men into Women’s Restrooms,"" says an Aug. 15, 2013, email from Texas Values, an Austin-based advocacy group that says it seeks to support ""family values."" The email and an Aug. 13, 2013, post on the group’s blog mentioned a new California law giving public school students access to either gender’s sports teams, locker rooms and bathrooms. The blog entry said the San Antonio City Council would soon consider a ""similar policy"" that ""makes it illegal to deny ‘facilities’ because of a person’s ‘gender identity.’ These facilities are commonly understood to include bathrooms, locker rooms, and other changing facilities."" Texas Values president Jonathan Saenz confirmed by phone that the group was referring to a proposed nondiscrimination ordinance that has been hotly debated in San Antonio with religious protests, an effort to recall the councilman who proposed it and 400 people showing up to speak at an Aug. 28, 2013, council meeting. The San Antonio Spurs basketball team and Austin Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett have lent their support to the ordinance; gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott and other politicians have weighed in opposing it. The proposal has a broader scope than bathrooms. According to a July 25, 2013, San Antonio Express-News news blog entry, it would consolidate the city’s ""hodgepodge"" of anti-discrimination policies and add protection for sexual orientation, gender identity and veteran status. PolitiFact Texas wrote about the proposal’s employment protections in a July 26, 2013, fact-check. The council will hear more public comment Sept. 4 and is set to consider the ordinance Sept. 5. Saenz said his group was referring to Section 2-592 in an Aug. 7, 2013, draft of the ordinance, which said:  A place of public accommodation, the draft said, is any business in San Antonio that’s open to the general public and offers products, services or facilities in return for payment. Among the examples it gives: stores, theaters, bars, restaurants, hospitals, museums and golf courses. The city issued a revised draft Aug. 28, 2013, that did not change the wording of Section 2-592 but added below it, ""Nothing herein shall be construed as directing any policy or practice regarding the use of restrooms, shower rooms, or similar facilities which have been designated for use by persons of the opposite sex."" According to Councilman Diego Bernal, who spearheaded the proposal, neither version would have addressed who could enter which restroom. Rather, he told us by phone, both would protect people from being turned away entirely -- not allowed to use any restroom at all -- based on their gender identity. We unsuccessfully sought comment from the City of San Antonio’s communications office and city attorney’s office on whether the ordinance would ""allow men into women’s restrooms."" Spokeswoman Diedrie Brewton of the city attorney’s office, speaking to us by phone Aug. 30, pointed us to a fact sheet posted in the ""last week"" on the city’s homepage, www.sanantonio.gov, which says the proposal does ""not change any bathroom, dressing room or locker room policies currently in place."" Bernal pointed us to an Aug. 15, 2013, opinion column by Express-News commentator Brian Chasnoff, who wrote that according to city attorney Michael Bernard, because of an appeals court ruling that applies to Bexar County, ""if the proposal passes, a business owner in San Antonio would still have the right to stop someone from going into a bathroom — regardless of that person's gender identity."" So the official view appears to be that places open to the public will still be able to prevent men from entering women’s restrooms, or vice versa. Saenz disagreed, saying, ""What the councilman says and what the city attorney says doesn’t say how it will be used."" Courts will decide how the ordinance is carried out, he said. Transgender groups’ swift opposition to the Aug. 28 revision bolsters that view, Saenz said, because their reaction made it clear they expected the ordinance would let them use the restrooms of their choice. Spokesman Michael Diviesti of GetEqualTX, an education and advocacy group that started a petition protesting the ordinance’s revisions, told us by phone that by specifying bathroom policies would remain unchanged, the Aug. 28 version effectively stripped protection that the Aug. 7 draft offered to transgendered people. Executive director Katrina Stewart of the Transgender Education Network of Texas, an advocacy and education group whose online fact sheet about the proposal was sent to us by Saenz, told us by phone that Texas Values’ statement was false for a different reason: ""Because transgender women don’t identify as men,"" she said. ""They identify as women."" Separately, Diviesti said the same. Overall, Stewart said, the ordinance would not create significant change. ""The truth is, there are a large number of transgender people that have been working in San Antonio just fine, and using the restrooms,"" she said. ""For the vast majority of trans people, we just want to go in, go to the bathroom, wash our hands and leave."" Diviesti said that there’s no state law governing bathrooms’ gender designation, so ""it’s currently up to business owners"" to say who can use which restroom. Ryan Kellus Turner, general counsel for the Texas Municipal Courts Education Center, also told us by phone there is no Texas law specifically saying whether men or women can enter bathrooms designated for the opposite gender, though other states and some cities have created ordinances addressing such access. Houston’s municipal code makes it a misdemeanor to enter without permission a public restroom designated for the opposite gender ""in a manner calculated to cause a disturbance."" City employees, under executive orders issued by Mayor Annise Parker in 2010, can ""use restroom facilities in city-owned buildings for the gender with which they identify,"" according to an April 2, 2010, Houston Chronicle news story. Saenz said that antidiscrimination policies in other places indicate how San Antonio’s could be applied, citing a 2012 incident in which Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., protected the right of a transgender student who was biologically male to use women’s facilities after a girl saw the student nude in a locker room. Allowing men into women’s facilities via such policies has ""happened in other states; it will happen in San Antonio as well,"" he said. The American Civil Liberties Union said April 24, 2013, on its website that while some jurisdictions across the U.S. have specified that denying transgender people access to the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity is discrimination, courts have also ruled the other way. A Dallas ordinance protects against discrimination based on sexual orientation at public accommodations’ facilities citywide; similar ordinances in Austin, El Paso and Fort Worth include gender identity as well. Dallas County protects county employees from discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. Our ruling Texas Values’ email said, ""San Antonio Ordinance to Allow Men into Women’s Restrooms."" We found nothing in law that says San Antonio men can’t go into women’s restrooms now, or vice versa. The City of San Antonio and the councilman who proposed the measure said it won’t change any bathroom policies that are now in place. The city attorney said in a newspaper commentary that an appeals court decision means a San Antonio business owner would still be able to prevent someone from entering a bathroom, regardless of that person’s gender identity. We rate the group’s statement as False.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Call for tax overhaul cites high cost of money, time
","How much time did it take you -- or your tax preparer -- to complete your taxes last year? A couple of hours? A few days? How about 6 billion hours! According to Georgia Congressman Tom Price, Americans spend that vast amount of time complying with the tax code each year. Not only that, he said, but the cost to comply with the tax code is also astronomical. In a couple of Twitter posts recently, Price, a Republican from Roswell, used the eye-popping figures to push for an overhaul of the tax code. ""Americans spend $160+ billion per yr complying with the tax code. Visit http://TaxReform.gov  & share your ideas to fix a broken tax code,"" one Price post said. It was followed by a second post:: ""Americans spend 6 billion hrs per yr complying with the tax code. Follow @simplertaxes & join the fight for a simpler, pro-growth tax code."" We know taxes and the federal tax code are tough and take time to understand. But 6 billion hours and $160 billion for compliance? Those numbers seemed extreme, and we decided to check them out. Tax reform has become a talking point that almost everyone can agree on, sort of like the declaration that ice cream is yummy. Politicos on both sides of the aisle have called for an overhaul of a tax system that many say is too complex and onerous for businesses and individuals. The broad goal is to simplify the code by eliminating or reducing tax breaks and using the additional revenue to lower tax rates across the board. Price is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, the chief tax-writing committee in the House. He has been part of a Republican bloc that has argued for overhauling the tax code to not only lower tax rates but also broaden the tax base and eliminate loopholes. To illustrate the obstacle that the tax code has become, Price and several other politicos have used the figures the congressman used in his Twitter posts. For example, PolitiFact Oregon checked similar statements made by U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who used the figures to promote his plan for simplifying the tax code. Wyden’s statement was rated True. The numbers cited by Price and Wyden can be traced to the Internal Revenue Service’s independent ombudsman, known as the National Taxpayer Advocate. The ombudsman, currently Nina E. Olson, is described as the voice of the taxpayer before the IRS and Congress. Olson leads the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS, in helping taxpayers resolve problems with the IRS, as well as working for change in the agency and in the federal tax code. In a 2010 annual report to Congress, Olson said that taxpayers -- individuals and corporations -- spend about $163 billion annually to comply with the tax code, a sum equal to 11 percent of all the revenue the federal government collected. The cost of compliance was based on 2008 figures. The NTA says there is no correct methodology for quantifying the costs of compliance with the tax code. The $163 billion figure is based on what was spent on personal and business income taxes (5.6 billion hours) multiplied by the average hourly cost of a civilian employee ($29.18, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The calculations did not include time spent complying with requirements for employment, estate and gift, excise, and exempt organization taxes. The annual compliance cost estimate based on 2010 requirements grew to $168 billion, according to the NTA’s 2012 annual report. That  2012 annual report found that individual taxpayers and businesses spend about 6.1 billion hours a year complying with the filing requirements of the Internal Revenue code. That figure does not include millions of additional hours taxpayers spend responding to IRS notices or audits. Olson’s office arrived at that figure by multiplying the number of copies of each form filed for tax year 2010 by the average amount of time the IRS estimated it took to complete each form. The IRS estimates the average time burden for all taxpayers is 13 hours, with an average cost of $210 per return. This average includes four hours for actual tax form completion, six hours for recordkeeping, two more hours for tax planning and a miscellaneous hour. The authors of the NTA report admit that the figure for time spent complying with the tax code is difficult to accurately measure because the IRS has not kept up with technology improvements that have made the process more efficient. Since 2001, Olson’s office has found, Congress has made nearly 5,000 changes to the tax code, an average of more than one a day, and the code has reached almost 4 million words. ""Individual taxpayers find return preparation so overwhelming that few do it on their own. Nearly 60 percent of taxpayers hire paid preparers, and another 30 percent rely on commercial software, with leading software packages costing $50 or more,"" Olson wrote. ""In other words, taxpayers must spend money just to figure out how much money they owe."" If tax compliance were an industry, Olson said, ""it would be one of the largest in the United States."" To sum up, U.S. Rep Tom Price said Americans are spending more than $160 billion and 6 billion hours each year complying with the federal tax code. The figures have been repeated by multiple interests seeking a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code. Prices’ figures, used in two Twitter posts, can be traced to the IRS’ independent ombudsman. Those figures, while difficult to quantify, have become the accepted standard for calculating compliance time and costs. We rate Price’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A5A640>],/factchecks/2013/sep/04/tom-price/call-tax-overhaul-cites-high-cost-money-time/

Only 1 percent of endangered species list have been taken off list, says Cynthia Lummis
","The Endangered Species Act, the law that protects animals and plants at risk of extinction, has had some dramatic successes -- among them, saving the bald eagle, the gray whale, the peregrine falcon and the American alligator. But the law has also drawn complaints from landowners and energy interests that it unnecessarily harms economic development. The debate over the decades-old law is resurfacing in Congress, with critics of the law citing a statistic that raises questions about the law’s effectiveness. Specifically, a reader suggested we check a claim by U.S. Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., in a recent interview with Wyoming Public Radio. In the interview, which aired Aug. 23, 2013, Lummis said, ""Our goal is not to repeal the Endangered Species Act. Far from it. Our goal is to make the Endangered Species Act work. We have a law where only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted. To me, that indicates a law that is failing in its ultimate goal which is to list species, recover them, and then delist them."" Whether the act is ""failing"" is an opinion, and as we'll see, opinions differ on that point. We wanted to concentrate on whether Lummis is right that under the act, ""only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted."" How does the act work? The precursor to the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1966. The law was revised in 1969 and underwent a major rewrite in 1973. A key element of the 1973 act is that it prohibits federal agencies from ""authorizing, funding, or carrying out any action that would jeopardize a listed species or destroy or modify its ‘critical habitat.’ "" While this doesn’t necessarily affect privately held land, many major development projects on private land may require one or more federal permits, so they can be delayed or otherwise affected by the law. In addition, states may have their own laws on endangered species. So what does ""listing"" mean? The federal government can confer protection upon species after completing a lengthy regulatory process that includes public input. The factors that would qualify a species for the list, according to the 1973 act, include ""the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; disease or predation; the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence."" The two key categories are ""endangered"" and ""threatened."" An endangered species is at more severe risk than a threatened species; a species can be either ""uplisted"" from threatened to endangered or ""downlisted"" from endangered to threatened, depending on the improvement of its prognosis in the wild. Species can also be ""delisted"" entirely. That can be done if the threats to the species ""have been eliminated or controlled, based on several factors including population sizes and trends and the stability of habitat quality and quantity."" How many species have been delisted? The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, one of the key agencies that carries out the act’s provisions, has a running tally of species that have been listed and delisted. All told, 56 species have been delisted. Because Lummis said she was talking about the ability of the law to ""list species, recover them, and then delist them,"" we will use the 28 species that were delisted due to recovery as the focus of our calculation. We will exclude the 10 that were delisted because they became extinct, and an additional 18 that were delisted for a variety of other reasons, such as an error in the original listing. Meanwhile, 2,105 species have been listed as either threatened or endangered. So, doing the math, 1.3 percent of listed species have ultimately been delisted.. In other words, numerically, Lummis is right -- slightly more than 1 percent of listed species have been taken off the list because they recovered. Is this the only purpose of the act? Experts say that while Lummis was right on the number, they add that the number tells only part of the story. They argue that while delisting is great, it isn’t the primary goal of the law. At root, they say, the law is designed to prevent extinction -- and on that score, the law has been a success. Only one-half of 1 percent of species placed on the list have become extinct, which works out to a success rate of over 99 percent plus. ""By the time species are listed as threatened or endangered, their numbers are so low that preventing extinction is the major challenge, with recovery and delisting a remote consideration,"" said Wm. Robert Irvin, president and CEO of the advocacy group American Rivers. ""The law acts as an emergency room. Recovery requires much longer treatment through actions under the full panoply of conservation laws and programs."" In addition, focusing on delisting ignores species that have seen improvements in viability, but not large enough to justify a delisting. This has been the case for a variety of species, from sea otters to black-footed ferrets. J. Michael Scott, an emeritus professor in the fish and wildlife department of the University of Idaho, said studies suggest that more than half of the endangered and threatened populations are stable or improving, and that percentage increases with the length of time the species has been protected. Such statistics ""suggest that the act is far more successful than the 1 percent figure suggests,"" he said. Our ruling Lummis said that under the Endangered Species Act, ""only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted."" She’s correct, though one could just as easily say that less than 1 percent of the species placed on the list have become extinct, and that many species have improved without being delisted. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C448340>],/factchecks/2013/sep/03/cynthia-lummis/endangered-species-act-percent-taken-off-list/

McCain says a million children are refugees from Syrian civil war
","Most of the debate over a military strike on Syria involves broad strategic questions about stability in the region and defining clear goals for dropping bombs and launching missiles. But one strong supporter of the use of force brought in another factor -- refugees. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has long argued for greater military engagement in Syria on moral grounds, among other reasons. ""It's shameful, while a million children are now refugees, "" McCain said on CBS’ Face the Nation. We didn’t think McCain had the number of refugees wrong. We were simply struck that it was so high. In the past 24 hours, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, announced that the number of refugees had crossed the 2 million mark. For a country with a population of 22.5 million, that means close to 10 percent of its people are in camps or with families outside its borders. António Guterres, the U.N.’s High Commissioner for Refugees, called it ""a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history."" The UNHCR reports that more than half of the registered refugees are children. So McCain’s figure is accurate. If anything, it undercounts the scope of the turmoil. Peter Garrett with the British Red Cross said this only tallies people who have registered with the UNHCR. ""We know there are people who will not have registered for support, for many reasons. They may be afraid of any form of authority or of registering their status,"" Garrett told CNN. The surrounding countries are strained to deal with the outflow. Lebanon has taken in more refugees than any other country, about 720,000. Jordan is not far behind with over half a million, followed by Turkey. In addition, the UNHCR reports said an estimated 4.25 million Syrians have been displaced inside their country. This would mean the conflict has forced nearly one out of every four persons from their homes. With almost all refugees dependent on international organizations for food, blankets and medical people care, the UNHCR is calling for $2.9 billion in aid to meet their needs. Over 1 million new people left Syria in the first five months of 2013. The UNHCR said if current trends continue, the refugee count will top 3 million by the end of this year. Our ruling McCain said the Syrian civil war has turned 1 million children into refugees. More than 2 million people have registered with the UNHCR as refugees and over half of them are children. We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FF7A00>],/factchecks/2013/sep/03/john-mccain/mccain-says-million-children-are-refugees-syrian-c/
"['Ethics', 'Virginia', 'Ken Cuccinelli']","
Cuccinelli says McAuliffe is under investigation
","Confused about all charges of poor ethics that the major gubernatorial candidates are lobbing at each other? Republican Ken Cuccinelli wants to help you out. ""The truth? There’s only one candidate under investigation: Terry McAuliffe,"" the announcer says at the start of a Cuccinelli TV commercial that’s been airing since Aug. 22. We wondered whether that is indeed the truth. The ad comes on the heels of a Quinnipiac University poll that showed McAuliffe, a Democrat, had staked out a 48-42 percent lead over Cuccinelli. The survey showed Cuccinelli is being hurt by voter doubts about his trustworthiness, the likely result of a scandal that has touched him as well as Gov. Bob McDonnell. Cuccinelli accepted $18,000 in gifts from Jonnie Williams, the chief executive of Star Scientific Inc., a nutritional supplement company. Williams was the source for more than $145,000 in gifts and loans for McDonnell and his family, most of which went unreported. Cuccinelli, in April, amended four years of personal disclosure reports he had filed with the state to include $12,000 in gifts he said he forgot to report -- including about $5,000 from Williams. Examining Cuccinelli’s ad claim requires a determination whether either major party candidate is under formal investigation. So let’s start. Is McAuliffe under investigation? Cuccinelli says his claim is based on a recent media reports about GreenTech Automotive, an   electric car company that McAuliffe founded in 2009. McAuliffe quietly resigned as GreenTech’s chairman last December -- an action that wasn’t made public until April -- but continues to be a major stockholder in the struggling company. On Aug. 2, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that GreenTech is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The full scope of the probe has not been made public, but the newspapers said it focuses, at least in part, on GreenTech’s recruitment of foreign investors. GreenTech and a partner company, Gulf Coast Funds Management, sought to raise money for the electric car venture through a federal program, called EB-5, that gives permanent resident visas to foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in a U.S. startup company that creates jobs. The newspapers said the SEC was examining whether GreenTech and Gulf Coast illegally promised foreign investors risk-free returns. GreenTech and Gulf Coast officials have said they have received subpoenas and are cooperating with the investigation. But McAuliffe says the SEC has not contacted him and his only knowledge of the probe comes from newspaper articles. The Post reported on Aug. 22, ""there is no indication McAuliffe is personally under investigation."" Cuccinelli’s campaign, in defending the ad claim, says the investigation targets a time when McAuliffe was GreenTech’s chairman. Anna Nix, a campaign spokeswoman, referred us to an article on the investigation by Breitbart.com. It quotes Douglas Park, a California business attorney, as saying that corporate board members can be held responsible for the actions of their companies and that ""a good plaintiffs’ securities lawyer is going to go after"" McAuliffe. Legal experts we spoke to said the facts are not clear cut. ""There have been plenty of government investigations of corporations that did not involve misconduct by a high level corporate official, and plenty that have focused on misconduct by CEOs or Boards of Directors,"" said John G. Douglass, University of RIchmond law professor, in an email. The only way to know, he said, is when prosecutors announce who is involved. We should note that there’s a second investigation swirling around GreenTech, although Cuccinelli’s campaign did not cite it in defense of its ad. The inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security is investigating whether U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Alejandro Mayorkas gave preferential treatment to GreenTech and some other firms seeking to establish EB-5 programs. Mayorkas, who has been nominated for deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and is going through Senate confirmation hearings, has denied giving GreenTech special treatment. Records show McAuliffe and several of his business partners lobbied Mayorkas to speed consideration of EB-5 applications. But McAuliffe and officials from GreenTech and Gulf Coast Funds said they did not receive any favors and have not been contacted in the Mayorkas probe. So again, there is no evidence that McAuliffe is being personally investigated. Is Cuccinelli under investigation? Cuccinelli’s name has been tied to two probes this year. He initiated the first one on himself in April after amending his disclosure forms to include $12,000 in unreported gifts he received since lated 2009, when he was elected attorney general.  Amid criticism from Democrats, Cuccinelli appointed Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael Herring to investigate whether he had violated state disclosure laws. Herring ended the investigation on July 18 with a nine-page report saying he found ""no evidence"" that Cuccinelli violated any laws or intentionally failed to disclose gifts."" Two days later, PolitiFact Virginia gave a Pants on Fire to McAuliffe’s claim that the probe concluded Cuccinelli ""should have been prosecuted"" but Virginia’s ethics laws are too weak. The second investigation, being conducted by Virginia’s inspector general, focuses on whether a lawyer in Cuccinelli’s attorney general’s office offered legal advice to two energy companies involved in a dispute over paying royalties for natural gas they extracted from private lands.  One of the companies, Consol Energy Inc., has contributed $111,000 to Cuccinelli’s campaign. The probe centers on emails Assistant Attorney General Sharon Pigeon sent to the lawyers for the energy companies. U.S. Magistrate Pamela Mead Sargent wrote in June that the emails ""shockingly"" show that Pigeon ""has been actively involved in assisting"" the companies. Cuccinelli has said that although Pigeon’s emails were ""overzealous,"" they ethically carried out his office’s responsibility of defending the constitutionality of a state law that’s at the center of the royalties dispute. For this Truth-O-Meter, here’s the important thing to remember: Inspector General Michael Morehart has said his investigation focuses on attorneys in Cuccinelli’s office -- not Cuccinelli himself. As noted by The Post, the inspector general is not empowered to initiate investigations of elected officials. We should finally note that there are no reports that a third gubernatorial candidate -- Robert Sarvis, a libertarian  -- is under investigation. Our ruling Cuccinelli said McAuliffe is the only gubernatorial candidate under formal investigation. He cites an SEC probe into the tactics GreenTech Automotive used to attracted foreign investors. McAuliffe was chairman of the electric car company until last December and remains one of its key stockholders. But there has been no indication that McAuliffe is a target of the SEC investigation. The burden of proof falls on Cuccinelli to prove his charge against McAuliffe, and he comes up empty. The good news for Cuccinelli is that we can also say that he is not the focus of any current investigations. The bad news is that we rate his ad claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968A0800>],/factchecks/2013/sep/03/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-under-investigation/
"['Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Cruz statement about Obamacare-caused paperwork--and more than 1,500 Mount Rushmores--draws on flawed Republican-authored analysis
","Ted Cruz, the junior Republican senator from Texas, said the health care overhaul signed into law by President Barack Obama would create mountains--or at least Mount Rushmores--of paperwork. In Senate floor remarks on July 30, 2013, Cruz said: ""According to federal agency estimates, Obamacare will add paperwork burdens totaling nearly 190 million hours or more every year. And... to put that in perspective, Mount Rushmore, which took 14 years to build, could be constructed 1,547 times with the paperwork."" By email, a Tennessee doctor asked us to investigate. Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Utah Sen. Mike Lee have taken center stage in a campaign from the right to ""defund"" changes set to roll out under the Obamacare law. The senators and their supporters declare that otherwise the economy will be gutted. And to spread their message, they’ve released online ads and held town halls. Without a doubt, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 is highly complicated and extensive; the text runs 974 pages. Does it generate millions of hours of paperwork? By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier directed us to the Obamacare Burden Tracker, an 18-page document issued in February 2013 by the Republican sides of three House committees. It states that per six agencies--including the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor and Social Security Administration--the Obamacare law will result in 189,822,836 hours of paperwork a year, plus nearly 80 million once-only hours. Frazier also pointed us to the National Park Service’s website, which says Mount Rushmore was built between Oct. 4,1927, and Oct. 13, 1941, or a little more than 14 years. And, she sent us to a May 7, 2013 Energy and Commerce Committee press release that says those 14 years could be used to construct 1,547 monuments. Here is what we take to be the relevant equation: The Burden Tracker’s 189,822,836 hours divided by 24 comes out to 7,909,284.83 days, equal to 21,669.27 years. Divide that by 14 and you find out that during 21,669.27 years, there are 1,547.8 spans of 14 years. Let’s review the paperwork details, then tackle those mountains. Committee explains tracker The Burden Tracker was described in a Feb. 6, 2013, press release from the Republican side of the Ways and Means Committee as ""a real-time online resource to help the public keep track of all of the new government mandates, rules, and red tape as a result of Obamacare."" The release said that burden would fall on individuals, businesses and health care providers. The tracker was updated in May 2013 and is to be updated every few months, according to Ways and Means Committee spokespeople. When we peeked, the tracker listed 174 separate Obamacare-related paperwork tasks, each one leading to online documentation intended to show the associated paperwork hours. The tracker says, for instance, that according to Health and Human Services and two other agencies, changes to coverage for certain types of care, including contraceptive services, would require 2.5 hours of paperwork each year from health organizations. Meanwhile, regulations for government-funded insurance programs would generate paperwork for hospitals and other groups absorbing 45,982,371 million hours annually, which is the tracker’s largest single entry. By phone, Sarah Swinehart, a staff spokeswoman for the Republican side of the Ways and Means Committee, told us that staff members went through federal documents that list all paperwork associated with the regulations for government-funded insurance programs to reach the 45.98 million figure. We tried to follow similar steps, but ended up with a much smaller sum of several million hours. When we shared our tally with Swinehart, she said the committee didn’t have anyone available to explain in detail how its 45.98 million number was reached. We also couldn’t confirm the smallest paperwork burden of 2.5 hours, which did not appear in the documents referenced in the tracker. Michelle Dimarob, a spokeswoman for the Ways and Means Committee’s Republican office, said by email that most of the paperwork hours came from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is part of the Obama administration’s Office of Management and Budget. Congress created the regulatory office in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Swinehart said committee staff members built the tracker by using a search function on the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website. It allows users to check a box that filters out all paperwork burdens related to the Obamacare law, Swinehart said. In the most straightforward instances, she said, a provision by itself created a paperwork burden. In sticky cases, she said, the law was among several contributing to a paperwork burden, which meant committee staff had to extract the Obamacare-tied burden. To do so, she said, staff looked at documents in the Federal Register, which include paperwork burden estimates. We drew no comment on the accuracy of the tracker from Health and Human Services as well as the OMB and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office and Government Accountability Office. Spokespeople for each agency also said they had not estimated paperwork burdens related to the law. Examining the numbers Federal law defines a burden as the ""time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, or provide information to or for a federal agency."" Burdens can include gathering information, disseminating information to the public and installing technology. For context, the public spent 9.14 billion hours completing paperwork burdens for the federal government in 2011, according to OMB’s 2012 Information Collection Budget, the latest available annual report. Obamacare’s supposed 190 million burden hours would represent a 2.1 percent increase from that 2011 figure. The Obamacare law is not alone in creating significant paperwork burdens, according to the information collection budget. A 2009 change in how investment companies are regulated resulted in 33.5 million hours of additional paperwork a year, a figure that was based on forms that mutual funds had to newly fill out to report information to the public and the IRS. Perhaps a more familiar burden, one that college students and their families bear, is the estimated 26 million hours total it takes to fill out forms used to determine eligibility for financial aid. Before a federal agency can require the public to comply with a paperwork burden, it must seek public comment, and obtain review and approval from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Fabien Levy, a Washington, D.C.-based HHS spokesman, said by email that the health care law reduces some paperwork burdens, noting that applications consumers will use to enroll in health insurance under the law will be ""simple and significantly shortened."" When we looked, the tracker did not refer to reduced paperwork hours from enrollment applications. Among the burdens specified in the tracker are 21.3 million paperwork hours for insurance agencies related to changes in Medicaid eligibility and 10.8 million hours for health plans that will sell insurance under the law. In one case, the tracker suggests paperwork time will drop. New rules limiting how long it takes for insurance benefits to kick in will cut paperwork by 341,000 hours, according to the tracker. To sample the tracker’s accuracy, we looked into three of the largest identified paperwork burdens. Together, these burdens total 75,537,966 hours -- about 40 percent of the 190 million number aired by Cruz. One of those burdens comes from the Obamacare law’s menu-labeling provision requiring chain restaurants and vending machine operators to disclose nutritional information. The tracker says this provision will annually impose 14,068,808 hours in paperwork. A 2011 OMB report backs up that figure, listing it as one of five ""significant burden increases."" Another of the highest paperwork burdens, the 40,189,456 hours created by forms that small employers will use to figure out tax credits for health insurance premiums, was listed in a 2012 OMB report in an appendix attributing the burden to the Obamacare law. Our examination of other sizeable items in the tracker revealed miscalculations. For instance, the tracker overcounted 6.75 million hours it attributes to additional information that hospitals must report. A document from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that increase stems partly from a section of the Obamacare law, but also from the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act. The document also says the 6.75 million hours hospitals spend reporting the information would save them 2.5 million hours they currently put toward giving the same information to accreditation groups. The tracker also incorrectly counted a preliminary estimate that regulations regarding Medicaid eligibility would generate about 11 million hours of paperwork. Health and Human Services updated that figure in March 2012, predicting it would create more than 21 million hours of paperwork. The tracker lists both the original estimate plus the revised one. We noticed as well that some listed burdens are from a college student loan overhaul rolled into the health care law. The tracker counted 2,232,386 hours of new annual paperwork for Stafford and Ford loans. Admittedly, we devoted only a few days to looking over the tracker. Still, it looks like at least  57 million of the listed hours--the 45.98 million that the Ways and Means committee couldn’t explain, plus the miscalculations we found--are factually unsupported or insufficiently documented. On the flip side, we found that at least 75 million hours of paperwork has been forecasted in connection with the Obamacare law. Experts weigh in Other issues may be worth chewing over, outside experts suggested. Donald Arbuckle, who was second-in-command at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs from 1996 to 2006, said by phone that any estimate of a law’s paperwork hours is ""soft"" because each federal agency uses a different method to calculate the hours. Some agencies, he said, are more diligent than others. Arbuckle, a public affairs professor at the University of Texas-Dallas, said that generally, such information helps track government activity. ""Paperwork burdens are usually associated with government red tape, which is bad,"" Arbuckle said. ""Except, one person’s red tape is another person’s accountability. If the government is putting money toward Medicare or Medicaid, using tax dollars, the government needs to be ultra, obsessively responsible"" for ""where that money is going."" Chris Jacobs, a health care analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, emphasized by phone that the Obama administration recognized the large paperwork burdens created by the law by delaying the requirement for some employers to provide insurance to workers. In July 2013, the White House announced that it was delaying from 2014 to 2015 the law’s mandate that businesses with 50 or more full-time employees offer health insurance. In a July 2, 2013, agency blog post, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s assistant secretary for tax policy, Mark J. Mazur, wrote that the employer mandate was delayed because of ""concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively."" Building Mount Rushmores When we turned to the second half of Cruz’s statement--that the time spent on Obamacare paperwork could be used to build Mount Rushmore 1,547 times--we spoke to National Park Service Mount Rushmore spokeswoman Maureen McGee-Ballinger. Cruz’s calculation uses the total number of hours in 14 years--122,640. That assumes, in effect, that one person created Mount Rushmore by working around the clock for 14 years--or any other scenario getting to the hours’ total. McGee-Ballinger said by phone that there are no records of how many worker hours went into Mount Rushmore, which was created in South Dakota at a cost of nearly $990,000 ($15.7 million in 2013 dollars). A web search led us to Lou Del Bianco, who has researched his grandfather Luigi Del Bianco’s role in carving Mount Rushmore. By phone, Del Bianco said that some of the 400 people who built Mount Rushmore--doing tasks like blasting away granite with dynamite or carving the stone--worked only for half a year while others stayed for all 14. Their hours varied greatly, he said, and they didn’t work for about four to six months during the cold. Just to get a handle on how that might affect the numbers, we estimated the total hours if Mount Rushmore had been created by 400 people who each stuck with the project for 12 years, working 40 hours a week (which became the federal standard in 1938) for 32 weeks per year, or about eight months. We got 6,144,000 hours, which means they could build 30 Mount Rushmores in the Burden Tracker’s 189.8 million hours. To cook up a low-end estimate, we tweaked it to 400 people working three years each, putting in 40 hours a week but averaging only about six months of labor in each year -- say, 26 weeks. This time we got 1,248,000 hours, which means those efficient 400 people could build 152 Mount Rushmores in the hours aired by Cruz. When we reached out to Frazier, Cruz’s spokeswoman, about the seeming shortcomings of the tracker and the Mount Rushmore calculation, she did not speak directly to them. In an email, she noted that several lawmakers have relied on the tracker’s paperwork tally. Our ruling Cruz said the Affordable Care Act would ""add paperwork burdens totaling nearly 190 million hours or more every year."" He went on to say that Mount Rushmore could be built 1,547 times over ""with the paperwork."" Based on the 190 million figure, that mount count is ridiculously off, premised on the notion that one person carved the monument around the clock for 14 years--or something equivalent. And about the 190 million hours: the landmark law indeed appears responsible for creating a large amount, at least 75 million hours, of confirmed additional paperwork. However, that total is less than half Cruz’s declared number. The tracker that Cruz relied upon has unexplained holes, miscalculates some burdens and folds in paperwork associated with non-health-care programs such as student loan changes. Significantly, too, we could not tell how the document’s largest single entry--46 million of the declared hours--was calculated. We rate this statement, based on a partially unsupported hour count plus unrealistic Mount Rushmore math, as Mostly False. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Has Portland won more national Constitution contests than any other city?
","PolitiFact Oregon can’t be everywhere, listening to stray statements crying out to be fact checked, so we rely on colleagues to have their ears up and ready. This one comes to us via The Oregonian’s senior political reporter, from a Portland City Club forum with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Portland. The topic was government surveillance. But lucky you, we’re not checking a statement related to spying. The statement we have is way more fun. During the lunchtime program, Blumenauer did some civic boasting about two high schools in his district that have distinguished themselves in an annual contest hosted by the Center for Civic Education, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization based in California. ""I represent the two teams that alternate the national championships. Last year it was Lincoln, this year it's Grant. Who knows what is going to happen (next) year,"" he said. ""But ladies and gentlemen, the City of Portland has won more national Constitution contests than any city in America."" The program is called ""We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution Program,"" and it’s been around since 1987 with its first competition in 1988. High schools compete to display knowledge of the U.S. Constitution and the winning team from each state moves to the finals in Washington, D.C. This year, Grant High School in Northeast Portland placed first in nationals. Last year, Lincoln High School in Southwest Portland won. We asked for a list of winners from the center, and then we did some fancy Excel work -- it’s called cut and paste and sort -- and voila: Results worthy enough for an analysis. We found that four schools have each won First Place in the national championship four times: Lincoln High; East Brunswick High School in East Brunswick, New Jersey; East High School in Denver, Colorado; and Our Lady of Lourdes Academy in Miami, Florida. With Grant High the champion this year, that brings the city of Portland to five First Place finishes, more than any other city in the United States. Blumenauer can proudly claim the distinction. But before we signed off on this fact check, we wanted to make sure of one last angle. Is this the only national Constitution conference? Could there be a rival program that shuts out Portland? We asked the people at the Classroom Law Project, the nonprofit in Oregon that coordinates the state’s We the People program. ""None that I know of.

McAuliffe says Cuccinelli fought law banning missile launchers in airports
","In Republican Ken Cuccinelli’s Virginia, people could walk through airports with loaded missile launchers. So says Terry McAuliffe, Cuccinelli’s Democratic opponent for governor. ""In 2004, Ken Cuccinelli voted against making it a misdemeanor to carry a missile into an airport terminal,"" McAuliffe tweeted on Aug. 23. The tweet contains a picture of an airport sign with the silhouette of a loaded missile launcher.  The sign says: ""Attention Passengers Passengers are now permitted to carry missiles in Virginia airports. Your safety is our priority. --Gov. Ken Cuccinelli."" Underneath the sign, McAuliffe wrote, ""This is Cuccinelli’s Virginia."" We checked whether Cuccinelli really has voted to allow armed missile launchers in airports. McAuliffe is not the only Democrat making this explosive claim. It began Aug. 19 when American Bridge 21st Century, a pro-Democrat PAC, tweeted, ""Missiles in Airports? In 2004, Ken Cuccinelli voted against legislation to ban missiles and guns in airports in Virginia."" That same day, an entity called Terry4Gov tweeted a doctored picture of a smiling, dark-haired, man with a heavy beard carrying a launcher on his shoulder in an airport terminal while a missile rises to his right, tailing smoke. Terry4Gov describes itself on Twitter as an ""unaffiliated grassroots group."" We tried to reach a spokesperson, but group does not offer any contact information. Brian Coy, a spokesman for the Democratic Party, said he does not know anything about Terry4Gov, other than it is not affiliated with the party or McAuliffe’s campaign. The basis for all the claims -- including McAuliffe’s tweet, four days after the others -- is a 2004 bill that banned bringing a ""gun or other weapon designed or intended to propel a missile or projectile of any kind,"" into an airport terminal. That included any ""frame, receiver, muffler, silencer, missile, projectile or ammunition designed for use with a dangerous weapon."" Passengers checking firearms, law enforcement officials and approved airline employees were exempted. ""Critics of the legislation fought unsuccessfully to exempt holders of concealed weapons permits,"" the Roanoke Times said in a March 13, 2004 article. That’s exactly where Cuccinelli, then a state senator, took issue with the legislation. He was concerned that the bill could prevent people with concealed carry permits from possessing their firearms at airport drop-off areas, according to Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli’s gubernatorial campaign. Despite Cuccinelli’s opposition, the legislation passed the Senate on a 23-16 vote and was signed by then-Gov. Mark Warner. There are a few points to make about the bill. First, the state has limited jurisdiction over airports. It can legislate items that may be brought into a terminal, but once a person gets to security checkpoints, federal laws take over. According to Transportation Safety Administration rules, travelers may only transport unloaded firearms in a locked, hard-sided container as checked baggage. All firearms, ammunition and firearm parts, including firearm frames and receivers, are prohibited in carry-on baggage. Another point: The sign in McAuliffe’s tweet implies that  state law defines ""missile"" as a warhead that’s fired from a rocket launcher. But Virginia’s code offers no definition of the term. State laws ban shooting or throwing missiles at vehicles, at or inside buildings and pointing or holding a weapon, including missiles, to induce fear. It also illegal to carry weapons, including missiles, into courthouses unless the person is a law enforcement official on duty. In 2007, Jessica Hall of Jacksonville, N.C. spent two months in a Virginia jail after angrily hurling a large McDonald’s cup filled with ice into the open window of another car in stalled traffic on I-95. Although no one was hurt, a Stafford County jury convicted Hall of maliciously throwing a missile into an occupied vehicle. According to an article in The Washington Post, the jury was instructed that ""any physical object can be considered a missile. A missile can be propelled by force, including throwing."" Finally, it should be noted that automatic firearms and other destructive devices, such as grenades and military-style missiles, are tightly regulated and difficult for individuals to acquire. Such weapons require registration under the National Firearms Act. The size of those weapons are restricted and someone interested in owning automatic firearms or any form of rocketry would need to find a registered dealer, undergo an extensive background check and pay federal taxes to do so. Our ruling McAuliffe, in a tweet bearing a picture of a loaded missile launcher, says ""Cuccinelli voted against making it a misdemeanor to carry a missile into an airport."" In 2004, Cuccinelli was one of 16 people in the 40-member state Senate that voted against a bill barring people from entering an airport terminal carrying a ""gun or other weapon designed or intended to propel a missile or projectile of any kind."" It can be argued that the description does  encompass missile launchers, but that’s an interpretation that doesn’t weigh the debate at the time the bill was considered. A 2004 news article said Senate opponents were concerned that the bill undercut the rights of some gun owners. The article made no mention of missile launchers. McAuliffe’s tweet focuses on the term ""missile"" and suggests that the bill’s purpose was to ban warheads from airports. But the term ""missile"" is undefined in state law and could mean bullets, rocks, or even a cup of soda if it’s thrown maliciously. So there’s a trace of truth to a deeply distorted and inflamed statement by McAuliffe. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C414C80>],/factchecks/2013/sep/03/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-cuccinelli-fought-law-banning-missi/
"['Georgia', 'Congress', 'Health Care', 'Karen Handel']","
Handel's diagnoses Obamacare rule as bad legislation
","U.S. Senate candidate Karen Handel recently highlighted an example of what she considers  hypocrisy in the place where she wants to work. Handel  fired off a couple of emails to supporters attacking two can’t-lose sources of Republican consternation -- Obamacare and Congress. ""Only in Washington could Congress seek and secure a special exception to prevent their health care costs from rising while premiums for thousands of Georgians will go up by as much as 198 percent next year,"" one email read. Another email read: ""Last week, Karen asked Congressmen Jack Kingston, Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey to join her in standing against the special Obamacare exemption negotiated by members of Congress in order to prevent their healthcare premiums from rising. We still haven't heard a peep."" PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state and former candidate for governor, accurately depicted the situation. Did Congress negotiate a special exception or exemption for itself and its staff to prevent their health care premiums from rising? Broun, Gingrey and Kingston, like Handel, are vying for the Republican Party nomination for the Senate. The three U.S. House members have been vocal opponents of the federal health care law, aka Obamacare, which was passed along partisan lines in 2010. The three men have repeatedly voted to repeal it. But those measures have not gotten past the Senate. Handel, who has never run for Congress, has fashioned herself as the only candidate in the crowded field who can shake up Washington and restore some conservative normalcy to Capitol Hill. When Congress passed the health care law, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, included an amendment that required lawmakers and their staffs to buy health insurance through the online exchanges created by the law. Grassley’s amendment was intended to test the commitment of Senate Democrats to the health care law. Would they be as supportive of the law if they had to buy insurance through an exchange? The amendment stayed. The health care law created exchanges for people to buy insurance. A state can create and run its own exchange, it can operate an exchange with the federal government or allow Uncle Sam to handle it. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, like many Republican governors, decided the state should not participate in the exchange program. Members of Congress and their staffs still must obtain coverage from health plans created under Obamacare or through an exchange. In late April, Twitter was atwitter with reports that Congress was negotiating a deal with the Obama administration to exempt itself from the health care law. Not so, Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein explained in April. ""[N]o one is discussing ‘exempting’ congressional staffers from Obamacare,"" he reported. ""They’re discussing creating some method through which the federal government can keep making its current contribution to the health insurance of congressional staffers."" On Aug. 7, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced that members of Congress and some of their staffs will continue to have an employer contribution toward their health insurance premiums. A news release does not mention congressional involvement in the decision. So was Handel wrong about the role of Congress in the arrangement? Far from it, said Handel spokesman Dan McLagan, who sent us several news reports to back up his claim. Reuters reported that House and Senate leaders had been in intense negotiations with the Obama administration to reach an agreement about employer contributions. The Wall Street Journal reported that President Barack Obama told congressional Democrats in a closed-door meeting that he would resolve the matter. Some members of Congress were reportedly worried some of their employees would quit if something wasn’t done. A ""brain drain"" is what they called it. McLagan also forwarded us a news release from U.S. Sen. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, that says congressional leaders were part of the decision. Vitter was not happy about the OPM rule. ""[T]his behind-closed-doors deal, announced right after Congress is safely away from the crime scene on break, was fully supported by establishment Republicans,"" Vitter said. ""When it comes to protecting their own, they find a way to work just beautifully with the Democrats."" PolitiFact Georgia still wondered whether it was correct for Handel’s emails to label the OPM rule as an exemption or an exception? We asked the OPM, and an official there responded by sending us the news release, which contained links to a fact sheet about its plans and other information. In the news release, the OPM said the amount of the employer contribution toward exchange premiums is no more than would otherwise be made toward coverage under the prior health benefits program for members of Congress and eligible staff. McLagan and many conservatives, though, believe this is part of a special exemption for Congress and its staff. McLagan said the health care law did not provide for a continued taxpayer subsidy of health care costs for members of Congress and their staffs. ""This is clearly an exemption. It was done by an administration desperate to keep support of the president's only memorable legislative accomplishment from falling apart. They found a way to exempt Congress from the law. You can call it ‘purple unicorns’ or ‘continuation of purple unicorns’ if you like, but you cannot say that Karen's characterization was inaccurate,"" McLagan said. U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, a Republican from Coweta County, recently wrote an op-ed with his explanation of what happened. He said a technicality in the health care law ended employer contributions to lawmakers and their staffs, forcing them to pay 100 percent of their health care costs. ""What OPM actually did was issue regulations stating the government can continue to make the employer contribution to the health plans of Members of Congress and their staff – exactly as they do right now,"" said the congressman, who is neither a fan of the decision nor the health care law. So where does this leave us? Handel said Congress negotiated itself a special rule to prevent its health care benefits from rising. She’s used the words ""exception"" and ""exemption"" to describe what happened. Congress, according to several news accounts and a GOP senator, was pushing to get this done, although it came from an order by the Obama administration. Most conservatives describe the decision as an exemption. The OPM says the rule is a continuation of past policies for funding health care coverage for congressional workers and their bosses. Handel’s basic claim seems to be in the ballpark.  But it  needs a lot of context to be fully understood. It’s true that members of Congress and some of their staffs will continue to have an employer contribution toward their health insurance premiums. But they will also still have to go through the health care exchanges like other people. We rate Handel’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979FA8C0>],/factchecks/2013/sep/03/karen-handel/handels-diagnoses-obamacare-rule-bad-legislation/
"['Debt', 'State Budget', 'Transportation', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Kathleen Vinehout']","
Gov. Scott Walker responsible for record debt payments, Democratic rival says
","Could Gov. Scott Walker, preparing for a 2014 re-election campaign and a possible presidential bid, be credibly branded as a big-time debtor? We know Walker helped balance his first state budget, for 2011-'13, by pushing off some payments on the state’s debt further into the future. Now, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout (D-Alma), who is considering her own run for governor, contends Walker’s move means this for the 2013-’15 budget: General fund tax dollars -- money used for schools and colleges, BadgerCare, local governments, prisons and more -- are being used to make debt payments at the highest rate in state history. Vinehout, who ran for the Democratic nomination to challenge Walker in the 2012 recall election, blasted the budgeting done by Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature in an Aug. 24, 2013 opinion column in The Capital Times of Madison and in an earlier blog post. In a section of the column about debt, Vinehout criticized the amount of borrowing and the restructuring of debt payments done by Walker. ""In the depths of the recession, Gov. Jim Doyle delayed debt payments to gain cash and keep government going. In the 2011-’13 legislative session, Gov. Scott Walker did not pay an even larger amount of debt payments coming due. Because debt payments were not made, more money goes to pay off debt in (the 2013-’15) budget than ever before,"" Vinehout wrote. Walker’s 2013-’15 budget, she added, ""pays that price in a greater percent of tax dollars going to pay off debt than ever before in our history."" Is Vinehout right that because Walker pushed principal payments on the state’s debt into future years, a higher percentage of general tax dollars is going to debt payments than ever before? Walker’s first budget  The rationale for borrowing for capital projects is well understood. Costs can be spread out over years, so that future users of a new highway, for example, help pay the tab for building it. Borrowing, instead of paying cash for a major project, can also alleviate the need for a tax increase. But as any borrower knows, repaying debt -- or bonds, as they’re known in the state’s case -- can take a bite out of your operating budget. Like Vinehout, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, Walker’s Democratic opponent in the recall election, criticized the debt payment restructuring Walker did. We rated Mostly True Barrett’s claim that Walker ""pushed over $500 million in debt onto our children and grandchildren"" to help balance the 2011-’13 state budget. What the Republican governor did was issue new debt in order to make $558 million in debt payments that were due in 2011 and 2012. That freed up more general fund money to help balance the 2011-’13 budget. But pushing more principal payments some 20 years into the future also meant accumulating more interest costs. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau -- cited by both political parties as the best neutral source on state financial matters -- estimates that Walker’s debt will add $156 million in interest costs.   Vinehout’s evidence As for Vinehout’s claim, there are essentially two parts. She says the percentage of general tax dollars -- as opposed to gas tax money, for example -- that are being used toward debt payments is the highest ever, and that Walker’s debt restructuring is largely responsible for it. Vinehout provided us a June 2013 memo she requested from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau which estimates that for the current budget year -- 2013-’14 -- 5.26 percent of general fund revenues will be used to pay off bonds. The fiscal bureau confirmed to us that 5.26 percent is the highest such figure on record, based on figures dating back to 1970. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson didn’t dispute the figure, but pointed out that Vinehout voted for debt restructuring under Doyle. The 5.26 percent translates into $738 million in general fund tax dollars that are being used in the 2013-’14 budget period on debt payments. That exceeds the state’s historical target, which is to allocate no more than 4 percent of general fund revenues to debt payments. So, the best available data support Vinehout’s statistical claim. Debt restructuring As for assigning responsibility, Vinehout conceded in her column that, like Walker, Doyle also stretched out debt payments in order to manage the state budget. But she suggested Walker's restructuring is what led to the record rate of general fund spending on debt payments. Experts from the fiscal bureau, the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project and the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, however, told us that factors other than Walker's debt payment restructuring also play a role. Doyle and Walker, and governors before them, have done long-term borrowing that is still being repaid. In other words, much of the debt, and debt payments, were inherited by Walker from previous governors -- something Vinehout acknowledged to us in an interview. Another factor that occurred under both Doyle and Walker is an increase in bond issues that are repaid with general fund dollars, rather than simply gas taxes and related funds, to do major transportation projects. Our rating Vinehout said that because of Walker’s budgeting, a greater percentage of general tax dollars is ""going to pay off debt than ever before in our history."" The 5.26 percent of general fund revenues being used for debt payments in the 2013-’14 budget period is the highest on record. It's reached that level partly because of the borrowing and debt restructuring under Walker, but also because of similar actions by previous governors. For a partially accurate statement that leaves out important information, we rate Vinehout’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976F3900>],/factchecks/2013/sep/02/kathleen-vinehout/gov-scott-walker-responsible-record-debt-payments-/

Cory Booker supports late-term abortion, opposes safety regulations groups claim
","U.S. Senate hopeful Cory Booker supports a woman’s right to choose, according to his campaign website. But to hear two conservative groups tell it, Booker supports much more than choice. The American Commitment Action Fund, a conservative Political Action Committee behind the #BookerFAIL website, and the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti abortion-rights group, funded a new ad that claims Booker, a Democrat and Newark’s mayor, condones abortion at any stage of pregnancy and without restrictions. ""He supports late-term and partial-birth abortion and opposes safety regulations,"" the ad states. Conservative activist Steve Lonegan is Booker’s challenger in an Oct. 16 special election for a Senate seat left vacant after Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg’s death in June. The groups say Booker’s support of the Democratic National Committee’s platform gives credence to their claim, but the Truth-O-Meter has determined there’s a little more to this story than what the ad portrays. Let’s begin by reviewing how the groups came to identify Booker’s supposed support of late-term and partial-birth abortions, and opposition to safety regulations. Mallory Quigley, communications director for the Susan B. Anthony group, directed us to Booker’s support of the national committee’s platform. ""We’re taking a look at the Democratic Party platform which unequivocally supports a woman’s right to choose without any restrictions and regardless of ability to pay,"" Quigley said. ""That was supported by Booker and a host of others."" Indeed, the ad shows a clip from Booker’s Sept. 4, 2012 address during a Planned Parenthood rally at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C ""I was a co-chair for the DNC platform, when we affirmed a woman's right to choose,"" Booker said during the rally. So Quigley is correct that Booker and others supported the Democratic National Committee platform and women having the right to choose. Now let’s review the national committee’s platform on abortion. The platform makes no mention of specific procedures such as late-term or partial-birth abortion, and states support for a woman’s right to make decisions about her pregnancy, ""including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay,"" according to a statement from the Democratic National Committee. The committee also supports a woman’s decision to carry a pregnancy to term. ""We strongly and unequivocally support a woman's decision to have a child by providing affordable health care and ensuring the availability of and access to programs that help women during pregnancy and after the birth of a child, including caring adoption programs,"" the platform states. Next, we checked with Booker campaign spokesman Kevin Griffis about the mayor’s stance on abortion. ""We can all agree that we want to prevent unintended pregnancies, and therefore the need for abortion,"" Griffis said in an e-mail. ""Fundamentally, Mayor Booker believes that a woman's health decisions should remain between her and her doctor.

Robin Vos says higher speed limits on rural interstates have proven safe in nearby states
","Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, gunned into the fast lane after a colleague proposed raising the speed limit on Wisconsin’s rural interstate highways from 65 to 70 mph. Vos embraced the idea as an overdue time-saver for drivers -- and he sought to head off criticism that higher speeds could kill. ""We see all the states around us, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa already have 70, and just this last week Democrat Gov. Quinn signed the bill into law in Illinois,"" Vos said Aug. 22, 2013, on Wisconsin Public Television’s ""Here and Now"" program. ""So it makes no sense not to have Wisconsin join this group."" Vos added: ""And certainly as we’ve driven in other states, we see that they’ve been able to do it safely. Most of the interstates were designed for 75 miles an hour anyway because they were done a long time ago and they were reduced just for fuel economy. So I think the safety standards are in place, and we can do it in a way that makes sense for all of us."" Vos was more emphatic in other comments to reporters, as quoted in the Journal Sentinel, saying that in the three states he cited: ""We haven't seen any issues there."" We’ll examine his safety claim here and tackle the historical statement in a separate item. Where things stand For starters, most states are already at 70 or 75 mph. There are 13 at 65 mph, according to tracking by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Of those, Wisconsin is the only state outside the northeast, west coast and Alaska where 65 is the limit on rural interstates. Only Hawaii is lower, with a speed limit of 60. As more and more states have raised their limits, a flurry of sometimes-conflicting studies has tried to tease out the role of speed in vehicle-crash trends. In reviewing the research in 2013, the Council of State Governments noted that most policy makers and researchers agree that physics means higher speeds can cause more and more deadly accidents. But the council noted, ""Intense debate still surrounds the idea that speed-limit hikes alone make roadways more dangerous."" The challenge, an Indiana study said, is ""unraveling the effects of speed-limit changes from factors such as speed enforcement; vehicle miles traveled; vehicle occupancy; seat-belt usage; alcohol use; proportions of passenger cars, minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles; and vehicle safety features, such as airbags and antilock brakes."" With that in mind, let’s look specifically at the three states Vos cited. Iowa: The Department of Transportation in Iowa, where 70 became law in 2005, surveyed crash trends elsewhere and reported its findings in early 2006. ""The evidence in this study and the previous seven annual comparison studies indicates that raising the speed limit in Midwestern states in the United States has resulted in an increase in traffic fatalities in the years following that increase,"" the department said. Iowa saw the same in the short-term aftermath of its change, according to a study that examined the 2.5 years before and after the change. Fatal and major-injury crashes increased on average from 78.8 to 90.8 per year, resulting in a 15.2 percent increase, an Iowa State study found. The study showed that early in Iowa’s own experience with 70, crashes at all severity levels increased compared to the same period before the change. And compared to a much longer period before the change, fatal and other serious across-the-median crashes rose faster than random variations in the annual data, the Iowa State researchers found in 2009. But the same Iowa State study -- also cited by Vos -- casts doubt on the significance of the simple numerical findings. More rigorous statistical testing found ""no statistically significant increase in crashes,"" the study said. It concluded: ""While it is likely changes were due to the speed-limit change (as the only significant highway safety–related public policy change in Iowa since 2004 has been the change to 70 mph on rural Interstates), the findings presented herein are necessarily observations of correlation only."" The study acknowledged that looking at only 2.5 years ""may not provide an adequate base of data for a reliable statistical analysis."" In addition, other factors such as changing economic conditions and high fuel prices may have impacts that mask any speed limit–related changes, it said. More recently, the Des Moines Register reported in Sept. 4, 2012 that 10 percent more people had died on Iowa's interstate highways since the state raised the speed limit to 70 mph -- even though fatalities on all Iowa roads in 2011 were at the lowest level since World War II. The paper quoted Col. Patrick Hoye of the Iowa State Patrol, who said the Iowa statistics bore out warnings by traffic safety planners. ""Any time you raise speeds, an accident has a greater risk for injury and death. The other thing that we see quite often on the interstates is that people are just following too closely, and at higher speeds that just makes the situation that much worse,"" Hoye said. We asked Iowa’s top traffic safety official, Steve Gent, about the speed limit change. Gent didn’t like the idea of the speed-limit hike, but has tempered his feelings. He told us that safety problems from 70 mph were ""not as bad as we thought."" More people are driving near average speeds, and fewer at very high or low speeds. That scenario is associated with safer driving. In fact, the study found that speeding was reduced, and that speeds -- on average -- increased only about 2 mph. Still, Gent said, the statistics suggest some negative safety aspects. Michigan: Michigan went to 70 in 1996 and 1997. Truck speed limits are lower. A 2000 study by Michigan State University found that total traffic crashes increased in the three years after the change -- but traffic volume increased faster. Fatal crashes went up 4.5 percent, but the combination of fatals and major-injury crashes actually fell, presumably due to increased seat belt use and airbags, the report said. Travel speeds rose only about 1 to 2 mph over three years, considering all vehicles. Overall, the study concluded: ""Raising the speed limit appears to have had little effect"" on speed or crash frequency. ""Nothing really happened"" in those three years, the author of the study, MSU engineering professor William C. Taylor, told us. ""The signs changed. A few of the slower people drove a little faster. But (driving at faster speeds) didn’t change at all."" Vos cited no studies on Michigan accident statistics, but did cite comments in the media by a Michigan State Patrol traffic safety official that slower is not necessarily safer on interstates. Minnesota: The state raised the speed limit on rural interstates from 65 to 70 mph in 1997. A Minnesota DOT study found that during the five years immediately following the increase (1998-2002) there was a 24 percent increase in all crashes on interstates where speed limits were increased, Kevin Gutknecht, the department’s communications director told us. There was a 70 percent increase in fatal crashes in the same locations, a DOT spokesman said. The comparison period was 1992-96. The situation was much improved when DOT compared 2007-2011 to pre-change time period. For the same locations, there was a 1 percent increase in all interstate crashes and a 19 percent increase in fatal crashes. During the 2007-2011 period, roadway engineering safety improvements, vehicle safety enhancements and changes in laws have contributed to a downturn in fatal and serious crashes, Gutknecht said. The agency’s website, we noted, advises motorists that lowering speed limits will not necessarily reduce speeds or cut crash frequencies. The comments are not specific to interstates. ""The driver is much more influenced by the roadway conditions,"" the DOT site says. ""Although lowering the speed limit is often seen as a cure-all in preventing crashes, this is not the case. Crashes are most often the result of driver inattention and driver error. However, if a posted speed limit is unrealistically low, it creates a greater speed variance (i.e. some drivers follow the speed limit while most drive the reasonable speed). This speed variance can contribute to crashes."" Vos cited no Minnesota studies. Our rating Vos said ""Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa already have 70 mph"" speed limits on rural interstates, and ""we see that they’ve been able to do it safely."" Vos goes too far with the blanket statement. We found numbers suggesting otherwise in two states, and a key Iowa official attributes some negative safety impact to the change. But the Michigan experience fits his description, and researchers in Iowa cast doubt on the significance of the speed-limit change in the uptick in fatalities there. So there’s some gas in his claim’s tank. Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097096200>],/factchecks/2013/sep/01/robin-vos/robin-vos-says-higher-speed-limit-rural-interstate/

Commentator Steven Frias says once tolls paid off the construction bonds for the Newport Bridge, it was supposed to be toll free
","One of the most contentious issues of 2013, at least among residents of the eastern half of Rhode Island, is the question of whether there should be a toll on the new Sakonnet River Bridge. In an Aug. 14, 2013, commentary in The Providence Journal, Steven Frias, a lawyer and the state's Republican National Committeeman, argued that Rhode Island should use the revenue from its gasoline tax and motor vehicle fees exclusively to maintain its bridges and roads. We were intrigued by this statement: ""When the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority was first created in 1954, it was supposed to exist only until the bonds used to build the Newport Bridge were paid off through tolls. Once the bonds were paid, the Newport Bridge was to be transferred to the State of Rhode Island and become toll-free."" The state has always charged a toll on that span, now officially known as the Pell Bridge. We were curious about the accuracy of Frias' characterization. When we contacted Frias, he sent us 34 pages from Chapter 3390, the 1954 act creating the authority. It authorized the construction of the Newport Bridge, the acquisition of the Jamestown Bridge, and the construction of a turnpike for the bridge that could run from Connecticut, through Washington County to the Massachusetts border. It also gave the authority the right to finance, ""maintain, repair and operate"" any of those projects, along with the ability to issue new bonds and collect tolls of any amount at any and all points along the project. The law is silent about ending tolls on the Newport Bridge, which opened June 28, 1969, although Section 17 dictates that ""No tolls shall be charged for traffic over the Jamestown Bridge after December 31, 1970."" On that date, the Jamestown Bridge, which has since been replaced, was to become property of the state, without any money being owed on it. Frias, asked about his statement, focused on that section, which also says that once the authority has paid off all its bonds or set aside enough money to cover those bonds, ""all other projects financed under the provisions of this act shall be transferred to the state in good condition and repair, and thereupon the authority shall be dissolved . . . "" So the law did call for eventually turning everything, including the Newport Bridge, over to the state. But, once again, there is no mention of ending any other tolls. In fact, the law doesn't specifically dictate that the Newport Bridge have a toll. The authority has continued to exist to maintain the bridge, now 44 years old. RITBA chairman David Darlington said the authority currently has about $50 million in bonds that remain to be paid off, and that indebtedness is expected to continue because the state doesn't have the funds to take over and maintain the bridge. (The current bonds mature in 2017.) Frias said his statement is correct because the original legislation makes it clear that the intent was to eventually transfer ownership of the Newport Bridge to the state. The bridge would then have to be toll free, he argued, because the state, at the time, had not given itself the authority to levy tolls on roadways. ""This is inherent in the law,"" he said. ""An intent to transfer ownership of a bridge to an entity that has no legal authority to impose tolls, at the time the legislation was first enacted, is an intent to make that bridge a toll-free (bridge)."" That strikes us as a stretch, especially when the law specifically talks about transferring the Jamestown Bridge to the state and making it toll free. If the act of transference automatically meant that no tolls could be charged, as Frias asserts, there would be no need to mention ending the Jamestown bridge toll.   We also checked with Thomas Evans, the state librarian, who pointed out that the act creating the Mount Hope Bridge Authority, also passed in 1954, also contains language that calls for the project to be turn over to the state AND be toll free after Dec. 31, 1969. (East Bay residents will note that the bridge subsequently carried a toll until 1998.) Frias was not dissuaded. He said it was necessary to specify a date for the Jamestown and Mount Hope bridges to become toll-free because, unlike the Newport Bridge, they were in existence in 1954. ""It makes no sense that the Newport Bridge would have a toll on it once it was transferred over to the state,"" he said. ""The state had not given itself legal authority to impose a toll in 1954 (nor has it since then) therefore a bridge owned by the State is synonymous with a bridge that cannot have a toll."" Legal interpretations aside, it seems that the public perception at that time was that the Newport Bridge toll would go away eventually. Frias produced a copy of an article in the March 11, 1963, edition of The Evening Bulletin, headlined ""Newporters Pressing for Span."" Part of it reports on arguments of ""the bridge advocates,"" saying, ""And when the new bridge finally was paid for, they add, the state would come into ownership of a valuable property, a toll-free bridge across the East Passage."" Darlington said that when he was appointed to the RITBA board in 2002, ""My dad said, 'Those tolls were supposed to come off that bridge when it was paid for. It has to be well paid for by now. Go down and get those tolls taken off that bridge.'"" ""Then, when you find out what it costs to maintain the bridges, the state doesn't have anything like the money that's required,"" Darlington said. ""It's so enormous, and you have to focus on them year after year because if you let a bridge go three, four, or five years, you have to start planning a new bridge. So it's really not practical."" Our ruling Steven Frias said that ""When the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority was first created in 1954, it was supposed to exist only until the bonds used to build the Newport Bridge were paid off through tolls. Once the bonds were paid, the Newport Bridge was to be transferred to the State of Rhode Island and become toll-free."" The first sentence accurately characterizes the 1954 legislation. The big question is whether the bridge was supposed to eventually be toll-free. Despite what the public believed and Frias is inferring, there was no mandate in the 1954 legislation to end tolls on the Newport Bridge once the state took ownership. Perhaps other historians have additional evidence that will cause us to rethink our ruling. But for now, while most of Frias' statement is true, the key element regarding tolls on the Newport Bridge is open to serious question. For that reason, we rule it Mostly True.

Beck says 45 percent of physicians would quit if health reform passes
","Physicians are important players in the health care debate. They've been courted by both supporters and opponents of the Democratic reform plan. President Barack Obama held a Rose Garden ceremony with some of them recently. And now opponents of the Democratic health care plan are citing poll results that supposedly show that lots of doctors would be so unhappy with the reforms that they'd quit their jobs.

Fox News Channel political commentator Glenn Beck mentioned this on his Oct. 12, 2009, show during a wide-ranging critique of the Democratic plan. He said that the plan could harm doctors financially and make medical students have doubts about pursuing the profession. ""Do you really think that you're going to see an increase in medical students? I don't think so,"" Beck said. ""Especially consider that the percentage of doctors who say they'll quit if this is passed is only 45 percent. No worries. Ha! You'll be able to find a good doctor. Really, you will.""
 
If true, the sudden departure of 45 percent of the nation's doctors would indeed constitute a stinging rejection of the Democratic effort by an influential health care constituency. But that number sounded high to us, so we decided to look into the statistic's origins.
 
It came from a survey of ""practicing physicians"" published in mid September. The survey was sponsored by the newspaper  Investor's Business Daily  and was done by the firm TechnoMetrica Institute of Policy and Politics, or TIPP. The survey was conducted between Aug. 28, 2009, and Sept. 15, 2009. It was mailed to 25,600 physicians nationwide at addresses purchased from a list broker.
 
We found several problems with the poll and the way Beck described its results:

•  Beck misstated what the poll asked  . Beck said that 45 percent of doctors will quit. But in fact, the poll found that 45 percent of doctors said they will consider quitting. Considering quitting isn't the same thing as quitting, which makes Beck's statement a significant exaggeration.
 
In addition, the specific question asked of respondents was, ""If Congress passes their health care plan, will you ... continue your practice, [or] consider leaving your practice or taking an early retirement?"" This wording leaves open the possibility that respondents are saying they might simply leave their current practice to join another practice, rather than quit.
 
• The poll had a low response rate  . According to the statistics published in  IBD  , 1,376 practicing physicians responded to the poll, out of the 25,600 solicited nationally. That's a 5.4 percent response rate. In one of its articles about the poll,  IBD  bills this as ""a high rate of return, considering how difficult doctors are to get hold of."" But another survey of doctors released around the same time managed to do better — much better.
 
That other survey was conducted by Salomeh Keyhani and Alex Federman, internists and researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, who published the results in the  New England Journal of Medicine  . They mailed 5,157 questionnaires and got a response rate that exceeded 43 percent — nearly eight times the  IBD  survey's rate. In fact, Keyhani and Federman reached almost 50 percent more doctors despite sending out only one-fifth the number of inquiries. (They did not ask doctors if they would consider quitting as the other poll did.) Does a higher response rate matter? In this case, it's hard to know for sure, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. However, she added, ""higher response rates give me more confidence in results,"" a point echoed by other experts we interviewed.
 
• The sponsor was listed prominently on the survey, possibly influencing who responded  . The survey was sent out on  Investor’s Business Daily  letterhead, and the introduction said in part, ""The results of this survey will be on  Investor’s Business Daily’s  front page and investors.com. A press release will also be prepared. This will give doctors a voice in this key issue.""
 
This type of framing matters because  IBD  's editorial page is known for its conservative stance, including opposition to the Democratic health care effort.
 
While it’s safe to assume that not everyone who received the survey knew about  IBD  's political leanings, some respondents presumably did — and among those who did, such knowledge could have made a difference in determining who responded. Liberals might have been less likely to respond, while conservatives in tune with the  IBD  editorials would have been more enthusiastic about responding. In such a small sample, even a modest bias of that sort could skew the results. • The wording of questions may have influenced who responded  . In an interview, Mark Blumenthal, who blogs at pollster.com and has written critically of the  IBD  poll, said the wording of the questions could have skewed the results.

He noted that, unlike telephone polls, mail polls enable the recipient to skim the entire list of questions before deciding to answer any of them. With the  IBD  poll, respondents might have thought some of the questions had a subtext that was critical of the Democratic proposal.

One was, ""Do you believe the government can cover 47 million more people and it will cost less money and the quality of care will be better?"" Another was, ""If Congress passes their plan, do you expect fewer students to apply to med schools in the future [or] more students to apply to med schools in the future?"" A third was, ""Under a government plan, do you think drug companies will have incentives to continue developing as many life saving new drugs?"" (Grammatical errors in original;  full survey text available here.)

""Collectively, these questions imply that health care reform will mean very bad things for medicine,"" Blumenthal said. ""I'm guessing that a proreform doctor would be inclined to ignore, and not return, a survey if the questions seem leading or biased."" Could the prominence of the  IBD  name and the question wording have made a difference? The evidence suggests that may be true.

In the  IBD  poll, 65 percent of the doctors who responded said they opposed ""government's proposed health care plan"" while just 33 percent supported it. By contrast, the Keyhani-Federman poll found that 63 percent of doctors surveyed favored giving patients a choice between public and private insurance, as congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama have advocated. Another 10 percent said they favored a single-payer health care system — a solution that is actually to the left of the president. In other words, the results of the two polls are so far apart that they are essentially opposites.

The truth may actually lie somewhere in between the two surveys. It's worth noting that the Keyhani-Federman poll received financial support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which favors health care reform. Also, National Public Radio has said that ""Keyhani and Federman belong to ... the National Physicians Alliance. It supports a public option, and Keyhani has spoken publicly about her own support for a public option."" A campaign finance database search found that both researchers donated to the Obama campaign in 2008 — $500 from Keyhani and $300 from Federman.

In addition, the initial postcard Keyhani and Federman sent to doctors included the subheading, ""Congress wants to hear from doctors on health care reform"" — advocacy-style language similar to what the  IBD  poll said. This may have produced some ideological bias in the opposite direction from  IBD  's poll. (In an interview, Federman said the reason for choosing the words they did stemmed from ""what the literature shows about what works to get docs to respond to surveys."")

Finally, Don Dillman, an expert in mail-based polls and a professor at Washington State University, suggests another factor that could make the  IBD  poll results on doctors quitting vastly overstated: People don't usually make decisions about changing careers lightly. ""If one is trained to be a physician, then are you going to take on another occupation?"" he asks. This concern is especially relevant for younger physicians, who would likely find few new careers that would earn them enough income to pay off their debts from attending medical school.
 
So, back to Beck's statement. First, he misstated the results of the poll. The survey didn't say 45 percent would quit; it said they would consider quitting, which is considerably different. Moreover, polling experts have raised significant questions about the poll's methodology. Of special concern are the combination of the heavy mention of  IBD  's name and questions that experts said appeared to be seeking answers critical of health reform. We'd like to see an independent poll assessing doctors' views of health care reform, but neither the findings from the  IBD  survey nor those from the Keyhani-Federman study are fully persuasive to us. We rate Beck's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F917C0>],/factchecks/2009/oct/15/glenn-beck/beck-says-45-percent-physicians-would-quit-if-heal/

E-mail claims Iowa policy seeks to round up Iowans who might be exposed to the swine flu
 ","
Patty Quinlisk, medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health, has been amazed by the amount of misinformation and blatant lies swirling around about the H1N1 virus and the federal plans to distribute a vaccine.
 
But even she was a bit thrown when a man called last month and asked her whether Iowa was creating concentration camps for people with H1N1. Seriously.
 
""We don't have concentration camps here in Iowa,"" she said.
 
And then she sighed.
 
""Those are words I never thought I'd have to say.""
 
The rumor spread wide enough that the Iowa Department of Public Health felt the need to isssue a press release on Aug. 31 to knock it down. We're not sure what version of the chain e-mail the department got, but here at PolitiFact, a reader sent us one that claimed, ""The state of Iowa has an internal document that was recently leaked on the Internet that ... provides for a state round up of Iowa citizens who might be exposed to the swine flu virus.""
 
The e-mail links to a

""Facility Quarantine Order.""

 
It's a legitimate document, a template to be used in the event that Iowa ever did decide to quarantine people.
 
It reads, in part: ""The Iowa Department of Public Health (Department) has determined that you have had contact with a person with Novel Influenza A H1N1. Novel Influenza A H1N1 is a disease which is spread from person to person and is associated with fever (greater than 100.0 F), cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea (runny nose), nasal congestion, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Novel Influenza A H1N1 presents a risk of serious harm to public health and if it spreads in the community severe public health consequences may result.
 
""The Department has determined that it is necessary to quarantine your movement to a specific facility to prevent further spread of this disease. The Department has determined that quarantine in your home and other less restrictive alternatives are not acceptable because — insert the reason home quarantine is not acceptable, the person violated a previously issued home quarantine order, the person does not have an appropriate home setting conducive to home quarantine, etc. The Department is therefore ordering you to comply with the following provisions during the entire period of quarantine.""
 
You set that to ominous music under a title calling them ""concentration camps,"" as some have done in YouTube videos, and it comes off as pretty scary.
 
Here's the response from Iowa officials: ""To ensure there is no confusion on this issue, Iowa Department of Public Health wants to make it clear that Iowa has not issued any isolation and quarantine orders for novel influenza A (H1N1), and has no plans to issue any this fall.


""In preparation for public health emergencies, these types of templates are often prepared in case they are needed, but isolation and quarantine orders are only very rarely used in very specific situations.""
 
The templates were prepared when H1N1 first reared up in Mexico, when it was feared to be much more deadly than it turned out to be, Quinlisk said.
 
""As soon as we realized it wasn't that bad, or at least that it was similar to the seasonal flu, that was the end of that,"" she said.
 
There are a couple of other claims in the e-mail we received. One is that Massachusetts state officials are ""in the process of passing a law that will mandate vaccines for the swine flu.""


According to the chain e-mail, the bill would allow "" 'authorities' to impose vaccinations. If you refuse, they can haul you away into quarantine. If you refuse that, you'll be fined up to $1,000 per day, and possibly be incarcerated in prison for 30 days.""
 
On Oct. 8, the Massachusetts legislature did sign off on a bill to tighten the powers of public health officials to isolate or quarantine people to contain the outbreak of serious contagious diseases.
 
But that doesn't translate to ""a law that will mandate vaccines for the swine flu.""
 
In fact, said Jennifer Manley, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department of Health, ""There will absolutely, positively

not

be any mandatory vaccines for the H1N1 virus in Massachusetts.""
 
Most states have laws more than 100 years old that allow people who pose a public health danger to be isolated or quarantined, Quinlisk said. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many states looked into updating those laws to ensure, among other things, that people's civil rights are not violated. Some have clearly misinterpreted those efforts and assigned them insidious intent, she said.
 
No states are considering quarantining people with H1N1.
 
""Quarantine is a public health tool that is primarily used to keep well people who have been potentially exposed to a serious illness away from others who may be susceptible,"" said Christine Pearson with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""It's particularly effective when a new disease has not yet been introduced into our country. Given that the virus is already widespread in the United States and worldwide and is presenting the same sort of disease we see with regular seasonal flu, CDC does not intend to issue quarantine or isolation orders for 2009 H1N1 flu at this time.""
 
The chain e-mail claims that the Iowa policy ""provides for a state round up of Iowa citizens who might be exposed to the swine flu virus."" The fact is that there is no mandatory order that all Iowa residents be vaccinated against H1N1, let alone a policy seeking to round up and detain people those refuse. We rule this claim False.

Chain e-mail claims the Obamas plan to change a holiday tradition
","
On the Internet, the ""war against Christmas"" wages on — or at least that's what the e-mails claim.

 

A chain e-mail says that the Obama White House is renaming Christmas trees ""holiday trees.""

 

""We have a friend at church who is a very talented artist. For several years she, among many others, has painted ornaments to be hung on the various White House Christmas trees,"" the e-mail begins. ""She got her letter from the WH recently. It said that they would not be called Christmas trees this year. They will be called Holiday trees. And, to please not send any ornaments painted with a religious theme... Just thought you should know what the new residents in the WH plan for the future of America.""

 

""This isn't a rumor; this is a fact,"" the e-mail says.

 

We always get suspicious when we hear statements like that.

 

It is true that the White House has long commissioned tree ornaments. In 1969, first lady Pat Nixon asked disabled workers in Florida to make velvet and satin balls featuring each state's flower, according to the White House Historical Association. And in 1974, first lady Betty Ford commissioned Appalachian women and senior citizen groups to craft ornaments that emphasized thrift and recycling. And for her first year in the White House, first lady Laura Bush asked artists from all 50 states and the District of Columbia to design replicas of historic homes and houses of worship to hang on the tree.

 

Nevertheless, the Bush administration came under scrutiny for its own politically correct holiday traditions.

 

In 2005, then-press secretary Scott McClellan was asked why the media Christmas party had been changed to the media ""holiday"" party. Here's what he had to say:

 

McClellan: ""I don't know that that's accurate, that the Bush White House eliminated ...""

 

Reporter: ""It is. Yes, it's no longer Christmas. It says, 'holiday.' ""

 

McClellan: ""This is a time to welcome people of all faiths, and all those who are celebrating the holiday season. The president just yesterday dedicated the National Christmas Tree to our men and women in uniform.""

 

In the same year, Laura Bush was asked whether she had any misgivings about calling the White House Christmas tree a Christmas tree.

 

""Well, no, not really,"" she said. ""At this season we know that Americans celebrate the season in a lot of different ways. We'll have a Hanukkah party, Hanukkah reception here at the White House later during the month. But I think we've always called this the White House Christmas tree.""

 

The Bush White House also recognized Kwanzaa, a holiday traditionally celebrated in African-American communities, and held an annual children's ""holiday"" party.

 

For the current administration's part, White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield says the tree tradition isn't changing.

 

""There is no truth to this, and the letter referenced in the e-mail does not exist,"" she said. ""No letter has gone out yet from the White House pertaining to Christmas tree ornaments.""

 

She added, ""The trees in the White House will be called Christmas trees, and the tree on the Ellipse will be called the National Christmas Tree. There will be no name changes.""

 

So all this chain e-mail deserves is a lump of coal and a Pants on Fire!

Glenn Beck warns that in 1970s, flu shots caused neurological problems
","Radio and talk show host Glenn Beck has said he doesn't want to share his personal take on whether he will immunize his family with the H1N1 vaccine — the stakes are too high either way to give a personal opinion, he says — but he and some of his guests have repeatedly raised concerns about the safety of the vaccine. On his radio show on Oct. 8, Beck said, ""You don't know if this (the H1N1 vaccine) is gonna cause neurological damage like it did in the 1970s."" Beck refers here to a concern often raised by vaccine opponents, so we decided to give the claim some scrutiny. It is rooted in a 1976 swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix in New Jersey, which resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier. President Gerald Ford initiated a massive immunization effort that resulted in some 45 million Americans getting a swine flu vaccine. The flu never went beyond Fort Dix, and the immunization program was halted, but among those who got the vaccine, more than 500 people got a rare neurological illness called Guillain-Barre Syndrome, an auto-immune disease that affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis. Two dozen people died from it. Understandably, many Americans grew wary of flu vaccines, particularly since the swine flu never materialized outside Fort Dix. But was the flu vaccine really responsible for all those people developing Guillain-Barre? In 2003, the Institute for Medicine commissioned a medical panel, called the Immunization Safety Review Committee,  to look into it. The issue is complicated by the fact that Guillain-Barre can be triggered by all kinds of influenza. So how much was the vaccine to blame? The panel  concluded  that ""the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relationship"" between the 1976 swine flu vaccine and Guillain-Barre in adults. However, the panel concluded that in the nearly 30 years of administering the seasonal flu vaccine since then, there was no proof that the vaccines had caused any more cases of Guillain-Barre, or any other neurological diseases, for that matter. ""The evidence was at most weak that the vaccine could act in humans in ways that could lead to these neurological problems,"" the panel concluded. So what about the risk of the H1N1 vaccine now? Doctors say the track record of seasonal flu vaccines shows the new one is safe. ""The vaccine was made essentially the same way vaccines have been made for the last 30 years,"" said Dr. Marie C. McCormick, a Harvard University professor who chaired that 2003 committee. Concerns about neurological issues with the H1N1 vaccine ""are not based on the evidence we have at hand today,"" McCormick said. In addition to studies conducted by the five pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the H1N1 vaccine, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has conducted clinical trials on more than 4,000 people, and the only side effects recorded so far amount to little more than sore arms and stuffed-up noses. Still, that's a relatively small sample, too small to ferret out any possible connection to Guillain-Barre, which in 1976 was recorded in just 1 in every 100,000 people who got the vaccine. There's no denying that the swine flu vaccine in 1976 appeared to contribute to an outbreak of Guillain-Barre, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. But to raise that specter without talking about the ensuing 30 years needlessly stokes fears, he said. Since that 1976 experience, Osterholm said, the seasonal flu vaccine has been administered to 100 million to 250 million people a year worldwide, and there's been no evidence it caused anyone to get Guillain-Barre or any other neurological disorder. ""At this point, we have no reason to believe it will,"" Osterholm said. ""This vaccine was made essentially the same way we made the seasonal flu vaccines for more than 20 years. You have to put it into context."" Put it this way, he said: His 31-year-old daughter is 6 months pregnant and works with children, and he is eager for her to get the vaccine. ""That's about as objective as I can get,"" he said. Patricia Quinlisk, medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health, said the only difference between the H1N1 vaccine and the regular seasonal flu shot is that it targets a different viral strain. In fact, had H1N1 showed up earlier, she said, it would have been included in the seasonal flu vaccine package. But by the time it appeared in May, the seasonal flu vaccine was already being made. Quinlisk also cautioned not to put much stock in the fact that the 1976 vaccine targeted swine flu, and the H1N1 has often been called the swine flu. The H1N1 is actually combination virus, mixing the typical swine flu with avian flu and typical human influenza. Can scientists give a 100 percent guarantee that no one getting the H1N1 vaccine will develop neurological problems? No, she said. There haven't been enough trials to definitively rule that out. ""But do I think it's safer to get the vaccine than to risk getting the flu? Yes,"" she said. ""If the H1N1 vaccine becomes available to me, I'm going to take it."" That risk-reward ratio is markedly different than in 1976, she said. Then, the flu never spread beyond Fort Dix. ""The H1N1 is here,"" she said. ""It's a pandemic."" We should also note that taking the H1N1 vaccine is being encouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, both of which say the track record of seasonal flu vaccines over more than two decades suggest the H1N1 vaccine will be safe and effective. Beck is correct in that scientists say that in 1976, the swine flu vaccine likely caused Guillain-Barre in a very small number of adults. But Beck's statement lacks important context. The 30-year track record of seasonal flu vaccines strongly suggests the new H1N1 vaccine won't cause neurological damage. Without noting that the H1N1 vaccine has been manufactured in essentially the same way as the seasonal flu shot that has been used by hundreds of millions of people — without any established link to neurological problems — ends up misleading by omission. And so we rule Beck's statement Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809703FF00>],/factchecks/2009/oct/14/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-warns-1970s-flu-shots-caused-neurologic/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Nancy-Ann DeParle']","
Study from health insurers says premiums will rise, but it's not the whole story
","
The day before an important vote in a Senate committee, the health insurance industry group released a report saying that health care reform will dramatically increase the cost of insurance.
 
The Obama administration attacked the report as a last-ditch effort to derail reform.
 
""I was disappointed to see that the health insurance industry had contrived a report like this at the last minute, right on the eve of a historic vote,"" said Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform.
 
The report ""ignores some of the key policies that are part of the Senate Finance Committee bill, such as the health insurance exchange, which is really a central feature that allows people to be pooled together to save administrative costs and to lower people's cost in achieving getting coverage,"" DeParle said.
 
For this item, we're checking DeParle's statement that the report ignores parts of the bill that would reduce costs.
 
The 26-page report was put together by PricewaterhouseCoopers. It examined four parts of a bill under consideration by the Senate Finance Committee.
 
The report examined four separate parts of the bill and found that all of them would increase costs for health insurance companies and health care providers. These increased costs would then most likely be passed on to consumers.
 
Among the report's complaints about the Finance Committee bill:
 
• Weak mandate.


The legislation requires insurance companies to cover everyone regardless of pre-existing conditions. The report says this might be all right if everyone were required to buy insurance, but the rules requiring people to buy coverage are weak and take too long to phase in. That means insurers would have to raise rates overall to pay for coverage of sick people that they can currently exclude from coverage.
 
• Excise taxes on ""Cadillac"" plans.

 

Insurance companies would pay an extra tax on the most generous health insurance plans people buy. The report said these taxes would be passed directly to consumers, and they projected that more plans would meet the definition of a ""Cadillac"" plan.
 
• Increased cost-shifting.


The report claims that Medicare pays health care providers below cost for treatment, so the providers have to charge people with private insurance more. If the legislation reduces payments for Medicare, that means people with private insurance will be charged more, according to the study.
 
• Taxes on medical devices.


The Senate Finance Committee bill raises taxes for the makers of certain medical devices, particularly the more expensive devices such as pacemakers and X-ray machines. The report says these taxes also would be passed on to consumers and result in higher premiums.
 
DeParle's criticism is that the report doesn't consider other parts of the bill that would lower costs for consumers. In particular, she points to health insurance exchanges, online marketplaces where people could comparison-shop for policies that meet their preferences for coverage and cost.
 
We read the report and found that DeParle is correct. The report does isolate aspects of the bill without considering the overall effects. It does not appear to consider how incentives or administrative efficiencies could result in reduced costs. The report even acknowledges that.
 
""The reform packages under consideration have other provisions that we have not included in this analysis,"" the report states.  ""We have not estimated the impact of the new subsidies on the net insurance cost to households. Also, if other provisions in health care reform are successful in lowering costs over the long term, those improvements would offset some of the impacts we have estimated.""
 
This caveat makes the report's findings incomplete, so we're skeptical that the specific dollar figures it presents as cost increases will reflect actual outcomes for consumers. However, it is reasonable to think that health insurance companies will pass on increased costs to consumers to the extent that they are able, which would drive up premiums. So the report isn't entirely off base, but it does present its evidence selectively.
 
The report did not derail Democrats' hopes for a successful vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The proposal was approved 14-9, with Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine joining the Democrats. The next step is for the Senate Finance bill to be combined with a bill from the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.
 
Getting back to our ruling, DeParle criticized the health insurance industry report on the grounds that it was an incomplete analysis. She said it ""ignores some of the key policies that are part of the Senate Finance Committee bill."" The report itself admits as much. We rate her statement True.

"['National', 'Baseball', 'Health Care', 'Americans United for Change']","
Liberal group says health insurance, baseball are only industries exempt from antitrust laws
","
Supporters of the Democratic health care plan have invoked baseball in their latest television ad that tries to demonize the health insurance industry.

In the 30-second ad, the liberal group Americans United for Change asks, ""How are professional baseball and insurance companies alike? Baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws. How are they different? Insurance industry executives are scared of competition. Baseball players aren't. When baseball players fix the games, they get in trouble. When health insurance executives fix the games, they get rich. Time for competition when it comes to health insurance. We need the choice of a public health insurance plan.""

In this item, we'll focus on their opening claim, that ""baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws.""

Let's first explain what ""antitrust"" means. Antitrust laws protect against anticompetitive conduct by cartels and monopolies. Federal antitrust laws target price-fixing, predatory pricing and mergers that reduce competition. Courts have consistently ruled that the federal government has the authority to pass laws that police competition in ""interstate commerce"" — that is, business activity that crosses borders and ripples through the national economy.

While federal antitrust laws do cover most industries, some are exempted, thanks either to the courts or Congress. The Americans United for Change ad cites what is probably the best-known exemption: baseball. 
Baseball's sweeping exemption stems from a 1922 U.S. Supreme Court decision. The justices, presented with an upstart league's lawsuit against the well-established National League, ruled that teams' travel across state lines was not ""essential"" to the business. As a result, the justices ruled, the federal government had no antitrust power over baseball, since games were essentially events held in one state. Most notably, the exemption allows Major League Baseball to prevent teams from moving without the league's consent. In more recent challenges, the high court declined to overturn baseball's exemption, saying it was up to Congress to rescind it. Despite numerous bills, lawmakers have so far declined to do so.

So, the ad is correct that baseball has an antitrust exemption. Does insurance have one too?

It does. Insurance — in fact, all kinds of insurance, not just health coverage — is exempt from federal antitrust laws, though these protections are more limited than they are for baseball teams. A 1945 law exempts from federal antitrust law the ""business of insurance"" as long as it is ""regulated by state law."" However, in some contexts — such as if the conduct involves an agreement to ""boycott, coerce or intimidate"" — federal antitrust law does apply.

This is hardly an arcane issue. As Congress struggles with health care reform legislation, some lawmakers are seeking to lift health insurers' antitrust exemption. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has introduced the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act, which would, among other things, ""repeal the federal antitrust exemption for health insurance and medical malpractice insurance companies for flagrant antitrust violations, including price-fixing, bid rigging, and market allocations."" Reps. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., and John Conyers, D-Mich., have introduced an equivalent measure in the House. Both measures are pending.

Even though baseball and insurance have somewhat different types of antitrust exemptions, we find they are similar enough to justify the ad's pairing of the two. But when the ad says that baseball and insurance are ""the only industries exempt from antitrust laws,"" it's wrong.

For starters, three additional industries — agricultural cooperatives, fishing cooperatives and maritime shipping — have, like baseball and insurance, what the American Bar Association calls ""general"" antitrust exemptions. Each of these exemptions stem from a law passed by Congress. For example, they permit co-ops, from milk producers to cranberry growers, to jointly market their products, including setting prices and output. (Congress has also exempted labor unions from antitrust law, but unions aren't an ""industry,"" so we won't include them in our calculations.)

Also, other industries benefit from more limited forms of antitrust exemptions, usually laws that protect specific practices rather than invoking a blanket exemption for business activity.

Studies by the ABA and a federal commission counted almost two dozen such partial exemptions. These govern a wide range of activities, including the actions by broadcasters to curb violence in television shows, efforts by airlines to ease airport congestion, attempts by financially troubled newspapers to merge some functions with competitors, and activities by soft drink producers to draw up exclusive sales territories.

The Americans United for Change ad is generally correct to equate the antitrust exemptions of baseball and health insurance, but the one for health insurance is more limited. And the ad is incorrect to say that these are the ""only industries exempt from antitrust laws."" Agricultural and fishing co-ops and maritime shippers have similar exemptions. And a host of other sectors, notably freight rail, have some pretty significant antitrust protections as well. We rate the ad's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970036C0>],/factchecks/2009/oct/13/americans-united-change/liberal-group-says-health-care-baseball-are-only-i/
"['National', 'LGBTQ', 'Military', 'Carl Levin']","
Levin claims that other Western countries have lifted their bans
","
President Barack Obama has repeatedly said that he plans to repeal the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" rule, which prevents openly gay and lesbian people from serving in the military.

 

But so far, no go.

 


Meet the Press

host David Gregory asked Michigan Democrat Carl Levin, who chairs the Senate's Armed Services Committee, whether Obama would follow through on his promise.

 

""I think he will and he can,"" Levin said on the program on Oct. 11, 2009. ""I think it has to be done in the right way, which is to get a buy-in from the military, which I think is now possible. Other militaries in the West, the British and other Western armies, have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully.""

 

Before we dig into Levin's claim that other Western countries have already repealed similar policies, some background: On the campaign trail, Obama wrote an open letter to the LGBT — lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender — community, stating that, as president, he would ""bring about real change for all LGBT Americans."" Chief among his efforts would be a repeal of the military's rule, one that was put into place during the Clinton administration.

 

That's easier said than done, however. Obama cannot simply undo ""don't ask, don't tell"" — it must be repealed by Congress. So, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in March 2009 that the administration was not actively pursuing a rule change, we gave Obama a

Stalled

on our Obameter for his promise to overturn the policy.

 

The issue was back in the news Oct. 11 when Obama spoke at a gathering of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization. He told the group: ""I'm working with the Pentagon, its leadership and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy.""

 

Levin hopes the policy will change. To underscore his optimism, he pointed out that the United States wouldn't be the first country to repeal laws banning gays from the military.

 

Australia ended its ban on homosexuals in the military in 1992, as did Canada.

 

Levin is also right that Britain does not prohibit gays and lesbians from serving. Its ban was lifted in 2000, when the European Court of Human Rights settled a two-year legal battle involving four homosexual service members.

 

All told, at least 25 Western countries have no ban on gays and lesbians in the military, according to the Palm Center, a public policy think tank associated with the University of California at Santa Barbara. As of June 2009, that list includes Germany, Austria, Spain, Finland and France.

 

So, Levin is correct that other Western countries, including Britain, have ended policies that prevent gays and lesbians from serving openly. We give him a True.

Rep. John Kline and other Republicans say under Hate Crime bill, religious leaders could be prosecuted for preaching about sexual practices
","
A number of Republican congressmen cried foul this week when Democrats attached a controversial hate crime bill to a must-pass $680 billion national defense policy bill.
 
The House passed the defense bill 281-146, with most of the opposition votes coming from Republicans. They said they objected to inclusion of a hate crime provision that they say will put federal prosecutors in the ""thought crime"" business. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act would prohibit ""violent acts motivated by actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of a victim.""
 
Already, some 45 states have hate crime statutes, so in practice the federal law would mostly serve to provide technical and financial support to local law enforcers so they can more aggressively prosecute violent hate crimes; but it also would allow federal prosecutors to pursue violent hate crime cases that state or local officials are unable or unwilling to prosecute.
 
U.S. Rep. John Kline, a former Marine whose son serves in the military, voted for the defense bill in June before it included the expanded hate crimes provision. But in voting against the bill this week, Kline echoed a concern voiced by several Republican leaders that the hate crime bill could lead to prosecution of religious leaders preaching their morality about sexual preference from the pulpit.
 
""I disdain racism, sexism, and bigotry, but under this legislation, any pastor, preacher, priest, rabbi or imam who gives a sermon out of their moral traditions about sexual practices could be found guilty of a federal crime,"" the Minnesota Republican stated in an Oct. 8, 2009, press release.
 
This isn't a new charge about the hate crimes bill.
 
During the presidential campaign, Barack Obama was criticized for his support of the hate crimes legislation by an evangelical group that claimed the bill would ""put churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality."" We rated that claim

False

.
 
Proponents of the hate crimes law argue that such a hypothetical is absurd, that the law clearly targets violent acts, and that religious leaders are still protected by First Amendment free speech laws.
 
But just to be extra clear, Democrats on a conference committee recently added specific protections against just the kinds of concerns raised by Kline.
 
Here's how the bill reads now:
 
""Nothing in this division ... shall be construed or applied in a manner that infringes any rights under the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Nor shall anything in this division ... be construed or applied in a manner that substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion (regardless of whether compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief), speech, expression, or association"" unless prosecutors can demonstrate that the speech was intended to ""plan or prepare for an act of physical violence"" or ""incite an imminent act of physical violence against another.""
 
It's that last part that concerns some Republican leaders like Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana.
 
""As has been previously stated by Judge Carter of Texas, under Section 2 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code today, an individual may be held criminally liable who 'aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures' in the commission of a federal crime,"" Pence said from the House floor on Oct. 8. ""Therefore, to put a fine point on it, any pastor, preacher, priest, rabbi, or imam, who may give a sermon out of their moral traditions about sexual practices, could presumably under this legislation be found to have aided, abetted or induced in the commission of a federal crime. This will have a chilling effect on religious expression, from the pulpits, in our temples, in our mosques and in our churches. And it must be undone.""
 
But we quote more from the bill: ""Nothing in this division shall be construed to prohibit any constitutionally protected speech, expressive conduct or activities (regardless of whether compelled by, central to, a system of religious belief), including the exercise of religion protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and peaceful picketing or demonstration.""


Again, the bill notes, ""The Constitution of the United States does not protect speech, conduct or activities consisting of planning for, conspiring to commit, or committing an act of violence.""
 
In other words, you can preach that the Bible says homosexuality is wrong, but you can't encourage violence against gay people.
 
Brian Moulton, chief legislative counsel for the Human Rights Coalition, said this language makes ""exceedingly clear"" that the kind of thing talked about by Kline, Pence and others is ""just not possible under this legislation.""
 
""I don't see how anyone who has read the language of the legislation could come to that conclusion,"" Moulton said.
 
We certainly think it's fair for Republicans to criticize the decision to add this controversial hate crime provision to a bill that funds the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But we also think it's wrong for opponents of the bill to again raise the scare tactic that it might lead to the prosecution of preachers who condemn homosexuality from the pulpit. The language of the bill makes abundantly clear that it would not. And we rule Kline's statement False.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Bloggers']","
Conservative blogger says proposed tax could hit wide array of medical devices
","
Republicans often complain that the Democratic health care bills would impose a heavy tax burden on Americans. So when the Senate Finance Committee began considering a tax on medical devices — including some modest devices such as enema kits and breast pumps — it was no surprise that conservatives would use the tax to rally opposition.


Initially, the Finance panel was planning to subject all medical devices to the tax. (Technically this would be a tax on companies that make devices, based on their market share, rather than an excise tax on individual units.) But an outcry that it would lead to ""tampon taxes"" and ""Q-tip taxes"" led the committee's chairman, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., to shift course. He decided to apply the tax rules based on the three medical device categories determined by the Food and Drug Administration. These categories align roughly with how complex and risky the devices are.


When the bill was unveiled on Sept. 16, 2009, Baucus said it would exempt items labeled Class I by the FDA, things such as enema kits and elastic bandages. Those items, which account for 47 percent of all devices, are often inexpensive and are defined as ""present(ing) minimal potential for harm to the user"" by the FDA.


But critics continued to argue that including all Class II devices — which rank between Class I and III in complexity and risk — would still mean imposing a tax on a host of inexpensive items that could ultimately be passed on to consumers. So Sept. 22, 2009, Baucus exempted from the tax all Class II items costing less than $100. (Class III items — the 10 percent that ""sustain or support life, are implanted, or present potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury"" — have always been subject to Baucus' proposed tax.)


This eased the attacks somewhat, but not entirely. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., offered an amendment to eliminate the tax altogether, but on Oct. 1, 2009, it failed by a 10-13 vote.


Then, on Oct. 7, 2009, blogger Meredith Jessup on the conservative Web site TownHall.com cited work by a

Washington Times

columnist to show a wide range of items that she said would still be taxed despite Baucus' revision.


""

Washington Times

columnist Amanda Carpenter has looked into the matter and found that new moms who want to use a powered breast pump to bottle milk for their babies will have to pay this excise tax,"" Jessup wrote. ""These pumping devices, Carpenter points out, typically retail for more than $100. In addition, other items used by both men and women — including 'pacemakers, ventilators, X-ray machines, powered wheelchairs and surgical needles — will be taxed too.' ... So what else is on this list of items to be taxed? Lots of things, including dentures, fetal cell-screening kits, female condoms (I'm surprised there aren't angry 'feminists' taking to the streets over this one), tests for syphilis and HIV, hip, knee, ankle and breast prosthetics, dialysis catheters, mammograms and sickle-cell anemia tests.""


We found many other conservative bloggers have made similar claims.


We turned to the FDA's Web site to determine which items would be subject to the tax.


We found that the following items would still be subject to the current version of the proposed tax, either because they're rated Class III or because they're considered Class II and cost more than $100: powered breast pumps; tests for HIV; pacemakers; ventilators; X-ray machines; powered wheelchairs; hip, knee, ankle and breast prosthetics; and dentures. Many dialysis catheters are rated Class III, and the female condom is Class III. (Male condoms are Class II — go figure.) Assuming Jessup meant ""mammography machines"" rather than ""mammograms,"" then you can add that to the list as well.


It's a bit more complicated to determine the taxability of the remaining four that Jessup mentioned. Tests for sickle-cell anemia and syphilis are both categorized as Class II, and a Web search turned up prices well below $100 per test, suggesting that both would be exempt. Meanwhile, most surgical needles are rated Class I or Class II, and the one fetal-cell screening kit rated by the FDA is considered Class II; for both the needles and the fetal-cell kit, we were unable to find price quotes on the Internet.


Based on this information alone, these products would seem likely to avoid the tax. However, congressional aides said that the final details about what's covered and not covered remain to be written. One possibility is that all Class II items that are generally sold directly to hospitals or doctors' offices, rather than to consumers directly, could be subject to the tax, even if they cost less than $100. Most likely, the Treasury Department would be responsible for providing final guidance — perhaps even a list of specific items — on which items fall into which category. So it's possible the four items above could eventually be hit by the tax.


So Jessup is correct about most of the items she cites: They would be subject to the tax. A few others she cites would not fall under the committee's latest definition for the tax, but the practical details of the bill right now are not yet settled, so it's possible that they will be taxed eventually. We should also add that the tax may not necessarily be included in the final health care bill that will be crafted from the various versions in different committees. But for now, the provision remains part of the Senate Finance bill. On balance, we rate Jessup's assertion Mostly True.

Car pollution in China doesn't cause as many deaths as Nany Pelosi claims
","
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has long considered herself a human rights activist and an environmental advocate. So during a recent trip to China, Pelosi discussed how the issues overlap during a meeting with the country's president, Hu Jintao.


She recounted the meeting for television host Charlie Rose on the Oct. 5, 2009, edition of his show. ""I took a little bit of a different approach this time in terms of talking about environmental justice because . . . 750,000 people, approximately, die in China each year from auto emissions. The Gobi Desert is encroaching on the rest of China. There are sandstorms in Beijing. They know that . . . there's something that has to be done about climate change and environmental protection and that — and so my pitch to them is there has to be environmental justice. As you develop and as you compete, you can't leave people behind.""


We wondered if the death toll from auto emissions could possibly be as high as Pelosi claims.


But first, some background. Most scientists believe that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide, are due in part to the number of cars on the road that do not burn fuel efficiently. Our cars release greenhouse gases that trap heat from the sun and have caused the Earth to warm. There's also evidence that the heat-trapping qualities of greenhouse gases lead to an increase of particulate matter and carcinogens in the atmosphere — bad news for those with asthma and other respiratory illnesses.


We called Pelosi's office and they pointed us to 2007 news reports about a World Bank analysis that focused on the cost of pollution in China.


According to the

Financial Times,

the Chinese government asked the World Bank to exclude information about how many people die each year as the result of air and water pollution. (For its part, the World Bank says the numbers were left out due to ""some uncertainties about calculation methods and its application."")


""Missing from this report are the research project’s findings that high air-pollution levels in Chinese cities (are) leading to the premature deaths of 350,000-400,000 people each year,"" the July 2, 2007,

Financial Times

story said. ""A further 300,000 people die prematurely each year from exposure to poor air indoors, according to advisers, but little discussion of this issue survived in the report because it was outside the ambit of the Chinese ministries which sponsored the research.""


On top of that, 60,000 premature deaths were related to poor-quality water that resulted in diarrhea, and stomach, liver and bladder cancers, according to the story.


So, Pelosi is relying on a news story's summary of World Bank data that was not officially published but that was obtained by the

Financial Times.

According to the news story, on the high end, there are 760,000 deaths annually from water and air pollution, not just auto emissions, as Pelosi said on the

Charlie Rose Show.



We took a look at the report, and found that it provided a lot of compelling evidence that Chinese citizens suffer a great deal from air and water pollution and that smog and dirty water in that country lead to many premature deaths. But it offered no overall numbers, nor did it focus specifically on auto emissions.


""Energy consumption, especially coal consumption, is the main source of air pollutants,"" the report said, noting that medical evidence suggests ""outdoor air pollution is a contributing cause of morbidity and mortality.""


To get another perspective, we called Mark Jacobson, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Stanford University, who has studied death rates due to carbon dioxide pollution. In 2008, he found that for each increase of 1 degree Celsius caused by carbon dioxide, the resulting air pollution would lead annually to about 1,000 additional deaths in the United States, and 20,000 worldwide.


That's on top of the approximately 2 million air pollution-related deaths worldwide, he explained, citing numbers from the World Health Organization.


""Home heating and cooking are really the biggest source of deaths,"" Jacobson said, explaining that, particularly in China, India and other developing countries, cooking is often done with animal dung, wood or coal. ""There's a lot of smoke, no ventilation.""


Indeed, most pollution-related deaths — about 1.6 million of the 2 million overall, according to the WHO — are the result of poor indoor air quality.


According to WHO's numbers, that leaves only about 400,000 deaths annually that stem from outdoor pollution — worldwide. Furthermore, outdoor air pollution isn't limited to auto emissions. Much of it comes from agricultural operations, electricity generation and industries that rely heavily on fossil fuels, Jacobson said.


So to summarize: Pelosi said that about 750,000 people in China die annually from auto emissions. But she was basing her claim on news reports that relied on data that was never actually published.  (When we inquired, the World Bank declined to directly address the statistics.) So even if the World Bank data is correct, Pelosi misinterpreted it by saying that all those deaths are related to auto emissions.
 
On top of that, the World Health Organization estimates that most pollution-related deaths are the result of indoor pollutants (those coal and wood fires we mentioned above), not outdoor ones. So while Pelosi is correct that air pollution is harmful and may be responsible for many deaths in China, she's wrong to say that auto emissions are specifically responsible for 750,000 of them annually. We rate her claim Barely True.

Michael Moore claims in his movie, 'Capitalism,' that during the Reagan era, millions were thrown out of work
","
In his latest film,

Capitalism: A Love Story

, Michael Moore singled out the Ronald Reagan administration for the loss of millions of jobs.
 
During the Reagan administration, he said, American government was run more like a business. The fallout of Reagan's ""trickle-down"" economic policy, he said, is that major corporations laid off American workers at the same time they were raking in enormous profits.
 
And, he said, ""Millions of people were thrown out of work.""
 
In backup material for that claim on his

Web site

, Moore points to a line from a May 28, 1991, article in the

Washington Post

: ""Since 1980, 2 million workers have been cut from the U.S. manufacturing payroll. Millions more have accepted — or been forced to accept — reductions in earnings.""
 
A couple of things here.
 
First, this is a 1991 article, and Reagan served as president from January 1981 to January 1989. In other words, the time frame referenced in the article includes a year before Reagan was in office, and 2 1/2 years after he left. The added time on each end makes a big difference.
 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing jobs went from 19.3 million in January 1980 to 18.6 million in January 1981 (when Reagan took office), to 18.1 million January 1989 (when Reagan left office), and then down to 17.1 million by April 1991, the month before the

Washington Post

article was written. So the article is correct that 2 million workers were cut from the U.S. manufacturing payroll between 1980 and when the article was written in early 1991.
 
However, while manufacturing jobs saw a major decline during a severe recession early in the Reagan years (dipping to a low of 16.7 million in January 1983), manufacturing jobs rebounded significantly during Reagan's latter years. So yes, millions of manufacturing workers lost their jobs early in Reagan's tenure, but if you look at the statistics over the entire eight years of the Reagan administration, the number of manufacturing jobs decreased by just a half million.
 
One other point on manufacturing jobs: If you look at historical tables, the number of manufacturing jobs remained fairly stagnant from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, peaking in 1979 at 19.4 million jobs. Since that time, the number of manufacturing jobs has fairly steadily decreased — it was at 13.4 million jobs in 2008.
 
""We've seen declines in the share of the work force that is manufacturing for decades,"" said Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute. ""It wasn't just in the 1980s. That trend was going on before and since.""
 
The other point of context needed here is that Moore never specified manufacturing jobs when he said millions of people were thrown out of work. When you consider all types of employment, the picture is less dour.
 
Again, jobs were lost during the recession early in Reagan's presidency, but overall the employed ranks grew from 100 million in January 1981 to 116.7 million in January 1989. And while the unemployment rate grew to more than 10 percent during the recession, the unemployment rate from the start of the Reagan era to the end was 7.5 percent to 5.4 percent.
 
Lou Cannon, who has written several books about Reagan, called Moore's claim ""pure fantasy,"" belied by the aforementioned statistics.
 
""Reagan obviously, like Obama, came into office in the middle of a big recession,"" said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute. But by the late 1980s, ""all the indicators were extremely positive.""


Still, Edwards cautioned not to put too much stock in the political actions Reagan took as president on swinging various economic indicators.
 
""Presidents only have so much effect over the economy or business cycles,"" he said.
 
We should note that much of the slack in declining manufacturing jobs was more than picked up by a surge in service industry jobs, a trend that Moore highlights in the movie as well. Many would note that these service industry jobs generally pay lower than manufacturing jobs. Nonetheless, employment rates improved during the Reagan years. Factoring in for population growth, employment ratios grew by 2 percentage points over Reagan's eight years. And failing to note that while saying that millions of people were thrown out of work is misleading. We rate this claim Barely True.

Michael Moore claims in 'Capitalism' that during Reagan years, productivity went up while wages remained frozen
","
In his new film,

Capitalism: A Love Story

, Michael Moore contends the economic policies of President Ronald Reagan were the turning point toward widening the gap between the rich and everyone else. Once Reagan was elected, Moore said, the government was run like a business, and the president's tough stance on unions and his theory of ""trickle-down"" economics ended up hurting working Americans.
 
In this item, we will look at Moore's claim in the movie that as productivity rose during the Reagan years, ""wages for working people remained frozen.""
 
We'll get right to the numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 
People generally look at ""output per hour"" for workers in the nonfarm business sector to track these kinds of trends. Essentially, it's the amount of value of product produced per hour of work by an employee.
 
Generally, productivity has steadily increased for as long as those kind of statistics have been kept as people and businesses learn to work more efficiently. But by the late 1970s, productivity had begun to slow.
 
During Reagan's time in office (1981 to 1989), however, the numbers grew from 81.7 to 92.8. So it's certainly fair to say productivity increased during the Reagan administration.
 
Now on to wages. There are several ways to look at this. First is the hourly wages paid in current dollars (what workers were actually paid). By that count, average hourly wages increased from $7.44 to $9.80. But these were high inflation years, and so when you look at the hourly wages adjusted for inflation (""real hourly compensation""), wages remained fairly flat. In fact, based on 1982 dollars, real wages dipped slightly from $7.89 in 1981 to $7.75 in 1989.
 
End of story?
 
Not quite. We think a few qualifiers are in order. For one, wages aren't the only way workers are compensated. There's also health benefits and other compensation. When you look at the ""real compensation per hour"" paid by companies to nonsupervisory employees, the cost went from 90.2 in 1981 to 95.1 in 1989. So compensation to employees, even when adjusted for inflation, grew during the Reagan era.
 
We also think it's worth noting that stagnation of average hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, predated Reagan. Historical tables show that hourly wages climbed steadily through the 1960s and into 1970s, and then peaked in 1973. From that point on, ""real"" hourly wages declined for a few years and then pretty much froze until the late 1990s.
 
But it wasn't until Reagan's presidency that productivity began to quickly outpace wages.
 
Why? Economists have a host of theories.
 
For one, new technology certainly allowed workers to build widgets much better and faster, said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute.
 
But the reasons for the widening gap between productivity and wages are more complex and varied.
 
Globalization of the economy, eroding of unions, regressive taxes, the declining value of minimum wage, a rise in the number of immigrants and deregulation of industry all contributed, said Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute.
 
Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research believes the weakening of unions played a huge role.
 
""I think the bargaining power of workers took a big hit during the Reagan years,"" Baker said.
 
The most notable example was when the Reagan administration broke the air traffic controllers union.
 
""That changed labor-management relations,"" Baker said.
 
Moore cited an article by Baker called

""The Productivity to Paycheck Gap: What the Data Show""

on a part of his

film Web site

that provides backup for a number of claims in the film. And Baker said a fact-checker employed by Moore called him before the release of the movie to make sure he got it right.
 
""I think his (Moore's) comment was pretty much on the mark,"" Baker said.
 
One other caveat to Moore's comment. He's talking here about wages for nonsupervisory production workers, which comprise about 80 percent of the work force. But not all. And that's why it's also true, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that the mean average of real income rose by 15.2 percent from 1980 to 1989, from $33,409 to $38,493, in 1990 dollars. So it all depends on how you define ""working people.""
 
Still, adjusted for inflation, and when looking at nonsupervisory production workers, it's true that during the Reagan years, productivity rose while wages remained frozen (or even dipped slightly). We dock Moore some points, though, because the decline/stagnation of wages pre- and postdated the Reagan era; and total compensation (including payments for benefits) rose. Moore left out some important qualifiers. Still, while you may not agree with Moore's conclusions, he can back up his claim with legitimate numbers. And so we rate it Mostly True.

Rockefeller says health insurance premiums have doubled since 2001
","
Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., recently wrote an opinion piece for the Capitol Hill newspaper

Roll Call

in which he said, ""Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled."" We address the first part of this statement in another

item

; we'll take up the second half here.


The 2009 Employer Health Benefits Survey, published by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, is considered the definitive source for health benefits cost information, and its data stretch from 1999 to 2009. (Even though Rockefeller didn't explicitly say it, we'll assume he was talking about the period since 2001 when he made this assertion.)


In 2001, average annual premiums for single people were $2,689, a number that rose to $4,824 by 2008 — a 79 percent increase. The amounts for family coverage rose over the same period from $7,061 to $13,375 — an 89 percent increase.


So, in neither case did the cost of benefits actually double, although they are in the ballpark. However, if you read Rockefeller's language closely, he did say, ""premiums for consumers have doubled"" — and if you use the data for the employee-paid portion of health benefits by itself, he's right.


For individuals, the employee cost rose from $355 to $779 and for families it rose from $1,787 to $3,515. The former jump is easily double, while the latter is just shy of double. Using this calculation, Rockefeller is right. We rate his assertion True.

Rockefeller says health insurer profits have risen by 400 percent since 2001
","
Those who advocate for health care reform have tried to rally the public by portraying insurers as greedy. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va. — a member of the Senate Finance Committee, a key player in the health policy debate — is no exception.


Rockefeller recently wrote an opinion piece for the Capitol Hill newspaper

Roll Call

in which he said, ""Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled."" We'll address the first part of this statement in this item; we'll take up the second half in a separate

item

.


On the first part — health insurer profits — Rockefeller took his numbers from a study sponsored by Health Care for America Now, a liberal group that supports Democratic health care reform efforts. Researchers for HCAN looked at financial data submitted by 10 large, publicly held health insurers to the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the years between 2000 and 2008. The 10 companies are Aetna, Amerigroup, Centene, CIGNA, Coventry, Health Net, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, Universal American Group and WellPoint.


In the past, we have had problems with the data HCAN has used — we rated one

claim

on health insurance denials False and

another

on insurance company CEO compensation Barely True — but their data on health insurer profits look sound. We checked a few of HCAN's numbers by looking at some of the original disclosure forms on the SEC Web site and found no notable discrepancies.


Rockefeller's use of the numbers, however, is a different matter. Whether the increase amounts to at least 400 percent depends on which years you choose.


The researchers found that the collective profits of these 10 companies rose from $2.41 billion in 2001 to $12.87 billion in 2007 — a 466 percent increase, meaning that, over that period of time, Rockefeller would be right.


But using the years 2001 through 2008 instead, the data show that profits rose from $2.41 billion to $8.40 billion — a 249 percent increase. That's still a whopping jump, but it's not as high as Rockefeller indicated. The general dropoff in the economy had a lot to do with the lower profits in 2008, said Alex Lawson, a health care researcher for Campaign for America's Future, a liberal group, who co-authored the HCAN study.


Meanwhile, there's another caveat for HCAN's study. The group didn't adjust the profit statistics for corporate takeovers. When big companies absorb smaller ones, the net effect may be to enlarge the profits of the biggest companies (including many of the 10 giants in HCAN's study) even as the total size of the health insurance industry — the broader entity that Rockefeller seemed to be referring to — stays roughly the same. While doing such adjustments would have been logistically difficult, and maybe even impossible, the fact that they weren't done puts limits on how this data can be interpreted.
 
A health industry analyst, Steve Shubitz of Edward Jones, agreed that consolidation is ""a very large part of this overall increase"" rather than simply higher profits by the remaining 10 companies. ""Of course, these companies have increased profits, too, outside of acquisitions, but nowhere near to the extent that's implied by those stats,"" Shubitz said.
 
Lawson acknowledged that the HCAN chart on profits does not address how much of an impact consolidation has made on profits. But he added that the table actually comes from a study that specifically addressed the harm to competition caused by consolidation, so the group hardly ignored that issue. In addition, he defended the decision to use numbers unadjusted for consolidation. ""That's what the market reacts to, and that's what they put in their annual report,"" Lawson said.
 
The insurance industry, for its part, argues that total health plan profits are less than one penny of the total national health expenditure dollar. ""The data is clear that profits are not what is driving rising health care costs,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the leading health insurance trade group.


Let's recap. If you carry the data forward to 2008 — an admittedly somewhat atypical year — the increase falls short of Rockefeller's stated 400 percent. Also, the numbers Rockefeller used reflect 10 of the biggest companies as opposed to ""insurance companies"" in general. On the other hand, the increase exceeded 400 percent for the period 2001 to 2007, and however you slice the numbers, the rise in insurer profits is large indeed. On balance, we rate Rockefeller's statement Half True.

"['Environment', 'National', 'Climate Change', 'Energy', 'PlantsNeedCO2.org']","
PlantsNeedCO2.org claims that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and is good for the environment
","With Congress deep in a debate over legislation to slow climate change, the  Washington Post  has become a  popular place  for climate change claims, including this one from an organization called PlantsNeedCO2.org:
 
""Not only is there no scientific evidence that CO 2 is a pollutant, higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life,"" according to an ad the group published Oct. 5, 2009, in the  Post  .
 
To check this claim, we'll first need to travel back in time to high school biology, when we learned about a little life-sustaining process called photosynthesis. Plants pull carbon dioxide through tiny openings in their leaves where it combines with water and sunlight to create sugar and oxygen. Aside from maintaining normal oxygen levels in the atmosphere, life depends on photosynthesis as a source of energy.
 
Carbon dioxide also plays an important role in climate change. This is naturally occuring — we release it into the atmosphere every time we exhale — but is also emitted when we burn fossil fuels. Along with other greenhouse gases, such as methane and sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide traps energy from the sun in the atmosphere, which causes the Earth's surface temperatures to rise. Most scientists agree that greenhouse gases are primarily responsible for climate change.
 
PlantsNeedCO2.org  is skeptical. The organization, which is still awaiting its nonprofit status, is the brainchild of Leighton Steward, a self-described geologist, environmentalist, author and retired energy industry executive. He authored a diet book called  Sugar Busters!  and is the chairman of the board of the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man at Southern Methodist University. We sent an e-mail to the organization but our inquiry was not returned.
 
PlantsNeedCO2.org has one mission: ""to educate the public on the positive effects of additional atmospheric CO 2 and help prevent the inadvertent negative impact to human, plant and animal life if we reduce CO 2 .""
 
The Web site is chock-full of links to papers, videos and other evidence that more carbon dioxide is actually good for the environment.
 
""Far from being a pollutant, rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will never directly harm human health, but will indirectly benefit humans in a number of ways,"" according to the site. ""In addition to increasing the quantity of food available for human consumption, the rising atmospheric CO 2 concentration is also increasing the quality of the foods we eat.""
 
We're going to take the group's claims — that there is no scientific evidence that CO 2 is a pollutant and that higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life — one at a time.
 
First, PlantsNeedCO2.org claims that there is no scientific evidence that carbon dioxide is a pollutant.
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disagrees.
 
On April 17, 2009, the agency said that thorough scientific review proved that carbon dioxide, along with several other greenhouse gases, are pollutants that threaten human health; it is taking steps to regulate the gases under the Clean Air Act, a law typically reserved for monitoring traditional pollutants including ozone and sulfur dioxide.
 
""This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations,"" said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson in a press release. ""In both magnitude and probability, climate change is an enormous problem. The greenhouse gases that are responsible for it endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of the Clean Air Act.'""
 
The EPA's findings were ""based on rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis of six gases — carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride — that have been the subject of intensive analysis by scientists around the world. The science clearly shows that concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels as a result of human emissions, and these high levels are very likely the cause of the increase in average temperatures and other changes in our climate,"" according to the press release.
 
PlantsNeedCO2.org's second claim — that higher carbon dioxide concentrations boost plant and animal life — is not so clear-cut. To be sure, carbon dioxide is essential to life as we know it, and climate change skeptics have used the argument to reject efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.
 
""Plant physiologists have known for a long time that most vegetation loves more carbon dioxide,"" wrote Roy Spencer, a scientist at the University of Alabama at Huntsville in a 2008  National Review  article. ""It grows faster, is more drought-tolerant, and is more efficient in its water use. While the pre-industrial CO 2 concentration of the atmosphere was only about 280 parts per million (ppm) by volume, and now it is around 380 ppm, some greenhouses pump it all the way up to around 1,000 ppm. How can environmentalists claim that helping vegetation to grow is a bad thing?""
 
So, there's an argument to be made that carbon dioxide concentrations increase plant growth and abundance.
 
But the claim leaves out some important facts, said Rob Jackson, a professor of global environmental change and biology at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment.
 
""Is carbon dioxide good for plants? The narrow answer is yes,"" said Jackson. ""But I think it's misleading to say that, if CO 2 is good for plants, it's good for the environment. ... It's kind of like saying that steroids are good for people — they build bone and muscle — but they also have other effects.""
 
For example, Jackson's research shows that with higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere we would see more wood growth, but that there may also be more pests due to higher temperatures, and longer droughts due to more evaporation.
 
Beyond the  reams  of  scientific research  to demonstrate how dramatically the Earth could change with increased carbon dioxide levels, some studies indicate that more is not necessarily better for plants. For instance, a two-decade study of the Panama and Malaysia rainforests demonstrated that temperature increases of more than 1 degree could lead to 50 percent reduction in tree growth.
 
A study launched in 1997 in California studied the effects of climate change on grasslands. Scientists doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, raised the temperature by 2 degrees, increased precipitation by 50 percent, and raised levels of nitrogen, which is also a product of fossil fuel consumption, to simulate how the Earth might look decades from now. When carbon dioxide levels alone were raised, plants grew quite a bit.
 
""But when we factored in realistic treatments — warming, changes in nitrogen deposition, changes in precipitation — growth was actually suppressed,"" Christopher B. Field, a professor at Stanford, told ScienceDaily in 2002.
 
But back to PlantsNeedCO2.org's claim. They are wrong that carbon dioxide is not considered a pollutant. According to the EPA, it is. And the claim that ""higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life"" leaves out some important details. While carbon dioxide is good for plants, increased amounts of it in our atmosphere will have auxiliary effects that are decidedly bad for ecosystems. For PlantsNeedCO2.org, it's False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972F7200>],/factchecks/2009/oct/07/plantsneedco2org/plantsneedco2org-claim-carbon-dioxide-not-pollutan/

Cokie Roberts says government accounts for 40 percent of GDP
","Part of the frustration voiced by critics of President Barack Obama stems from the notion that the government has simply grown too big. But just how big is the government? ABC News commentator Cokie Roberts offered one estimate: Government spending accounts for 40 percent of gross domestic product.

Here's what Roberts said on the Oct. 4, 2009, edition of  This Week With George Stephanopoulos  :

""You know, right now, 40 percent, 40 percent of GDP is state, local, or federal money. I mean, that's an incredible number. So that, you know, adding more [government spending] to that, I think, is going to ... distort things even more. And the public is so concerned about it."" Could such a large number possibly be right? We contacted economists familiar with this topic to give us an idea of what goes into these numbers. And wading through the data is messy indeed.

Marc Goldwein, an economist with the New America Foundation, framed the conundrum in this mind-bending fashion: ""What percent of GDP is made up of government spending is a different question from what government spending equals as a percent of GDP.""

That's because when a government ""transfers"" money — such as through Social Security — it is shifting money around rather than spending it directly. ""This can have real and large effects on GDP, but it does not directly impact GDP, since tax and transfer policies simply take money that one person could be using for consumption or investment and give it to another person to use for consumption or investment,"" he said.

The decision to exclude transfers underlies one set of federal economic statistics — the so-called National Income and Product Account data collected by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Using these figures, direct government consumption and investment amounted to just under 20 percent of GDP in 2007, the most recent year available. That's only about half of what Roberts said it was.

But there's also a second way of thinking about this question — and using this method brings the percentage closer to what Roberts cited.

Adding all federal spending, including transfers, for 2008 ($2.98 trillion) to state and local government spending (estimated to be between $1.72 trillion and $2.2 trillion) gets government spending to between 33 percent and 35 percent of GDP.

This, too, is short of Roberts' 40 percent -- but there's an important caveat. This year, the recession has driven federal spending higher (think of the stimulus package) and sent GDP lower (due to slumping economic activity). These twin developments could spike government's percentage of GDP for 2009, quite possibly above 40 percent, although this rise could be offset somewhat by lower state and local spending, since many states are constitutionally bound to balance their budgets and must cut back as tax revenues decline.

Obviously, this sort of calculation is tricky on a number of levels. Most importantly, the nation is in the midst of a recession and engaging in deficit spending to get out of it — yet the data that are available have not caught up to the new reality. So, while the government's percentage of GDP for 2009 and beyond is likely to rise, saying so requires the use of preliminary estimates and educated guesses rather than hard data.

Still, we spoke to several liberal and conservative economists, none of whom objected to including transfers in the data, and all of them said they expected the 2009 figure to be either 40 percent or close to it. Still, using the latest data, Roberts is off by 5 percentage points. So we find her claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970BB7C0>],/factchecks/2009/oct/06/cokie-roberts/cokie-roberts-says-government-accounts-40-percent-/

Michael Moore claims that during the Reagan years, the richest had their top tax rate cut in half
","
In his latest film,

Capitalism: A Love Story

, Michael Moore takes more than a few swipes at President Ronald Reagan, essentially asserting that under Reagan's watch, the rich got richer at the expense of everyone else.
 
During the Reagan era, he said, ""the richest Americans had their top income tax rate cut in half.""
 
Moore is correct that the top marginal tax rate — the rate of income tax charged to an individual on their last dollar of earnings — decreased from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1989.
 
That's not the same as saying the richest had their taxes cut in half.
 
In 1980, the top marginal tax rate was 70 percent on earnings over $161,300. The rate was substantially lower for the income earned below that. For example, that year, there were no taxes on the first $2,300 of income; 14 percent on income between $2,300 and $4,400; and on up via a graduated scale.
 
So if you made $162,000 in 1980, for example, you paid far less on average than 70 percent of your income in federal taxes.
 
The marginal tax rate also doesn't take into account various available deductions and tax credits, said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. When Reagan revamped the tax code and dropped the top marginal tax rates to 50 percent in 1982, and then down to 28 percent by 1988, he also closed some of the tax loopholes available to people at the top.
 
It's much fairer, we think, to look at effective individual income tax rates. That's the actual percentage of income that people paid in income taxes, factoring in not only the graduated percentages along the marginal tax rate scale, but also the deductions and tax credits that people were entitled to.
 
In 1980,

the effective individual income tax rate

for the top 1 percent of earners was 22.3 percent. In 1989, that rate dropped to 19.9 percent. That's a decrease of 2.4 percentage points, which works out to an 11 percent drop. That's sizable, but nowhere near 50 percent.
 
If you widen the field and consider the top 10 percent of earners, instead of just the top 1 percent,

 

the drop in effective individual income tax rate was about the same, just over 10 percent.
 
For middle incomes, the effective individual income tax rate also dropped, from 8 percent to 6 percent. That's a 25 percent decrease. In other words, it wasn't just the rich who saw their income tax rates drop under Reagan.
 
One more thing. When the top marginal tax rate dropped between 1980 and 1989, it went from 70 percent on earnings over $161,300 in 1980 to 28 percent on earnings over $128,810 in 1989. Obviously, that's not an apples-to-apples comparison.
 
Did the rich get richer during the Reagan years? Yes.
 
And Moore is technically correct when he says that ""the richest Americans had their top income tax rate cut in half."" But we suspect some may mistake that for the richest having their taxes cut in half. In fact, we first began to look at this claim from a fact sheet provided on Moore's Web site before the movie was publicly released. And in the fact sheet, it states that ""the richest had their taxes cut in half."" We were prepared to give that a False, as the effective tax rate for the richest was cut by about 10 or 11 percent.
 
But in the movie, Moore describes it as ""the top income tax rate,"" apparently referring to the highest marginal rate. As we said, some may misinterpret that, but we think Moore has been careful enough with his words to get a Mostly True.
