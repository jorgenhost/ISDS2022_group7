Tom Barrett says Gov. Scott Walker's budget made ""draconian"" public safety cuts
","
With the endorsement from a national police union as the backdrop, Democratic recall challenger Tom Barrett attacked Republican Gov. Scott Walker as a threat to officers and public safety.

""Scott Walker is quick to attend ceremonies honoring officers that have fallen in the line of duty, but he has eliminated their ability to bargain over their health insurance and his draconian cuts only place officers at greater risk of harm,"" Barrett said May 24, 2012, on his website after the National Association of Police Organizations’ endorsement.

One of the complaints about Walker’s collective bargaining changes was that he exempted police officers. Did he then quietly turn around and put them at greater risk?

When asked to back up the claim, Barrett’s campaign staff pointed to three things:

1. State statistics showing a drop in sworn police personnel between 2010 and 2011.

2. The $76 million in cuts Walker’s 2011-13 budget made in state aid to local municipal governments. Known as ""shared revenue,"" it is general aid that can go for various programs, including police and fire.

3. A 2011 Republican move, backed by Walker, that eliminated a 2009 provision that heavily discouraged municipalities from cutting their police and fire budgets. That provision had been sought by police chiefs and police unions.

First the sworn-officer statistics.

They show a 1.7 percent drop in sworn police personnel between 2010 and 2011. That’s a drop of 225 from 13,046 officers at the hundreds of law enforcement agencies around the state.

Not insignificant, but hardly ""draconian.""

In fact, the numbers cited aren’t really relevant, because the budget cuts to shared revenue didn’t hit until the 2012 budget year for local governments -- and there are no statewide staffing numbers available for 2012.

So blaming the state aid cuts for previous reductions is off, too.

Barrett’s campaign didn’t point out any community that saw a drastic drop in police and fire coverage in 2012.

Some did face cuts. In Beloit, for example, five out of 77 recently vacated patrol officer positions were eliminated, according to city officials.

They described it as a significant cut, but not dramatic.

""The sky’s not falling,"" said Police Chief Norm Jacobs, ""but it does affect how the officers deal with problems in the neighborhoods"" through preventive policing.

In Milwaukee, where Barrett oversees the police budget, the size of the force was basically unchanged for 2012. The city used Walker’s limits on collective bargaining to save millions on health insurance costs, helping balance the budget.

Doug Pettit, who is police chief in Oregon, Wis., said he’s heard about positions being frozen and furloughs, but no horror stories of dramatic police cuts. Pettit is the longtime legislative chairman of the Wisconsin Chiefs of Police Association.

He said Barrett’s remark about decreased officer safety would be true if departments put fewer officers on a shift, leaving less backup. He said that might be happening in some cities, but did not cite any.

Jim Palmer heads the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, an umbrella group of police unions.

He said he considers it drastic to cut $76 million from shared revenue because some of that money could have helped police agencies meet demand for service. That was a 9 percent cut, according to state figures, the largest in at least a decade.

But he acknowledged that layoffs of officers still were uncommon. Departments are downsizing mainly through attrition, he said.

""Police and fire are definitely the last to get cut,"" Palmer noted.

What about the final point cited by the Barrett campaign: Walker’s budget move to drop the ""maintenance of effort"" law that had shielded many police budgets from cuts in 2010 and 2011?

Pettit told us the repeal of that protection was a concern for chiefs, but he has not heard that its removal had led to inappropriate funding cuts in police operations.

Our rating

Barrett said Walker’s budget moves included ""draconian"" budget cuts to public safety and put officers at risk.

There are clearly some reductions in some departments, but neither Barrett nor key union and police officials point to any drastic cutbacks. There are no current statewide numbers on officer cuts, and the mayor offered no examples either. So far, it looks like local officials -- who ultimately control what to cut -- have protected police from big harm.

"['New Jersey', 'Deficit', 'Economy', 'Rodney Frelinghuysen']","
Rodney Frelinghuysen says debt rose more than twice as fast as the overall economy in first quarter of 2012
","
The nation faces a hefty tab that keeps growing.

According to U.S. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, the United States is increasing its debt twice as fast as its economy is expanding.

A May 25 e-mail newsletter from the Morris County Republican cited growth in debt compared with the increase in the gross domestic product, or GDP -- a measure of the nation’s economy -- in the first quarter of 2012 and said, ""the U.S. is borrowing approximately $2.52 for every $1 of economic growth so far in 2012.""

Really? PolitiFact New Jersey checked the congressman’s numbers and found he’s right -- down to the penny.

Let’s first discuss the different types of federal debt.

Gross federal debt includes two components: debt held by the public, which is money the government owes outside entities, and intragovernmental holdings, which is essentially money the government owes itself.

As we -- and our PolitiFact colleagues -- have noted previously, some economists prefer to focus on debt held by the public since it is money borrowed from private groups rather than gross debt.

In the time frame the congressman specified, the debt held by the public actually increased more than the gross debt. Here, we’ll note the changes in both measures of debt and compare each with the growth in the nation’s economy.

In the first three months of 2012, the gross debt grew by more than $359.1 billion to reach more than $15.58 trillion. Over the same time frame, the debt held by the public grew by $399.1 billion, totaling nearly $10.85 trillion.

According to preliminary estimates from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis -- the most recent data available at the time Frelinghuysen’s e-mail newsletter was sent -- the GDP grew by $142.4 billion to reach roughly $15.46 trillion in the first quarter of 2012. Those figures are in current dollars and not adjusted for inflation.

So how does the national economy’s expansion compare to growth in federal debt?

Gross debt grew by more than $359.1 billion in the first three months of 2012, while the GDP increased by $142.4 billion. That’s $2.52 added to the debt for each $1 added to the nation’s economy.

Or for debt held by the public, it’s $2.80 in borrowing for each $1 in GDP growth.

We should note that the Bureau of Economic Analysis released updated figures on Thursday that showed slower growth in GDP. According to that data, the GDP grew by $134.6 billion in the first quarter of 2012.

Using that figure, the nation added $1 to the economy for every $2.66 it added to the gross debt.

Jason Peuquet, the research director for the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Frelinghuysen’s statistic is not very surprising given the impact of the economic downturn on the federal budget. Lower revenues driven in part by high unemployment and stagnating wages, as well as increased spending on programs such as unemployment insurance and food stamps have all added ""even more to deficits and debt in the near term,"" Peuquet said.

But, Peuquet said, ""the most important fact isn’t that this is going on because this is what everyone would have predicted."" More importantly, he said, ""we are not on a path to have the budget recover completely once the economy does"" because structural deficits will ""keep piling on more and more.""

Our ruling

Frelinghuysen said: ""the U.S. is borrowing approximately $2.52 for every $1 of economic growth so far in 2012.""

The gross debt grew by more than $359.1 billion in the first three months of 2012. During the same time frame, the GDP increased by $142.4 billion, according to the data available at the time of Frelinghuysen’s statement.

That’s $2.52 added to the debt for every dollar added to the nation’s economy.

We rate this statement True.

Memphis police union says Mayor Wharton threatened to lay off cops, emergency services personnel
","
At a  recent meeting with The Commercial Appeal editorial board, Memphis Mayor A C Wharton showed a side to his personality seldom seen in his many years of public service -- anger.

The subject -- commercials being aired by the Memphis Police Association, the union representing Memphis’s police officers. The ads claim the city’s ""leadership"" has used city tax money and offered tax breaks to companies like Mitsubishi and Electrolux, and then warns that ""city leadership is threatening to lay off police and emergency services personnel to balance the budget.""

Wharton said he had been seeing the ads running ""24-7"" and that ""it really irks me.""

Coming from Wharton, whose reputation for a calm demeanor goes back to his days as one of the area’s most esteemed courtroom lawyers, that qualifies as a tirade. So we decided to take a closer look at the charges.

The commercial is part of a larger campaign by the MPA called ""Wake Up, Memphis!"" that includes a dedicated home on the MPA website and handouts. In an appearance with Fox 13 News, MPA president Mike Williams said, ""It’s not our intention to irk the mayor off."" But did the union go too far in its criticism?

Wharton has consistently said, since winning a special election in 2009, that he would do everything possible to avoid cuts in public safety. Mayoral spokeswoman Mary Cashiola wrote in an email: ""In the budgets he has presented, laying off fire and police personnel has never been submitted, planned, or agreed to at any level.""

In an email response, MPA vice president Essica Littlejohn confirmed that by ""city leadership,"" the MPA was referring to Wharton, providing links to two TV news reports featuring interviews with the mayor. She names Wharton specifically and says that he ""expressed that police and fire would not be exempt from layoffs as in years past, although that option would be a last resort. It is our belief that Mayor Wharton planted the seed of police and fire layoffs to soften the blow regarding the need for a property tax increase. So to answer your question, yes, there were definitely threats made to lay off police and fire personnel.""

One of the TV reports, from WPTY’s ABC 24, does indeed lead with this sentence: ""Mayor A C Wharton is considering police and fire department layoffs in Memphis as he prepares to present his budget ideas to city council members next week.""

Another, from WMC’s Action News 5, has this headline: ""Memphis police, firefighters could face layoffs."" The station even used this wording in the web address to try to attract the attention of search engines like Google: ""police-and-firemen-now-included-in-city-layoffs.""

So, case closed, right? Not exactly, at least when you look at what the mayor said rather than how the TV stations teased the pieces to entice viewers.

Wharton told ABC 24: ""I made it a cardinal principle we would not take any boots off the street. But things are so challenging now, I'm not going to rule out anything. Obviously that would be my last resort.""

This is what Wharton told Action News 5: ""I'm not saying yes, I'm not saying no. I'm simply saying that when we go before the council, we will have looked at everything.""

He also said, ""For the whole time I've been in office, that's the first thing we want to protect.""

The mayor’s spokeswoman, Cashiola, contends that ""the Mayor’s statement about it being a last resort shouldn’t be taken as a threat but an indicator of something he did not plan to do. Calling those layoffs a last resort means just that – everything else would be tried before public safety would even receive the slightest consideration.""

The budget the mayor presented, in fact, not only did not propose layoffs for public safety personnel but in fact proposed an overall increase in spending on public safety. Memphis Fire Department director Alvin Benson even said that there will be hiring to replace employees lost through attrition.

Despite that, the commercials continued to run and remain highlighted on the MPA’s website.

Our ruling

In trying to influence the Memphis budget hearings, the Memphis Police Association ran commercials claiming that a mayor who still has never proposed cuts in public safety areas was ""threatening to lay off police and emergency services personnel to balance the budget.""

Though the mayor said he was ""not going to rule out anything"" he never said there were serious plans to lay off cops or emergency services personnel. In fact, he said such moves would be a ""last resort"" and the budget he eventually proposed calls for increased spending on public safety.

We therefore rule the police union’s statement False.",/factchecks/2012/jun/03/memphis-police-association/memphis-police-union-says-mayor-wharton-threatened/
"['Environment', 'Rhode Island', 'Energy', 'Lisa Blais']","
Tea Party leader Lisa Blais says Rhode Island consumers are now paying for Deepwater wind turbine project in their electric bills.
","
The controversy over Rhode Island's decision to guarantee $75 million in loans to 38 Studios to develop video games has raised questions about the government's role in promoting various businesses.

When Lisa Blais, a member of the board of directors of Ocean State Tea Party In Action, was asked about the deal on the May 21 edition of WHJJ's ""Helen Glover Show,"" she brought up the state's support of the Deepwater Wind project, which is planning to build wind turbines in the waters off Block Island.

""As you know, we came out against Deepwater,"" Blais said. ""And everybody is now paying for it in their electric bills.""

With the Rhode Island economy in such bad shape and many residents facing financial problems, ""who can afford these extra surcharges on our electric bill,"" she asked, calling the Deepwater project another example of ""crony capitalism.""

Her claim caught our attention because Deepwater is still in the planning stages, years away from completion. We wondered: Are Rhode Islanders really paying for a project that hasn’t been built?

Before we answer that question, here’s some background.

In 2004, the General Assembly passed a law requiring National Grid -- the company that provides electricity and gas to Rhode Island -- to start buying electricity generated from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, even though such sources cost more.

In 2007, when the law took effect, the amount was 3 percent of the power the company purchased, rising incrementally each year. It is now at 6.5 percent, according to David Graves, spokesman for National Grid.

In 2009, the legislature and Gov. Donald Carcieri modified that law, requiring National Grid to actively encourage renewable energy projects; one of them was to be an undersea power line from Block Island to the mainland.

The line would be used to feed cheaper power to the island (currently the island relies on diesel generators for its power). Ultimately, the line would feed excess electricity from the Deepwater turbines to the mainland when the wind is blowing.

In the first phase, there would be five turbines. In the second phase, up to 200 more would be built in federal waters.

National Grid has racked up some legal costs dealing with that power line and those costs are being passed on to consumers as part of a 0.007 cents per kilowatt hour surcharge on their bills. For the typical residential customer -- who uses about 500 kilowatts per month -- that surcharge translates to no more than 3.5 cents per month.

The real cost is going to come when National Grid has to buy the power Deepwater generates.

Initially, National Grid and Deepwater agreed that National Grid would pay no more than 24.4 cents per kilowatt hour for that energy -- but that was still more than two and a half times the cost of buying energy from conventional sources at the time. However, that price would automatically increase by 3.5 percent per year over the next 20 years.

The state Public Utilities Commission overruled the deal on March 30, 2010, saying the price was not ""commercially reasonable"" for Grid's customers.

Carcieri and legislative leaders reacted by passing a law requiring the PUC to rehear the case using different rules and a shortened timetable. It also redefined what was ""commercially reasonable"" and declared that Deepwater's initial Block Island project was ""in the public interest.""

Critics said the changes gave the PUC no choice but to approve the agreement, even though the project was expected to result in consumers paying $409 million to $415 million extra for their power while getting economic benefits worth $129 million (as calculated by the state Economic Development Commission) and the creation of just six permanent jobs.

The PUC approved the agreement by a 2-1 vote on Aug. 11, 2010.

How much extra will the power from Deepwater Wind ultimately cost consumers?

On an individual basis, Graves said, the best estimate in 2009 was that the typical residential bill would rise by $1.37 per month. The actual amount will depend on prices at the time. To put that number in context, the bill for the average customer is currently $78 a month.

But the costs will show up in other ways as well, as businesses struggle with more-expensive electricity, an effect that will ripple through the Rhode Island economy. Benefits, such as cleaner energy, are even harder to quantify.

Our ruling

Lisa Blais of the Ocean State Tea Party In Action said that, in the wake of the state's approval of the Deepwater Wind project, ""everybody is now paying for it in their electric bills.""

When we asked for the source of her information, she said she remembered it from the debate over Deepwater, but said she should have referred to the extra cost as something consumers will be facing.

""I would have been more precise if I said now 'we face' paying for it, which was the tenor of my comments on Glover's show,"" she said.

If the Deepwater Wind project becomes operational and if prices for purchasing electricity don't change significantly, Blais' statement could become true.

But most radio listeners would have heard what we did: that we're paying for the project now.

In the strictest sense, we're paying less than 3.5 cents a month for some incidental National Grid expenses connected with the project. That's enough to avoid a False on the Truth-O-Meter, but not enough juice to move the needle very far.

We rate her statement Mostly False.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says federal officials ""verified"" his administration's job-gains numbers
","
In the final gubernatorial recall debate, Gov. Scott Walker sought to close the door on opponent Tom Barrett’s claim that Wisconsin lost jobs in 2011, as monthly surveys of businesses have shown.

His administration had drawn criticism in mid May from Democrats for rushing out much more favorable jobs numbers -- part of a more detailed census of businesses -- before federal labor officials could sign off on them.

In the May 31, 2012 debate, Walker stressed that those federal officials had now completed their review of the more comprehensive data -- and confirmed that Wisconsin not only hadn’t lost jobs in Walker’s first year, but gained even more than state officials thought.

""Yesterday the US Bureau of Labor Statistics … sent an email to the state’s Workforce Development department saying they’ve reviewed and verified the numbers,"" Walker said, adding the agency had put the job gain at 23,608, a bit larger than Walker’s preliminary number from mid-May.

Barrett pounced, saying that a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics official was quoted in the Journal Sentinel as saying the numbers were not in fact final.

So who’s right?

BLS officials could clear this up, but they have chosen to stick with their policy of not commenting on any individual state’s data before they post the numbers for all 50 states on the federal agency’s website in late June 2012 -- weeks after the recall election.

They repeated to us what they have said to other reporters: They have completed their review but can’t say anything about the quality of the numbers.

""BLS approved the submission of Wisconsin data as part of the normal processing of data, but does not comment on data until released by BLS,"" the agency’s chief spokesman, Gary Steinberg, said in an email.

The Walker administration has released a cryptic email chain with federal and state officials that it says confirms that federal officials are OK with the numbers crunched by Walker’s administration. Walker cited this in the debate.

The emails are not easy to interpret.

The emails’ reference to the quarterly census of jobs is the number ""202,"" a federal designation for the census. BLS officials in the email chain are with the BLS’s ""Current Data Analysis"" section, or CDA.

One of the emails tells state officials: ""As discussed, CDA has declared the data for the BLS publication to be preliminarily clean.""

In another, a BLS-to-BLS exchange, the message is: ""CDA has declared final signoff.""

Notably, the emails do not spell out what numbers they are signing off on.

Steinberg, of BLS, made clear that ""any state may release its data when ready and does not need to wait for BLS to release data.""

For instance, Minnesota also has released its quarterly census data and -- similar to Wisconsin -- the data shows a much larger job gain than the monthly estimates.

Minnesota released its data only after BLS reviewed and verified it. Wisconsin, by contrast, put its numbers out -- and Walker immediately put them in campaign TV ads -- before BLS had verified them.

Our rating

Walker said the federal government had signed off on the positive jobs numbers and provided some information that supports Walker’s claim.

But his statement leaves out the fact federal officials publicly will not verify the numbers, and the fact that the emails released do not contain any numbers, let alone the ones cited.

Those missing, important details land his claim at Half True.

Democrat Tom Barrett says Republican Gov. Scott Walker is citing jobs numbers that are not commonly used
","
Talk about jobs has dominated the Wisconsin recall election, and in the run-up to the June 5, 2012 vote much of the discussion has turned into a numbers game.

As in: My numbers are better (and more official) than your numbers.

Much of the confusion stems from the unusual decision by the Walker administration to release a batch of 2011 jobs data almost six weeks before it is to be released by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figures come from a census of about 95 percent of state employers, and are viewed as the most accurate measure of employment in Wisconsin.

The numbers, which show an increase of more than 23,000 jobs in 2011, will eventually be used to update the less-accurate monthly BLS numbers Barrett has used to claim a jobs decline.

During the May 31, 2012 debate at Marquette University, Barrett said of Walker: ""I'm saying that he came up with a new set of numbers that are based on a new set of numbers that are used but are not commonly used.""

So just how common are these numbers?

This isn’t the first time we’ve visited this issue.

The last time this flared up, we rated False Walker’s claim that the jobs numbers were ""final"" because the feds had not yet verified them. We rated Walker’s claim the state added 33,200 jobs on his watch Mostly False, in part because he combined the unverified annual census data for 2011 with less reliable monthly survey data for 20122  And we rated False Barrett’s claim Walker ""cooked the books"" by releasing numbers ""he just dreamed up.""

Since then, things have changed a bit.

On May 30, 2012, the Walker administration claimed the state’s census numbers had been verified by the feds and that the number was now even higher -- 23,608. (In a new separate item, we rated Half True that Walker claim from the debate.)

The feds have only said they are done reviewing the state’s figures but, following past practice, will not release any information until June 28, 2012, when numbers for all 50 states are released.

There’s no question Walker rush-released the census numbers. Barrett is right that preliminary census figures are are not typically cited. And there tends to be more focus by the public and media on the monthly numbers. But the census numbers certainly are regularly used. Indeed, the feds use them to firm up the basis for the monthly numbers.

We rate Barrett’s claim Half True.

David Dewhurst says Ted Cruz helps run two national groups leading push to give amnesty to illegal immigrants
","
David Dewhurst, seeking the Republican U.S. Senate nomination, declared before his party's May 2012 primary that opponent Ted Cruz helps steer two groups seeking amnesty for illegal immigrants. 
Dewhurst, who faces Cruz in a July 31, 2012, runoff, leveled the claim in a radio ad his campaign released May 24, 2012, five days before the primary. In the stop, two women discuss Cruz's candidacy and one says: ""Cruz helps run two national organizations that have been leading the push to give amnesty to illegal immigrants."" 
""Amnesty groups? Ted Cruz?"" the other woman replies.

""Yup,"" woman No. 1 says. ""He’s on their boards.""

The specter of Cruz, the state’s former solicitor-general, leading groups that back amnesty runs counter to a March 5, 2012, commentary by Peggy Fikac of the Hearst Newspapers Austin bureau pointed out by Cruz's campaign in response to Dewhurst's ad. Fikac wrote: ""While (Cruz) often tells the story of his father fleeing Cuban oppression and celebrates legal immigration, he's a hard-liner on border security and illegal immigration. He opposes amnesty. ...""

We wondered if Dewhurst, the Texas lieutenant governor, accurately captured Cruz's amnesty activism.

An anti-Cruz website set up by Dewhurst’s campaign says Cruz sits on the boards of the Hispanic Alliance for Prosperity Institute and the Hispanic Leadership Fund, the implication being that both groups are leading the push for amnesty.

About amnesty: As PolitiFact noted in a December 2, 2011, article, Merriam Webster defines amnesty as ""the act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals."" With respect to illegal immigrants, the historical standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. That law enabled illegal residents to become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in the United States by Jan. 1, 1982, and met other minimal requirements. It was widely described as an ""amnesty"" program.
   
But amnesty can be defined differently depending on one’s view of immigration policy. Advocates for more legal immigration often maintain that amnesty means widespread legalization with few requirements. A path to legality or earned legalization, on the other hand, includes fines, waiting periods, proof of English language proficiency, criminal background checks and other criteria.

Those who oppose additional immigration define amnesty more broadly. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, previously told PolitiFact: ""Anything that turns an illegal resident into a legal resident one way or another is an amnesty.""
   
To gauge Dewhurst’s claim, we sought details about the mentioned groups and Cruz’s connections.

Nexis searches for news stories on the groups calling for amnesty came up empty.

But Dewhurst campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch pointed us to the HAP Institute website, which lists Cruz as among about 35 members of its board of advisors. When we peeked, the group also had posted this statement: ""The HAP Institute does not support amnesty nor have we in the past. We seek a productive dialogue from our leaders that will promote free market principles.""

Then again, Hirsch pointed out, the institute in 2011 said it was reasonable for Texas to establish a system enabling illegal immigrants to work legally in the state as proposed by state Rep. Paul Workman, R-Austin. An April 6, 2011, blog post by the institute urged readers to take action as a Texas House committee held a hearing on Workman’s proposal.

Generally, the institute post says, ""a comprehensive state reform bill would need to address three pillars – tougher enforcement, a guest worker program, fines and worker permits – in order to be beneficial. Several states have passed reform bills and the most recent bill passed in Utah contains these elements. Texas in in dire need of comprehensive immigration reform legislation and efforts to pass bills to address these elements must be given a chance.""

We recently reviewed Workman’s proposal in rating Half True a claim by Workman’s 2012 Republican primary challenger, Ryan Downton, that Workman’s legislation provided amnesty for illegal immigrants. House Bill 2886 would have enabled illegal residents paying a fee and clearing a background check to receive state-issued cards enabling them to work in Texas for eight years at a time.

That seems a kind of forgiveness some would consider amnesty. However, the proposal does not go as far as the 1986 federal act, which enabled immigrants to become legal residents for all purposes, not just to work for a period in one state. Significantly, that law put beneficiaries on paths to citizenship; Workman’s proposal would not.

An institute representative, Suzanne Bellsnyder of Austin, registered in favor of Workman’s proposal, according to a witness list for a hearing held by the House Committee on State Affairs on April 6, 2011.

Bellsnyder, a consultant to the institute, which has offices in Austin and Washington, told us by telephone that the group, whose founding members include Cruz, earlier backed President George W. Bush’s 2004 call for immigration reform. Cruz was an adviser in Bush’s 2000 campaign and worked for federal agencies while Bush was president.

Bush outlined an approach, which did not pass into law, that included a temporary worker program for newcomers and for immigrants already living illegally in the country, according to a summary by the Migration Policy Institute. Beneficiaries would have had to apply for renewable three-year temporary visas, the summary says, while unauthorized immigrants applying from within the United States would be required to pay a fee and prove they were already employed. Applicants from other countries would have to show they had a job offer from an American employer.

Bellsnyder said: ""We like guest-worker programs and we want to have a positive debate and momentum on these issues and at some level, a path to citizenship,"" though she cautioned any endorsement of a plan would depend on its provisions. ""It’s not black and white.""

She said the group -- whose education arm, the Hispanic Alliance for Progress, hosted Dewhurst as a speaker at a March 31, 2005, Austin event -- has never been for amnesty, which she defined as letting an offense pass without punishment. Any required payment, she said, would be punishment.

Contrary to Dewhurst’s backup information, Cruz is not a board member with the non-partisan Hispanic Leadership Fund, according to a list on the 4-year-old group’s website. The group’s president, Mario Lopez, told us by phone that he briefed Cruz about the group’s interest in an immigration system that works a couple years ago, though Cruz has not served on its board.

Mindful that since 1986, Congress has not approved a rewrite of immigration laws that might be interpreted as amnesty, we queried national experts and activists on whether the HAP Institute ranks among leading advocates for amnesty, as Dewhurst says.

Negative, they uniformly said.

Donald Kerwin, executive director of the New York-based Center for Migration Studies, told us by phone there has been no recent national push for what he would consider amnesty, meaning forgiveness without hurdles.

Kerwin, who wrote a December 2010 report sketching out the history of U.S. immigration law, further said that business, labor and civil rights groups are most associated with attempts to establish a way for a share of illegal residents to attain legal residency. Conversely, he  said, the HAP Institute has not been a leading advocate.

Similarly, Tamar Jacoby of Washington-based ImmigrationWorks USA, which says it seeks laws bringing the country's legal intake of foreign workers in line with labor needs, said the institute has not been a leading advocate on immigration issues, including amnesty.

Chris Chmielenski of NumbersUSA, which favors reductions in immigration and also tries to track Senate candidate positions on immigration, replied to our inquiry with an email listing 20 groups he considers leading advocates of amnesty. By telephone, Chmielenski said he doesn’t recall institute members testifying before Congress or speaking to immigration on news programs over the past few years nor does he consider them a top proponent of amnesty. ""I definitely would not call them a national leader,"" he said.

Contacted about what we found, Hirsch of Dewhurst's camp urged us to quiz two HAP Institute advisory board members, Jacob Monty and Massey Villarreal. Monty, a Houston lawyer, says in a statement posted online by Dewhurst’s campaign that Cruz was instrumental in helping the institute craft its ""policy on immigration reform"" and says he also supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, giving speeches about it.

Bellsynder told us by phone: ""There isn’t a institute policy or position paper on immigration at this point. We’ve weighed in on proposals.""

We failed to reach Villarreal, but Monty said by phone that Cruz always aligned with the institute’s support for comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for certain illegal residents. He said the group's support extended to members urging senators to back a failed 2007 immigration law overhaul proposed by Sens. Ted Kennedy and John McCain, which Bellsnyder confirmed. However, Monty told us, he has never viewed the institute as favoring unconditional amnesty. 
As we completed this review, Cruz spokesman James Bernsen sent emails pointing out that Monty has donated to Dewhurst's campaign and stressing Cruz's statements on the stump that he opposes amnesty. 
Our ruling

Dewhurst says Cruz, who has said he opposes amnesty, ""helps run two national organizations that have been leading the push to give amnesty to illegal immigrants."" 
That’s weakened from the top because Cruz is on the advisory board for one -- not two -- relevant groups. The HAP Institute favors comprehensive immigration reform, including hurdles that illegal immigrants must clear to qualify for legal residency. It’s at least debatable whether that’s amnesty. 
Most significantly, we were struck by the utter lack of evidence for saying the institute has been leading the national push for amnesty. Far as we can tell, it’s not even among the top 20 advocacy groups on immigration policy.

In Wisconsin recall, Scott Walker says Tom Barrett plans to spend $100 million on 2-mile ""trolley""
","
Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tom Barrett discussed economic development for Milwaukee during a debate on May 31, 2012, five days before Wisconsin’s historic gubernatorial recall election.

Walker said his plan, announced a month earlier, is to spend $100 million in a multi-faceted effort to improve ""the most impoverished corner"" of the city.

In contrast, he claimed Barrett’s plan is ""to spend $100 million on a trolley that goes barely two miles on the east side of Milwaukee,"" suggesting that amount of public money would be used.

Barrett, the Milwaukee mayor, is the chief supporter of a plan to create a rail system in the city, which he has said is aimed at growing the city’s tax base.

But did Walker describe it accurately?

Walker used the term trolley for maximum rhetorical effect, but what Barrett backs is a modern streetcar that resembles a light-rail vehicle. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, the first segment would run two miles from the city’s lower east side to the downtown Amtrak/Greyhound station.

So, parts of Walker’s claim are off in that the streetcar wouldn’t run only on the city’s east side. And it’s more than a ""trolley.""

But let’s get to the larger part of his claim -- that the plan is to spend $100 million.  

When asked for backup, Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews provided Journal Sentinel news articles in 2011 and 2012 citing various cost figures.

Construction -- $64.6 million: The Journal Sentinel reported in February 2012 that $54.9 million would come from federal transit aid and $9.7 million from tax incremental financing, which is done through city borrowing.

Debt service -- $5.4 million: This borrowing would be on top of the borrowing for a downtown tax incremental financing district, resulting in a longer pay-off period and an increase of $5.4 million in debt service costs, the newspaper reported.

Relocating utilities -- $55 million: The Journal Sentinel said utility companies warned that relocating utility lines would cost more than $55 million, but that it had not yet been determined whether the utilities and their customers, the city, or a combination would cover the cost.

However, that number is not certain.

Both We Energies and the city have said the final figure could be much lower and, if it isn’t, the city could revise its plan -- likely by shifting the route -- to lower the cost of relocating the utilities.

If the state Public Service Commission orders the city to pay part of the relocation costs, the Common Council could authorize additional spending, cut the project back or kill it.

Annual operation cost -- $2.65 million: The $1 fares, parking fees and sponsorships would cover operation costs. But they would be borne by streetcar riders and sponsors, not the city.

To recap, using round numbers:

The city has committed to spending $65 million in mostly federal money and borrowed funds to build the streetcar line. The borrowing would add $5 million to the city’s debt service costs, for a total of $70 million.

Relocating utilities could cost another $55 million. But ultimately the figure could be much less and it’s unknown whether utility ratepayers or city taxpayers or both would be ordered to cover the cost.

Finally, Matthews cited a July 2011 Journal Sentinel article that said the city would seek federal money to extend the planned streetcar line. So, she argues, Barrett ultimately supports spending even more.

But that extra spending is off point, in that Walker limited his claim to the planned two-mile loop. In any case, the newspaper later reported that the repeated efforts at getting more money had failed.

Our rating

Walker said Barrett plans ""to spend $100 million on a trolley that goes barely two miles on the east side of Milwaukee,"" suggesting the plan is to spend that much in  public money.

The city has committed to spending $70 million -- for a streetcar that would run from the east side to downtown. And the plan Barrett backs would require utility relocation that could push the total cost above $100 million -- but that’s not clear, nor is who would bear the cost.

Barrett was ready to spend more than $100 million, but that was for a line longer than the two-mile line, and that’s not currently in the plan given that efforts to obtain extra funding have failed.

Gov. Scott Walker says for the first time in 12 years property taxes fell on a median value home
","
Defending his fiscal policies and collective bargaining limits during the final debate before the June 5, 2012 recall vote, Gov. Scott Walker put property tax relief near the top of his bragging list.

""We’ve seen property taxes go down for the first time in 12 years on a median valued home,"" Walker said during the WISN-TV debate at the Marquette University Law School.

Is his claim on the money?

Walker’s office pointed to the annual estimates from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Those reports show an upward trend in the property tax bill for a median-valued home, from 2000 to 2010. Some years it was close to flat; the year-to-year increases ranged from a tiny 0.1 percent to 4.6 percent.

This leads us to 2011, the first year under Walker and his budget’s tight limits on local property tax increases. Those caps included a virtual freeze on the ability of local governments to increase the tax levy.

In preliminary estimates during the budget process, the Fiscal Bureau projected the median residential bill would go up. But Walker’s administration -- using actual figures reported by schools and municipal governments -- announced in April 2012 that the bill for a median-priced home in 2011 saw a 0.4 percent drop.


To be sure, that doesn’t mean every homeowner’s bill went down, just that a median-valued home would see a small drop. The approach is simply a way of roughly measuring year-to-year changes.

While Walker’s claim appears on target, the overall amount of property taxes collected in the state will likely go up a bit, not down.

The reason: Walker is using a typical residential home, not looking at the total of all residential collections, and his figures does not include commercial and agricultural property.

The Fiscal Bureau is still checking the administration’s math and fine-tuning the numbers, but so far the data clearly supports a decrease, said Fred Ammerman, the Fiscal Bureau’s property tax program supervisor.

So, the fact the numbers are not final adds a note of caution to the mix.

But the figure Walker cited is a commonly used benchmark that last dropped from 1999 to 2000. And he made it clear he was talking about just residential property.

Kelly Ayotte claims student loan change is 'government takeover' with profits pay for health care law
","
College loans and universal health care might not seem to be related, but U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-NH, says there is an unusual linkage. 
Ayotte tied the two issues together last month in a May 8, 2012, email that her office sent to the press titled, ""We Can Prevent a Student Loan Rate Increase Without Raising Taxes.""

The message, meant to convey Ayotte’s stance on temporarily extending existing rates on new subsidized Stafford loans, raised some questions about where student loan interest is going, and whether government ""profits"" from those loans are used to help pay for the health care law.

""Under the Affordable Care Act, which amounted to a federal takeover of the student loan industry, the government borrows money at 2.8 percent and then loans money to students at 6.8 percent. Government profits are then used to help pay for the health care law,"" Ayotte asserted.

PolitiFact Ohio has already laid out how the federal government is using student loans to pay for some health care reforms when it fact-checked a claim made by Sen. Rob Portman. Through the Reconciliation Act of 2012, which combined student loans and health care in one bill, Congress removed the private sector from the student loan process, to eliminate federal payments to banks and to move the revenue from the lending process into federal coffers.

The savings was expected to be about $58 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, with $39 billion going back into student loan programs, $10 billion toward deficit reduction and $9 billion directed toward health care.

Yet, Ayotte’s email took Portman’s logic a step further, claiming a government takeover of the student loan industry and using profits to pay for Obamacare.

PolitiFact has given plenty of Pants on Fire ratings to claims that say Obama’s health care law is a federal takeover of the health care system -- it was PolitiFact's Lie of the Year for 2010. But a takeover of the student loan industry?

That’s a new one.

First we contacted Ayotte’s legislative office to get sources for the claim. They cited PolitiFact Ohio’s Half True ruling on Portman’s claim as back up for Ayotte’s statement. But that only dealt with a portion of what Ayotte was saying.

PolitiFact Ohio walked through the history of government involvement with student loans, up to the Reconciliation Act of 2010, which permanently moved the government away from subsidizing private lenders for student loans as had been the practice since 1965.

With the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, created with the Higher Education Act of 1965, the federal government guaranteed student loans against default by promising a certain interest rate to the banks, even if the rates students paid were lower.

In other words, the government money has always been behind the loans to American students.

""(The Reconciliation Act of 2010) didn’t take over the student loan industry, it ended a federal program,"" said Jason Delisle,  Director of the Federal Education Budget Project at the New America Foundation. ""The semantic problem of the government taking over its own program is really kind of crazy.""

""You wouldn’t talk about the government taking over the Social Security program, or a government takeover of Medicare,"" Delisle said. ""It didn’t take over the industry. The private companies that were involved were participating in a federal program and were getting paid for that. So how do you get ‘federal takeover’ out of that?""

Through the FFEL program, the government paid additional fees to banks for administration and collection of student loans, providing them a revenue stream. While millions of Americans earned college degrees, the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies, and some in Washington, especially Democrats, sought alternatives, which ultimately prompted The Reconciliation Act of 2010.

When we asked Ayotte’s office to address the ""federal takeover"" of student loans, they pointed to the CBO break down of the Reconciliation Act that explains the reconciliation package would eliminate the federal guaranteed loan program and replace it with direct loans administered by the Department of Education and funded through the U.S. Treasury.

Because the government has always backstopped student loans, calling the Reconciliation Act of 2010 a ""federal takeover"" isn’t accurate, said Justine Sessions, a spokeswoman for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Pensions and Labor, which is chaired by Democrat Tom Harkin.

""What the health care reconciliation package did was eliminate the middleman,"" Sessions said. ""The middleman equals a bunch of private banks.""

In addition, many of the same companies involved in the guaranteed loan program service the expanded direct loan program, Delisle added. They include nonprofit and for-profit companies, including Sallie Mae, Nel Net, Mohela, Granite State Management and Resources, among others.

""The federal government can’t do all this work itself,"" Delisle said. ""(The guaranteed loan program) wasn’t really a private sector thing. What’s really important to understand about that is the government set all of the terms on the loans, the interest rates, the terms of repayment, all of that was set in law and the loan companies couldn’t change those.""

And private lenders can still make loans to students, Delisle added.

""They can do it, they just don’t get any subsidies from the government,"" Delisle said. ""They don’t do it because it’s a money loser.""

As for the rates Ayotte’s staff provided, those were accurate, Delisle said, but to call the interest the government gains on the loans ""profits,"" is a stretch.

""Banks can borrow at the same rate as the federal government,"" Delisle said. ""They don’t make money off lending to students at 6.8 percent. … This concept that the difference between the rate the government charges on the loan and the rate they pay to borrow is profit, is totally wrong.""

Subsidized loans do not make money for the government, Sessions said. They actually cost the federal government money.

""The claim seems to conflate two completely unrelated issues,"" Sessions said. ""The 6.8 percent interest rate was set by Congress in 2002 with overwhelming bipartisan support and it was the projected average rate that would result in 2006 under a fixed rate formula.""

Loans had the same interest rates under both the direct loan and FFEL programs, Sessions said, and the cost of student loans to the government fluctuates with program changes, economic conditions, borrower repayment patterns, and the relationship between the government’s borrowing rate and the interest rate at which borrowers repay loans.

There’s also more to the cost of the loan than what the government pays to borrow, Delisle added, including losses from defaults, administrative costs, cost of equity, loan forgiveness, and risk. Current fixed rates do not offset those additional costs.

""The bottom line is that the claim about the 2010 legislation that cut out the middleman in the student loan system is completely unrelated to the claim about what government charges for student loans,"" Sessions said. ""Reinstating the FFEL program would cost the government additional fees and subsidies that would be paid to banks.""

Our ruling

The government’s Reconciliation Act of 2010 was not a takeover, but rather an elimination of a federal student loan program the government had used since 1965. Private companies are still involved in servicing the program and private lenders can still make their own student loans without a government subsidy.

The government does borrow in the 2.8 percent ballpark and loans money to students at 6.8 percent but the difference is not a profit, it helps compensate for the unanticipated losses inherent with any loan. Finally, the money saved in the Reconciliation Act of 2010, not ""profits"" from the direct loans, is used to fund elements of the Affordable Care Act.

Since Ayotte’s statements have elements of truth but lack critical facts, we give her a Mostly False. 
UPDATE: This item has been updated to note that Justine Sessions is a spokeswoman for the Democrat-controlled Senate Committee on Health, Education, Pensions and Labor. Also, we have corrected a quotation from Jason Delisle who said he mistakenly said the government does not ""make money off lending to students at 2.8 percent,"" when he meant to say 6.8.",/factchecks/2012/jun/01/kelly-ayotte/kelly-ayotte-claims-student-loan-change-government/

In Wisconsin recall, Dem challenger Tom Barrett says no one on his staff ""has ever been charged with a crime”
","
Part of the May 31, 2012 gubernatorial recall debate focused on an ongoing John Doe criminal investigation into Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s time as Milwaukee County executive.

Walker has created a criminal defense fund to pay attorneys but has maintained he is not a target of the secret probe, which is being conducted by the Milwaukee County district attorney’s office. The probe has led to criminal charges against three former Walker aides, an appointee and a major campaign contributor.

Walker’s challenger in the June 5, 2012 election, Democrat and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, alluded to the charges when he said: ""I have a police department that arrests felons. He (Walker) has a practice of hiring them.""
 
To be sure, felony charges are among those pending, but none involving Walker aides or the appointee has yet resulted in a felony conviction.

A few minutes later Barrett fired again:

""I just want to say I’ve been in public life for 28 years,"" said Barrett, who served in the state Legislature and Congress before becoming Milwaukee mayor in 2004, ""and no one on my staff has ever been charged with a crime, and I’ve never had a criminal defense fund.""

A quick Google search, however, found a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article reporting that Joseph N. Cantu, a receptionist in Barrett’s mayoral office, was charged in May 2010 with suffocating his ex-girlfriend.

""These are shocking and serious charges,"" Patrick Curley, Barrett's chief of staff, said at the time.

Court records show Cantu was charged with two felonies and a misdemeanor, but pleaded guilty to three misdemeanors: disorderly conduct and two counts of battery. He was sentenced to two years of probation and 90 days in jail.

We were not able to do a complete search of all his staffers in all his past offices, but this alone contradicts the claim.

Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told the Journal Sentinel there is a big difference between an office receptionist being charged with a crime outside of work and the job-related charges faced by Walker aides in the Doe probe.

However, in making the claim, Barrett made no such distinction.

Barrett said flatly ""no one on my staff has ever been charged with a crime."" His receptionist was charged in 2010 with battery and was convicted.

Joe Biden says 3.5 million jobs lost during Bush administration
","

Vice President Joe Biden spent a lot of time in New Hampshire during the 2008 election, both as a candidate himself and as President Barack Obama’s running mate. So, when he returned to the Granite State earlier this month, he looked back to 2008 and the economic turmoil that year.

Speaking May 22 to a crowd at Keene State College, Biden referred to the start of the national recession in the fall of 2008 and to the failing economy he and Obama inherited when they came into office.

""In the last six months of the Bush administration, we lost 3.5 million jobs,"" Biden told the crowd. ""As a matter of fact, on that magnificent day … when we were sworn in, before I lowered my hand that day after taking the oath … we’d already lost over 760,000 jobs that month.""

Claims and blames like this have become a rallying cry of sorts for Obama’s re-election campaign. But, are they true? PolitiFact decided to take a look.

The source of the numbers wasn’t hard to find. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks employment numbers from month to month dating back to 1939.

The data from the last six months of the Bush administration supports Biden’s claim. A search of the job figures from July 2008 through January 2009 shows the country lost 3.47 million jobs during that time, falling from 137 million from July 2008 to 133.6 million in January 2009, according to the bureau’s monthly count.

Those figures, which are seasonally adjusted, are based on payroll surveys collected the 12th of each month from 141,000 businesses and government agencies across 486,000 locations, according to Gary Steinberg, a spokesman for the labor statistics bureau.

The labor statistics show that job losses started to mount before the end of the Bush administration. Driven by the bursting housing bubble, the country lost 84,000 jobs between January and February 2008. But the job losses grew, reaching 200,000 in April. And by September, when Lehman Brothers collapsed in the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, job losses spiked again, reaching 489,000 in October and 803,000 in November.

When Obama and Biden took office in January 2009, the country had already lost 818,000 jobs from the prior month, falling from 134.4 million in December 2008 to 133.6 million in January. But, if you pro-rate those figures to the Jan. 20 inauguration date referenced by Biden, the economy would have lost about 527,000 jobs, roughly two-thirds of the month’s total. That number falls below Biden’s claim of 760,000 jobs lost by the time he took office.

The steep job losses continued through the first few months of the Obama presidency, which lost 3.4 million from February through July 2009, according to the labor data. In October 2010, the economy started adding jobs, and job growth has been evident for 19 consecutive months, according to the labor figures.

In total, the economy has lost 1.4 million jobs since Obama and Biden took office.

""It had gotten bad by (the time they came into office),"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. ""Regardless of political leanings, it is not ambiguous that Obama inherited a labor market in free fall.""

Our ruling:

The economic recovery and job creation during the Obama administration will be a leading point of contention throughout the 2012 election. As for the labor situation Obama and Biden inherited when they came to office, there’s little room for debate. Federal labor statistics support Biden’s claim that the country lost 3.5 million jobs in the last six months of the Bush administration, but they show he overstated the losses reported by inauguration day, Jan. 20, 2009.

Car repair bill catches eye in Cobb chairman's race
","
Cobb County politics is much like the onetime hit television sitcom ""Cheers.""

Everyone knows your name in the Boston bar, and there are few things that occur that go unnoticed.

For example, the county government’s commission chairman, Tim Lee, seemed to have the scoop on Bill Byrne, the man who once had that job and wants it back.

In a recent Marietta Daily Journal ""Around Town"" political column, Lee appeared to question Byrne’s campaign ethics.

""I have not paid to have my personal car worked on with campaign funds like some other candidates,"" Lee said.

Lee didn’t refer to Byrne by name, but the inference seemed obvious. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to see if Lee was engaging in some campaign fact twisting or did he deserve a toast for telling the truth?

Cobb is Georgia’s fourth highest-populated county. The Cobb chairman is an influential perch for deciding policy on public safety, transportation and water resources. Cobb is also a treasure-trove of Republican votes. Lee’s predecessor, Sam Olens, a Republican, is now Georgia’s attorney general.

As the headline to the article suggested, the race for county chairman -- arguably one of the most powerful local government posts in Georgia -- is heating up. Earlier in the column, Byrne suggested that Lee would not achieve his fundraising goals. Lee countered that he was on track to raise his previously stated target of at least $200,000 and said he spent money on legitimate campaign expenses -- unlike an unnamed opponent.

We tried to contact Lee a couple of times in recent weeks, leaving messages on a telephone number the chairman listed on his candidate campaign disclosure forms filed with the state. We received no reply. PolitiFact Georgia also called the county government’s communications director and explained the article we were reporting. No reply.

PolitiFact Georgia caught up with Lee at a candidate forum Wednesday organized by the East Cobb Civic Association at the East Cobb Library. The chairman told PolitiFact Georgia that he read Byrne’s most recent candidate disclosure report, which mentioned money spent on a vehicle, and decided to talk about it to The Marietta Daily Journal. Lee said he considered it an old matter in a brief interview before Wednesday’s forum and declined further comment.

So what did the report show?

On Jan. 31, 2012, Byrne reported he spent $209.78 on ""servicing campaign truck."" Byrne told PolitiFact Georgia he used the money to pay for a tuneup and repair a brake line. Byrne said he uses a 2008 red GMC pickup truck that he owns for campaign purposes. Byrne is an old-school campaigner, who said he drives around the county to spread his message.

Byrne sent PolitiFact Georgia a photo of the vehicle, which had a campaign sign attached to the passenger’s door and a large campaign sign in the truck bed. The vehicle was parked in front of Byrne’s campaign office in Marietta. The truck was parked in the lot outside the East Cobb Library on Wednesday.

""It’s a campaign vehicle,"" Byrne said in one telephone interview.

We asked Byrne what he thought about Lee’s initial comment.

""He has the right to say anything he wants, and I have the right to respond,"" Byrne told us.

Georgia’s campaign finance act has no specific language about funding vehicle repairs with campaign funds. The law advises candidates to spend on necessary campaign purposes. William Perry, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, an ethics watchdog group, said the law is vague on such spending.

Perry told us the repairs could be legitimate if Byrne needs the vehicle for campaign purposes, and if the candidate is not attempting to get reimbursed for the mileage he is driving for the campaign. Otherwise, Perry said it could be ""double-dipping"" by Byrne.

It is true that the vehicle belongs to Byrne. It is also true that Byrne used campaign funds to pay for repairs on the truck. Byrne does seem to be using the vehicle for campaign purposes, which the candidate said in his disclosure report. Lee did not mention that when he was quoted in the column. 

That context is critical for readers to fully understand the chairman’s statement.

A month later, Trump waded in further to make the Pants on Fire claim that windmills cause cancer. Now, we have a meme roaming social media that claims Canadian author and professor Thomas Homer-Dixon said that windmills will ""never"" generate as much energy as was expended to build the structures. The full quote: ""A two-megawatt windmill contains 260 tonnes of steel requiring 170 tonnes of coking coal and 300 tonnes of iron ore, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons.""

The phrase is a partial quote cherry-picked from a chapter written by earth scientist David Hughes in the 2009 book ""Carbon Shift: How Peak Oil and the Climate Crisis Will Change Canada (and Our Lives),"" a book Homer-Dixon edited. Here is the full passage: ""The concept of net energy must also be applied to renewable sources of energy, such as windmills and photovoltaics. A two-megawatt windmill contains 260 tonnes of steel requiring 170 tonnes of coking coal and 300 tonnes of iron ore, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons. The question is: how long must a windmill generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it? At a good wind site, the energy payback day could be in three years or less; in a poor location, energy payback may be never. That is, a windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it."" The meme does get a part of the quote right, but it strategically leaves out large swaths of information in order to give people the impression that all windmills never expend the amount of energy that was invested in it, which is not accurate. The meme’s omitted section explains that, while poorly placed windmills may never generate enough energy payback, a good wind site could generate it in three years or less. Homer-Dixon, who served as the founding director of the Waterloo Institute for Complexity and Innovation and is currently a professor at the Balsillie School of International Affairs, even called out the meme in a May 2018 post on his website. ""It’s worth noting that it would be pointless to put wind turbines in poor locations, and it’s trivial, or meaningless, to say that a turbine would never pay back its embedded energy in a poor location,"" Homer-Dixon wrote in the post.

GOP blames Evers’ budget for potential property tax hike
","Property taxes are where ideology hits home for Wisconsin residents Debates over budget priorities echo through the statehouse and social media feeds ad nauseum, but the core question for many people is how what happens in Madison affects their wallet. Republicans say more money will be leaving taxpayer pockets under Gov. Tony Evers’ budget than any time in the recent past. ""Governor Evers' budget would increase property taxes by the largest amount in a decade,"" the Wisconsin Assembly GOP tweeted March 27, 2019. ""Republicans have worked hard over the past 8 years to provide $3.56 billion in property tax relief to Wisconsin homeowners."" So Republicans are asserting not just that property taxes are going up, but that Evers’ budget is to blame for that increase. We checked it out. Property tax increase would be largest in a decade The Republicans’ claim, as noted in the tweet, is based on a hypothetical median-valued home. It’s a standard metric used to evaluate budget impact since it represents a ""typical"" Wisconsin homeowner. We’ve previously used that metric to examine numerous property tax claims, including state Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, and then-Gov. Scott Walker saying in recent years that property taxes are lower than in 2010. Both were rated Mostly True. Using the median value — which for 2019-’20 is $173,646 — the numbers do show a property tax increase, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. If Evers’ budget were passed as proposed, property taxes for the median-valued home would be an estimated $2,927 in 2019-’20. That’s an increase of $56 or 2 percent from the 2018-‘19 level. That would be the largest year-over-year increase since an $87 jump in 2009-’10. Property taxes would rise another $45 or 1.5 percent in 2020-’21, the second year of the budget. Remember that these are statewide average rates — the changes on an individual tax bill won’t match these numbers because of the taxing decisions made by local municipalities, differing values of homes and other factors. Evers’ budget just one of many factors in increase But the Republicans’ claim goes awry blaming Evers’ budget for the increase. Kit Beyer, communications director for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, said the March 27 claim relied on Evers’ own Department of Administration estimate of the tax impact. The DOA numbers did show the largest increase in a decade, but they didn’t detail what was behind the  increase. A fiscal bureau report released April 9, 2019, showed the increase isn’t simply due to changes in the governor’s budget. It’s largely a result of current law — decisions made by local municipalities, voters and state government under Walker. In fact, while some of Evers’ individual proposals would raise taxes, the overall budget would actually reduce the property tax level from what it would have been under current law alone. Fiscal bureau calculations say current law on its own would mean property taxes would go up by $72 on the median home in 2019-’20; under Evers’ budget the increase drops to $56. Under current law, tax levies for school districts, technical colleges, municipalities and counties are expected to grow by 2 percent to 3 percent each in 2019-’20, according to the fiscal bureau. Some of those increases will be offset by new construction.The rest could affect the tax rate. Meanwhile, Evers’ budget would increase the property taxes districts are able to impose by $123 million in 2019-’20, but that would be offset by a $205 million increase in general school aids from the state. That would create a net drop in school-related taxes. Melissa Baldauff, a spokeswoman for Evers, also noted some factors that significantly impact the property tax level are outside the governor’s control. Those include school district tax levies implemented under current law and an unprecedented level of school spending approved by referendum, such as for new building projects or expanding annual spending beyond the typical limits. In 2018 alone, Wisconsin voters approved a record $2 billion in K-12 school spending statewide through referendums, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum. Beyer argued Evers deserves the blame for any increases under his budget plan. ""If he didn’t want (property taxes) to go up by this much, he could have taken actions to reduce it,"" she said in an email. ""As a comparison, over the last eight years, Governor Walker and the Legislature took numerous actions to keep property taxes low."" Our rating Republicans claimed in a tweet that Evers’ budget would increase Wisconsin property taxes by the largest amount in a decade. The estimate they relied on does show the largest year-over-year increase since 2009-’10. But the increase is not solely a result of Evers’ budget. Rather, it is based, in part, on a host of decisions by voters in referendums, by local units of government and by Walker and Republican leaders in years past. Indeed, the overall impact of Evers’ budget is to help keep the increase in check.

NC doesn't have the second-most drug overdose deaths
","To reduce opioid overdose deaths, North Carolina lawmakers want to crack down on the people who distribute them. A pair of bills introduced in the state House and Senate would impose new penalties on people who illegally give a controlled substance to someone who died as a result of taking it. The idea is controversial. Some think it would deter people from calling 911 if someone they know is overdosing, several local media outlets reported. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Brown, a Jacksonville Republican and co-sponsor of one of the bills, promoted it in the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 9. ""North Carolina last year was second in the nation in overdose deaths,"" Brown told the committee in opening remarks. Overdose death rates have increased in recent years as Americans have abused prescription painkillers and street drugs, such as heroin. Appalachian states are some of the most affected. As PolitiFact North Carolina has previously reported, statistics at one point showed that an average of four North Carolinians die from an overdose every day. PolitiFact NC knows there’s a problem, and we won’t pass judgment on whether the bill is warranted. But we wondered if Brown’s claim about North Carolina’s ranking is accurate. Turns out, he’s off. NOT EVEN CLOSE The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a federal government agency, is the leading authority on mortality in America. According to the most recent CDC data, which analyzed 2017 stats, North Carolina isn’t even in the top 10 for states with the highest drug overdose death rate. That year, North Carolina had the 19th highest drug overdose death rate in the country and the 10th highest total number of overdose deaths. West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and New Hampshire had the highest drug overdose death rates in the country. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, California and New York had the most drug overdose deaths. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research organization, uses data from the CDC and National Center for Health Statistics to track opioid overdose deaths, specifically. Like the CDC, Kaiser’s most recent information is from 2017. That year, North Carolina didn’t rank among the 10 states with the highest rates for opioid deaths or total number of overdose deaths. KFF reported that North Carolina in 2017 had the 16th highest rate of opioid overdose deaths in the country and the 20th highest overdose rate from all drugs (not just opioids.) WHAT BROWN SAID Contacted by PolitiFact, Brown said he misspoke. He meant to say, ""In 2017, North Carolina had the second highest increase in the country in overdose deaths,"" he said in an email, emphasizing the word increase. Brown cited a story by Charlotte-based radio station WFAE — ""NC’s surge in rate of drug overdose deaths second highest in the U.S."" — as his source. Multiple media outlets, including the News & Observer, reported the CDC’s prediction in August 2018 that 2017 data would show North Carolina had the second-highest increase in drug overdose deaths that year. The CDC often reports provisional (or predicted) data before it finalizes the completed data. In North Carolina’s case this time, the prediction turned out to be slightly off. A CDC report of complete 2017 numbers found that NC had the fourth-highest increase in drug overdose deaths between calendar year 2016-2017. (The Kaiser review of 2017 also found that NC had the fourth-highest increase in drug overdose deaths, as well as opioid overdose deaths.) And the most recent CDC data paints a rosier picture for North Carolina. Again using limited data, the agency reports that NC isn’t among the states with the highest reported overdose deaths or the largest increase in deaths between August 2017 and August 2018. The CDC webpage, ""Provisional drug overdose death counts,"" shows the percent change (increase or decrease) in reported drug overdose deaths between August 2017 and August 2018. The report shows Nebraska, Kansas, Louisiana, Delaware and Hawaii as the states with the largest increases in drug overdose deaths. OUR RULING To promote a controversial bill, Brown said North Carolina ""last year was second in the nation in overdose deaths."" That’s not true, and Brown said he misspoke. But even what he meant to say — that NC had the second-largest increase in total drug deaths — is based on an outdated stat. We rate his claim False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

Cory Booker makes misleading attack on Donald Trump, domestic terrorism funding
","Sen. Cory Booker said President Donald Trump has made it harder for the federal government to go after domestic terrorist groups. ""For Donald Trump to cut funding — to cut funding from the Justice Department to investigate, I mean, he talks about terrorism all the time, but to cut funding to investigate these domestic terrorist groups, these white supremacist groups, is making us less safe,"" Booker said during a March 27 CNN town hall in Orangeburg, S.C. When we asked Booker’s campaign for evidence that Trump cut funding for the Justice Department to investigate terrorism, his campaign largely cited cuts to a separate agency — the Department of Homeland Security. And the cuts that Booker cited were grants that experts told us were for the prevention of terrorism, not the investigation of terrorism. The FBI, under the umbrella of the Justice Department, is the main entity that investigates terrorism. We found no evidence that Trump has cut back investigative funds for the FBI. When we asked about Booker’s statement, his team pointed us to cuts to the Countering Violent Extremism grant program. CVE was launched under Obama to work with community leaders to deter U.S. residents from joining violent extremists groups. In the final days of Obama’s tenure, the Homeland Security announced 31 groups would be awarded a total of $10 million in grants. (The Justice Department  was part of a CVE task force, but it was Homeland Security that awarded the grants.) Once Trump took office, his administration froze the grants. Then, in June 2017, the Homeland Security released a list of 26 grant recipients. Some of the awardees named under Obama had dropped out, citing fears of anti-Muslim bias under the new president. Offers to other awardees had been rescinded. Two that drew attention: Life After Hate and University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. Although both organizations proposed countering messages of extremists or jihadists, they also mentioned expertise in some specific areas. Life After Hate was founded by former neo-Nazis and skinheads while UNC said it had expertise in far right extremism and white supremacy. Homeland Security spokespersons said at the time that the applicants were rejected because they didn’t meet new criteria like working with law enforcement. They were not, they said, rejected for their interest in countering white supremacist thought. Indeed, our review of the accepted projects showed that these grant applicants were strongly centered around working with Muslims, immigrants or refugees; white supremacists were scarcely mentioned. Trump faced criticism that the Countering Violent Extremism program was now too focused on Muslims. But the Obama administration faced the same critique, including from the liberal Brennan Center. ""The picture is more nuanced than, ‘The Obama administration was going after white supremacists and the Trump administration stopped it,’"" Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program, told PolitiFact. ""Neither went after white supremacists."" The CVE grants will end in July and the administration has not requested additional funding, suggesting the grant program could end. Booker’s spokeswoman also pointed to other Homeland Security programs that Trump proposed to cut including the Complex Coordinated Terrorist Attacks. These grants were created following the 2016 terrorist attacks in Paris to help state and local jurisdictions to prepare for and prevent attacks. The grants expire in July. But experts told us that these grant programs are not intended to be directed at investigations. The main investigative agency is the FBI, and we couldn’t find any available data that would show us whether the FBI has cut back on investigating domestic terrorism under Trump. ""I don’t know of public information that would say one way or another, they don’t publicize resource allocation at that level,"" said Brian Jackson, a homeland security researcher at the RAND Corporation who co-wrote a report for Homeland Security on terrorism prevention. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, an expert on terrorism and CEO of Valens Global consulting firm, was a senior advisor to the director of Office of Community Partnerships, which oversaw the CVE program, under both Obama and Trump. He, too, said that these grant programs were not for investigations: ""There is no evidence at all that investigations have been cut."" But Gartenstein-Ross said programs that are designed to thwart domestic terrorism play an important role, even when they are not investigative. Cutting such programs raises red flags among those who believe the federal government should do more to prevent domestic terrorism. ""We should be increasing our ability to work with state and local law enforcement to counter domestic terrorists – not inhibiting it,"" said Ryan Greer, who works on extremism issues at the Anti-Defamation League and formerly worked at the Department of Homeland Security. Booker spokeswoman Sabrina Singh challenged the notion that the anti-terrorism programs Booker referenced in his criticism of Trump were preventative, not investigative: ""I think that is a narrow interpretation. It’s clearly a partnership that helps with investigative work"" Booker said Trump ""cut funding from the Justice Department to investigate these domestic terrorist groups, these white supremacist groups."" For evidence, Booker pointed to cuts to programs from a separate agency -- Homeland Security. He didn’t cite evidence of funding cuts in the Justice Department. In addition, Booker cited as an example the Countering Violent Extremism grant program which set to run out of funds this summer. This program funds terrorism prevention in local communities, not investigations. In 2017, the Trump administration did rescind two Obama-approved CVE grants to groups that had expertise in neo-Nazis, far right extremism or white supremacy.

Viral image about the Confederate flag confuses history
","""So the Confederate flag is not racist, huh?""... That’s how an April 1 Facebook post begins, followed by a sketched portrait of a man and two quotes. The first quote: ""As a people we are fighting to maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race."" And the second quote: ""As a national emblem, it (the Confederate flag) is significant of our higher cause, the cause of the superior race."" The statements are attributed to William T. Thompson, who the post identifies as the Confederate flag’s designer. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s just cut to the chase: Yes, William T. Thompson said these things. The problem with this claim, though, is that he isn’t the designer of what we know today to be the Confederate flag. First you should know that the flag has evolved over time. The first official flag of the Confederacy was adopted in March 1861, according to the Los Angeles Times. It had red and white stripes and a circle of stars against a blue background in the upper left corner. In May 1863, the Confederate Congress approved a new national flag—the so-called Stainless Banner. As John Coski, a historian at the American Civil War Museum, writes in the New York Times, this flag ""was a plain white field emblazoned with what was already a powerful and famous Confederate symbol, the Southern Cross, the star-bedecked blue saltire, or diagonal cross, that had been a famous battle flag since the fall of 1861."" A third flag, which was adopted soon before the Confederacy fell, resembled the second flag only it had a red bar on the right edge. Next, let’s look at what we today think of as the Confederate flag: the Confederate battle flag. It was designed by Confederate politician William Porcher Miles, not William T. Thompson, as the Facebook post claims. Miles chaired the Committee on the Flag and Seal, and though his design was never officially adopted by the Confederacy, it was ""taken up by the Confederate army,"" the Washington Post notes, ""not to mention ‘The Dukes of Hazzard’ and alleged Charleston shooter Dylann Storm Roof."" (Roof has since been convicted and sentenced to death in the 2015 killing of nine African-American churchgoers in South Carolina.) Miles’ design was also incorporated into the Stainless Banner, that second national flag that the Confederate Congress approved in 1863. William T. Thompson is often said to be the designer of the ""Stainless Banner."" The Los Angeles Times, for example, described him as that flag’s designer in its 2015 story about the Confederate flag’s evolution. Also that year, The Washington Post said putting the battle flag on a field of white was ""his idea."" Going even farther back, ""Our Flag: Origin and Progress of the Flag of the United States of America,"" an 1872 book by American naval officer George Henry Preble notes that Thompson ""suggested a white flag with the Southern cross or battle flag for its union, as a national ensign for the Confederacy"" and then asked Capt. Wm. Ross Postell to make a colored drawing of his proposed flag. But Coski questions whether Thompson was really that flag’s designer. He told PolitiFact in an email that he thought others had previously suggested putting the battle flag on a field of white. When we asked if he could confirm, he said ""without substantial research, I don’t think it is possible to confirm that he was the designer."" ""At this point,"" he added, ""it is only a hypothesis."" We reached out to other historians about Thompson’s credit as the Stainless Banner’s designer but the two who responded pointed us back to Coski. One called him one of two experts on the flag (we couldn’t reach the other). Coski could confirm the quotes.     Thompson, as it turns out, was the editor of the Savannah Morning News. According to the book ""Our Flag,"" in an April 1863 editorial, he wrote: Our idea is simply to combine the present battle flag with a pure white standard sheet; our Southern cross, blue on a red field, to take the place on the white flag that is occupied by the blue union in the old United States flag or the St. George’s cross in the British flag. As a people, we are fighting to maintain the heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematic of our cause."" He objected to efforts to add a blue stripe to the center of the white field, according to the book, and after the idea was dropped, he wrote on May 4, 1863: The flag as adopted is precisely the same as that suggested by us a short time since, and it is, in our opinion, much more beautiful and appropriate than either the red and white bars or the white field and blue bar as first adopted by the senate. As a national emblem it is significant of our higher cause the cause of the superior race, and a higher civilization contending against ignorance, infidelity and barbarism. Coski said Thompson’s editorials are well-known and regularly quoted. But, he said: ""most historians consider his a somewhat lone voice and don’t regard his comments as in any way official or representative of the Confederate government."" Our ruling William T. Thompson has been credited with designing the Stainless Banner, one of several flags used by the Confederacy. But not everyone agrees that Thompson was the Banner’s designer; Coski said it’s not possible to prove without substantial research. What’s more, Thompson didn’t design the flag that Americans today think of when they hear ""Confederate flag."" That flag is the Confederate battle flag, and while it was incorporated into the Stainless Banner, it was William Porcher Miles who designed it. Thompson did say what the Facebook post claims. However, he was describing the ""Stainless Banner,"" not the battle flag. We rate this post Half True.",/factchecks/2019/apr/11/viral-image/viral-image-about-confederate-flag/

Hickenlooper expanded Medicaid, created state-run marketplace to insure nearly all Coloradans
","Former two-term Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is a rare breed in the 2020 presidential race — he’s running as a moderate. On health care, he supports universal coverage and boasts about Colorado’s record-low uninsured rate. But unlike many of his opponents in the Democratic primary, he opposes Medicare for All, the single-payer federal system that would guarantee health care coverage to every American. Hickenlooper has been making the rounds on cable talk shows and is trying to distinguish himself as a compromiser. In an interview on MSNBC’s Meet the Press, Hickenlooper said, ""We got to almost universal coverage in health care in Colorado. We expanded Medicaid. We created one of the most innovative exchanges in the country."" His campaign website claims that ""nearly 95 percent"" of Coloradans currently have health care coverage. We wondered how Colorado’s uninsured rate changed during Hickenlooper’s time in the governor’s mansion and how it compares with the rest of the country. The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, authorizes states to expand Medicaid to include health care coverage for all adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Colorado is one of 37 states that has opted to do so. In 2013, then-Gov. Hickenlooper announced his proposal to expand Medicaid at no cost to the state general fund. Under the ACA, the federal government would pay for the program until 2016, after which states had to pay a portion. Hickenlooper planned to cover future expenses with cost-cutting efforts and existing revenues, including a hospital provider fee rolled out in 2009.   Since Hickenlooper launched the Medicaid expansion, Colorado’s uninsured rate has dropped from 14.3% in 2013 to 6.5% in 2017, according to the Colorado Health Institute. However, about 350,000 Coloradans still don’t have health insurance — one-quarter of whom are undocumented, making them ineligible for public insurance. Also, the price of coverage continues to rise in Colorado, where people pay some of the highest premiums in the United States. Hickenlooper saw Medicaid expansion as a step toward his goal to make Colorado the ""healthiest state in America."" But he hasn’t always supported policies that could give more people health care coverage. In 2016, he opposed a ballot measure that would have created a single-payer state health care system called ColoradoCare. Then, he said he’d be open to a Trump administration-backed policy to implement a work requirement for Medicaid recipients. Hickenlooper’s Medicaid expansion more than halved Colorado’s uninsured rate. But if a 6.5% uninsured rate counts as ""almost universal coverage,"" then how many other states can tout that accomplishment? According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Colorado’s uninsured rate positions it squarely in the upper half of the pack, with a national average uninsured rate of 9%. (It’s important to note that the Kaiser Family Foundation measured Colorado’s uninsured rate differently, pegging it at 8%. The Colorado Health Institute said its rate is slightly lower because it includes more data on children.) Kaiser lists 20 states with even lower uninsured rates than Colorado, including Massachusetts at 3% and Iowa at 4%. In an email to PolitiFact, president of the Colorado Health Institute Michele Lueck called Hickenlooper’s claim that ""nearly 95%"" of Coloradans currently have health care coverage a ""friendly rounding error."" About 300,000 fewer Americans bought insurance through HealthCare.gov during the enrollment period in 2018 than in the previous year. Meanwhile, Colorado’s enrollment numbers were up. The Affordable Care Act allowed states to create their own marketplaces to sell insurance plans to people who aren’t covered by their employer, Medicaid, or Medicare — which includes about 8% of the total market in Colorado. Twelve states, including Colorado, run their own marketplaces. Some credit lower enrollment across the country to the Trump administration’s policies to stymie the Affordable Care Act. It cut funding for HealthCare.gov’s budget for marketing and eliminated the penalty for not having insurance. But in Colorado, nearly 6% more people purchased a plan on Connect for Health Colorado, the state-run marketplace that operates independently of the federal government. While HealthCare.gov released fewer ads and shut down on a weekly basis for maintenance, Connect for Health Colorado continued to reach out to eligible customers. Hickenlooper said, ""We got to almost universal coverage in health care in Colorado."" Though Colorado is much closer to universal health care coverage than before the Affordable Care Act, hundreds of thousands of Coloradans remain uninsured and other states have even lower uninsured rates. Nevertheless, the state has an uninsured rate of 6.5%, which is close to universal coverage, as Hickenlooper said. The state achieved this by expanding Medicaid and running its own health care marketplace.

Activist says F-35s bound for Burlington have a nuclear mission. They don’t.
","Plans to base a squadron of the U.S. military’s next generation of fighter jets in Burlington has met stiff resistance among some voters, who last year approved resolutions in three cities to cancel the basing. But the F-35s are still scheduled to arrive starting in September. One of the organizations leading the resistance, the Peace and Justice Center, has turned its focus in recent months to the possibility the jets in Burlington could be equipped with nuclear bombs. Rachel Siegel, the group’s executive director, sent out an email this week titled ""Action Alert: Stop Nuclear bombers coming to Vermont!"" ""The F-35 bombers, scheduled to arrive in Burlington this fall, have been designated with a nuclear mission,"" she wrote. ""This is new information and makes Vermont a target for all other nuclear equipped countries."" When we looked into this issue in June 2018, no F-35 squadrons had been given a nuclear mission, and information about whether such a mission might one day be assigned to Burlington was iffy. But didn’t seem like a decision that was going to be made within a matter of months. Did something change? We asked Siegel what she was referring to. ""I misspoke/got it wrong,"" she replied. ""The F-35 Weapon System does have a nuclear mission; but the individual aircraft have yet to be upgraded to have a nuclear capability."" The upgrade would require software upgrades and retrofitting. The Vermont National Guard said last year that the military does not, as a matter of policy, discuss where nuclear weapons are located. Capt. Mikel Arcovitch, the Guard’s spokesperson, said Tuesday that the mission of the F-35s was subject to change over time depending on what is required. ""The jets arriving to Burlington will not be nuclear capable,"" he added. ""There are no plans to add the hardware to make the 158th Fighter Wing F-35s nuclear capable."" So there are no plans, but the Guard says that plans can change. We reached out to Retired Col. Rosanne Greco, who has been at the fore of the fight against F-35s in Vermont and spent part of her career advising on nuclear targeting. She conceded that Siegel’s message could be easily misread, but was accurate if you disassemble the parts. F-35 bombers are coming to Burlington (true). And F-35s have a nuclear mission (true). Greco cited the U.S. Department of Defence’s 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, which makes numerous references to the F-35 being part of the country’s nuclear deterrence strategy. ""Modernizing our dual-capable fighter bombers with next-generation F-35 fighter aircraft will maintain the strength of NATO’s deterrence posture and maintain our ability to forward deploy nuclear weapons, should the security situation demand it,"" then Defense Secretary Jim Mattis wrote in a preface to the report. ""The United States is incorporating nuclear capability onto the forward-deployable, nuclear capable F-35 as a replacement for the current aging DCA (dual capable aircraft),"" the report says. The UPI news website reported in November that Lockheed Martin won a $83.1 million award from the Air Force to develop and test equipment for F-35A nuclear capability. Greco does not contend that the bombers heading to Burlington will be nuclear capable when they arrive. But a fleet of F-35s heading to European allies will be. An arms expert told VTDigger last year that an ""exhaustive review process"" would be conducted before the Department of Defense made an F-35 squadron nuclear capable. ""The ones coming here won’t have the capability now,"" said Greco, ""but most people know the way the military works are pretty certain at some point they will be upgraded to have a nuclear capability, and when they are we won’t know."" Even if the F-35s based in Burlington were nuclear equipped, it doesn’t mean the bombs would be located in Vermont -- there could be a pick-up point elsewhere. And even if the bombs are stored in Vermont, that information is highly classified. ""Whether F-35s will be assigned a nuclear mission is probably something no one will ever know,"" Greco said. Siegel formulated her statement in a way that is confusing at best, but certainly misleading. It leads readers to believe that the bombers coming to Vermont will be equipped to carry nuclear bombs. That is false. However, it’s true that the Department of Defense intends to use F-35s to deliver its nuclear arsenal if needed. And there’s good reason to believe that the bombers in Burlington could someday be given a nuclear mission.

Candace Owens' false statement that the Southern strategy is a myth
","During a congressional hearing on hate crimes, conservative African American commentator Candace Owens said that the Republican Party never had a strategy of capitalizing on racism to lure voters. Owens said that black conservatives face criticism from the left because they ""have the audacity to think for ourselves and become educated about our history, and the myth of things, like the Southern switch and the Southern strategy, which never happened."" The ""Southern strategy"" refers to efforts by the Republican Party to appeal to Southern white voters who were turned off by the Democratic Party advocating for civil rights. Historians disputed her statement, including Cornell professor Lawrence Glickman and University of Arkansas professor Angie Maxwell. Princeton historian Kevin Kruse called Owens’ statements ""utter nonsense."" Owens is a spokesperson for the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA and encourages black people to leave the Democratic Party (calling it ""Blexit""). Owens did not respond to our emailed request for comment. On Twitter, she said she was referring to the ""myth"" that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress switched parties. Kruse challenged her explanation, saying, ""Owens, predictably, points to the small number of congressmen who switched parties as ‘proof’ that the larger literature on the racial realignment is a myth — even though that isn't actually something historians and political scientists emphasize in the work on this."" The Republicans’ Southern strategy has been documented for decades — including by Republicans who were a part of it. For this fact-check, we interviewed historians and reviewed news articles from the civil rights era. Joseph Alsop, an influential syndicated newspaper columnist, called it ""basically a segregationist strategy"" in a 1962 column. When Republican Barry Goldwater ran for president in 1964, his Southern surrogates played up the fact that he had just voted against the Civil Rights Act. That paid off in the Deep South where he won a handful of states, but he ultimately lost to Lyndon B. Johnson. By 1968, the Republicans fine-tuned their approach and packaged it in a way they could win, said Maxwell, the Arkansas professor and an expert on southern politics. Republican nominee Richard Nixon reached out to white Southerners by opposing school busing and promising that his administration would not ""ram anything down your throats"" and would appoint ""strict constructionist"" Supreme Court justices. The strongest evidence of the Southern strategy comes directly from Republicans at the time. That includes Clarence Townes, who served as director of the Minorities Division of the Republican National Committee in the 1960s. Harvard professor Leah Wright Rigueur wrote about Townes in her book ""The Loneliness of the Black Republican."" When Nixon disbanded the division, Townes told reporters in 1970, ""There’s a total fear of what’s called the Southern strategy. Blacks understand that their wellbeing is being sacrificed to political gain. There has to be some moral leadership from the president on the race question, and there just hasn’t been any."" In 1969, Nixon White House aide Lamar Alexander, who now represents Tennessee in the U.S. Senate, wrote about the Southern strategy in a memo following the unsuccessful Supreme Court nomination of Clement Haynsworth, who was opposed by civil rights groups. ""SOUTHERN STRATEGY — we flat out invited the kind of political battle that ultimately erupted when we named a Democrat-turned-Republican conservative from South Carolina. This confirmed the Southern strategy just at a time when it was being nationally debated,"" Alexander wrote. Nixon strategist Kevin Phillips openly discussed the Southern strategy in a newspaper article in 1973: ""If the New Washington liberal crowd could tear themselves away from Watergate ecstasy and the lionizing of Daniel Ellsberg for a little look-see below the Mason-Dixon line, they might glean a useful political insight, namely that the GOP 'Southern Strategy' seems to be rolling along — and rolling up local victories — just as if G. Gordon Liddy had never existed."" (Ellsberg released the Pentagon papers in 1971 while Liddy was an FBI agent convicted of illegal wiretapping.) Phillips told the New York Times in 1970 that the Republicans were never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the ""Negro vote and they don't need any more than that."" ""The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans,"" he wrote. ""That's where the votes are. Without that prodding from the blacks, the whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local Democrats."" Ultimately, winning over white Southern voters required using coded language, as campaign consultant Lee Atwater, who worked on Reagan’s 1980 campaign, explained in an interview 1981. In audio, he can be heard describing how in 1954, a racial slur could be used to describe black Americans, but that ""backfired"" by 1968 — requiring a pivot to use more abstract language. ""So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites,"" he said. Reagan used language such as ""states’ rights"" and ""welfare queens,"" which critics said was coded racist language. ""The partisan shift in the South from the 1960s to George W. Bush is the greatest partisan shift in all of American history,"" Maxwell said. In 2005, Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman told the NAACP national convention in Milwaukee that using race as a wedge issue was ""wrong."" ""By the ‘70s and into the ‘80s and ‘90s, the Democratic Party solidified its gains in the African American community, and we Republicans did not effectively reach out. Some Republicans gave up on winning the African American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization. I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong."" Owens said the Southern strategy is a ""myth"" that ""never happened."" Efforts by the Republican Party starting in the 1960s to win over white Southern voters have been documented by scholars for decades. The strongest evidence that it happened comes from the Republicans who were part of that strategy. There are numerous instances of them talking about the approach in documents or interviews.

Did South Bend unemployment fall by half under Mayor Pete Buttigieg?
","Unlike the various senators, House members and governors running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Pete Buttigieg doesn’t have a high-level policy record. But he does have a record for the more than seven years he’s spent as mayor of South Bend, Ind., a city of just under 102,000 people that is best known as the home of the University of Notre Dame. During an interview on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" host Chuck Todd challenged Buttigieg on some of the city’s more worrisome economic statistics. The mayor drew on one of his own to show improvement on his watch. Todd: ""I'm going to put up a couple of numbers here having to do with South Bend. The poverty rate is still over 25 percent. The eviction rate is 6.7 percent, which is fairly high. Not the highest in Indiana, but on the high end of Indiana. Obviously, you've been re-elected. So voters believe you've put the city in the right direction in that sense. But these are still tough numbers. What haven't you been able to accomplish that you wish you would?"" Buttigieg: ""... We're a city that was devastated by the loss of industry, especially when the auto factories left in the 1960s. When I took office, there were articles about whether South Bend was a dying city. Our poverty rate is too high, but it's down. We cut unemployment by more than half. And we've been able to change the trajectory of the city to where we're growing in population and in investment at a pace we haven't seen in a generation."" In this fact-check, we’ll scrutinize Buttigieg’s claim that, as mayor, he cut unemployment in South Bend by ""more than half."" We’ll also dig into his economic development record in his two terms as mayor. When Buttigieg took office in January 2012, the unemployment rate in South Bend and neighboring Mishawaka — the closest region for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the unemployment rate — was 9.6 percent. Today, it’s 3.8 percent. That’s a drop of more than half. It’s also a slightly steeper fall for South Bend than for the United States as a whole. In January 2012, South Bend-Mishawaka had an unemployment rate 1.3 points above the national average. By February 2019, the rate in South Bend was exactly the same as the national rate. So as far as the numbers go, Buttigieg is on target. But no single executive — whether president, governor, or mayor — controls the economy. Economic gains (or losses) are subject to broader trends, from demographic changes to the performance of the international economy to advances in technology. And for mayors, this caution is even more important to note, because it’s hard to filter out the various effects at the national, state and local level. Consider this graph of the unemployment rate since January 2012 in the United States (in light blue), Indiana (dark blue), and South Bend (red). It’s clear that the unemployment rate for the nation, the state, and the city have dropped almost in lockstep over the past seven-plus years. ""There is no doubt that he worked hard on economic development, but it is hard to give him exclusive credit for the overall turnaround given the fact that there were somewhat similar results statewide,"" said Robert L. Dion, the chair of law, politics and society at the University of Evansville. When we reached out to Indiana political observers, most agreed that Buttigieg has had a successful tenure — and that he did spearhead policies that improved the city’s economic position. Buttigieg played a significant role in several specific economic-development projects, observers said. ""One is the former Chase Tower downtown,"" said Andrew Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics at Purdue University Fort Wayne. ""It was nearly vacant when he took office and now it is a Marriott-brand hotel. The other is the revitalization of the old Studebaker automobile plant. There is quite a bit of work to do there, but there is positive movement after decades of inaction."" In addition, Buttigieg was involved with a project by the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians to open a casino in South Bend in 2018, bringing what was touted as 1,200 jobs. Jeff Rea, the president and CEO of the South Bend Regional Chamber and the former Republican mayor of Mishawaka, said he’s had a ""positive"" impression of Buttigieg’s impact on economic development. ""City investments near Four Winds Field, home of Chicago Cubs’ Class A affiliate, and through the downtown area have helped spur almost $200 million of new private investment,"" Rea said. ""Under his leadership, a growing logistics and distribution cluster is growing on the city’s northwest side. We still have a long way to go, but business leaders feel like we’re on the right track."" Dion added that Buttigieg ""worked with the state government of Indiana through their Regional Cities Initiative to direct economic development funding to South Bend."" (Dion said Buttigieg would have to share credit for the state-linked efforts with then-Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican who now serves as vice president.) Buttigieg's campaign cited many of the same mayoral initiatives that independent observers mentioned. ""Major economic development projects in cities always need private investment and organizations to make them happen, but these days they don’t seem to happen without the support of the city government,"" Downs said. Buttigieg also devoted attention to the urban landscape in ways that made the city more attractive to companies and individuals looking to relocate, observers said. For instance, Buttigieg led efforts to install a light display along the St. Joseph River. ""This might seem trivial, but the city has changed traffic flow of some downtown streets — changing one-way streets to two-way streets, on the theory that two-way streets are more conducive to street level retail and food service business success,"" Downs said. Observers also suggest that Buttigieg offered an intangible factor that could help close deals and raise the city’s profile: his own personality. Buttigieg ""has been a visible and vocal supporter of South Bend,"" Downs said. ""His personality and attention to celebrating what South Bend is, and could be, should not be underestimated."" David E. Campbell, the chair of the political science department at the University of Notre Dame, compared it to what Alexander Hamilton called ""energy in the executive."" ""Mayor Pete has been a doer, initiating a variety of projects to catalyze South Bend's recent renaissance,"" Campbell said. ""Reasonable people can disagree on the relative impact of any single initiative, but there can be no doubt that he has brought a revived sense of pride in South Bend, and a feeling that this is a city on the move."" Buttigieg said ""we cut unemployment by more than half"" in South Bend. On the numbers, he’s right, and observers of South Bend’s fortunes say Buttigieg did things, both tangible and intangible, to improve the city’s economic outlook. That said, it’s worth noting that the decline in unemployment closely tracked declines in Indiana and the United States, suggesting that what he accomplished on unemployment was not unique.

No, Health and Human Services didn’t say it failed to monitor vaccine safety
","The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has a website devoted to vaccinations — vaccines.gov. ""HPV vaccination prevents cancer!"" reads one post recommending the vaccine for boys and girls at ages 11 or 12. Another discusses recent measles outbreaks in the United States. On March 6, a Health and Human Services administrator joined other federal officials to write a New York Times opinion piece advocating for vaccinations, saying they save lives and protect public health. But a recent Facebook post suggest the federal agency has failed to ensure vaccinations are safe. ""Health and Human Services admits they have never conducted federally-required monitoring of vaccine safety for over 30 years,"" the April 4 post says. ""No science exists! Your child is their vaxx-test dummy!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The short version of the story is this: The federal agency in charge of vaccinations failed to turn over certain reports in response to a group's request for documents. The Facebook post goes too far, however, to say that the agency admitted they ""have never conducted federally-required monitoring of vaccine safety"" for decades. That is not true, experts told us.  A spokesman for Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to PolitiFact’s email about the Facebook post.   On the agency’s ""vaccine safety"" page, on vaccines.gov, it notes that ""because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people — including children — to prevent serious diseases, they’re held to very high safe standards."" That includes testing and evaluating vaccines before the Food and Drug Administration licenses them and monitoring vaccines’ safety after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended them.   Every batch of vaccines is tested for quality and safety, according to HHS, and FDA reviews the test results and inspects the factories where the vaccines were made. After a vaccine is licensed and recommended for use, the website says, FDA, CDC and other federal agencies monitor its safety. CDC and the FDA manage the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, which tracks unusual or unexpected patterns that could mean there’s a vaccine safety issue. The Post-licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring System is the FDA’s national system for monitoring vaccine safety. Tony Yang, a professor and health services and policy researcher at George Washington University, told us the Facebook post’s claim is ""absurd."" ""FDA and CDC (both under HHS) closely monitor vaccine safety after the public begins the vaccine,"" he told PolitiFact in an email. ""They monitor the safety of vaccines by: performing high-quality vaccine safety research; making determinations about whether vaccines caused reactions in certain cases and helping to learn about preventable risk factors; identifying vaccine adverse events through public health surveillance."" Daniel Salmon, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director at the university’s Institute for Vaccine Safety, told PolitiFact, ""HHS does lots of vaccine safety monitoring."" He pointed us to a December 2008 document from HHS called ""Comprehensive review of federal vaccine safety programs and public health activities."" The summary begins: The evaluation of safety for vaccines is conducted through a network of diverse, yet integrated activities that cuts across federal agency responsibilities and includes the private sector and academic investigators. … The development, licensure and widespread use of a vaccine involves activities and programs from a broad range of groups, including State health departments, academia, industry, healthcare providers, professional organizations, third party payers, managed care organizations, philanthropic and service organizations, and agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. After a vaccine is licensed, the document says, the FDA may obtain agreements from the manufacturers to conduct studies about a vaccine’s risks, benefits and optimal use. They’re usually epidemiological studies involving tens of thousands of people, according to the document. Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, a law professor at University of California, Hastings, researches legal issues related to vaccines. When we asked her about the Facebook post, she said, ""it is not true that HHS has not conducted safety monitoring in 30 years."" The claim, Reiss said, stems from a public information request filed by the Informed Consent Action Network seeking administrative reports that HHS had filed with Congress. Though the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires HHS to file such reports, HHS said they couldn’t find any in a search. In a July 2018 post on its website, the Informed Consent Action Network says, ""HHS has not acted in its duties regarding vaccine safety, forcing 78 million American children into a vaccine program with no safety provisions."" However, Reiss said, while HHS said they couldn’t find the reports the Informed Consent Action Network requested, ""that is not to say they have not monitored safety. They have."" She directed us to two blog posts she wrote about the case. In the first, she notes that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires HHS to report to two congressional committees on its vaccine-related activities. On June 27, 2018, the agency responded to the request by saying that its search for records ""did not locate any records responsive to your request."" Reiss then details the ""abundant research"" on HHS and vaccine safety, including Institute of Medicine reports that the agency commissions. ""In July 2014, a large report on vaccine safety commissioned by HHS was also completed."" She concludes by saying that though HHS ""has done and continued to do abundant work related to vaccines safety, the agency should have submitted the required reports."" Our ruling The Facebook post claims that Health and Human Services ""admits they have never conducted federally-required monitoring of vaccine safety for over 30 years."" While the agency was unable to locate records responsive to the Informed Consent Action Network’s public information request, we couldn’t find evidence that the agency admitted it had failed to monitor vaccine safety for more than 30 years. Rather, HHS details on its website how it and other agencies monitor vaccines. Other reports, such as the 2008 review of federal vaccine safety programs that Salmon pointed us to, are available online.

No, the number of projected U.S. Muslim voters in 20 years is still not enough to elect a president
","The Muslim population in the United States is growing, but a recently shared social media post overstates how fast. The Facebook post says in 20 years there will be enough Muslim voters in the United States to elect the president. The full post reads: ""In twenty years there will be enough Muslim voters in the U.S. to elect the President. I think everyone in the U.S. should be required to read this, but with the ACLU, there is no way this will be widely publicized, unless each of us sends it on! This is your chance to make a difference."" The claim, which was posted on March 14 and has since accumulated over 100,000 shares, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Setting aside the ridiculousness of the presumption that an entire population of people who share a religion would all vote uniformly, we examined the proposition in terms of sheer numbers. In 2010, we checked a similar claim that surfaced in a chain email. At the time, Muslim population numbers in the United States were not nearly high enough to elect a president. They still aren’t. We reached out to Douglas Massey, director of Princeton University's Office of Population Research, about the post. ""That claim is completely untenable,"" Massey wrote to PolitiFact in an email. ""Muslims are less than 1 percent of the U.S. population and only around 10 percent of all immigrants. They are projected to reach 2.1 percent by 2050, much smaller than the 26 percent who are projected to profess no religion and the 66 percent who will still be Christian."" Massey is referring to a January 2018 Pew Research Center report that estimated there were about 3.45 million U.S. Muslims of all ages in 2017, and that the religious group made up about 1.1 percent of the country’s total population. (As of July 2018, the total U.S. population is a little more than 327.2 million). But that figure represents all ages, including children and teenagers under the age of 18 who cannot vote. The report found that the figure drops to 2.15 million when only looking at adults. Now, that figure is indeed going to grow, and while the social media posts gives it another 20 years before Muslims could ""elect a president,"" there still wouldn’t be enough voters to accomplish that even by then, according to the projections. The population is rising rapidly, though. By 2040, the Pew study reported that Muslims will replace Jews as the nation’s second-largest religious group after Christians. By 2050, the report says, the U.S. Muslim population is expected to essentially double from today’s figures to 8.1 million, or 2.1 percent of the nation’s total population. The Muslim vote would certainly influence national debate. But, even if that entire 2.1 percent of the U.S. population voted for president (and this would be a long-shot because this figure would include those of non-voting age), it would not be enough to decide a winner in a presidential election. In 2016, NPR conducted a study to find out the lowest possible percent of voters a candidate would need to reach the White House under the Electoral College system. With two candidates in the race, the media organization found that it is possible for a candidate to win the presidency with only around 23 percent of the popular vote. That low number is nearly 10 times greater than 2050’s projected U.S. Muslim population. According to a 2015 Pew Research study on the future of world religions, the projected Christian population in the U.S. in 2050 is 261,960,000 – more than 30 times greater than the projected 8,090,000 Muslim population. In the same report it was also estimated that by 2050, the projected number of Americans who identify with no religion at all will be around 100,860,000. A social media post make the claim that in 20 years ""there will be enough Muslim voters in the U.S. to elect the president."" It is absurd to assume that an entire population of people who share a religion would all vote uniformly, but we examined the math behind the viral claim. According to the most recent data collected concerning the religious group, the population numbers are far below the amount needed to determine a nationwide election result. Even in 30 years, a decade longer than the post asserts, the entire projected U.S. Muslim population would be millions below the lowest number of votes needed to elect a president.

Missouri ranks toward the bottom of higher education funding
","Higher education funding is always a top subject in the Missouri state legislature, with some universities holding annual legislative days at the Capitol in hopes of boosting support for their institutions. On Feb. 14, Missouri State University’s President Clif Smart said, ""Missouri ranks 45th in the nation in per capita state fiscal support for higher education and @MissouriState is last among Missouri schools. This must change."" We wanted to find out if those numbers were true. Smart’s chief of staff Ryan DeBoef directed us to data from the Missouri Budget Project’s annual report. The Missouri Budget Project describes itself as an organization that ""provides independent, objective research and analysis of state budget and tax issues."" The Missouri Budget Project derives its information from Grapevine. Since 1961, Grapevine, now housed through Illinois State University, publishes data on state tax support for higher education every year. All organizations we reached out to use the Grapevine data. According to the Grapevine data, Missouri ranked 45th in state funding for higher education per capita in 2018, 2017 and 2016. This verified Smart’s first claim that Missouri ranks 45th in the nation in per capita state fiscal support out of all the higher education facilities. Things have actually gotten worse since the numbers Smart cited. Missouri ranked No. 46 for the 2019 data. ""President Smart’s statement on MSU funding appropriations does look at per student funding, and his statement is accurate,"" said Kim Dancy, assistant director of policy research for the Institute for Higher Education Policy. IHEP is a nonpartisan policy and research center that, ""serves as a resource for government agencies higher education organizations, philanthropic foundations, and others committed to increasing access and success in postsecondary education."" However, Dancy suggested analyzing higher education funding through full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment. ""This gives a more nuanced view of how state higher education appropriations are being used to serve current students and promote their success,"" she said. The latest data available looking at higher education funding through FTE is from 2017, and the data from the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association shows Missouri ranks 38 out of 50 in state appropriations per FTE. ""While Missouri is certainly not the worst in per student funding, it has been consistently dropping in this measure over the past three years,"" Dancy said. In the last part of his tweet, Smart said Missouri State is last among Missouri schools. Does Missouri State University rank last in per capita state fiscal support for higher education? When asked where Smart got his numbers from, DeBoef pointed us to the Missouri Department of Higher Education’s yearly higher education factbook, which was published in February 2019, but did not include numbers from fiscal year 2019. In the factbook, Missouri State University has the lowest state appropriations level per FTE among public four-year universities in the state. This means Missouri State University receives the least amount of funding out of all public universities in the state, with $4,225 per student. In comparison, the public university with the most state funding is Lincoln University with $9,764 per student. The largest university system in the state, the University of Missouri System, gets $7,373 per student. ""By allowing Missouri State’s funding to fall hundreds of dollars per student behind other universities, the state has inadvertently created a system where institutions are penalized for enrollment growth and rewarded for enrollment decline,"" DeBoef said. ""While per student appropriations often fluctuate year-by-year,"" Dancy said, Missouri State University ranked among the lowest in the state over the past 10 years. Missouri State University has a plan to combat the low numbers. ""We are working with legislators throughout the state to advocate for an equity adjustment in Missouri State’s operating appropriation to address this issue,"" DeBoef said. ""We have seen some success in the early stages of the state’s budgeting process."" However, he said the process is nowhere near completion and the university is not sure what the outcome will be. ""But we remain hopeful that the funding gap between Missouri State and the next lowest-funded university will be eliminated in the coming fiscal year,"" DeBoef said. Missouri State University’s President Clif Smart said, ""Missouri ranks 45th in the nation in per capita state fiscal support for higher education and @MissouriState is last among Missouri schools.""

Steineke hits, misses on claim Evers won't meet
","The relationship between Gov. Tony Evers and Republican legislative leaders has been icy at best since Evers took office in January 2019.

""Just recently, we’ve made overtures to meet on a regular basis so we can continue to communicate, and (Evers has) refused to even meet with us,"" Steineke said March 31, 2019 on WISN-TV’s UpFront program. ""So it’s extremely frustrating when he’s saying one thing about working in a bipartisan manner, but the actions just haven’t been there. … He’s not talking to us at all.""

I've already met with more than 100 legislators from both parties and have additional meetings scheduled this month. I look forward to working together to pass The People's Budget! #WI4Us pic.twitter.com/oeaZceskY9 Steineke responded that his point was about meeting with GOP leadership over the budget, a ""wholly different"" level of communication from an initial get-to-know-you meeting. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos added: ""(Gov. Scott Walker) made a point of meeting with legislative leaders on a regular basis. We extended a similar offer to (Evers), but it seems he's only interested in talking every few months."" Clearly, Evers and GOP legislative leaders are figuring out the new ""normal"" of a divided state government after eight years of Republican control. With Walker in office, Republican leaders had a standing Wednesday meeting with the governor, which hasn’t happened under Evers. But communication in Madison isn’t limited to elected officials. A lot of work gets done in meetings between staffers, or legislators meeting with gubernatorial appointees. That was common under Walker as well. At a March 5, 2019 news conference Evers had this to say about meetings with lawmakers: ""We’ll meet with (Republican leaders) as often as we need to. I’m not sure we need to schedule Tuesday morning at 10 o’clock every week, but the bottom line is we need to have good conversations and we need to involve staff members in those conversations, so we truly have a good dialogue going."" In a March 31, 2019 tweet that came after the Steineke interview aired, Patrick Marley of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted that the previous week Evers said he hadn’t been talking to legislative leaders directly, but his top aides were in contact with them. Alesha Emmert, communications director for Steineke, said the lawmaker’s claim on UpFront was referring to substantive meetings with Republican leaders. ""Our office is aware Governor Evers has been introducing himself to legislators since he took office – we tweeted a photo from our own meeting,"" Emmert wrote. ""But to be clear, these interactions have been very brief. In Rep. Steineke’s 15-minute meeting, some niceties were exchanged, and the only substantial conversation was a request made by my boss to have more regular, structured meetings."" As evidence, she noted Evers’ opposition to weekly meetings at the March 5 news conference, the Marley tweet and several letters to Evers in which Republican leaders referenced wanting to work together with the governor. Emmert did not provide an example of any specific invitation that Evers declined. Vos communications director Kit Beyer said the speaker has had one sit-down with Evers aside from the initial meet-and-greet. Like Emmert, she noted that Republican leaders have asked for a regular meeting, but Evers has not shown an interest in that. Meanwhile, Evers’ staff says attempts on their end to set up meetings have found little traction. Melissa Baldauff, Evers’ spokeswoman said an aide had reached out to staffers for Vos, R-Rochester, and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, the week before Steineke’s comment. The aide was seeking a meeting with them and Evers but did not immediately get a response. She shared an April 1, 2019, email the aide sent that reiterates the request for the three leaders to meet. Baldauff also provided emails that referenced Evers’ staffers attempting to set up a meeting between Fitzgerald, Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, and Evers’ chief of staff to talk about gubernatorial appointments. Another email referenced attempts to arrange a meeting between policy directors for Evers and Vos, as an outgrowth of an earlier meeting between Evers and Vos. We’ll note that all this back and forth — also detailed in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story on April 9, 2019 — did eventually lead to a meeting plan. Vos, Fitzgerald and Evers scheduled a sit-down for April 10, 2019. Amid ongoing tension between Wisconsin’s Democratic governor and Republican Legislature, Steineke said GOP leaders have ""made overtures to meet on a regular basis"" but Evers has ""refused to even meet with us."" Evers has, as Steineke notes, shown little interest in regular sit-downs like his Republican predecessor. But Steineke is off base claiming there was a refusal to meet. His staff offered no evidence of a specific meeting being refused. And in fact, the opposite appears true. Evers’ staff reached out to facilitate a meeting between Evers and Republican leaders in the days before Steineke’s TV appearance, and they received no immediate response. That makes Steineke’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2019/apr/10/jim-steineke/steineke-hits-misses-claim-evers-wont-meet/

McAuliffe does full flop on late-term abortion bill

","On the brink of deciding whether he’ll seek the Democratic presidential nomination, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe is being accused of flip-flopping on a bill that would have eased Virginia’s restrictions on late-term abortions. The criticism was leveled last week by Victoria Cobb, an anti-abortion activist who is president of The Family Foundation in Virginia; John Fredericks, a conservative radio talk show host; and several conservative websites. Virginia allows third-trimester abortions in hospitals if three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy would ""likely"" kill the woman or ""substantially and irremediably"" impair her mental or physical health. Legislation - introduced in January by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax - would have lowered the threshold from three physicians to one. That doctor would only have to certify that the pregnancy would damage a woman’s health. The ""substantial and irremediable"" threshold would have been repealed. The bill was killed this winter by Republicans ruling the House Courts of Justice Committee, a year after McAuliffe’s governorship ended. But it’s tremors have rocked Virginia politics. Tran, under tough questioning by Republicans during a Jan. 29 hearing, acknowledged that her bill would allow an abortion when a mother is dilating. During a year when all 140 General Assembly are on the ballot and partisan control is up for grabs, Republicans are planning to use the bill and Tran’s statement to argue Democrats support abortions almost up to birth. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s clumsy defense of Tran during a January 30 radio show deepened the controversy. Northam, a physician, discussed what happens when a fetus is incapable of surviving outside a womb. He said the baby is delivered, made comfortable, revived at the mother’s request, ""and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother."" Northam’s comments spurred Republican charges that he was backing infanticide, an accusation the governor denounced. They reportedly spurred an outraged person to leak a picture from Northam’s page in his 1984 medical school yearbook showing one person in a painted black face and another in Ku Klux Klan garb. Northam worsened matters during a February 2 news conference when he denied that he was either person in the photo, said he didn’t know how the photo got on his yearbook page, offered that he had gone black face once in medical school to appear as Michael Jackson, and seemed ready to demonstrate his Jackson-like ""Moonwalk"" before his wife dissuaded him. After the news conference, many of Northam’s fellow Democrats - including McAuliffe - called for the governor’s resignation. McAuliffe statement No. 1 The next day, February 3, McAuliffe made a national TV appeal for Northam’s resignation on CNN’s ""State of the Union.""  Host Jake Tapper played Northam’s radio interview defending the late-term abortion bill. ""Do you support this new legislation? And what was your reaction to the governor's comments there? "" he asked McAuliffe. ""Absolutely not,"" McAuliffe said. ""And I think Ralph (Northam) misspoke on that. No Democrat I know is for infanticide, none, none. I just don't know of anyone who is for it."" McAuliffe statement No. 2 McAuliffe had a different response during an April 1 interview on The John Fredericks Show, broadcast from Portsmouth. McAuliffe spent much of his time talking about his record and his deliberations about running for president. At one point, Fredericks turned to the late-term abortion bill and asked, ""If you were governor, would you have vetoed that bill if it hit your desk?"" McAuliffe took three minutes to answer. He said the purpose of the bill was to save pregnant women facing life-threatening circumstances in rural areas where it’s hard to find one doctor - let alone three - to approve a third-trimester abortion. The former governor accurately noted that only two third-term abortions have been reported to the state’s Department of Health since 2000. And he said efforts to ""demonize"" women undermine the state’s recruitment of businesses. Four times, Fredericks prodded McAuliffe to get to the point. ""Governor, would you have vetoed the bill? Yes or no?"" he finally asked. ""I would not have vetoed the bill,"" McAuliffe replied. ""And listen, I have not read the whole bill, John, but from what I read in the newspaper, if the one thing in the bill was to go from three to one (doctors) to help with rural communities…I would support that. Sure I would."" He added, ""A woman’s life or death may be on the line and, you know, one doctor is as good as three. Why do you need three if you’ve got a qualified doctor?"" We asked Crystal Carson, McAuliffe’s spokesperson, whether the former governor’s position on the bill had changed. Her response was unclear. ""The only people talking about ""infanticide"" are anti-choice, anti-women Republicans,"" she wrote in an email. ""Of course Governor McAuliffe is against ""infanticide"" - any reasonable person would be. (The bill) has nothing to do with that - but instead reduces invasive, medically-unnecessary requirements put on women across the Commonwealth and enables them to make their own health care decisions in consultation with their doctors. For that reason the Governor would not have vetoed the bill."" We should note that McAuliffe ran for governor in 2013 pledging to be ""a brick wall"" against efforts to diminish abortion rights. During his term, new members McAuliffe appointed to Virginia’s Board of Health repealed stringent building standards that had forced some abortion clinics to close. He also vetoed a bill that would have eliminated state funding to Planned Parenthood, a major abortion provider. Our ruling On February 3, McAuliffe said he would have ""absolutely not"" supported a bill that would have eased Virginia’s requirements for a third-third trimester abortion. In contrast, On April 1, he said he ""would not have vetoed"" the late-term bill if he had been governor this year. He said a provision that would have lowered from three to one the number of doctors required to approve a third-semester abortion could save rural women whose lives are jeopardized by pregnancies. ""I would support that. Sure I would,"" he said. One bill, two polar positions. That’s a Full Flop.  ",/factchecks/2019/apr/09/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-does-full-flop-late-term-abortion-bill/
