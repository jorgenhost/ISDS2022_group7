NRSC attacks Michael Bennet for casting 'the deciding vote' for stimulus, health care
","
If you're seeking to tie your opponent to two controversial bills, what better way to do it than to say he cast the deciding vote to pass them? That's exactly what the National Republican Senatorial Committee is doing in the Colorado Senate race between incumbent Democrat Michael Bennet and GOP nominee Ken Buck.

On Oct. 6, 2010, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm ran an ad attacking Bennet's role in helping pass two Democratic-sponsored bills, the economic stimulus and the health care overhaul.

""One vote makes a difference,"" the narrator says. ""Michael Bennet cast the deciding vote for Obama's stimulus that wasted billions, added to the debt and didn't create the jobs they promised. Bennet cast the deciding vote to allow passage of the trillion-dollar health care bill that slashed Medicare, hurting seniors. Bennet's vote was the key to billions in job-killing taxes, too. Michael Bennet: He's been their vote, not Colorado's.""

We won't tackle the ad's description of the substance of the two bills. (We've addressed some of those points in the past.) Instead, we'll look at whether it's fair to call Bennet the deciding vote on those bills.

First, some background on how the bills passed. Both measures had long and roundabout legislative paths to President Barack Obama's desk, but we'll stick to the two votes the ad specifically references on screen.

The stimulus vote cited in the ad was taken Feb. 13, 2009. It was to approve the conference report of the bill -- that is, the version that both chambers must pass with identical language. Once both chambers pass identical versions, the bill goes to the president to be signed. For the stimulus, the final vote was 60-38, with exactly the number of votes needed to meet the three-fifths supermajority required of most major actions in the Senate.

Meanwhile, the health care vote mentioned in the ad was taken Dec. 23, 2009. The vote was to invoke cloture -- that is, to cut off debate so that consideration of the bill could proceed. Invoking cloture requires 60 votes, and in this case the Democrats once again got exactly the 60 votes required.

The idea that the Democrats couldn't spare even a single vote is the crux of the NRSC's argument.

""Absolutely Michael Bennet was the deciding vote,"" NRSC spokesman Brian Walsh told PolitiFact. ""Had he not done so, they wouldn’t have passed the health care bill, regardless of whether he was first, middle or last to cast his vote. End of story.""

But is it? What about the argument that Bennet was merely one of 60 deciding votes. Couldn't the same charge be leveled at every member of the Senate who voted as Bennet did?

We ran the issue by a variety of congressional scholars, and most agreed that it was a stretch for the NRSC to label Bennet's vote ""the deciding vote.""

""That statement is misleading and a distortion of fact,"" said James Thurber, a political scientist at American University.

Several experts we spoke to pointed to historical examples in which lawmakers waited until the last moment to help push the bill over the top.

Norman Ornstein, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, pointed to President Bill Clinton's attempt to pass the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- a bill that critics loathe for raising taxes but which supporters praise for eventually producing surpluses in the latter part of the decade. Lacking any Republican support in Congress, the measure faced nail-biter votes in both chambers, with then-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, D-Pa., and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., attracting wide attention for remaining undecided until shortly before the votes and then ultimately voting yes. In Margolies-Mezvinsky's case, her loss the following year was universally blamed on that vote.

Then there was the 1985 vote on President Ronald Reagan's budget by then-Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. Wilson was wheeled onto the Senate floor wearing blue pajamas following surgery for a ruptured appendix. ""That could be called a deciding vote,"" said Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution senior fellow emeritus.

Indeed, there's a long and storied history of senators holding back on supporting a bill until certain demands are met, said Donald Ritchie, the historian of the Senate. This approach ""takes some nerve, because the undecided vote may come under fire from both sides, but the rewards can sometimes be significant,"" Ritchie said.

So, did Bennet's approval of the stimulus and the health care bill follow the same pattern? The short answer is no.

On the stimulus, Bennet spoke favorably of the bill at least as early as Jan. 31, 2009 -- two weeks before he cast the vote cited in the ad -- when the Rocky Mountain News paraphrased him saying he ""likes the overall direction of the legislation."" He was part of a bipartisan group of 20 Senators trying to shrink the size of the stimulus, which suggests that he was sufficiently supportive of the bill that he was willing to work behind closed doors to see it succeed. His approach does not seem like that of a reluctant holdout.

On health care, Bennet actually took to the Senate floor to forcefully criticize deals struck by party leaders on behalf of holdout Democratic Senators, hoping to persuade them to vote for the health care bill. 
""Columnists opposed to reform have criticized me for saying that I am willing to lose my seat to enact meaningful health care reform,"" he said on Dec. 21, 2010, two days before the vote. ""Now, I am being asked why I didn't negotiate a special deal with leadership. In fact, there was a report this morning criticizing me because the National Republican Senatorial Committee was rejoicing that I did not ask for special favors. Only in Washington would someone be attacked for not negotiating a backroom deal. Just because others choose to engage in the same tired Washington rituals, doesn't mean that I have to."" 
Bennet continued, ""So I have a message for the columnists, the political professionals, and those back home. I am not happy about the backroom deals. I am not happy that the public option was held hostage by people in our own party. I do not support rewarding delay with special deals. I will let others justify their vote and their tactics."" 
Indeed, as the health care debate came to a climax in the Senate, a stronger case can be made that any of several other senators deserve the title of the ""deciding vote."" In a Dec. 24, 2009, account tracing the health bill's Senate endgame, Noam N. Levey and Janet Hook of the Los Angeles Times cited Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., as a late holdout, due to his opposition to a proposal for a ""Medicare buy-in."" That policy would have allowed certain non-senior citizens to voluntarily join the federal health care plan for the elderly.

According to the article, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., ""knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward. Without the Medicare buy-in, Lieberman would be the 59th vote."" At the meeting, Reid turned to Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., ""who had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska's Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal.""

Suddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to convince Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade.

""Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience,"" the Los Angeles Times article reported. ""And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. 'I don't think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,' said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md.""

And there was at least one more potential deciding vote -- the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. It wasn't a question of whether Byrd would support the bill but rather a question of whether he'd be physically able to reach the chamber to vote.

Byrd had spent six weeks in the hospital earlier in 2009 with a staph infection. On the day of the vote, Byrd ""was pushed onto the Senate floor in his plaid wheelchair,"" bundled in a coat, scarf and hat, according to an account in the New York Times.

Lieberman, Nelson, Feingold, Byrd -- any of them could easily have been described as the deciding vote on the health care bill. So could any of the other 56 senators voting in favor. The NRSC ad ""is true, but not very informative, since there were 60 deciding votes,"" concludes David W. Rohde, a Duke University political scientist.

The NRSC ad would have been quite justified in describing Bennet's vote for either bill as ""crucial"" or ""necessary"" to passage of either bill, or even as ""a deciding vote."" But we can't find any rationale for singling Bennet out as ""the deciding vote"" in either case. He made his support for the stimulus bill known early on and was not a holdout on either bill. To ignore that and the fact that other senators played a key role in completing the needed vote total for the health care bill, leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression from message conveyed by the ad. As a result, we rate the statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/26/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-attacks-michael-bennet-casting-deciding-vote-/

Michael Steele says Obama's claims hypocritical: that his presidential campaign was asked to disclose donors and refused
","
For weeks, Democratic leaders have been complaining about the tens of millions of dollars being poured into attack ads against the party's candidates. The ads have been funded by independent groups  -- like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS -- that have no legal requirement (or inclination) to disclose their donors. President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi say those groups have allowed anonymous special interest groups, perhaps even foreign corporations, undo influence on this election, threatening our very democracy.

Asked about it on NBC's Meet the Press on Oct. 23, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele called the Democrats' charge hypocritical.

""When President, then candidate, Obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign, they refused to do it. So don't give me this high-and-mighty, holier-than-thou attitude about special interests flooding the political marketplace.""

We've fact-checked several Democrats' claims about attack ads aimed at their candidates being financed by secret foreign donors.

Here, we're checking the counter-claim from Steele, that during the 2008 presidential campaign, ""Obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign, they refused to do it.""

Despite the context of the conversation, Steele was not contending that the Obama campaign was asked to disclose donors to independent groups funding attack ads. That's a somewhat new phenomenon this election cycle. Trade groups and other 501 (c) groups were always allowed to keep donors anonymous. But the Supreme Court's Citizen United case upped the stakes with a ruling that allows corporations to contribute unlimited amounts to independent efforts to support or oppose a candidate.

What Steele was talking about is different.

We contacted the RNC for details about Steele's claim and were pointed toward an Associated Press investigation that found the Obama campaign had not properly safeguarded against illegal foreign donations in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election. Candidates can, of course, accept foreign donations from American citizens living overseas, and they are supposed to return any money donated by foreign nationals. But the AP investigation found ""clear evidence that the campaigns of both Obama and John McCain took money first and asked questions later. Shining a light on a weakness in the nation's campaign finance laws, the review turned up a smattering of illegal foreign donations to Obama as well as missing details in federal paperwork the law requires from Obama and McCain.""

The issue was particularly striking, the story noted, as Obama was getting two-thirds of his contributions via the Internet. Online donors were asked to check a box certifying they were U.S. citizens. Although the Federal Elections Commission instructs campaigns to seek a donor's current U.S. passport when accepting money from an overseas address, many donors contacted by the AP said they were not asked to produce one before making their donation.

In one case highlighted in the story, the Obama campaign accepted a $500 donation from a Canadian man who wrote ""I am not an American citizen!"" on his contribution.

The Federal Elections Commission requires that ""treasurers of political committees exercise best efforts to obtain, maintain and report the complete identification of each contributor whose contributions aggregate more than $200 per calendar year.""

The Obama campaign maintained it was complying with the law and that it met the ""best efforts"" standard with extensive ""back-end review"" of donations. That means the campaign accepted money and later checked to make sure the donations were proper. And campaign officials say that when they discovered illegal contributions from foreign nationals, the money was returned.

The RNC raised another issue to underpin Steele's accusation. It cited an Oct. 29, 2008, story in the Washington Post that called out the Obama campaign for ""allowing donors to use largely untraceable prepaid credit cards that could potentially be used to evade limits on how much an individual is legally allowed to give or to mask a contributor's identity.""

According to the story, revelations about questionable donations from individuals using fake names ""prompted conservative bloggers to further test Obama's finance vetting by giving money using the kind of prepaid cards that can be bought at a drugstore and cannot be traced to a donor.""

The story did not quantify how much the Obama campaign received in prepaid credit cards.

The Washington Post claim, though, wasn't that the Obama campaign refused to disclose the donors. It's that the campaign, by accepting donations via prepaid credit cards, made it impossible to verify whether the person was an American citizen or had exceeded donation limits.

""You don't know,"" said Doug Heye, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""The rhetoric from the Obama campaign (about campaign finance disclosure) never matched the reality.""

In October 2008, the RNC asked the Federal Election Commission to look into every donation, large and small, made to the Obama campaign.

According to the complaint, ""The RNC believes that"" the Obama campaign ""has (1) accepted prohibited foreign national contributions and (2) knowingly done so through its failure to reasonably investigate questionable contributions originating abroad.""

Heye said the FEC has not yet responded to the complaint.

Brad Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said ""the Obama campaign required donors to check a box confirming that they were U.S. citizens or green-card holders and refunded any contribution that came from any foreign national or other prohibited source."" Woodhouse said the charge by Steele was ""a lie – and is just smokescreen by the RNC to distract from the secret money being spent by its allies like the Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove.""

Contributions from foreign nationals and people using fake names inevitably slip into campaigns accepting donations from hundreds of thousands of people, said Dave Levinthal of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. It's incumbent on campaigns to make a good faith effort to identify those bad donations and return them.

Levinthal said he didn't remember the issue of illegal contributions being a ""a huge, overriding issue"" in the 2008 presidential campaign.

In fact, an analysis of campaign contributions by the Center for Responsive Politics found that the Obama campaign scored slightly higher than McCain's when it came to full disclosure of donors. The center found the Obama campaign fully disclosed 90 percent of the donations to the campaign, as opposed to 87 percent for the McCain campaign. The report found no information about the donor's employer and/or occupation listed for 6 percent of the Obama campaign's contributions, as opposed to 9 percent for McCain.

We think Steele's comment is misleading in the context of responding to Democrats' complaints about tens of millions of dollars anonymously making their way into this election via independent groups like Crosssroads GPS. Steele's comments aren't directly related to that issue.

The RNC says Steele was referring to the fact that the Obama campaign accepted donations from prepaid credit cards, which makes it almost impossible to verify the donor. It may be a legitimate campaign finance issue, but it's not the same as saying that the Obama campaign was asked during the 2008 presidential campaign to reveal its donors and refused (as Steele alleged). The campaign readily provided the names of large donors as required by law. And there's no evidence that contributions from prepaid credit cards were anywhere near the huge sums being spent by independent groups in this election.

As for accepting money from foreign nationals, that's an issue all campaigns deal with (though more so for Obama, who got a lot of money from Americans overseas). Again, it's not that the Obama campaign was asked for names of foreign donors and refused. The campaign had names, and in most cases assurances from the donors, that they were American citizens. The allegation in the Washington Post story was that the campaign's vetting of foreign donations was not stringent enough up front. There was no issue of the Obama campaign willfully refusing to disclose the names of foreign donors. In fact, it was the disclosure of those names that allowed AP reporters to discover some of the donations were improper.

Scott Walker says Tom Barrett voted to allow abortions through the ninth month of pregnancy
","
Republican Scott Walker, hit with an emotional TV ad portraying him as an extremist on abortion, has responded with a spot that paints Democratic rival Tom Barrett with the opposite side of the same brush.

The Barrett ad featured two parents whose daughter was raped, noting that in opposing abortion Walker does not support exceptions for cases of rape, incest or where the life of the mother is at risk. The ad inserted a hot-button social issue into the governor’s race.

In the response ad, Walker’s wife, Tonette, hits a similar personal note.

""As a mother, I can't imagine learning that my child was assaulted,"" she says. ""But for Tom Barrett to lie about my husband's compassion for victims is just wrong. Scott's been standing up for victims of violence for years.""

A narrator finishes the job:

""It's really Tom Barrett who's extreme. Barrett supports taxpayer funding for abortion.
And in Congress Tom Barrett voted to allow abortions through the ninth month, just moments before the baby is born. That's extreme.""

Strong words in response to a strong ad.

Let’s get behind them.

The ad cites no specific vote to back up the claim that Barrett backed a measure that allowed the late abortions, but Walker’s campaign said it referred to Barrett’s 1995 vote, while in Congress, against the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.

In the highly contested abortion issue, the partial birth abortion debate and the topic of late-term abortions are among the thorniest. Activists on either side agree on little -- not what to call the
procedure involved in partial-birth abortions, now even how many abortions, if any, occur as late as the ninth month.

Before entering this debate, some key background:

In the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed abortion on demand up until the time of fetal ""viability"" -- sometime in the second trimester -- or later if the doctor determined it medically necessary to protect the life or health of the mother.

The partial-birth abortion ban  -- which passed in 2003, after Barrett had left Congress -- outlawed a controversial abortion method sometimes known as ""intact dilation and extraction."" It was used in most cases in the second trimester when the fetus had grown too big to be removed by the suction method commonly used in the first trimester.

Public opinion was solidly against the procedure -- Gallup reported in 2003 that a majority of Americans supported the ban, with 68 percent saying it should be illegal. That pattern held back to 1995, according to Gallup. Congress banned it except when necessary to save the life of the mother.

That ban was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007.

Now, to the language in the Walker ad, which says Barrett voted to ""allow abortions through the ninth month, just moments before the baby is born.""

It should be noted, the ban in question was not pegged to when an abortion occurs during a pregnancy. It focused on a specific procedure, but left in place other abortion methods.

The two sides disagree about the extent of abortions in the ""ninth month,"" though it’s clear from government statistics that it is uncommon.

In 2006 in Wisconsin, the last year before the ban took effect, 2 percent of abortions (197 of them) occurred after 20 weeks. That is the latest benchmark used. It is not known how many occur at various points after that. Nationally that year, 1.3 percent of abortions were after 20 weeks.

But both sides agree on this: It is the Roe vs. Wade decision -- not the partial-birth ban -- that ""allowed"" abortions late in a pregnancy, albeit under limited circumstances.

Barrett is solidly in favor of abortion rights and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood, but he clearly was not among the justices participating in the Roe vs. Wade decision.

He has, however, been on both sides of the partial birth issue.

He voted against the ban in 1995, but then changed his position and voted to override President Clinton’s veto. That override effort fell short. In 1997 and 2000, he voted in favor of a ban before flipping again by opposing it in 2002.

The Walker campaign cites Barrett’s 1995 vote, but could have just as easily picked 2002. We will consider that last vote his position.

So, was it a vote to ""allow abortions through the ninth month, just moments before the baby is born""?

Let’s review.

Under Roe vs. Wade, late-term abortions were already allowed and the ban Barrett opposed does not stop them. The ban focused on a particular abortion method and was not tied to the gestation period of the fetus. Walker’s ad -- which makes no reference to the partial-birth issue -- makes it sound as if Barrett was voting in favor of Roe vs. Wade.

Partial-birth abortions, even by the account of abortion opponents, were mostly limited to second trimester and earlier -- not commonly done in the ""moments before the baby is born."" While the two sides cannot agree on how common ninth-month abortions were then -- or now -- there is an element of truth to the statement: Barrett twice took a position that arguably blocked a narrowing of abortions, some of which could occur late.

Tom Barrett says Scott Walker wants to ban abortion, even in cases of rape or incest
","
In a gubernatorial campaign largely centered on jobs and the job performance of the candidates, Democrat Tom Barrett has injected abortion into the debate, using a stark TV ad to take aim at his opponent, Republican Scott Walker.

A couple identified as Lana and Mike appear on the screen. Mike says their teenage daughter was brutally raped. ""You can’t imagine what she went through,"" he says. ""That’s why politicians like Scott Walker make me so mad.""

The screen goes black. Then as Mike continues, the words he says also appear on the screen:

""Scott Walker wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother.""

Mike concludes: ""Who is Scott Walker to play God with our family?"" and -- repeating a common theme from Barrett and the Democratic side -- says he feels Walker is ""too extreme for Wisconsin.""

As voters weigh their choices in the Nov. 2, 2010, election, there is no dispute that Barrett  is pro-choice and Walker is pro-life. But Barrett’s claim, which may be new to many viewers of the ad, is that Walker wants to outlaw abortion under any circumstances.

It is worth noting that many voters who consider themselves pro-life support make an exception for abortion being available in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. A May 2009 Gallup poll, however, found that 23 percent of Americans -- up from 17 percent a year earlier -- said abortion should be illegal under all circumstances.

For his part, Walker has said repeatedly he opposes abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. He declares himself ""100 percent pro-life."" And to Pro-Life Wisconsin, an organization that opposes abortion without exception, Walker pledged to seek a complete abortion ban.

We asked Jill Bader, Walker’s campaign spokeswoman, about Barrett’s ad and she said it accurately states Walker’s position. 
(We would note that as a member of the state Assembly, Walker backed an effort to bar government employees from performing abortions and a bill outlawing ""partial-birth abortion""; both measures included an exception for when the life of the mother is at stake.)

This is one item we can assess quickly.

In the race for governor, Democrat Tom Barrett said his opponent, Republican Scott Walker, ""wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother.""

Donna Campbell: Rep. Lloyd Doggett voted for health care, cap-and-trade, and stimulus legislation

In an ad posted online Oct. 19, the narrator compares Doggett and Campbell, an ""emergency room doctor."" ""They disagree on ObamaCare: Doggett voted yes, Dr. Campbell says repeal. Stimulus spending: Doggett voted yes, Dr. Campbell says it's a waste of money. Cap and trade: Doggett voted yes, Campbell says job killer."" We're not weighing in on whether the stimulus was a waste of money, or if cap and trade is a job killer. But since earlier this month we rated True Doggett's statement that he voted against ""big bank bailouts,"" we were curious whether Campbell accurately recapped his votes on other high-dollar issues. Amanda Tyler, Doggett's campaign manager, told us by e-mail that Doggett voted for each piece of legislation, though the campaign has reservations about the visuals in Campbell's ad; for example, she said, a shot of a foreclosure sign doesn't make sense in connection with his vote for stimulus aid. Let's review Doggett's votes one at a time. Health care On Nov. 7, 2009, the U.S. House voted on its version of health care legislation in a 220-215 vote. Doggett joined 218 Democrats and one Republican, Rep. Anh Cao of Louisiana, in passing the legislation. On March 21, 2010 , Doggett voted for legislation reconciling Senate and House versions of the proposal. The compromise passed 220-211, with no Republicans in support. Doggett said in a floor speech ""with this reform, every insured American gets valuable consumer protections, and every uninsured American can become insured."" We later rated that statement as True. Stimulus On Jan. 28, 2009, the House passed the $819 billion economic recovery bill 244-188 without a single Republican vote. Doggett voted ""aye."" ""One way this bill promotes economic recovery is by promoting educational opportunity,"" he said on the House floor the day before. ""$13.5 billion of targeted tax relief to help young people and not-so young people attend college. Today, one out of five graduating high school students does not qualify for this assistance. But because we provided a refundable tax credit, we help them, just as the appropriations section of this bill helps with expanded Pell Grants and other direct aid."" We asked Campbell's campaign why it showed an image of foreclosure sign while describing Doggett's vote for the stimulus legislation. Mike Asmus, Campbell's campaign manager, told us ""the stimulus spending Lloyd Doggett has voted for has prolonged the narrative of economic malaise, running from joblessness to foreclosure and beyond."" Cap and trade Doggett voted for a cap-and-trade measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. With Doggett's vote, that proposal cleared the House 219-212 on June 26, 2009, though Doggett also aired objections about the measure being too soft, saying the plan stripped too much oversight from the Environmental Protection Agency and encouraged new coal-fired plants. ""I struggled deeply about whether to support this flawed bill, but I finally determined that voting for it was my best hope for making it better,"" he said on the floor that day. ""I've been listening to the debate — not so much to those who support a bill that I'm not all that enthusiastic about, but listening to the Flat Earth Society and the climate-change deniers, and some of the most inane arguments I have heard against refusing to act on this vital national security challenge."" Tyler also told us that Doggett hoped to improve the bill by being tapped to serve as a House member of a possible House-Senate conference committee on the plan.

"['Georgia', 'Ethics', 'Mark Butler']","
Candidates spar over ethics claims
","
With double-digit unemployment and the economy as uncertain as the outcome of this weekend's matchup between the Georgia Bulldogs and the Florida Gators, the two leading candidates for state labor commissioner are spending a good bit of time talking about ethics.

At issue: Who is more unethical?

Case in point, the Oct. 17 Atlanta Press Club debate.

The fireworks began with Democrat Darryl Hicks grilling Republican Mark Butler, a state representative, about whether he attempted to ""strong-arm"" a state university to rehire a lobbyist whom he dated.

""I never threatened nor strong-armed anybody to hire anybody back,"" Butler said.

Butler countered by asking Hicks about some information the representative spotted on the State Ethics Commission's website.

""I'd like for you to tell the people of Georgia about your seven ethics violations and your seven ethics fines, most of which you have not paid, dating all the way back to 2006,"" Butler said, referring to Hicks' failed 2006 bid for secretary of state.

""Now, Mark,"" Hicks said. ""C'mon, folks can look that up and see that is not true.""

""Look it up,"" Butler could be heard saying in the background.

We wanted to look into Butler's claim about Hicks, since it seemed more concrete than whether Butler inappropriately tried to help a lobbyist. You've either had ethics fines or not.

Butler led us to the website's late/nonfiler's reports. Hicks' name was there. Hicks was late in turning in his campaign contribution disclosure report, according to the site. The disclosure reports outline who gives a candidate money and how each candidate spent the funds.

""It's right there,"" Butler said.

Hicks, the former chief of staff to the chairman of the Fulton County Commission, lost the Aug. 8, 2006, Democratic Party runoff for secretary of state to Gail Buckner. He was late in filing disclosure reports from that campaign that were due on Sept. 30, 2006, and Oct. 25, 2006. We checked the Ethics Commission's website and Butler's name didn't appear. Butler's campaign disclosure reports show he filed them by the deadline.

Hicks told us he didn't realize he had to file disclosure reports with the state for the Sept. 30, 2006, and Oct. 25, 2006, due dates since he had lost. State records show some fines were paid in 2009, when Hicks said he received invoices from the state that he had not paid the late fees. Hicks paid $150 in fines last week to clear up other late disclosure reports.

Candidates are typically required to send disclosure reports to the state five times during the year of their campaign. The standard dates are March 31, June 30, Sept. 30, Oct. 25 and Dec. 31. Candidates have a grace period of five business days to deliver the reports to the state. Candidates who miss the deadline are required to pay ""an additional filing fee"" of $25, according to page 24 of the state Ethics in Government Act. The candidate must also pay a $50 ""filing fee"" if he or she is more than 15 days late, according to the state act.

The penalties and language are much tougher on lobbyists found guilty of improper actions. The ethics act says they can be hit with a $2,000 penalty for each ""violation.""

Ethics was a major topic during this year's legislative session as lawmakers passed a bill that broadens the authority of the Ethics Commission, tightens reporting requirements for lobbyists and legislators, increases the fines for violations, makes it a crime to use a state agency to attack someone and prohibits sexual harassment. State lawmakers were influenced by embarrassing headlines that surrounded the resignation of former House Speaker Glenn Richardson, who resigned last year after his ex-wife accused him of having an affair with a female lobbyist. Some lawmakers wanted the legislation, Senate Bill 17, to go further by restricting gifts from lobbyists.

We spoke with Hicks campaign spokeswoman Phyllis Fraley, who sent us a letter from her candidate to the commission. Hicks wrote that there were ""clerical errors in the amount assessed"" on the state's website and he thought the matter had been resolved. State Ethics Commission executive secretary Stacey Kalberman told us that all the fines have been paid.

Fraley accused Butler of blowing the matter out of proportion.

""It's interesting that while Mark is busy being dishonest by attacking Darryl's ethics over the most minor clerical error, Mark has managed to further expose his own serious moral and ethical lapses while he held office,"" she said.

Butler believes the issue is important. He told us he wouldn't have brought up the matter if Hicks had been late once or twice, but seven times is disturbing. Butler also said Hicks should have known he missed those deadlines in 2006.

""He's a habitual violator,"" Butler said.

Butler accused Hicks of misleading those who watched the Atlanta Press Club debate by saying it wasn't true he had ethics violations.

""He called me a liar over that fact,"" Butler said.

We discussed this with Common Cause Georgia executive director Bill Bozarth, one of the state's leading government ethics watchdogs. Bozarth said when he thinks of ethics violations, he considers something like a candidate who uses a contribution for inappropriate purposes or accepts a donation from a questionable source. Bozarth said he has seen some cases in which candidates who lost their race missed the deadline to hand in their disclosure reports, although the state's ethics laws do not give them a pass for being late because they lost.

So does this constitute an ethics violation?

""Technically, it is a violation, but in my opinion, not as serious as those flouting the law and using the [campaign] funds for inappropriate purposes,"" Bozarth told us.

We posed the same question to Kalberman, without mentioning the dispute between the two candidates about this issue.

""Technically, any time you don't file on time, it's an ethics violation,"" Kalberman said. ""I would not consider it a serious violation of the ethics code.""

Butler is technically correct that Hicks violated the ethics act. But his statement leaves out important details and context that could give voters a different impression. The ethics act is much tougher on other acts of improper conduct. We believe Butler's statement could give viewers the impression that Hicks committed ethical lapses along the lines of what was included in SB 17. Also, most of the fines were paid before last week. We rate Butler's claim against Hicks as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/26/mark-butler/candidates-spar-over-ethics-claims/

Concerned Taxpayers claim Peter DeFazio votes with Nancy Pelosi
","

Concerned Taxpayers of America is the lofty and nicely generic name of an independent expenditure group funded by two very rich people on the East Coast. The group has spent at least $300,000 for several TV ads attacking U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio and backing Republican challenger Art Robinson.

The latest commercial is as cute as the cartoon kids on South Park. There’s DeFazio behind the wheel of his 1963 Dodge Dart as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in the passenger seat, exhorts him, ""Turn left! Turn left!"" and ""Spend more! Tax more! Faster!"" Again, very catchy -- and geared to generate maximum outrage in a congressional district that disdains Washington, D.C.  

But we were curious about the ad’s claims. Has DeFazio voted with Pelosi 86 percent of the time? Does he take directions, besides driving, from the speaker from San Francisco? PolitiFact Oregon always thought DeFazio, the state’s longest serving sitting congressman, really wasn’t big on party politics or groupthink.

Democrats in other states have been hit with the same attack as Republicans try to capitalize on Pelosi’s unpopularity in swing districts. The attacks usually cite as evidence The Washington Post votes database or, as in this case, something called the National Republican Trust PAC. Go there and you’ll find ""The Pelosi Index,"" which rates House members on how closely they hew to the speaker. There’s the Statue of Liberty at one end and Pelosi on the other, and anything above 75 percent is ""tyranny.""

DeFazio’s counsel asked KEZI-TV, the ABC affiliate in Eugene, to stop airing the ads, arguing that the website doesn’t compare all votes between DeFazio and Pelosi. The letter read, in part:
  
""Instead, it fabricates a percentage based on only 14 votes that it cherry-picked, out of hundreds cast by Rep. DeFazio. And it ignores the fact that, of those 14 selectively chosen votes, Speaker Pelosi did not even cast a vote on 3 of them."" 

(The station briefly stopped airing the ad to conduct a review, but has since resumed.)

Pelosi, as speaker, doesn’t vote much. She’s cast 94 votes in the 111th Congress, which opened January 2009. But regular member DeFazio does, and we thought it useful to check how he’s rated by the The Washington Post database.

Here’s what we found: DeFazio has cast 1,508 votes this session, voting with the majority of his party 96.6 percent of the time. The average for Democrats is 92.2 percent, so DeFazio is higher than the average, although lower than the other Oregon House Democrats. Earl Blumenauer and David Wu are at 97 percent, and Kurt Schrader is at 97.1 percent.

So the number is high, but remember, these tally all votes cast, even the mundane ones. And The Post database shows the percentage a lawmaker ""agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members,"" not just Pelosi.

Since PolitiFact Oregon has nothing but time, we ran our own comparison between DeFazio and Pelosi. We eliminated 24 of Pelosi’s 94 votes because they were roll calls or resolutions that both parties agreed on. That left 70 substantive votes, of which DeFazio disagreed on six. Percentage-wise, that’s 91 percent.

So on both counts, DeFazio rates higher than the 86 percent figure cited in the commercial.
But we needed to flesh out the disagreements -- because they are blowout disagreements -- and this gets to the larger question of whether DeFazio is indeed someone who’s just following Pelosi’s lead.

DeFazio voted against a signature cap and trade climate bill pushed by Pelosi last year, saying it had too much carrot and not enough stick.

And he was one of only seven House Democrats to vote against President Barack Obama’s $787 billion economic stimulus package in February 2009. Passage of the stimulus was one of the Democrats’ signature initiatives.

DeFazio did vote for Obama’s health care plan, but only after finagling better Medicare reimbursement rates for Oregon.

Defying party leadership, he opposed the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street in 2008 and voted against it in a follow-up bill in 2009. Most recently, he and a dozen House Democrats joined Republicans in voting against a business-lending act that he deemed too expensive for taxpayers without lending enough help to small businesses.

In short, not a very good Pelosi lapdog.

Finally, we checked National Journal’s annual rankings from 2009, just for fun. DeFazio had a 61.5 percent liberal voting record and a 38.5 percent conservative voting record. Again, he was the least liberal of Oregon’s four House Democrats.

To summarize, DeFazio has diverged sharply from Democratic leadership on key issues, especially economic ones. To imply that Pelosi is really in the driver’s seat when it comes to DeFazio’s votes is false. But it’s true that agrees with his party most of the time. We rate this Half True.

GOP challenger Jim Renacci joins the chorus on job losses but mangles the refrain
","
Once more, with spirit: Ohio has lost a whole lot of jobs.

It’s the chorus line of 2010, and if the Capital Steps were in Ohio they would sing it as an encore.

Imagine our surprise, then, when we heard a sonorous new version last week from congressional candidate and businessman Jim Renacci. The Wadsworth Republican, running against Democratic incumbent John Boccieri, said in opening remarks of a debate in Canton:

""Ladies and gentlemen, our country is going in the wrong direction. What we’ve learned is that over the last couple of years, Ohio has lost over 600,000 jobs."" He added that ""Since Mr. Boccieri has become a representative of the 16th District, unemployment has doubled.""

That figure – 600,000 – is roughly double to triple the number that others have cited as they challenge Ohio Democrats holding office. The sums change depending on the month and year, but Renacci’s figure seemed outlandishly high to our numerically attuned ears.

That’s because it is.

Using figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that from January 2009, when Boccieri took office, through August 2010, the most recent month counted when Renacci made his claim, Ohio lost 176,400 jobs. New data that included September came out after the debate, and if counted it would put Ohio’s job losses during the current Congress at 194,300.

It would be impossible for Renacci’s number to be correct no matter how you measured ""the last two years,"" unless BLS data – the gold standard for statisticians -- was off by 300-plus percent.  

Perplexed, we asked Renacci’s spokesman, James Slepian, how his boss got his number. Slepian responded that while Renacci said the state has lost 600,000 jobs over the last couple of years, his number was actually in reference to Ohio’s unemployment rate, not its job losses. Stick with us here, because this is a distinction with a definite difference.

The unemployment rate measures the number and percentage of people at any given time who say they are out of work and are actively looking for a job. It doesn’t matter when they lost their jobs.

That’s different – and typically much higher -- from the number of jobs lost during a specific period, which is measured in a survey of employers.  

If you counted every Ohioan looking for work, regardless of when he or she lost a job, the number would come to 601,145 as of August, which again was the most current number during the debate. It’s now come down a tad, to 590,809, BLS databases show..

That’s a lot of unemployed people, to be sure. But most of them were already out of work when Boccieri became a congressman. In fact, the number in Ohio was already 515,292 when Boccieri took his oath of office.

So while the trend continued while Boccieri has been in office, the magnitude is not the result of the last couple of years, as Renacci said, and in fact has shown a small reversal in recent months.   

This brings us to Renacci’s related point – that since Boccieri ""became a representative"" of the 16th Congressional District, ""unemployment has doubled.""

No, it hasn’t.

This, too, can be measured a number of ways, and we tried a bunch.

We started by looking at the Canton-Massillon metropolitan statistical area since that’s the heart of the district’s population center. The current rate of unemployment there is 10.6 percent.

The number is nothing to cheer. But the rate was 10.2 when Boccieri took office, which is not even close to the doubling that Renacci claimed.

We asked Slepian to explain how his boss arrived at this claim, too. Slepian said that Renacci was not using just the Canton metro area but, rather, the four-county area that makes up his district: Stark, Wayne, Ashland and Medina counties.

With Slepian on the phone, we joined him in going over the numbers as we turned our respective cursors to the BLS databases. He noted accurately that in Stark County, the unemployment rate just before Boccieri’s election, in October 2008, was 6.8 percent. And in January 2010, it reached 13.6 percent, which is exactly double.

Two problems. First, Boccieri was sworn in in January, 2009, and Stark County’s unemployment rate was already 10.0 by then. Second, Renacci seemed to stop flipping through the calendar awfully early to get to his claim. Had he counted every month that Boccieri has been in office, he would have stopped at August 2010, the most recent month for which there is countywide data, rather than stopping in January.

Guess what? The unemployment rate for the most recent month available was 10.5 in Stark County, not 13.6. Things improved, it seems, when Renacci stopped counting.

We did the same kinds of calculations for the district’s three other counties, and the result were similarly at odds with Renecci’s doubling claim. In fact, were he to measure Ashland County alone, he’d have to say that on Boccieri’s watch, the unemployment rate actually went down, from 12.2 at the start to 10.4 in August.

This looked like a classic case of cherry picking the data to support a false claim, and we told Slepian as much. He maintained that statewide, the unemployment rate is higher than it was two years ago, and that no matter how you slice it, ""there are 600,000 people out of work in the state."" And he said that when looking at certain periods in the last two years – a month before Boccieri’s election (but three before his inauguration) and 12 months into his term -- ""we did see it double"" in the district’s biggest county.

""It’s an accurate statement to say that that’s what it went up to since he was elected to office,"" Slepian said.

Yes, it is, but only if you ignore the fact that it has come way down since Renacci stopped turning the calendar pages at exactly the right date to shore up his argument. To include months when an opponent wasn’t in office, and to stop counting when the unemployment numbers make your case, leaves out a massive amount of information and context.

Did we mention that Renacci is a CPA?

If we tried these tricks on our taxes, we could be treated to a heap of IRS trouble (although with a creative accountant, you never know). But the Truth-O-Meter does not assess tax penalties; it merely points its arrow to the only rating possible when a claim is inaccurate and its basis is distorted and contorted: Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2010/oct/26/jim-renacci/gop-challenger-jim-renacci-joins-chorus-job-losses/

Meek claims Taliban have been in Afghanistan for hundreds of thousands of years
","
In Florida's U.S. Senate race, a trio of politicians have traded barbs about each other's records and argued about Social Security, immigration and the economy. The issue of the war in Afghanistan has not been as prominent a campaign topic in this feisty race between Republican and former state House Speaker Marco Rubio, independent Gov. Charlie Crist and Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek.

But in a nationally televised CNN debate at the University of South Florida in Tampa on Oct. 24, 2010, the candidates discussed the war in Afghanistan. CNN's Candy Crowley asked Meek, according to the transcript:

""The basic question is, if the government of Afghanistan comes to some conclusion of this war in a deal with the Taliban, is that acceptable to you given the price in both blood and treasure that the U.S. has put in there?""

Meek's response: ""Unaccepting. Not accepting to -- acceptable to me. I think Pakistan should be also in this discussion when it comes down to monitoring the situation on the ground. The international community must be at the table because there's a lot of foreign affairs dollars that are going into Afghanistan.

""I think the purse strings are going to dictate the deal. I think it's very, very important to understand that the Taliban has been there for years and years, I mean, hundreds of thousands of years. And I don't think that any -- you know, sitting down at a peace table is going to come about.

""We cannot allow the very dangerous individuals that have brought about the true 9/11 to have a place of safety in Afghanistan on the Pakistan side. But I think diplomatic -- diplomacy is important and also predator drones.""

At another point during the debate, Meek said: ""I'm the only candidate that's really talking about military families in this campaign. Folks want to talk about war; they want to talk about Afghanistan; they want to talk about Iraq. I'm the only person that's been there. I'm the only person that understands what these families are going through, who have committed their loved ones to war for the last 10 years, many of them the ages of these young people here in this audience.""

Meek's campaign spokesman Adam Sharon said Meek was referring to himself as the only Florida U.S. Senate candidate who has been to Afghanistan and Iraq.

For this Truth-O-Meter, we wanted to check Meek's statement that the Taliban has been in Afghanistan for ""hundreds of thousands of years.""

It's obvious that ""hundreds of thousands of years"" would take us back to well before the pyramids were built, so common sense tells us right away that Meek misspoke. But we were still curious about how long the Taliban had been around.

We sent Meek's claim to two foreign policy experts: Michael Semple, a fellow at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard Kennedy School, and David Markey, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. We also spoke to Megan Mattson, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State. All three experts pointed us to the 1990s for the birth of the political force we know as the Taliban.

Mattson said the Taliban rose to power in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s after the withdrawal of the Soviet Union forces. (The Soviets had invaded Afghanistan in late 1979 and withdrew 10 years later.) She referred us to background notes about Afghanistan on the state department's website which states:

""The Taliban had risen to power in the mid-1990s in reaction to the anarchy and warlordism that arose after the withdrawal of Soviet forces. Many Taliban had been educated in madrassas in Pakistan and were largely from rural southern Pashtun backgrounds. In 1994, the Taliban developed enough strength to capture the city of Kandahar from a local warlord and proceeded to expand its control throughout Afghanistan, occupying Kabul in September 1996. By the end of 1998, the Taliban occupied about 90% of the country, limiting the opposition largely to a small mostly Tajik corner in the northeast and the Panjshir valley. .... From the mid-1990s the Taliban provided sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi national who had fought with the mujahideen resistance against the Soviets, and provided a base for his and other terrorist organizations.""

Here is what Markey wrote to us in an e-mail:

"" 'Taliban' as a political movement is only decades old, was born out of the Afghan civil war in the 1990s and the breakdown in order that led a group of religious students ('talibs') to take up arms against rapacious, brutal warlords. Their success was assisted -- increasingly over time -- by radical groups and others, including Pakistani intelligence, until they eventually succeeded in taking over most of the country. I should note that 'Taliban,' as representatives of extremist Islam, could only be as old as Islam itself, which is hundreds, not thousands of years. The Pashtuns (ethnic group), from whom the Taliban are primarily drawn, have -- as far as I know -- lived in this region for thousands of years. But all Pashtuns are NOT Taliban, and this is clearly not what the Senate candidate said.""

Semple agreed in his e-mail: ""The Taliban Movement (Tehreek Taliban) was founded in 1994. Any claim that as a movement they have been there longer is simply wrong.""

We asked Meek's spokesman for comment on the statement. Sharon said simply, ""He misspoke.""

Meek clearly made a mid-debate stumble. He could have just stopped after saying that ""the Taliban has been there for years and years"" rather than adding ""I mean, hundreds of thousands of years."" But he made the comment on national TV, portrayed himself as the only one of the three who had been to Afghanistan (he notes his repeated trips to combat zones on his website) and claimed to be the only one talking about military families. So we felt his claim was fair game for a fact check. Meek's campaign does get credit for quickly acknowledging the error, but we rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/oct/25/kendrick-meek/meek-claims-taliban-have-been-afghanistan-hundreds/

Nancy Pelosi says more private sector jobs created in 2010 than in eight years under Bush
","
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. -- who is in danger of losing her leadership position if the Republicans take over the House -- must really like the following talking point, because she's used it at least twice on national television in recent days.

""More private-sector jobs were created in the first eight months of 2010 than in the eight years of the Bush administration,"" she said in an interview on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann on Oct. 21, 2010. The day before, Pelosi said something virtually identical in an interview on PBS' Charlie Rose Show.

We thought we'd check to see if she's correct.

We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that tracks employment numbers.

According to the BLS website, there were 111,634,000 Americans employed in the private sector at the start of George W. Bush's first term, in January 2001. Eight years later, in January 2009, there were 110,961,000 Americans employed in the private sector. So the United States lost 673,000 private-sector jobs on Bush's watch.

That makes it easy for Pelosi: If the United States netted even one private-sector job in 2010, she'd be accurate. And the nation actually did quite a bit better than that. Private-sector employment in January 2010 was 107,123,000, a number that grew to 107,970,000 by Septmeber 2010. That works out to be 847,000 jobs created.

So Pelosi's statement is accurate. But it's also a classic case of cherry-picking -- for two reasons.

First, Pelosi carefully cited private-sector employment, not total employment. There's a valid reason to focus on private-sector jobs rather than government jobs, since private-sector jobs produce income-boosting goods and services to a degree that government jobs do not. Still, choosing private-sector jobs helps Pelosi's case in a crucial way: If she'd chosen total employment instead, her formulation would have been wrong.

Total employment -- that is, the combination of private- and public-sector jobs -- during Bush's tenure increased by 1.08 million, while total employment in 2010 has increased by 599,000. (Quick aside: Who would have thought that federal and state government jobs would have increased by 1.7 million in eight years under Bush and fallen by 357,000 since President Barack Obama took office?)

Second, Pelosi chose her start and end dates in a way that's highly favorable to Obama and unfavorable to Bush.

If she'd instead chosen to start from the beginning of Obama's term -- rather than half way through his first two years -- she would be stuck with a net loss of nearly 3 million private-sector jobs, not the increase of 847,000 she came up with for 2010. Pelosi essentially started counting from the low point for jobs and only counted the upward part of the trendline.

Meanwhile, the start and end points she used for Bush give the former president no such break. The jobs picture under Bush looked like an arc, heading generally upward through mid 2007 before heading downward again. If she had used only the upward portion of the arc, as she did for Obama, it would have showed a gain of 3.9 million private-sector jobs.

You could argue that it's unfair to pin the blame on Obama for job losses early in his tenure. Still, Pelosi drew the lines for her comparison as artfully as state legislatures have been known to draw lines defining congressional districts, and, similarly, Pelosi's choices are not just highly selective but also beneficial to her side.

To be fair, Pelosi's staff points out that they have not shied from showing the full arc of the jobs numbers since Obama took office, attaching a fact sheet showing both the decline and rise in jobs since Obama's inauguration. But her televised comments don't reflect that. To fully understand the jobs comparison Pelosi makes, you need to understand how she sliced and diced the numbers. It's a good example of a statement that is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. -- the Truth-O-Meter's definition of Half True. So we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/25/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-more-private-sector-jobs-created/

Tom Perriello says Robert Hurt's support for ""Taxpayer Protection Pledge"" means he supports loopholes that send American jobs overseas
","
Tom Perriello wants to know what Robert Hurt is hiding with his stance on tax loopholes, but the murkiness comes more from a cookie-cutter Democratic ad campaign than the Republican candidate’s position.

In a political ad, ""What is Robert Hurt Hiding?"",  Perriello, a Democratic congressman from Charlottesville, claimed that Hurt, his  Republican challenger  from Chatham, ""supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas.""

The basis of the claim is the Taxpayer Protection Pledge that Hurt signed in December after a much-publicized meeting with Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a well-known anti-tax group in Washington. Hurt is one of seven challengers in Virginia congressional races -- six Republicans and one independent -- to take the pledge, which the anti-tax group enforces strictly.

The pledge for House candidates has two parts: They promise to oppose any increase in marginal income tax rates for citizens or businesses, and they vow to oppose the elimination of tax deductions or credits unless they are offset ""dollar for dollar"" by tax cuts or new credits.

Simple enough. But it has given Democrats an opening to make a dubious connection to tax credits they portray as loopholes for shipping American jobs offshore.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has translated the second part of the pledge to mean that signers support tax loopholes for multinational companies operating in other countries. The DCCC backs up the claim not with the pledge the candidates actually signed, but with three specific bills opposed by Americans for Tax Reform that the group urged pledge signers to oppose. One of them was the $26.1 billion bill adopted in August to help states hire teachers and pay for Medicaid services. The money for those programs would come from closing the loopholes. Hurt opposed that bill, citing the increase in federal spending.

Democrats say the money from closing the loopholes was well-spent. ""Our point is if you’re going to spend the money, it should be on creating jobs here,"" Jesse F. Ferguson, the DCCC’s southern region press secretary, told us.

But the fact that someone signed the pledge doesn’t necessarily mean they are opposed to closing loopholes for off-shore companies.

Our friends at FactCheck.org have been knocking down this claim since April, when the DCCC ran a TV ad against a Republican House candidate in Hawaii. They recently debunked the same claim in an ad in the Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign.

Here’s the problem: The taxpayer pledge doesn’t prevent a signer from opposing any tax break as long as he or she finds a way to offset the resulting increase in taxes.

""The pledge doesn’t get into whether something is good or bad tax policy,"" Ryan Ellis, ATR’s director of tax policy, told us. The pledge means that if a bill would result in a net tax increase, ""you’re not free to vote for it,"" Ellis said.

Hurt hasn’t offered specifics about his position on the offshore tax rules, but in a TV ad last month, he called Perriello’s claim false.

We agree. Perriello has chosen to rest his claim on the DCCC’s spurious connection to the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, but that is a huge leap of logic and it doesn’t prove Hurt supports the offshore loopholes. So we find the claim False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/25/tom-perriello/perriello-hurt-taxpayer-pledge-loophole-overseas/
"['Message Machine 2010', 'Voting Record', 'Virginia', 'Scott Rigell']","
Scott Rigell says Glenn Nye voted ""in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi"" 83 percent of the time.
","
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has become a popular villain for Republican candidates who have been trying to link her to their Democratic opponents.

Case in point: a recent TV ad titled ""Her Congressman"" from Scott Rigell, the Republican candidate for Congress in Virginia’s 2nd District, criticizing the voting record of Rep. Glenn Nye, the Democratic incumbent.

""Nye voted in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi, even on the wasteful stimulus bill,"" the ad says. ""Nye votes with Pelosi 83 percent of the time. Glenn Nye is her congressman, not ours.""    

The National Republican Congressional Committee makes a similar claim in a TV ad, taking aim at Nye for supporting the economic stimulus package and other Democratic legislation. It says, ""Glenn Nye voted with Pelosi 82 percent of the time.""  

PolitiFact has checked similar claims in other states and found they often exaggerated the correlation with Pelosi, so we decided to take a closer look.

Asked for the source for the claim, both Rigell’s campaign and the NRCC cited a Washington Post voting database.

We took a look at the database and quickly discovered the campaigns had blurred the details: Nye has voted with his party 82.5 percent of the time since he took office in 2009. But his rate of voting with Pelosi is actually significantly lower -- just 66 percent.

The Washington Post says its database shows ""the percentage of votes on which a lawmaker agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members"" -- not the correlation with a particular party leader.

The average party loyalty is 90.6 percent for all House members and 92.2 percent for the 263 Democratic members. But contrary to the implication of the ad, Nye is actually ninth from the bottom for party loyalty among Democrats and Republicans. That indicates he has one of the most independent records.

Comparing the voting records of a member of Congress and a House speaker can be misleading because the speaker rarely votes. The Washington Post voting database shows Pelosi has voted 94 times since the start of 2009, while Nye has cast 1,551 votes.

""That is just a tradition for speakers -- they often don't vote,"" Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly told PolitiFact. ""She votes on some bills, not all.""

Of the 91 times when they both voted on matters other than the routine roll call, Nye cast differing votes 31 times. That means they voted together 66 percent of the time.

And it’s important to note that Nye and Pelosi differed on health care reform, the signature issue for the Democrats. Nye voted against it, and has touted that vote in his campaign.    

And before voting with fellow Democrats to pass the economic stimulus bill in February 2009, Nye voted twice with Republicans to delay action on the plan, saying he wanted more time and more tax cuts.

So let’s take stock of the facts.

Rigell’s ad says Nye ""voted in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi."" But the facts don’t support such a strong claim.

It is incorrect for Rigell to say Nye voted with Pelosi 82 percent of the time. That is the percentage for his votes with his party. The actual number with Pelosi is significantly lower --  66 percent. And both measurements show he is one of the more independent Democrats. Only eight House members have lower party loyalty percentages.

It’s become a popular Republican tactic to link Democrats with Pelosi, but in this case, the voting records don’t justify the charge. And while Nye has voted with his party 82 percent of the time -- a clear majority of the time -- that’s a long way from being ""in lock step.""

So we find Rigell’s claim to be Barely True.

""Differently"" is a Hurt political ad that plays the China card against U.S. Rep. Tom Perriello, a Democrat from Charlottesville, for his vote in favor of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, better known as the stimulus package signed by President Obama in February 2009.

The ad defends Hurt against accusations by Perriello that he wants to ship jobs overseas. ""That’s just false,"" the announcer states. ""But Perriello did vote to give tax breaks to foreign companies creating jobs in China.""

The ad says the accusation is based on a story published Sept. 9 in the Washington Times that says ""as much as 80 percent of some green programs, including $2.3 billion of manufacturing tax credits, went to foreign firms that employed workers primarily in countries including China, South Korea and Spain, rather than in the United States.""

It’s an assertion that originates from a series of stories by the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University in Washington. The workshop report, ""Blown Away,"" documents how foreign-based companies are using stimulus grants to develop wind farms in the United States.

The workshop’s initial estimate in October 2009, was that foreign companies collected 80 percent of $1 billion in grants. An update in February pegged the estimate at 79 percent of $2.1 billion in grants. But those are allforeign companies, not just those from China.

The Chinese connection comes from a $1.5 billion wind farm proposed last year in Texas by a consortium of American and Chinese companies that planned to buy turbines manufactured in China for the wind farm. Subsequently, the consortium partners have proposed to build a factory in Nevada to produce the turbines and most of their components.

Here’s the problem for Hurt and other politicians relying on the Washington Times story:  the $2.3 billion in manufacturing credits come from a part of the stimulus act that explicitly links the credits to creation of manufacturing jobs in green industries in the United States, according to the workshop report.

By contrast, the workshop investigation focused on a provision that allowed payments in lieu of tax credits for development of alternative energy sources, including wind farms, without requiring the projects to produce manufacturing jobs in the United States.

""They’re sort of freely mixing the two programs,"" Russ Choma, the journalist who produced the workshop report, told PolitiFact.

So while the Times story may be correct in asserting that investments in alternative energy technologies haven’t created as many U.S. jobs as some supporters wanted, the story does not provide sufficient evidence to back up Hurt’s claim.

Yet in campaign ads in many states, Republicans have portrayed a vote for the stimulus to be a vote to send jobs to China, glossing over the details of the actual program. They have exaggerated the total money that’s gone to this particular program and ignored the small portion that actually ended up in China.

The same day Hurt’s ad first aired, Choma published an update on the workshop Web site that referred to a similar dustup in a West Virginia congressional race. In it, Choma said the IRW hadn’t found any examples of wind turbines built entirely in China.

Choma cited the conclusion of a PolitiFact National analysis in February that debunked a similar assertion by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Subsequently, PolitiFact reports in Georgia and Wisconsin found little or no truth in similar accusations by Republican congressional candidates.

He also revised his estimates that had originally said 80 percent of the money went to foreign companies. The revised estimate said 54 percent of a total of $4.4 billion in grants for wind farms had gone to foreign-owned companies, and that 65 percent of the turbines installed on those farms were constructed by foreign manufacturers instead of the original estimate of 79 percent.

It is true that many companies taking advantage of the grants for alternative energy sources are based outside of the U.S., but most of them are in Europe and none was owned by a Chinese company.

The American Wind Energy Association, representing the developers involved, said only three of the 33,000 wind turbines operating in the U.S. today were made in China and those included parts made in Minnesota and North Dakota.

The association claims the tax credit provision in the stimulus act ""saved"" 40,000 jobs in the American wind industry by stimulating demand. It does not have an estimate of the jobs that would be created by the manufacturing tax credit cited by the Washington Times.

Choma, the author whose article sparked the allegation, remains perplexed by the avalanche of ads that have relied on his work. ""I don’t see how you can attach China to the manufacturing tax credit,"" Choma told us.

We don’t see the connection either, so we find Hurt’s claim to be False. ",/factchecks/2010/oct/25/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-says-tom-perriello-voted-give-tax-brea/

Democratic leader says ultrasound requirement would apply to some rape victims
","Democrats in the state Legislature protested in June 2013 when majority Republicans introduced and quickly passed a bill requiring women seeking an abortion to get ultrasound scans. Two months later, the gaping divide between the two parties on abortion -- seen in the bitter floor debate over the bill -- remains wide. That was evident when Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha) and the Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) were interviewed together on Wisconsin Eye Aug. 7, 2013. Vos said he was proud the new law means that ""every single mother has the opportunity to see the child"" before making a ""final decision to end the life of that baby."" Democrats who sued to block the law, he added, are ""out there saying it’s more about getting rid of the child than it is about giving information to the mother, and I think that’s sad."" In response, Barca called the new law ""so irresponsible."" ""I think it's maybe the first time we've dictated a medical procedure a woman has to go through, whether she can afford it or wants it or believes it’s necessary. In the case of rape … even if you're raped, if you don't report it in the first 30 days, the Republicans will force you to have to have an ultrasound."" The bill passed on party-line votes, and Gov. Scott Walker signed it into law July 5, 2013. Besides ultrasounds, Act 37 requires doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles. The law’s authors say that means better care if abortions result in urgent medical problems. A judge has temporarily blocked the requirement on doctors, but the ultrasound provision remains in effect. Abortion providers argue the admitting requirement would force closure of two clinics because their doctors don't have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The result, they say, is that abortions in Wisconsin would not be available north of Madison or -- after the 19th week of pregnancy -- anywhere in the state. While the ultrasound provision has drawn much attention, the treatment of sexual assault victims under the bill has drawn relatively little. Is Barca right that women who do not report a rape within 30 days would be required to have an ultrasound? More about the law Under the law, the person performing the ultrasound must describe what is being shown and provide the woman an opportunity to see the ultrasound images. But the woman can't be required to view the images. PolitiFact Wisconsin previously rated False a claim by activist Rachel Campos-Duffy that more than 90 percent of women seeking an abortion decide not to get one after seeing their ultrasound. Research indicates that some women change their mind, but no solid evidence backs her sweeping claim. Barca’s statement was specific to sexual assault victims. The new law explicitly grants an exception -- a ""waiver"" in the bill’s parlance -- from pre-abortion ultrasounds when a pregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest, or in cases of medical emergencies. The bill’s definition of ""sexual assault"" includes rape. It covers assaults of the first, second and third-degree. The reporting requirement drew criticism from some lawmakers and the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault, which said that for victims who don’t report a rape, an ultrasound ""only serves to remind them of the trauma caused by the perpetrator."" Several things have to happen before sexual assault victims qualify for the waiver. -- The woman must state that a report alleging the assault has been made to law enforcement. -- A physician or qualified assistant must confirm the report has been made and make a notation in the woman’s medical file. -- Law enforcement officials must confirm -- confidentially -- that they received the report. So it’s correct to say that rape victims who seek abortions would be required to have an ultrasound unless they report to police. But Barca runs into trouble on part of his statement. He frames his claim around a specific time limit, saying that rape victims don’t just have to make a report to avoid an ultrasound, they have to do so within 30 days. To be sure, that reporting timeframe is the norm in Wisconsin. In 2010, 72 percent of the 4,857 reported sexual assaults were reported within 30 days, state figures show. Still, another 12 percent of those reporting did so after a month but before one year, and another 5 percent did so after a year. No data was available on the rest. But our search of Act 37 and related statutes, plus checks with legislative officials and interest groups, found no evidence of any specific timetable in the law enforcement reporting provision. Rather, victims can report the crime and thereby avoid an ultrasound scan without regard to any time limits. Barca aide Erik Greenfield told us the lawmaker misspoke in mentioning a 30-day time limit. It’s unknown exactly how many rape victims seek abortions but do not report being assaulted. But there is evidence that many sexual assault victims do not report file a report with police, for a variety of reasons. Nationally, a large survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Justice Department, showed that 64 percent of rapes or sexual assaults against females were not reported to the police from 2005 to 2010. The leading reasons for not reporting: feared reprisal (20 percent); considered it a personal matter (13 percent); felt police would not help (13 percent); reported to  different official (8 percent); not important enough to report (8 percent); did not want to get perpetrator in trouble (7 percent). In Wisconsin, evidence suggested that only 19 percent of sexual assaults are reported to law enforcement, the state Office of Justice Assistance, said in 2011. OJA was an independent state agency eliminated in the 2013-’15 state budget. Critics of the bill say these numbers strongly suggest that some abortion-seeking assault victims will be non-reporters and therefore will be forced to get an ultrasound. State Sen.  Mary Lazich, the bill’s sponsor, doesn’t deny the possibility, but said victims could avoid that. ""They need to report sexual assaults,"" Lazich, R-New Berlin, told us. Our rating Barca said that a new law passed by Republicans regulating abortion deals with sexual assault victims this way: ""Even if you're raped, if you don't report it in the first 30 days, the Republicans will force you to have to have an ultrasound."" The law does require an ultrasound when such victims do not report the assault to law enforcers, but there is no 30-day deadline for doing so. Barca’s claim is partially accurate but misses on an important detail that muddles his message. We rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/aug/22/peter-barca/democratic-leader-says-ultrasound-requirement-woul/

Via PUC and Railroad Commission, Smitherman part of seven lawsuits against EPA
","Want to burnish your conservative credentials in Texas? Doesn’t hurt to point out how many times you’ve sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Campaigning for attorney general, Railroad Commission head Barry Smitherman uploaded a video to YouTube on Aug. 5, 2013, in which he said that he’d ""sued Obama’s EPA seven times to protect Texas jobs and energy for our families."" PolitiFact Texas examined a related statement May 10, 2013, from the man holding the job Smitherman wants. State Attorney General Greg Abbott said he’d sued President Barack Obama’s administration 25 times, a claim we rated as True. Now running for governor, Abbott is highlighting his suits against the EPA (he’s up to 19). In many lawsuits, Abbott acts at the request of a department or branch of Texas state government. Spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us for that story, ""We file them on behalf of state agencies. We’re the lawyer, they’re the client."" That client capacity, Smitherman told us by phone, was the role he took in seven lawsuits spanning his time at the state Public Utilities Commission (2004-2011, became chairman in 2007), and Railroad Commission (2011-present, became chairman in 2012). The suits deal with greenhouse gases, cross-state air pollution and specific airborne toxins such as mercury. ""What we have seen with all of these,"" Smitherman said, ""is this EPA initiating rule-making that in my opinion is not backed up by law."" His spokesman, Allen Blakemore, emailed us a list and descriptions of the seven lawsuits that he said Smitherman had, either individually or on behalf of the commissions, referred to the attorney general. What action is involved in such a referral ""depends upon the case,"" Blakemore said. For example, in the two lawsuits that involved Smitherman’s role on the Railroad Commission, he said, ""the commission voted to request representation by"" Abbott. ""A letter was then written to the AG requesting that action be taken against EPA."" Here’s the top of one such letter, signed by Railroad Commission chairwoman Elizabeth Ames Jones and by railroad commissioners Smitherman and David Porter, dated Aug. 23, 2011: 
 We looked up the lawsuits on PACER, a federal service providing public access to records from U.S. district, bankruptcy and appellate courts. All originated after Obama’s first inauguration Jan. 20, 2009. Smitherman is personally named as a plaintiff in three cases in his capacity as head of the PUC. The other four cases list only the agencies’ names as plaintiffs, but going by their filing dates, Smitherman was PUC chairman when two were filed, a member of the Railroad Commission when one was filed and chairman of the Railroad Commission in the most recent case. Five lawsuits involving the PUC, Texas’ regulator of electrical and telecommunication utilities, challenged EPA restrictions on greenhouse gases that Blakemore said ""threatened the ability of electric utilities to receive permits, modifications or build new facilities."" The two suits involving the Railroad Commission, Texas’ regulator of oil and gas, addressed a cross-state air pollution rule and a restriction on airborne mercury and other toxins that, Blakemore said, adversely affected mining for lignite used in electricity generation. (Created in 1891 to oversee, well, railroads, the commission ooched into energy after getting jurisdiction in 1917 over pipelines transporting oil and gas.) We asked University of Texas Law School professor Charles Silver, whose specialties include the procedures and practices used in civil lawsuits, if it’s reasonable to say Smitherman ""sued"" the EPA in these cases. ""Seems fair to me,"" Silver told us via email. ""In ordinary conversations, people don’t make the sort of technical distinctions you identify"" -- such as being specifically named as a plaintiff vs. the commission being named -- ""even though they’re accurate."" Our ruling Smitherman said he ""sued Obama’s EPA seven times."" In the seven EPA lawsuits -- all during the Obama administration -- that his spokesman identified, either Smitherman or the commission he served on at the time is named as a plaintiff.

Bloggers say Obamacare provision will allow 'forced home inspections'
","A startling Obamacare claim swept from blog to blog last week: ""SHOCKING: Obamacare Provision Will Allow ‘Forced’ Home Inspections."" One blogger used a photo of armed officers entering a cottage, with the overline, ""We’re from the government and we’re here to raid your home."" Another said ""this is why the IRS has been training with AR-15s."" A reader sent us a post from BenSwann.com, ""Obamacare provision: ‘Forced’ home inspections."" He wondered if it were true. So did we. South Carolina’s concern ""Forced home inspections""? Um, no. The flurry originated with BenSwann.com blogger Joshua Cook on Aug. 13. He picked up the phrase ""forced home inspections"" from a state lawmaker in South Carolina. Back in March, as a group of state legislators discussed a bill to fight the Affordable Care Act, Rep. Rick Quinn offered a specific example of something in the law that worried him: ""The forced home inspections that I’ve heard about."" Cook was there. And the comment nagged him. He noticed people weren’t really writing about the issue. ""It's just been bothering me,"" he told PolitiFact. So he wrote about it last week, talking with an attorney who spoke at the committee hearing and posting a video clip of Quinn’s comment. ""The point is South Carolina legislators believe it, and are convinced this is going to happen,"" Cook told us. Quinn, indeed, had added an amendment to the South Carolina Freedom of Health Care Protection Act to prevent state workers from conducting any ""involuntary … in-home visitation."" It passed the House, but the Senate didn’t have a chance to vote. Cook says lawmakers hope to revive the legislation in the next session. But that Obamacare program that worries Quinn? It already is — by statute — voluntary. There’s literally nothing to suggest raids or weapons. Home visiting programs Concerned bloggers pointed to an Obamacare-funded grant program for ""maternal, infant and early childhood home visiting."" In 2011, the government announced $224 million in funding. Most of those grants are going to health departments — none, so far, in South Carolina. The idea: fund visits from nurses and social workers to high-risk families to help them develop skills to keep kids healthy, get them ready for school, and prevent child abuse and neglect. Home-visit programs already existed in 40 states. But to Kent Masterson Brown, a health care litigator invited by South Carolina lawmakers to help them avoid implementing Obamacare, the programs suggest overzealous nonprofits telling parents how to raise their children without their consent. Brown raises the specter of a home-schooling family subject to ""intervention"" for school readiness, their children forced into schools and onto medications and vaccines. ""The federal government will now set the standards for raising children and will enforce them by home visits,"" he wrote about the law. But consent is built into the program. A home visitor could no more compel a family to vaccinate kids than a pediatrician could, said Kay Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical School who’s one of the nation’s experts on state home visiting policy. Here’s what the Affordable Care Act says: Home-visiting programs must assure they’ll have procedures that ensure ""the participation of each eligible family in the program is voluntary."" Here’s how that might work, according to Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, who supports such programs. A low-income mom gets her prenatal care at a community health center. Her doctor asks if she would like visits from a nurse after the baby comes to offer tips and answer questions. Mom could say yes — or no. It’s like the old days of health care, Rosenbaum said, when nurses would visit families to show how to breastfeed, sterilize bottles, care for babies and cope when you’re exhausted. ""It's real health education in the home, is the purpose of it,"" she said. Such programs have a long history backed by peer-reviewed research, she said. They work. ""They make sure that you don't go home to nothing. It's done to help families, not to police them."" A classic randomized trial in Elmira, N.Y., showed nurse visits to families of newborns reduced child abuse and neglect, even years later. They also reduced government spending for low-income unmarried women. Brown, the lawyer, says he’s concerned families have no protection from social workers. He’s concerned workers won’t be well-trained and will overstep families’ rights. Nobody should knock on your door without a badge, he said. ""What I see in this is a monster, frankly. And you can quote me on that,"" he said. That’s the fear. The law, however, specifies that programs be voluntary, their staffs trained and supervised, and the home-visiting models they follow based on strong research. Any ""forced home inspection"" wouldn’t be under the law — it would be in direct opposition to it. And if a family welcomed help but later decided it made them uncomfortable? Samantha Miller, a spokeswoman for the U.S. agency administering the program, said families could stop accepting services ""without consequence at any time and for any reason."" Our ruling Bloggers passed around a claim last week that a provision of the new health care law will allow ""forced"" home inspections by government agents. But the program they pointed to provides grants for voluntary help to at-risk families from trained staff like nurses and social workers. What bloggers describe would be an egregious abuse of the law — not what’s allowed by it.

Mike Lee says unions call Obamacare bad for workers
","A small but vocal cadre of congressional Republicans would like to defund Obamacare and would be willing to risk a government shutdown to make that happen. A leading voice in the Senate is Mike Lee of Utah. Lee says the new law is so bad, even key Democratic allies don’t like it. ""By a margin of 2 to 1, Americans say Obamacare will make their family's health care situation worse, not better. Just 12 percent support the individual mandate. Doctors don't want it. Businesses oppose it. Unions say it's bad for workers,"" Lee wrote in an op-ed in USA Today. That last group, the unions, caught our eye. Organized labor is one of the pillars of the Democratic Party and lobbied hard for passage of the Affordable Care Act. We wanted to verify that Lee had his facts right. Unions that oppose the law Lee’s office pointed us to a press release and a letter. The press release from United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers called for ""repeal or complete reform of President Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA)."" The letter came from three of the larger unions in the country: The Teamsters, the United Food and Commercial International Union, and Unite-Here, which represents hotel workers. Those three unions sent a dire warning to the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. ""We can no longer stand silent in the face of elements of the Affordable Care Act that will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our members along with millions of other hardworking Americans. We believe that there are common-sense corrections that can be made within the existing statute that will allow our members to continue to keep their current health plans and benefits just as you and the President pledged. Unless changes are made, however, that promise is hollow. We continue to stand behind real health care reform, but the law as it stands will hurt millions of Americans including the members of our respective unions."" The circumstances that led to this letter are complex, and we will get into them in a moment. But first, let’s look at which unions are opposing the law and which are supporting it. Many unions offer health insurance through unusual plans that allow large and small employers to buy coverage as a group, and some of the unions that are involved in these plans have the biggest objections to the health care law. Randy DeFrehn is executive director of the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, a sort of trade association for these insurance groups. DeFrehn said at least six unions have gone public with their objections to Obamacare. Behind the scenes, he said, the number is larger. ""Altogether, there are a dozen or more out there,"" DeFrehn said. ""They don’t all want to come out against the administration, but they are worried about the unintended consequences of the law."" DeFrehn’s group has 23 member unions. So by his count, roughly half of them are raising red flags about Obamacare. In contrast, some very large members in DeFrehn’s organization actively support the law. That includes the Service Employees International Union, which represents housekeepers, janitors and other lower-paid workers. SEIU recently kicked off a national campaign to promote Obamacare. Even among the unions that warn of the dangers of the new law, for most of them, repeal is not the first choice. The letter to top Democrats called for ""common-sense corrections."" DeFrehn said that goal prevails, although calls for repeal could be the result of ""ultimate frustration."" What the unions don’t like One central problem with the law, in the unions’ view, is the threat it poses to the kind of health insurance their members enjoy today. Just as there are many different insurance companies, there are many different union insurance plans, about 3,000. These plans are often called Taft-Hartley plans after the federal labor law that created them. And here’s the rub: The Affordable Care Act creates insurance exchanges that will present employers with a new alternative to the current union insurance. ""The unions think it will be cheaper for employers to drop out of the Taft-Hartley plans and go on the health exchange,"" said Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University School of Law. ""This puts pressure on the unions who want to keep workers satisfied and make sure they have a reason to belong to the union."" Here’s why the unions think that could happen. DeFrehn says 90 percent of the employers in these plans have fewer than 50 workers. While larger employers will face penalties if they don’t offer health insurance, these smaller employers would not. At the end of a union contract, they would be perfectly free under the law to drop coverage and encourage workers to buy through an exchange. The exchanges could be an attractive option for another reason. In an exchange, workers with family incomes as high as 400 percent of federal poverty level would be eligible for a subsidy from the federal government. A subsidy calculator from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy group, shows what this could mean in dollars and cents. A family of four making $92,000 a year would get about 25 percent knocked off the premium. That’s a significant discount; one that Secunda says would put the union plans at a competitive disadvantage. Over the decades, some unions have negotiated successfully for good health care benefits, even at the expense of wages. But if the unions’ nightmare scenario plays itself out as they fear, and employers drop coverage, then workers would find that they can get coverage without the union. The coverage probably wouldn’t be as good but its shortcomings might not be obvious. And maybe these workers would have less reason to belong to the union. ""This could be yet another existential threat to the unions,"" said Secunda. There’s reason to think that some employers would exercise this option. Marshall Babson is a long-time employment lawyer and former member of the National Labor Relations Board, appointed by President Ronald Reagan. Babson represents management. Babson said for the past 20 years, he has been advising his clients to get out of Taft-Hartley plans. He said they are inefficient. ""If the Affordable Care Act is a threat to these plans,"" Babson said, ""It’s because they have been vulnerable for a long time."" This is the union fear. What would actually happen under Obamacare is unknown. Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a group focused on how government programs affect people of modest means. Bernstein was chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden during the drafting of Obamacare. He was more optimistic that the plans will remain viable. ""I wouldn’t be so quick to accept the assumption that the Taft-Hartley plans will end when the Affordable Care Act arrives,"" Bernstein said. ""One of the myths is that employers will willy-nilly dump their plans and put people on the exchange. Typically, these plans are offered for a reason. They are an important part of the compensation package that makes sense for keeping the workers you need to run a business. The ACA won’t change that."" But some unions, at least, are unwilling to wait and find out. Concerns about part-timers Another significant issue for unions is how the law treats part-time workers. While the law encourages employers to provide insurance, there are two primary escape clauses. Companies with fewer than 50 workers face no requirement to offer it. And no employer need provide coverage to anyone working less than 30 hours each week. ""We don’t have hard numbers but we hear anecdotally that some companies are shifting to using more part-time workers,"" said Brenda Carter, spokeswoman for Unite-Here. Carter said that doesn’t affect her union’s members because they are protected by contracts, but it isn’t good for non-union workers. Our ruling Mike Lee said unions say that Obamacare is bad for workers. About six unions, some of them quite large, have warned in the strongest terms that Obamacare will undercut health care coverage for their members. The evidence suggests that more than six unions share that view. However, the union community is not monolithic, and some large unions continue to support the Affordable Care Act as much as ever. And while Lee would like to do away with the new health care law, even unions with deep concerns seek to fix the law, not repeal it. Still, a significant number of prominent unions spoke against the law as it now stands and not every union would need to feel that way in order for Lee’s statement to be accurate. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/aug/21/mike-lee/sen-lee-says-union-call-obamacare-bad-workers/

Pottery class claim takes truth for a spin
","The race to fill retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss’ seat is in full swing with candidates on both sides of the aisle jockeying for early position among their competitors. A common theme, particularly among the GOP candidates, has been the need to rein in wasteful government spending. Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel has taken this topic to another level. Handel began a daily blog, titled ""Only in Washington,"" detailing alleged wastefulness by the federal government. Handel is planning to chronicle ""42 ridiculous things that happen only in Washington,"" and this week she reached the halfway point. PolitiFact Georgia perused the 20 or so completed entries and found some to be quite interesting. For example, Day 8’s item: ""Only in Washington would politicians spend $27 million to teach Moroccans how to make pottery,"" Handel said. ""While Morocco is no doubt a lovely place, we have families in Georgia that are being hurt by high taxes fueling out of control spending … What’s worse is that the program was deemed a failure …,"" she continued. Almost $30 million for pottery classes in any country sounded outrageous. We decided to dig a little deeper to determine whether these costs were accurate. A press release accompanying each day’s item includes sources that Handel’s team has used to make the statements. For the Day 8 item, the sources included a couple of news stories about the spending that Handel’s spokesman provided. The claim has been repeated by politicos before, including conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly. Earlier this year, PolitiFact Wisconsin looked into this claim as a portion of a three-part statement made by a congressman from that state about government spending. The congressman was found to be incorrect for overstating this portion of his claim about the pottery class spending. Much of the background about this claim originated from a similar aggregation of alleged wasteful federal government spending done by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn. Each year, the Republican senator from Oklahoma releases an oversight report of ""unnecessary, duplicative and low-priority projects spread throughout the federal government"" in a document called the Wastebook. Coburn’s Wastebook 2012 highlights the pottery classes as an example of wasteful spending, but notes that only part of the $27 million of a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) project went toward the classes. In 2009, USAID began a $30 million, four-year plan to help increase the economic competitiveness of Morocco. The plan included five projects, with the Morocco Economic Competitive Project accounting for $27 million, or 90 percent of the overall plan. The Competitive Project, scheduled to run through Sept. 30, 2013, initially included a provision for a $7 million, one-year extension. But because of anticipated budget cuts, a change in mission strategy, complications with the task order and poor implementation of some activities, it is unlikely the project will be extended, according to a December 2011 audit report by a federal inspector general. The initial goals of the project were to improve the country's business climate, work on ways to use water sustainably for agricultural growth and strengthen workforce development. A key part of the project included training Moroccans to create pottery to sell domestically as well as internationally. But the pottery program was riddled with problems, the audit found. For example, a translator hired to translate the instructions from an English-speaking pottery trainer to Arabic-speaking attendees was not fluent in English, which resulted in communication breakdowns. Also, some of the materials used by the pottery trainer were unavailable in Morocco, and participants were unable to replicate the projects. The pottery trainer was forgetful. Ultimately, the audit found that the pottery portion of the competitiveness project was poorly implemented, had limited impact and its intended focus on women and youths was not fulfilled. In a November 2011 response letter, USAID/Morocco's mission director characterized the pottery training as a ""minor activity"" within the competitiveness project. The pottery training portion of the project represented only one part of the project’s engagement in the country’s pottery sector. In fiscal 2011, that component accounted for 8 percent of annual project spending, the mission director wrote. So is Handel’s claim correct? The former Georgia secretary of state who’s now a U.S. Senate candidate said that the federal government spent $27 million teaching Moroccans how to make pottery. This claim has been a popular touchstone for conservatives looking to shine a light on government waste. But a closer look at the facts shows that the $27 million was for an entire economic development program in Morocco, of which the pottery training was only a fraction of the cost -- about 8 percent of the total program. Some may still consider that amount, $2.2 million, a large expense for pottery training and promotion, but it is not close to the $27 million that Handel claimed. Her overall point that the program was a failure is supported by an inspector general’s audit that found that the pottery training was mismanaged, poorly organized and ineffective. Her statement contains an element of truth but overstates the cost and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Obama says exports of U.S. goods at all-time high
","American manufacturing is more than just a shaded slice in a pie chart showing what makes the country’s economy tick. In the popular mind, it’s a measure of how well the nation competes in the world and whether ""we still make things."" So during a speech in Arizona, when President Barack Obama was listing the ways the economy has recovered, he made a point to include American exports. ""We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before,"" Obama said. It’s worth noting that the president specifically referred to ""products made in America"" in contrast to a broader view on trade that blends both goods and services. The data check on Obama’s claim is straightforward. When tallying sales of everything from bushels of wheat to jet engines, the standard unit of measurement is dollars. The Bureau of Economic Analysis in the U.S. Commerce Department helps pull together the country’s trade statistics. The bureau’s June report showed the U.S. exported more than $134 billion worth of goods that month. That indeed is the largest dollar amount ever, even accounting for inflation. There are two important pieces of context for these numbers -- the impact of the recession and the overall trade deficit. We’ll look at the role of the recession first. Trade numbers can bounce around from month to month so we compared the total amount of goods sold in the first half of 2013 to the first half of the years right before and after the recession. Half year (Jan-June) Dollars (in millions, seasonally adjusted) Change from same period, year before 2007 $561,979 2008 $665,892 18.5% 2009 $507,812 -23.7% 2010 $619,101 21.9% 2011 $731,409 18.1% 2012 $779,426 6.6% 2013 $786,631 0.9% Source: BEA 
  The recession took a big bite out of trade as the global economy locked up. The sale of goods fell by nearly a quarter from 2008 to 2009, again, just looking at the first half of each year. The rebound however was pretty quick. By 2011, sales were higher than just before the recession hit and they’ve continued to rise. But the rate of increase has slowed considerably. Andrew Bernard, a trade economist at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, runs the numbers a little differently but sees the same trend. The total dollars go up, but not as fast. ""Touting the current numbers as the best ever is a bit disingenuous as, by my calculations, the last 12 months are up 1.4 percent over the previous 12,"" Bernard said. ""Not exactly booming."" Still, Bernard notes that when the country’s biggest trading partners face economic headwinds, one should expect American exports to suffer. ""Europe has been pretty stagnant, and Chinese growth has been slowing, so any increase might actually be good news,"" he said. Bernard said both Europe and Asia are showing signs of improvement which he expects to help U.S. exports down the line. The balance of trade Generally speaking, strong economies sell more to others than they buy in return. This is an area where countries like China and Germany historically have done quite well and where the U.S. has struggled. When President Obama cheered the record level of sales for American products, that didn’t address the country’s trade deficit. However, while the U.S.  is still in the red on trade, the news here also is slightly better than in the past. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the deficit for goods dropped nearly $10 billion between May and June. The average monthly deficit over the past 12 months has been about $59.5 billion. In June, it was about $53 billion. The sale of capital goods, things like construction equipment and machinery, did the most to boost the numbers. There was a $2.3 billion rise over the past 12 months. While the focus of this check is on goods, the sale of services regularly generates surpluses of about $18 billion to $19 billion a month that help offset the nation’s overall trade deficit. But even with that, the trade deficit for the past 12 months stands at $540 billion. Our ruling President Obama said the United States is selling more products made here to other countries than ever before. We should note that the overall outlook for U.S. exports has several trouble spots: While sales are expected to grow, they will grow more slowly in the months to come. Also, the nation’s trade deficit remains high. The president’s statement, though, focused only on the overall value of all exports. His statement was accurate, and we rate it True.

Pro-pot group claims marijuana is 'less toxic' than alcohol
","Just as fans were filing into the Brickyard 400 NASCAR race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a big television screen by the entrance displayed a pro-pot ad with the headline ""A new beer?"" The ad, which opens with smiling young adults hoisting their brew mugs, drew outrage from lots of sources, including the St. Petersburg-based Drug Free America Foundation. The TV screen company, Grazie Media, pulled the ad after a few hours. The ad said: ""If you’re an adult who enjoys a good beer, there’s a similar product you might want to know about, one without all the calories and serious health problems. Less toxic so it doesn’t cause hangovers or overdose deaths. And it’s not linked to violence or reckless behavior. Marijuana. Less harmful than alcohol and time to treat it that way."" In this fact-check, we decided to focus on the idea that marijuana is ""less toxic"" than alcohol. ""I don’t see how this could be a more open-and-shut case,"" Mason Tvert, communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project, which produced the ad, told PolitiFact Florida in an email. ""If you consume too much alcohol in a sitting or over the course of your life, you can die. If you consume too much (marijuana) in a sitting or over the course of your life, you do not die.  What more could be needed to prove marijuana is ‘less toxic’ than alcohol?"" Yet, as a rebuttal, some health professionals say it’s a matter of picking your poison.   ""It’s like trying to compare different weapons. Both have the potential to cause harm,"" said Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, professor and vice chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and chief of the Division of Addiction Medicine, at University of Florida. ""I don’t know that there’s a clear answer."" For starters, the term toxic can be vague. Dr. Cynthia Lewis-Younger, medical director of the Florida Poison Information Center in Tampa, said toxic can be ""anything that causes harm. It is possible to drink enough water to poison yourself. It’s more related to the dose than anything else."" The Marijuana Policy Project’s claim that marijuana is ""less toxic"" rankles some health professionals and anti-drug organizations who criticize the inference that using the drug is okay. Calvina Fay, executive director of the Drug Free America Foundation, said she wants the public to realize that ""these are two drugs that are both addictive and impairing and they both create unsafe situations."" Briefly, here’s a look at how the National Institute on Drug Abuse describes each drug. Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of yeast, sugars and starches and while it may start as a stimulant in small doses, NIDA describes it as a central nervous system depressant that is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine into the bloodstream. Intoxication can impair brain function and motor skills and heavy use can increase risk of certain cancers, stroke, and liver disease. Marijuana is a dry, shredded green and brown mix of leaves, flowers, stems and seeds from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa. The main psychoactive (mind-altering) chemical in marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. When marijuana is smoked, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to the brain and other organs. Activists on both sides of the marijuana issue can find studies that back up their claims about the health impact of smoking weed. NIDA states in an email that the effect of marijuana can depend on the person (their biology) who’s using it, the amount and under what circumstances. ""Claiming that marijuana is less toxic than alcohol cannot be substantiated since each possess their own unique set of risks and consequences for a given individual,"" according to an agency email statement. Statistics certainly paint a grim picture of the lethal impact of alcohol abuse. The Centers for Disease Control’s National Center for Health Statistics reports that there were 41,682 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010, the last year with the most exact statistics. That breaks down to 15,990 deaths attributed to alcoholic liver disease and 25,692 other alcohol-induced deaths, excluding accidents and homicides. The center doesn’t have any reports of marijuana listed as a cause of death. In 2006, there were more than 1.2 million emergency room visits and 2.7 million physician office visits due to excessive drinking, the CDC reports on its website. ""Alcohol in excess is probably the No. 1 cause of toxicities from drugs of abuse in the world simply because it’s most widely used,"" Lewis-Younger said. Robert Gable wrote in an American Scientist article in 2006 that ""simply tallying the number of people who die or who show up at emergency rooms is, by itself, meaningless,"" because that figure is influenced by the number of people using the substance. Yet the Marijuana Policy Project’s Tvert said Gable’s eight-year study on recreational drugs bolsters their assertion. Gable, a retired professor of psychology at Claremont Graduate University in California, compared the toxicity of 20 abused substances using reports of experimental human and animal research and on published data of overdose fatalities. He compared the drugs by developing a safety ratio -- the ratio of an effective dose (eliciting a ""relaxed affability"") to a lethal dose. ""Two drinks makes you buzzy, 20 drinks puts you in the emergency room or the morgue,"" Gable said in a phone interview. ""Ten is the safety ratio"" for alcohol, among the most toxic recreational drugs, he said. The least physiologically toxic substances -- those requiring 100 to 1,000 times the effective dose to cause death -- included marijuana when ingested. He couldn’t find any cases of documented deaths from smoked marijuana ""so the actual dose is a mystery."" ""No drug is good for teenagers,"" he said,  ""but when it comes to the chances of immediate death by chemical toxicity, marijuana is about a hundred times less toxic than alcohol or cocaine.""      Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, notes: ""People could argue it (marijuana) is a weaker chemical in terms of toxicity, but it does have its consequences. It doesn’t mean marijuana is harmless."" Experts say one concern is the impact of marijuana on the brain, particularly for teens who start smoking early. Teitelbaum says marijuana can ""flip"" adolescents predisposed to mental problems into having a psychotic disorder. A 2012 study from Duke University, the University of Oregon, King’s College London and the University of Otago (New Zealand) published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ""Persistent Cannabis Users Show Neuropsychological Decline from Childhood to Midlife,"" examined the potential relationship between the long-term use of marijuana and declines in IQ scores. The study was based on data from more than 1,037 individuals followed from birth until age 38 and determined those who began using cannabis before age 18 and became persistent users (more than once a week) suffered the greatest decline in mental functioning (an average of eight IQ points) that didn’t improve once they stopped. Those who started using marijuana when they were adults didn’t show the same decline. Another concern has come up in recent years. The use of synthetic marijuana, often called Spice, has become a problem, and health professionals caution that it’s vastly different from natural marijuana and more toxic. ""Many Spice smokers have experienced agitation, paranoia and mental illness,"" JoAnn Chambers-Emerson, certified specialist in poison information/educator at the Florida Poison Information Center in Tampa, wrote in an email. ""Some Spice smokers have ended up having a stroke, heart attack, seizures and kidney failure. Synthenetic marijuana, however, is not marijuana.  Our ruling An ad from the Marijuana Policy Project claims marijuana is ""less toxic"" than alcohol. Our job as fact-checkers in this case is not to decide whether marijuana is good or harmful. We're focused on whether the drug in its natural form is ""less toxic"" than alcohol. In that regard, science and statistics present a strong case: Overall, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/aug/19/marijuana-policy-project/pro-pot-group-claims-marijuana-less-toxic-alcohol/

Cruz claim about fewer Americans with employer-backed health plans cherry-picks and misinterprets Congressional Budget Office figure
","Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who has championed Republican efforts to stop the Obamacare law from rolling out, says some workers will lose employer-supported health plans under the law. In an Aug. 12, 2013, commentary, Cruz initially noted that President Barack Obama, who signed the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare into law in 2010, said that under the law, Americans who like their health coverage could keep it. But that’s not so, Cruz said, adding: ""According to a recent Congressional Budget Office report, under Obamacare, 7 million people will lose their employer-sponsored insurance."" By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said he was drawing on the non-partisan office’s latest 10-year budget outlook forecast. The CBO's report, issued Feb. 5, 2013, does not say how many workers are poised to lose employer-backed coverage. But a multi-tiered chart pointed out by Frazier indicates that as soon as 2017, the number of people who have employer-backed plans will be down seven million from the 162 million Americans who would have such coverage that year if Obamacare were not law. Similarly, three million fewer individuals will be enrolled in group health plans, including Medicare, that year than if Obamacare were not law, the chart indicates. More broadly, the chart also shows that fewer workers will have employer-supported plans in every year from 2014 through 2023 than if there had been no Obamacare law. Then again, the chart shows more workers having employer-backed plans in all but one year of the decade than the 154 million listed as having such coverage in 2013. Some 155 million people will have such plans through 2015, according to the chart, with 154 million people having one in 2016. A greater total of workers will have such coverage through 2019, according to the chart, when 167 million people will be so enrolled; the workers in such plans is predicted to decrease to 158 million in 2020 before edging to 160 million in 2022 and 2023. More broadly, the chart signals a surge in health coverage. By 2017, according to the chart, there will be 27 million fewer uninsured citizens than if the law had not changed. The same year, 11 million more people will be enrolled in Medicaid or state Children’s Health Insurance Plans than if Obamacare were not law, the chart says, and 26 million more people will have health plans purchased through insurance exchanges, lately called marketplaces. Under the law, individuals seeking coverage will be able to shop via online exchanges, or marketplaces, which are scheduled to debut in October 2013 before the law requires most citizens to have health coverage starting in 2014. By email, Frazier said the upshot remains that seven million Americans ""will drop their current coverage"" with the point ""being that the people are losing their options and being thrown into exchanges that will not offer the same plans they have now."" On Feb. 8, 2013, CNN posted a news story noting that the prediction that seven million  people would lose or drop their employment-based coverage amounted to an increase from four million as estimated by the office in August 2012. The story said, though, that workers ""who lose that coverage won't all be joining the ranks of the uninsured or the unemployed... Many are expected to shift into the health insurance exchanges. The number of people participating in those exchanges is projected to grow from seven million in 2014 -- the first year they'll be available -- to 24 million in 2016,"" CNN said, recapping figures in the CBO chart. The CBO report provides a little elaboration, stating that the increase to seven million from four million was largely due to a big decision made after its previous forecast: Congress and President Barack Obama extended, rather than letting expire, most tax cuts passed into law under President George W. Bush. A footnote to the report’s chart states the expected number of people with employment-based plans reflects the ""net result of increases in and losses of offers of health insurance from employers and changes in enrollment by workers and their families."" It’s complicated: ""For example,"" the footnote continues, ""in 2019, an estimated 12 million people who would have had an offer of employment-based coverage under prior law will lose their offer under current law, and another 3 million people will have an offer of employment-based coverage but will enroll in health insurance from another source instead. These flows out of employment-based coverage will be partially offset by an estimated 7 million people who will newly enroll in employment-based coverage under the Affordable Care Act."" The report has a little more explanation. Lower income tax rates, it says, reduce the ""tax benefits associated with health insurance provided by employers."" Also, the report says, the greater predicted movement away from employment-based coverage reflects revised income projections plus higher projections of how many workers would have employer-based plans if Obamacare was not law. CNN’s story quoted James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, a trade association for large employers, as saying that since employer-provided health insurance is not taxable, the CBO's theory is that the benefits aren't as valuable when tax rates are lower. So some workers -- particularly lower-income individuals -- may find it more desirable to forgo their employer's coverage, CNN said, and seek insurance in the exchanges, where they also may be eligible for a government subsidy. At the same time, CNN said, employers with large, low-wage workforces may find it financially advantageous to withdraw health coverage, even if they have to pay penalties set up by the law. Frazier did not comment on the report's other elements. She emailed: ""The point is that President Obama promised Americans they could keep their plans under Obamacare. Millions won't be able to. This isn't an argument over who gets care, it's over who gets to keep their current plan."" Our ruling Cruz said that according to the CBO, ""under Obamacare, 7 million people will lose their employer-sponsored insurance."" Not exactly. This claim is a refraction of the budget office’s forecast, which says that in four years--2017 and 2021 through 2023--seven million fewer workers will have employer-based plans than if Obamacare were not law. In any year, it makes sense to expect some workers to lose employer-backed coverage. Things change. But the office’s 10-year forecast does not estimate how many workers will ""lose"" employer-sponsored plans. Conversely, it indicates that compared to 2013, more workers will have employer plans in all but one year of the decade. This claim skews a single cherry-picked number from a multi-variable presentation. While there is an element of truth--fewer workers will have employer-supported plans than if Obamacare had not passed into law--the CBO report also indicates many Americans will obtain coverage from other sources. We rate the statement as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/aug/19/ted-cruz/cruz-claim-about-fewer-americans-employer-backed-h/

Atlanta popular with tourists, but numbers lack clarity
","A land deal for the new Atlanta Falcons stadium moved a step closer to completion last week. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed announced that an agreement had been reached with one of the two churches currently on the preferred building site. (Discussions are ongoing with the second church) Reed later discussed the details of the agreement and next steps during a radio interview on Atlanta’s 680 The Fan. At the end of the interview, Reed was asked about the impact of Atlanta’s two newest attractions, the already operating SkyView Atlanta Ferris wheel and the planned College Football Hall of Fame, which is expected to open in fall 2014. Reed said these types of attractions equate to an ""extra day,"" or features that influence visitors to remain in the city an additional 24 hours. Atlanta’s tourism is doing well, and Reed wants to continue that theme. ""Last year we broke a record. We had 42 million people visit the city of Atlanta. We’ve never had that many visitors before,"" the mayor said. ""... We now have as many visitors as Las Vegas, Nevada; San Diego, California, and Los Angeles, California. Orlando and New York City still have more visitors than us. So that’s why this is so important."" We know Atlanta is a popular place, but more visitors than Sin City and L.A.? We had to check it out. Reed’s statement was based on information provided by the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, the mayor’s spokeswoman said. According to the Atlanta CVB, the city saw 42.3 million visitors from across the country last year, setting a single-year visitation record. The Atlanta CVB uses a private research company, Virginia-based D.K. Shifflet and Associates, for tourism data. According to its methodology information, each month DKSA surveys traveling and nontraveling households to generate the best estimate of travel volume within the total U.S. population. Travel is defined as either an overnight trip and then returning home, or as a day trip, defined as a place away from home and back in the same day. Information collected includes: travel destination at a city level, hotel stays, purpose of stay, expenditures, length of stay and demographics. We also checked with Georgia’s Department of Economic Development, but it does not have access to city data, a spokeswoman said. That office stands by the figures provided by DKSA. So how did Atlanta’s 2012 numbers stack up against the cities Reed mentioned? We visited each city’s tourism website to compare the numbers. Based simply on the numbers, Reed is correct. Atlanta’s tourism standings could be even better than he claims. Data for Orlando, New York City, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, for example, include foreign and domestic visitors to those cities, according to tourism officials in those cities. But Atlanta’s figure includes only U.S. visitors to the city, said Rachel Peavy, the public relations director for the Atlanta CVB. City            # of visitors in 2012* Orlando        57.3 million New York City        52 million Atlanta            42.3 million Los Angeles        41.4 million Las Vegas        39.7 million San Diego        32.3 million *Based on city CVB data, which could be compiled by third-party research firms But visitation data are difficult to verify and compare. Methods of estimating and defining visitation vary from city to city, with no generally accepted standard. Each destination has its own research vendors and methodology for calculating visitor volume, so in many cases they are not directly comparable, said Jamie Faulkner, director of research products for the U.S. Travel Association, a top travel industry group. Her company does not publish any visitor statistics beyond the national level, so Faulkner had no data of her own to test Reed’s claim. But according to other sources, his statement appears correct, she said. Based on DKSA’s visitation data, the Atlanta CVB estimates that the ATL was the sixth-most-visited metro area in the country for U.S. visitors last year. DKSA did not provide rankings. That ranking is in line with a 2010 Forbes magazine ranking that put Atlanta at the seventh-most-visited U.S. city in 2009. Forbes used third-party data to judge cities on things such as hotel occupancy rates, number of foreign arrivals and visitor numbers provided by the cities’ individual convention and visitors bureaus. So was Reed correct in his claim that Atlanta’s tourism numbers have met or exceeded those of other popular travel destinations? Reed said Atlanta’s tourism rates were in the realm of other major cities such as Los Angeles and Las Vegas. His claim is based on information from the city’s convention and visitors bureau. The CVB’s data are provided by a third-party research firm that conducts household surveys to determine Atlanta’s visitation numbers. But that’s where the clarity stops. There is no industry-accepted method for calculating tourism. Each city, tourism office and research company uses its own methods and search criteria. Other firms say Reed’s claim appears correct. But there is really no concrete way to tell. The mayor’s statement needs that bit of detail to clarify his claim. We rated the statement Mostly True.

Cantor says Obamacare gives IRS access to personal health records
","During a recent floor debate, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor warned of dire consequences from the IRS implementing portions of Obamacare and collecting taxes to help pay for the health care reforms. ""The IRS will have access to the American people’s protected health care information,"" Cantor, R-7th, said Aug. 2.   He expressed distrust of the IRS, referring to disclosures earlier this year that the agency gave special scrutiny to the Tea Party and other conservative groups seeking tax exemptions. Giving the IRS access to personal medical records ""is nothing short of an unwelcome big government overreach into the most personal aspect of our lives,"" Cantor said. Shortly after his comments, the House, in a party-line vote, approved the ""Keep the IRS off your Health Care Act"" that would bar the IRS from any involvement in Obamacare. The measure, like 39 other House-approved bills that would end or dismantle the health care act, is expected to die in the Senate. Cantor made a similar statement during a July 27 broadcast, saying, ""The doctor’s office is the last place anyone would want to find the IRS. Your health care information is private and should remain so."" We wondered whether Obamacare really would give the IRS access to records of our illnesses, surgeries and prescriptions. We asked Cantor’s office for proof. His spokesman, Rory Cooper, cited a June 18 article in the conservative Breitbart.com about a rule issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Starting in January, Obamacare will require people who can afford health insurance to buy coverage or pay a tax penalty. Many who are now uninsured are expected to buy policies through insurance exchanges that are being set up. The rule requires private companies participating in the exchanges to submit information about new customers to HHS so the agency can assure that these people have bought at least the minimum levels of coverage required by Obamacare and verify those receiving federal assistance buying their policies fall into qualifying income categories. The Breitbart article discusses concerns by some conservative organizations and publications that HHS might share that information with the IRS. But the story stops short of Cantor’s claim that the IRS will have access to the data. HHS officials repeatedly have said they will not be seeking intimate details from medical histories and guaranteed the department will not share the information with the IRS, as reported by this spring by our colleagues at PolitiFact National and FactCheck.org. Again, it should be noted that the data will not be collected on everyone, just those who buy coverage through exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 26 million people living in the U.S. in 2020 -- less than 8 percent of population -- will be insured by the exchanges.   Twice since May, IRS officials have testified at House hearings that they will not have access to private medical records. The agency’s website states, ""Nothing in (Obamacare) allows the IRS to access individual’s health information, including information about individuals’ health status and any health care services received."" The IRS will share tax information to help HHS determine whether low-income families and individuals qualify for assistance in purchasing insurance. A computer system is being developed that will give HHS instant access to that information. But it will be a one-way system, and the IRS will not be able to view HHS records. So how will the IRS identify uninsured Americans who must pay Obamacare’s penalty tax? ""Taxpayers will get a form at the end of every year from their insurer to use when they prepare their tax returns,"" then-IRS Deputy Commissioner Steven Miller told a House subcommittee in September 2012. ""It is important to note that the information that insurers provide to the IRS will show the fact of insurance coverage, and will not include any personal health information. In most cases, taxpayers will file their tax returns reporting their health insurance coverage, and/or making a payment, and there will be no need for further interactions with the IRS."" Our ruling Cantor said that under Obamacare, ""the IRS will have access to the American people’s protected health care information."" But he offers no hard proof, just speculation on a blog. The IRS will play a major role in Obamacare by collecting a variety of taxes that will help support the program. But contrary to Cantor’s claim, IRS officials have repeatedly testified before Congress that they will not have access to the intimate details of anyone’s health records. Cantor’s unfounded statement does nothing more than amp up public fear for his ongoing fight to repeal Obamacare.

Scott Walker says ""best two-year job growth"" came during his tenure
","Responding to news that Democrats were recruiting candidates to oppose him in 2014, Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign talked up his record on budgets, taxes and jobs. ""Gov. Walker has balanced a $3.6 billion deficit, cut income taxes and Wisconsin has seen its best two-year job growth in a decade,"" Walker’s campaign told reporters on July 29, 2013. ""We’re confident that all voters want to continue moving forward and have no desire to return to the failed policies of the past."" We heard the same claim by Walker’s campaign in early August. We’ve previously tested Walker’s deficit and income-tax claims -- the governor accurately claims credit on both -- and many of the Republican governor’s jobs claims while tracking his promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs by January 2015. But the ""best two-year job growth in a decade"" is a new one, and one voters are likely to hear repeatedly as the election nears. So let’s test it. Walker is referring to 2011 and 2012, his first two years in office. To examine the decade, we’ll use the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, a thorough jobs count that economists, state and federal jobs officials and the Walker administration agree is the most accurate source. The figures, based on reports from more than 90% of public and private employers, are gathered by the state, then adjusted and published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest state-by-state figures through 2012 came out in mid-2013, prompting Walker to highlight the state’s improvement from 44th in job-creation to 33rd among the states. Walker’s new campaign claim isn’t specific to private-sector jobs or all jobs, so we’ll examine both the private world and the broader employment picture, including government jobs, though we note that Walker’s 250,000 promise was for the private side only. We went back to 2002 to get enough data to measure the changes in the last decade, so the baseline was the final year of Republican Gov. Scott McCallum’s brief tenure. The 2003-2010 figures belong to the era of Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. The most important number is 62,082 -- that’s how many more private-sector jobs existed at the end of December 2012 compared to the end of December 2010 -- the first two years of the Walker era. Walker was sworn in Jan. 3, 2011. Is it the best two-year period in the last decade? Wisconsin actually lost ground at times in the decade, most notably in 2008 and 2009 amid the worst effects of the prolonged national downturn dubbed the Great Recession. From the end of 2007 to the end of 2009, the private job tally in Wisconsin fell by a whopping 175,000 -- a drop of 7 percent. Doyle, we found, can’t claim a better two-year period than Walker’s 62,082 gain in private-sector jobs. But there is a two-year period that tops that -- December 2009 to December 2011, when the private jobs count jumped by 63,458. That period encompasses Doyle’s final year in office and Walker’s first, both of which came after the official end of the recession in mid-2009. The state’s employment turnaround began in 2010, Doyle’s final year, when the count jumped by more than 33,600, mirroring national gains. It has continued under Walker, though at a slightly slower pace in raw numbers. By comparison, the gains in Walker’s first two years were 29,800 and 32,282, respectively. What about the broader job count, including both the private and public sectors? We found two earlier periods that top Walker’s two-year mark on the combined total of private and public-sector jobs. The Walker-era total was 53,564. Before the recession, from the end of 2003 to the end of 2005 -- in Doyle’s era -- the job count grew by 58,062. The other total that topped 2011-12 was post-recession, in the Doyle-Walker period of 2010 and 2011. The bottom line here: Walker’s campaign claim falls short. In researching this item, we found earlier instances in which Walker made a similar claim, but in more precise and political terms. Example: In May 2013, the spokesman for Walker’s office told the Journal Sentinel: ""Today, Wisconsin's private-sector job growth is the best two-year gain under any governor in over a decade."" For this fact check, the Walker campaign pointed us to that same statement, made by the state’s workforce development agency. But that qualifier -- ""any governor"" -- makes a difference in the accuracy of the claim. As we’ve said, viewed that way, and looking at private-sector jobs only, Walker’s two years run ahead of any similar period under Doyle. A Journal Sentinel story in May also reached that conclusion. Voters are likely to hear that more precise claim as well in this election season. So consider that a bonus fact check. Our rating ""Wisconsin has seen its best two-year job growth in a decade,"" the Walker campaign told reporters in late July and early August. Not true, we found: Private job growth was higher in 2010-11, in the final year of Doyle and the first year under Walker. And total employment including government jobs rose faster from 2003-05 and 2010-11 than in the two-year Walker period. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2013/aug/19/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-best-two-year-job-growth-came-du/
"['New Jersey', 'Guns', 'Mark Kelly']","
Capt. Mark Kelly claims near-unanimous support in New Jersey for expanding background checks for guns
","Near unanimous support in polls isn’t exactly a frequent occurrence. And it may be even more rare when the topic in question is one of the most controversial in this country: gun control. But that was exactly the case earlier this year when a handful of major polling organizations quizzed people on gun control in the wake of the December 2012 Newtown, Conn. shooting spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 27 people dead, including 20 children. ""Polls show that 96 percent of New Jerseyans – and 95 percent of gun households in the state – support expanding background checks to keep guns away from those who shouldn’t have them,"" Navy Capt. Mark Kelly said in an Aug. 12 opinion column on NJ.com, the online home of The Star-Ledger. Kelly, a New Jersey native, is married to former Arizona Rep. Gabrille Giffords, a Democrat, who was shot in the head Jan. 8, 2011 during a public appearance at a supermarket parking lot in Tucson, Ariz. Six people were killed and 13 were wounded at the event, including Giffords. Kelly’s column expressed support for Gov. Chris Christie to sign some gun-control bills passed recently by the state Legislature, and urged Christie to sign another bill that would, in part, expand background checks on gun purchases and safety training for gun owners. As for the high approval ratings in Kelly’s claim, data supports it. Kelly was referring to a Jan. 24 poll done by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn., according to Katie Hill, press secretary for Kelly, Giffords and their group Americans for Responsible Solutions. The poll of 1,647 registered voters in New Jersey asked, ""Would you favor or oppose requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows?"" The response, according to poll data: 96 percent favored it. The figure was 95 percent for ‘gun households,’ meaning those households in New Jersey where a gun is present. Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans For Responsible Solutions, noted that federal law requires background checks for guns purchased from federally licensed firearms dealers, ""otherwise known as a gun  store."" That’s not the case, however, if guns are purchased from a private seller at a gun show – and the point that Carusone said Kelly was making with his claim. ""When we say expanding background checks, we mean to say to cover guns purchased at gun shows,"" Carusone said. The Truth-O-Meter reviewed this issue – commonly known as the ""gun show loophole"" -- in a May 2012 fact-check. At that time we confirmed that The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, or Brady Act, requires all federally licensed firearms dealers to run a background check on potential customers to ensure they are not prohibited from owning a gun. Private sellers without a federal license don’t have to meet the same requirement, although some states have stricter requirements than others. In addition to the Quinnipiac poll, we checked with other organizations in New Jersey to determine how their post-Newtown gun control polls fared. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Poll, said the organization hasn’t done a poll about expanding background checks, but did survey residents earlier this year about whether gun control would influence their vote for governor in November. David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Polling Institute and a political science professor at Rutgers University, said an early February poll asked 794 New Jerseyans a variety of questions about guns. Two of six questions asked randomly were background-check related and had approval levels at 90 percent or higher. Approval levels topped 80 percent for the same questions posed to ‘gun households,’ he said. Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind poll in January asked questions about greater restrictions on guns and ammunition, and better management of the mentally ill, according to Krista Jenkins, director of PublicMind and a political science professor at FDU. Our ruling Kelly said in an opinion column, """"Polls show that 96 percent of New Jerseyans – and 95 percent of gun households in the state – support expanding background checks to keep guns away from those who shouldn’t have them."" Kelly was referring to a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll from January, with findings that match numbers he cited. The poll’s question specifically referenced guns bought at gun shows, and Kelly’s spokeswoman confirmed that his statement in his column referred to such purchases. We rate Kelly’s claim True.

Defending Obamacare, Rep. Ron Kind says increases in health care spending are at record lows
","On Aug. 2, 2013, when House Republicans staged their 40th vote to do away with all or part of Obamacare, Rep. Ron Kind rose to defend President Barack Obama’s landmark legislation. ""Mr. Speaker, what turned out to be a silly exercise has suddenly turned into an insane exercise. We find ourselves, for the 40th time in the House of Representatives, debating repeal of the Affordable Care Act,"" the Wisconsin Democrat said on the House floor. ""We understand they don't like it. But I beseech my colleagues on the other side to start working with us to improve a system that's in desperate need of reform, and make changes and adjustments along the way as we learn what's working and what isn't. That's the only way this can work."" Then Kind, who took the microphone after Rep. James Bridenstine, R-Okla., made this claim: ""But let me just inject a few facts in this debate, especially for the benefit of the previous speaker. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, U.S. health care spending grew at 3.9 percent for the last three years, the lowest growth rate in over 50 years."" Let’s see whether Kind is right on the numbers -- and to what extent Obamacare is responsible. The numbers The most recent federal figures, from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, show total public and private health care spending grew by the same rate -- 3.9 percent -- for three straight years: 2009, 2010 and 2011. Kind's spokesman, Peter Knudsen, confirmed to us that those were the years Kind was referring to when he spoke of ""the last three years."" The 3.9 percent is the smallest annual increase since 1960, the first year total health care spending statistics were kept. The total spending has never declined from one year to the next. That means Kind is mostly on target with the statistical part of his statement. Where he’s off is that the 3.9 percent increase in 2009 occurred before the Affordable Care Act became law in March 2010. Now let’s turn to the other part of the statement: Kind's linking Obamacare with the record-low increases in health care spending. The credit Kind didn’t explicitly state that Obamacare alone is responsible for keeping a lid on spending on doctors, hospitals and other health care. His spokesman told us that Kind meant that Obamacare was merely one of many factors. But the implication was pretty strong. In defending Obamacare from a repeal attempt, Kind said that since the passage of the law, health care spending had been much lower. And he didn't cite any other reasons. We found widespread agreement among experts that many factors helped hold down the spending growth. And there is no consensus that Obamacare, which is still being implemented, was a leading factor. The experts who have weighed in on reasons for the smaller increases in spending include the American Medical Association, the Health Affairs journal and the federal government itself. Some experts have said Obamacare has helped rein in spending through steps such as reducing some Medicare Advantage payments; providing incentives that have led to fewer hospital-acquired infections and readmissions; and adding ""accountable care organizations,"" which give physicians incentives to improve quality and lower costs. But many economists and others experts say the slowdown in health care spending simply reflects the overall economic slowdown. Other factors include expert cite for the slowdown in health care spending increases include a decline in private insurance coverage, changes in the design of insurance benefits, and a slower introduction of new drugs and technology. And when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the total health care spending figures for 2011, the agency concluded that Obamacare had ""no discernible impact"" on the slowdown in spending that year. Our rating Defending Obamacare, Kind said: ""Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, U.S. health care spending grew at 3.9 percent for the last three years, the lowest growth rate in over 50 years."" The statistical part of the claim is mostly accurate. But despite Kind’s implication that Obamacare was key in reducing the growth of health care spending, the evidence suggests its role was modest.

"['Rhode Island', 'Congress', 'Health Care', 'James Langevin']","
U.S. Rep. James Langevin says he will be required to purchase his health insurance through the Rhode Island Obamacare exchange
","One complaint about Congress is that its members make rules that apply to everyone but themselves. That complaint, mostly untrue, is being used again in the campaign against Obamacare. For example, Fox News anchorman Bill Hemmer announced on Aug. 8 that President Obama ""personally intervened to make sure that members of Congress and their staffers will not have to live with Obamacare."" The Wall Street Journal opined on Aug. 5 that the politicians had moved ""to create a special exemption for themselves from the Obamacare health coverage that everybody else is mandated to buy."" Yet when U.S. Rep. James Langevin, a Democrat representing Rhode Island’s Second Congressional District, was interviewed Aug. 12, 2013, by WPRO's Gene Valicenti, Langevin said flatly that he's now going to have to buy his health insurance from the ""exchanges"" that serve as online marketplaces for health care policies. ""Obamacare, as you mentioned, is going to be in effect very soon. We've seen some very positive effects,"" he said, citing the elimination of lifetime caps and the ban on insurance companies denying coverage because of a preexisting condition. ""And people will very soon be choosing their health care through the health insurance exchanges, including members of Congress."" ""I’ll be choosing my health care plan from the new exchange that Rhode Island is setting up,"" Langevin said. (Rhode Island’s exchange, HealthSource RI, starts enrollment Oct. 1 for plans that take effect in 2014.) So who is correct here? We decided to check Langevin's statement that members of Congress will have to buy from an exchange, sometimes referred to as a health insurance marketplace. Here's the short answer: members of Congress are treated differently under the law, but not in the way critics of Obamacare say. Here’s why. Under Obamacare, people must either get health insurance coverage or pay a fine, beginning Jan. 1, 2014. Generally, workers and their dependents who are covered by an employer's health insurance are all set. More than half the population is already covered that way. (Beginning in 2015, companies employing 50 or more must offer coverage or pay a penalty.) The exchanges -- set up by individual states or the federal government (if a state doesn't want to operate one) -- are designed to offer one-stop shopping for small businesses seeking affordable plans for their workers and for people without insurance looking to buy a policy. Because members of Congress and their staffs are already covered by the same health insurance plans that cover other federal employees, they wouldn’t have needed to buy their insurance through an exchange. But when Obamacare was being debated, some argued that Congress and congressional staff members should be required to buy their insurance through an exchange system, saying that would ensure that the system would work properly. If ordinary citizens would have to use the exchange, the argument went, so should Congress. That provision ultimately became part of Obamacare, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In passing it, members of Congress made themselves and their staffers exempt from the provision of the law that would have let them stay with their existing health plan, like everyone else already covered by an employer's health insurance plan. But that opened up a different issue, and it revolves around paying for their insurance. Most individuals who buy their coverage on the exchange will have to pay for it out of their own pocket. Many will get help from a federal subsidy in the form of a tax credit that varies based on family size and income. Yet members of Congress, and some of their staff, make too much money to quality for any subsidy. So they would have to pay twice. Not only would they lose their company-subsidized insurance (in this case, the ""company"" is the federal government), they would have to pay for their new insurance plan entirely out of their own pocket. To resolve the issue, the Obama administration announced Aug. 7, 2013, that the money already being spent to pay for Congress’ current health insurance plan would be applied to any policy purchased from an exchange. (The government currently covers up to 75 percent of the premiums of the federal plan, with enrollees paying the rest. Members of Congress and their staffs would still have to pay their share of the bill.) It was this proposed rule that prompted critics over the past few weeks to allege that the Obama administration was creating another exemption for Congress members and their staffs. But Congress had already agreed to live by the system it created. What the new rule actually does is continue the federal government’s contribution toward its employees’ insurance coverage. So when U.S. Rep. James Langevin said he would be required to buy his health insurance through one of the Obamacare exchanges, his statement was True.

"['Oregon', 'Poverty', 'Jim Francesconi']","
Are nearly half of Oregon's children growing up poor?
","With the State Board of Higher Education handing oversight of Oregon’s universities to independent boards, Jim Francesconi, one of the state board members, recently took to The Oregonian’s opinion pages to note a few of the issues the new custodians will have to deal with. Among them he said, and most importantly, education has to be accessible. ""Oregon,"" he wrote, ""must demonstrate that working people and poor folks can still make it in America. Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor."" It was the line about the percentage of poor children in the state that caught one Oregonian reader’s attention. Oregon is hardly a rich state -- particularly when the national economy itself is down and out -- but nearly half? That seemed a stretch. We agreed with our reader -- it was worth looking into. Our first call was to Francesconi to see where he got his figures. He said the information came from a 2012 report by Children First for Oregon, an advocacy group. According to that report, ""nearly 50% of children are either poor or low-income."" Francesconi almost immediately realized his mistake. ""In retrospect, I wish I would have said poor or low income."" Though there may not be a difference to the average person, there is a distinction between poor and low income as far as the U.S. government is concerned. In order to qualify as poor, a family must make 100 percent or less of the federal poverty level. Low income refers to families between 100 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level. So what does that mean in a practical sense? A family of four living in Oregon in 2013 would be considered ""poor"" if they make $23,550 or less a year. To be considered low income, a family would have to make between $23,550 and $47,100 a year. (For the curious, the National Center for Children in Poverty at Columbia University has a handy online calculator that can detail the poverty level for families of various sizes living in various states.) If you check the most recent Census information, you’ll find that in 2011 a little more than 23 percent of children (those younger than 18) in Oregon live in families at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level while another 21 percent live in low-income families. The figures are slightly higher still for young children, or those under 6 years old. Now, if we were just using the government’s definition of ""poor"" this would be a really easy False. As far as the U.S. government is concerned, about a quarter of the state’s children are poor, not half. But, at PolitiFact Oregon we strive for more context. Plus, it seemed to us that a family of four making $30,000 would likely feel pretty poor even if they didn’t meet the strict federal definition. So, we placed a couple calls to various non-partisan poverty centers around the nation and spoke with some experts. First up was Jennifer Romich, a professor at the University of Washington and founding affiliate of the West Coast Poverty Center. Using the federal poverty level as a strict line of who is poor and who is not can be problematic, she told us. ""The federal poverty line is widely seen as too low,"" Romich said. ""Among folks who spend their lifetime measuring poverty, they can agree that the current measure is problematic."" It doesn’t, for instance, take into account government assistance or tax expenditures. Plus, the measure, which rises with inflation, was developed in the 1960s and, aside from a couple small amendments, hasn’t been updated since. Romich explained that it ""was originally based on USDA reckonings that a family spends about 30 percent of their income on food which was true in the 60s but is not true today."" Nowadays, she said, health care and housing costs, for instance, are consuming much more of a budget. Either way, Romich said, families that are classified as low income are still going to ""feel  economically deprived. … In laymen’s terms, you'd think of this as unofficially poor or close to poverty."" Another expert, this time from Columbia University, agreed. ""I think that many low-income families who are above the poverty line, but not much above it, are struggling a great deal with paying bills and finding childcare that is stable and affordable and paying co-insurance on medical visits and putting gas in the car,"" said Sheila Smith, who oversees the early childhood program at the National Center for Children in Poverty. ""We like to think that families who are above that threshold of the official poverty line are doing OK. But we know, in fact, that they ... are struggling in many ways."" Smith said she and her colleagues at the poverty center look at whether states are actively promoting the needs of low-income residents, they often put the benchmark at 200 percent of the federal poverty level. For instance, does the state set the income eligibility for child care subsidies at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. (The cut off in Oregon is 185 percent.) ""Families who are at or above 200 percent of the FPL,"" Smith explained, ""still really need that support for income stability."" So what is an appropriate way to determine what poverty is and who feels it? Romich pointed us to the work of a colleague who measures poverty with a ""Self-Sufficiency Standard."" Essentially, how much would various types of families living in various parts of the country have to make to meet basic needs. Diana Pearce, the mind behind the standard describes how it works in an Oregon-specific report from 2011: ""The Self-Sufficiency Standard is a measure of economic security that is based on the costs of the basic needs for working families: housing, child care, food, health care, transportation, and miscellaneous items as well as the cost of taxes and the impact of tax credits. In 2011, Pearce determined that a family of four -- with one school-age child and one preschooler -- living in Multnomah County would have had to make $52,989 in order to meet their needs. Now, remember, that’s how much the parents would have to make collectively. That amount would put the family at 225 percent of the federal poverty level. For what it’s worth, that family would also qualify for housing assistance. The National Center for Children in Poverty employs a similar metric for their ""basic needs budget calculator."" Their calculator, which calculates for families living in 2008, doesn’t have data for Oregon, however we ran the estimates for Vancouver, Wa., and Clark County. According to the calculator, a two-parent family with one school-age child and one preschooler would have needed to bring in $48,523 a year in 2008 to meet basic needs. So where does this leave us? Francesconi said in an opinion piece that ""nearly half of Oregon's children are poor."" In fact, if you use federal definitions for poverty, about a quarter are poor and another quarter are low-income. But experts tell us that families that are described as low-income still struggle to meet their basic needs and, for all intents and purposes, qualify as poor. Be that as it may, Francesconi was referencing a report that used the federal definitions. As such, his statement leaves out important details and we, too, think it would have been better to say ""poor and low income."" We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/aug/16/jim-francesconi/are-nearly-half-oregons-children-growing-poor/

Bush claim about ""proficiency"" of Texas 8th graders in math tracks federal results, needs clarification
","George P. Bush, a Fort Worth Republican running for Texas land commissioner in 2014, wrote on Twitter that ""60 percent of Texas 8th graders are not proficient in math."" Bush’s July 2, 2013, tweet continued: ""Only 26% have a teacher with a undergraduate major in math."" We were curious about both of his claims, but also wondered why a land commissioner hopeful would zero in on middle-school math. By email, Bush spokesman Trey Newton pointed out that the commissioner manages state lands, which generate school revenue. Also, he said, Bush is a former schoolteacher who has helped local charter schools. Texas eighth-graders ‘proficient’ in math? Per Bush’s Twitter post, Newton pointed us to Change the Equation, a non-partisan CEO-led initiative to mobilize businesses to improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learning. An initiative web page presents ""proficiency"" results from the federal National Assessment of Educational Progress, which for nearly four decades has tested random samples of students around the country with results serving as a kind of national report card. In every state every two years, clutches of eighth graders are tested in math and reading. On the tests, significantly, a ""proficient"" score means a student has more than mastered the subject. A student attaining a lower score might qualify for what the government calls its ""basic"" rating. In 2011, the minimum score to be considered ""proficient"" on the eighth-grade math assessment was 299 on a scale of 0 to 500, according to a September 2010 U.S. Department of Education report spelling out testing details. Proficient students ""should understand the connections among fractions, percents, decimals, and other mathematical topics such as algebra and functions,"" the report said. ""Students at this level are expected to have a thorough understanding of"" basic ""arithmetic operations—an understanding sufficient for problem solving in practical situations."" Students with scores of 262 met the ""basic"" threshold, according to the report, meaning they were able to solve problems using varied ""strategies and technological tools—including calculators, computers, and geometric shapes. Students at this level also should be able to use fundamental algebraic and informal geometric concepts in problem solving."" Unlike eighth graders scoring high enough to be ""proficient,"" the ""basic"" students ""show limited skill in communicating mathematically,"" the report said. Newton pointed us to another group’s web page indicating that in 2011, 60 percent of the Texas eighth-graders chosen to take the math assessment did not score well enough to be considered proficient, though that also was an improvement on previous years, according to the information posted by Kids Count, a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Some 64 percent of Texas eighth-graders were not proficient on the math assessment in 2009, Kids Count said, with 75 percent not proficient in 2003. By telephone, spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson of the Texas Education Agency pointed us to a federal chart showing that on the 2011 math test, 81 percent of participating Texas eighth-graders scored well enough to meet or exceed the ""basic"" threshold--counting the 40 percent of students who were ""proficient."" On the 2009 test, 78 percent of Texas eighth-graders scored well enough to clear the ""basic"" hurdle, 36 percent of them proving ""proficient."" These results were far better than the first year shown, 1990, when 45 percent of tested Texas students achieved ""basic"" scores or better, including 13 percent deemed ""proficient."" Asked to explain the gains, Culbertson said, ""Instruction has gotten better and teachers are better trained."" Math teachers majoring in math And did most eighth-grade math teachers not major in math? Newton noted another Change the Equation web page including a bar graph indicating that in 2011, 26 percent of Texas eighth-grade math teachers had majored in math, compared with 31 percent of such teachers nationally. A footnote says these percentages did not count teachers who were ""math education"" majors. By telephone, spokesman Arnold Goldstein of the National Center for Education Statistics cautioned that the teachers surveyed do not amount to a random sample. The Texas math teachers who answered such background questions in 2011, he said, were simply those teachers who had the state’s 7,500 students in 210 schools randomly chosen to take the federal test.   That wrinkle aside, does the research support Bush’s claim? Evidently. With Goldstein’s help, we downloaded NAEP survey results indicating that 21 percent of the Texas eighth-graders who took the math test in 2011 had a math teacher who reported majoring in math. That compared with 26 percent in the government’s comparable 2009 survey, 28 percent in 2003 and 36 percent in 2000. And by email, a spokesman for a Washington, D.C.-based group, American Institutes for Research, told us that other 2011 NAEP survey data--information not immediately accessible to the public--indicates 26 percent of the students had a teacher who had majored in math or ""another mathematics subject"" such as statistics. Claus Von Zastrow further provided a spreadsheet showing the percentages for each state. Finally, Goldstein guided us to NAEP survey results indicating that in 2011, 16 percent of the Texas eighth-graders who took the math exam had a math teacher who had majored in math education. Past surveys indicated that in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009, 10 percent to 18 percent of such eighth-graders had a math teacher who had majored in math education. For another perspective, we reached Cynthia Schneider of the Texas Council of Teachers of Mathematics, who said by telephone that her review of the 2011 eighth grade NAEP math test results for Texas showed no significant differences in the scores of students who had teachers who had majored in math versus teachers who had not. Regardless, Schneider said, it’s increasingly important for middle-school math teachers to have taken advanced math courses in college because more and more students are expected to absorb algebra and other complex math topics. ""Math majors do matter,"" she said. Newton of Bush’s campaign suggested by email that it makes sense to stress teachers who majored in math, rather than math education. ""There are differences in the overall design of these degree plans, including the number of upper-division mathematics courses taken and the level of advanced mathematics taken,"" Newton said. Newton stood by Bush’s emphasis on students whose scores met the ""proficient"" threshold, saying that’s an accepted benchmark. ""If major education agencies are choosing to report it this way, choosing to report the proficient number rather than the basic, we are not being misleading by following suit,"" Newton said by email. Our ruling Bush said 60 percent of Texas eighth graders are not ""proficient"" in math and only 26 percent have a teacher who majored in math in college. Federal figures support both ends of this claim, though clarification is needed to specify that ""proficient"" here does not mean that 60 percent of such students are flat failing to keep up. In 2011, 19 percent of Texas eighth-graders fell short of the ""basic"" math achievement hurdle set for the federal math test. We rate this statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/aug/16/george-p-bush/bush-claim-about-proficiency-texas-8th-graders-mat/

Group backing Barack Obama says Marco Rubio is a ""climate change denier""
","In a recent email to supporters in Florida, Organizing for Action -- a group that supports President Barack Obama -- criticized the climate change policies of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the Senate’s leading Republicans and a possible 2016 presidential contender. The email, signed by Ivan Frishberg, the group’s climate campaign manager, begins like this: ""Friend -- ""We're spending the next week of Action August getting serious about climate change. ""To get ready, we're calling out Sen. Marco Rubio, who refuses to accept the basic science on this issue -- and is standing in the way of action. ""It's time everyone in Florida knows: Sen. Rubio is a climate change denier."" The email goes on to say that ""there are 135 documented climate change deniers currently roaming the halls of Congress."" The full list is here, but in this item we’ll be focusing on whether Rubio ""is a climate change denier."" We should clarify up front: In the policy context, the term ""climate change"" refers to rising temperatures and sea levels caused by human beings and their use of carbon-dioxide-emitting fossil fuels. (We should also note that Rubio’s staff did not respond when contacted for this story.) In supporting its claim, OFA cites a Feb. 13, 2010, article in the Tampa Tribune. According to the Tribune, Rubio called his then-Senate opponent Charlie Crist ""a believer in man-made global warming"" and said, ""I don't think there's the scientific evidence to justify it."" Asked whether he accepts scientific evidence that the global climate is undergoing change, Rubio responded, ""The climate is always changing. The climate is never static. The question is whether it's caused by man-made activity and whether it justifies economically destructive government regulation."" After trying to locate as many of Rubio’s comments on climate change as we could, we concluded that the Tribune story is indeed the strongest evidence OFA can use to support its labeling of Rubio as a ""climate change denier."" Rubio’s language to the Tribune is pretty clear: He doesn’t think there’s sufficient scientific evidence to support the claim that the climate is changing due to human factors. However, on other occasions -- both before and after the Tribune interview -- Rubio has offered somewhat more nuanced opinions on the topic. Initially, when he was speaker of the Florida House, Rubio seemed to tacitly support the idea that the earth’s temperatures were rising, even as he sometimes differed with environmentalists over specific policy options. While Rubio was speaker in 2008, the House unanimously passed a law ordering the state Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules for companies to limit their emissions of carbon dioxide, a pollutant that scientists say may be contributing to global warming. In a 2007 speech to fellow legislators, Rubio urged his state to become a Silicon Valley of the new energy-technology economy. ""Global warming, dependence on foreign sources of fuel, and capitalism have come together to create opportunities for us that were unimaginable just a few short years ago,"" he said. ""Today, Florida has the opportunity to pursue bold energy policies, not just because they’re good for our environment, but because people can actually make money doing it. This nation and ultimately the world is headed toward emission caps and energy diversification."" By phrasing it this way, without any effort to question the scientific underpinnings of global warming, Rubio suggested that he tacitly supported the science behind global warming. He made the same implication when he wrote in a 2007 Miami Herald op-ed, ""Whether motivated by global warming or geopolitics, there is widespread support for diversifying our energy portfolio and becoming more efficient in our use of energy."" By Dec. 10, 2009, Rubio was openly hedging his position on climate change science. Confronted with accusations that he had flip-flopped on climate change, Rubio told the Miami Herald, ""I'm not a scientist. I'm not qualified to make that decision. There's a significant scientific dispute about that.'' Rubio’s next flurry of comments on climate change came in 2013, after he had become a leading figure in the national GOP. Here are Rubio’s recent comments: • BuzzFeed interview, Feb. 5, 2013: In a video interview with the website BuzzFeed, Rubio said, ""The United States is a country, not a planet. On the other hand, if we unilaterally impose these sorts of things on our economy, you could have a devastating impact on economics. ... There has to be a cost-benefit analysis to every one of these principles people are pushing on. … The climate’s always changing -- that’s not the fundamental question. The fundamental question is whether man-made activity is what’s contributing most to it. I know people said there’s a significant scientific consensus on that issue, but I’ve actually seen reasonable debate on that principle."" • Republican response to the State of the Union address, Feb. 12, 2013. Responding to Obama’s speech, Rubio said, ""When we point out that no matter how many job-killing laws we pass, our government can’t control the weather – he accuses us of wanting dirty water and dirty air."" • Fox and Friends interview, Feb. 13, 2013. The day after his response to the State of the Union address, Rubio said, ""The government can’t change the weather. I said that in the speech. We can pass a bunch of laws that will destroy our economy, but it isn’t going to change the weather. Because, for example, there are other countries that are polluting in the atmosphere much greater than we are at this point -- China, India, all these countries that are still growing. They’re not going to stop doing what they’re doing. America is a country, it’s not a planet. So we can pass a bunch of laws or executive orders that will do nothing to change the climate or the weather but will devastate our economy -- devastate it."" • Statement on his Senate Web page, posted June 25, 2013: In response to a speech in which Obama outlined a series of measures on climate change that he could accomplish by executive order, Rubio said: ""This time, President Obama is discarding the Constitution and free enterprise system in the name of a job-killing environmental agenda. We must do everything we can to stand in his way."" In these comments, Rubio expressed strong opposition to Obama’s climate change policies, particularly on the grounds that the benefits would not exceed the costs. And he seemed to exude skepticism that climate change was an urgent policy concern, as well as the sentiment that human actions cannot change something as massive as the weather. Still, in these comments, Rubio never explicitly denied the science behind climate change, as he did three years earlier in the Tribune interview. In fact, in the BuzzFeed conversation, Rubio conceded that ""I’ve actually seen reasonable debate on that principle."" Someone who is a ""denier"" does not typically concede that his opponents may have a ""reasonable"" point. Our ruling Organizing for Action said that Rubio ""refuses to accept the basic science"" on climate change and is ""a climate change denier."" Rubio’s 2010 comments to the Tampa Tribune -- when he said, ""I don't think there's the scientific evidence to justify it"" -- represent the clearest evidence in support of the group’s charge. In that comment, Rubio does sound like he is denying the existence of science that supports the climate change hypothesis. Since then -- including on four separate occasions this year -- Rubio has expressed opposition to climate change policies while speaking more cautiously about the science that proves climate change is happening. On one of those occasions in February, he even conceded that he’s seen ""reasonable debate"" about the question. But in none of those instances did Rubio walk back his 2010 remarks, even though he had several opportunities to do so.
