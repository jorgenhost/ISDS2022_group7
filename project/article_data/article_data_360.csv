No, 13,506 Marines have not volunteered for White House duty since Trump’s inauguration
","An image of First Lady Melania Trump escorted by a Marine is circulating social media and comes with an oddly specific assertion. The post, shared on April 3, says: ""13,506 Marines have applied for White House duty since the inauguration of President Trump. In the previous eight years, no Marines volunteered for this duty, they had to be ‘assigned.’ Speaks volumes."" The photo post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim, which started circulating online shortly after Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, is inaccurate. The post contains no sources or citations, and its specifics, particularly the 13,506 number, appears to be made up. Service members in the U.S. Marine Corps do not typically volunteer for White House guard positions, but are assigned from a pool of candidates deemed eligible, a Marines spokesperson told PolitiFact. ""Marines serving in White House duty are generally not volunteers and are assigned from the eligible population through the Marine Corps' routine manpower processes,"" Capt. Karoline Foote, Marine Corps Communication Strategy & Operations Officer wrote in an email. ""Most Marines who serve at the White House are assigned to the position based on the needs of the Marine Corps and after a lengthy and detailed screening process."" A small number of positions, Capt. Foote told us, are filled by noncommissioned officers, who are also screened and vetted thoroughly. She explained these volunteers number in the dozens – not the tens of thousands, as the post claims. The main post for White House Marine sentries is standing outside the door of the West Wing whenever the president is working. Four work at a time in shifts of 30 minutes on, 30 minutes off. A Facebook post showed a photo of Melania Trump escorted by a Marine and claims that over 13,000 Marines have applied for White House duty since Trump’s inauguration and that  zero did so when Obama was president. The strangely specific claim appears to be fabricated, contains no sourcing and does not line up with the actual process in which Marine sentries are assigned to the White House.

Obama never said, ‘The American dream is to be Donald Trump’
","In today’s political climate, it feels as if President Donald Trump and President Barack Obama have been antagonists forever. So when a quote comes along of one allegedly praising the other, it raises eyebrows. That’s what’s roaming around social media in a recently shared Facebook post that claims in 1991 Obama said that ""the American dream is to be Donald Trump."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So did Obama say this? No, not exactly. Obama did not literally say (or write) that the ""American dream is to be Donald Trump,"" but he did refer to Trump in a Harvard paper as an example of American success. The tone, however, wasn’t entirely positive. In April 1991, just before Obama was about to graduate from Harvard Law School, he and schoolmate Robert Fisher co-authored a paper called ""Race and Rights Rhetoric."" An excerpt from the unpublished paper was unearthed in the 2017 Obama biography ""Rising Star: The Making of Barack Obama"" by David Garrow: Here is the book’s excerpt. For purposes of this fact-check, we have bolded portions of the quote: ""(Americans have) a continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility, values that extend far beyond the issue of race in the American mind. The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American—I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don't make it, my children will. (But) those of us on the political left (often forget) the degree to which coalition and consensus-building among the American electorate has necessarily precede any major federal program to reform or restructure America’s economic and political landscape."" According to Garrow (on page 451 in his book), the paper raises the argument that discussing minority rights as if they are ""universal"" rights may be counterproductive and that a pragmatic shift toward the ""language of opportunity"" would serve African-Americans better. Garrow writes, and quotes the Harvard paper (direct quotes from Obama’s paper are bolded again for our purposes): ""‘This chapter evaluates the utility of rights rhetoric … as a vehicle for black liberation,’ because the authors believed that such a focus ‘has impeded, rather than facilitated’ the achievement of ‘black empowerment.’ They observed that ‘it has become increasingly apparent that the strategies rooted in the Sixties have not led blacks to the promised land of genuine political, economic and social equality,’ because once that decade was in the past, ‘political mobilization … ground to a halt as blacks became increasingly reliant on lawyers and professional civil rights leaders and organizations with only minimal institutional presence in local communities.’ Garrow explains that the two friends had written a pragmatic call that realism should trump idealism, and that Fisher recalled how he and Obama had each ""intensely edited all parts of the documents, (for it) was very much a product of both our minds."" After Gallow’s book was released, news outlets picked up on the Trump passage, and while most clarified the context of the words and provided the full excerpt in the body of the articles, the headlines of those stories remain misleading. A Facebook post claims in 1991 Obama said that ""the American dream is to be Donald Trump."" Obama did mention Trump in a Harvard paper that he co-wrote with a friend. But the passage says ""I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don't make it, my children will,"" referring to Trump as an example of Americans’ expectations that they will be financially secure in the future. So, yes Obama did refer to Trump as a financially stable person, but he never said or wrote the words that are being attributed to him on social media. The quote is inaccurate, exaggerated and taken out of context. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C14B1C0>],/factchecks/2019/apr/08/facebook-posts/obama-never-said-american-dream-be-donald-trump/

Have more Florida felons registered as Republicans since Amendment 4 took effect?
","As President Donald Trump builds the Republican Party’s coalition before the 2020 election, his son-in-law Jared Kushner tossed out a surprising statistic about a group of people who he said leans right: felons in Florida. ""In Florida they passed a law where former felons can now vote. We've had more ex-felons register as Republicans than Democrats,"" Kushner told Laura Ingraham on Fox News April 1. Ingraham interjected: ""Wait, whoa, whoa. You've had more felons, ex-felons register as Republicans than Democrats?"" Kushner replied: ""That's the data that I've seen. I think that will surprise a lot of people when they see the new coalition that President Trump is building for what the Republican Party has the potential to be."" So are former felons rushing to join Trump’s party in Florida? We found no statewide data to support Kushner’s conclusion that more ex-felons have registered as Republicans since a new law took effect. At this point in time, his comment isn’t more than wishful thinking. We contacted the White House to ask for Kushner’s data and did not get a reply. In November, voters approved Amendment 4, which restored voting rights of Floridians with felony convictions after they complete their sentence. It does not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses. The Legislature has been debating how to define what it means to complete sentences, while advocates say it requires no further legislation. Regardless of that battle, Amendment 4 took effect Jan. 8, and some ex-felons have registered to vote. We interviewed election officials and professors who study voting, as well as advocates for Amendment 4. No one could point to any statewide data showing the partisan breakdown of newly registered ex-felons. Florida’s voter registration application asks applicants to check a box stating: ""I affirm that I am not a convicted felon, or if I am, my right to vote has been restored."" But on the form there is no way to separate those whose rights have been restored from those who were never felons. A spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Elections told us that it doesn’t have partisan voter registration data for ex-felons. That leaves us with anecdotal reports that may not be statistically representative. University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith said that he and his students identified 61 Floridians who identified themselves in media reports in January as ""returning citizens"" -- felons who had regained the right to vote. They were able to find 39 who made it on to Florida’s voter registration list by Feb. 1. He warned that it wasn’t a representative sample, but here’s what they found: Of those 39 individuals, 25 are Democrats, 10 are no party affiliation, and four are Republicans. A few of the experts we interviewed wondered if Kushner was referring to an NBC report in February about felon voter registration. A graphic in that report was titled ""Florida former felon voting"" and said ""new registrations, top 10 counties."" The story said: ""Between December and January, Democrats saw a net gain of 711 new registrations in the 10 largest counties in Florida. Republicans actually saw a slightly larger gain in that time in those counties, an increase of 717 registrations."" So that graphic showed the GOP had a 6-voter registration edge. However,  the data appears to reflect all registrations in 10 counties, not just felons. Although there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, and the majority of black voters are Democrats, in sheer numbers more whites could regain the right to vote in Florida. The national Sentencing Project found in 2016 that of the 1.5 million ex-felons in Florida who could not vote, about 28 percent were black. Of the 72 percent who were not black, most were white, and a modest number were Latinos. Michael Morse, a JD candidate at Yale Law School and a PhD candidate in Harvard’s department of government, said he plans to analyze voter registration and conviction data to determine the partisan makeup of the newly registered ex-felons. ""Although I’m working on it, it’s not possible to evaluate Kushner’s claim yet,"" he said. Kushner’s claim depends largely on the racial breakdown of these early registrants, said Morse, who along with University of Pennsylvania professor Marc Meredith looked at the political behavior of the 150,000 ex-felons restored by Gov. Charlie Crist about a decade ago. They wrote about their findings in a November article for Vox. They found that black ex-felons were extremely supportive of the Democratic Party, but all other ex-felons in the state were slightly more supportive of Republicans. In total, they found about 19,500 ex-felons whose rights were restored under Crist voted in 2016 -- about 58 percent were registered Democrats (largely black), 24 percent were registered Republicans (largely nonblack) and the rest registered with neither party. The researchers extrapolated that if all ex-felons could have voted in in 2016, Democrats would have gained a net of 48,000 votes. Trump won the state by more than double that margin. ""Clearly there is a preference for the Democratic party, but it’s not an immense preference, particularly in voting because of low turnout,"" among felons, he said. However, the same partisan preferences may not apply to the Amendment 4 population, Morse said. Among all Crist ex-felons who had their rights automatically restored under Crist, 38 percent were black. Among all ex-felons in the state as estimated by the Sentencing Project, only 28 percent are black. Also, no one yet knows the outcome of the battle in the state Legislature about defining fines and fees that must be paid as part of completing their sentence before register to vote. ""In short, everything is up in the air,"" he said. ""It’s not yet clear who will benefit from Amendment 4 and what the demographics of that population will be."" Kushner said Florida ""passed a law where former felons can now vote. We've had more ex-felons register as Republicans than Democrats."" The state said it did not have data showing a partisan breakdown of ex-felons who registered to vote since Amendment 4 took effect Jan. 8. Past research shows that black ex-felons heavily lean toward the Democratic Party while nonblack voters lean, but less heavily, to the Republican side, with many also choosing no party affiliation. We rate statements based on available data, and so far there isn’t any to backup Kushner’s statement. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C17EA40>],/factchecks/2019/apr/08/jared-kushner/have-more-florida-felons-registered-republicans/

Democrats push misleading tweet on Donald Trump, asylum seekers
","Democratic presidential candidates, liberal pundits and other critics of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies amplified a misleading tweet claiming that Trump said asylum seekers are ""animals"" and not people. Here’s what they left out in the process: the fact that Trump wasn’t clearly talking about asylum seekers. His ""animals"" comment came nearly a year ago during a White House discussion on MS-13 gang members. It started April 5, when the Twitter account @markmobility, owned by a man named Mark Elliott, tweeted a 47-second video of Trump in which he talks about people coming into the United States and says the word ""animals."" The since-deleted tweet said of the video: ""[email protected] on people asking for asylum ‘These aren't people. These are animals’."" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who is running for president in the 2020 election, shared the video on her Twitter account the next day, adding, ""Racist language like this has led to violence throughout the world’s history. No human being is an animal. We have to be better than this."" Racist language like this has led to violence throughout the world’s history. No human being is an animal. We have to be better than this.https://t.co/TQ0MhJFGtq   South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, also bidding for the White House, did not post the video on his Twitter account; but on April 6 tweeted, ""You do not refer to human beings as animals. You just don’t."" Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Democratic lawmakers, pundits, and activists also shared the video tweet as an example of Trump dehumanizing asylum seekers. Now, Trump’s recent comments about asylum-seekers have been tough. He has said ""the asylum program is a scam"" and that the administration’s new position is ""the system is full, can’t take you anymore."" Most people arriving at the border are families and unaccompanied children, but Trump claims some asylum seekers are ""some of the roughest people you’ve ever seen, people that look like they should be fighting for the (Ultimate Fighting Championship)."" Still, the Democrats left out important context in their attacks on this video clip of Trump speaking last year. Trump made the ""animals"" remark in May 2018 during an immigration roundtable discussion on so-called sanctuary cities, MS-13 gang members, and other policies around the country regarding the detention of immigrants. Cabinet members, California sheriffs and other elected officials attended the meeting. Trump’s comment came in response to Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims, who was telling the president how federal laws and California laws affected her job. Here’s the key part of their exchange, with Trump’s quote in bold for emphasis: Mims: ""So here we are, stuck in the middle, trying to decide. We have federal law, we have state law. And that's why I welcomed Attorney General Sessions's lawsuit, because that will provide us the clarity that we need and direction that we need. What do we do? Because here we are. ""And I appreciated Mr. Homan and ICE. We had a great relationship; we still do. But now ICE is the only law enforcement agency that cannot use our databases to find the bad guys. They cannot come in and talk to people in our jail, unless they reach a certain threshold. They can't do all kinds of things that other law enforcement agencies can do. And it's really put us in a very bad position."" Trump: ""It's a disgrace. Okay? It's a disgrace."" Mims: ""It's a disgrace."" Trump: ""And we're suing on that, and we're working hard, and I think it will all come together, because people want it to come together. It's so ridiculous. The concept that we're even talking about is ridiculous. We'll take care of it, Margaret. We'll win."" Mims: ""Thank you. There could be an MS-13 gang member I know about — if they don't reach a certain threshold, I cannot tell ICE about it."" Trump: ""We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — and we're stopping a lot of them — but we're taking people out of the country. You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people. These are animals. And we're taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that's never happened before. And because of the weak laws, they come in fast, we get them, we release them, we get them again, we bring them out. It's crazy. ""The dumbest laws, as I said before, the dumbest laws on immigration in the world. So we're going to take care of it, Margaret. We'll get it done."" The video clip captured in @markmobility’s tweet (which had garnered more than 14,000 retweets and 23,000 likes before it was taken down) did not include the preceding comment from the sheriff about MS-13 gang members, making it look like Trump was broadly referring to immigrants. Since Trump did not specifically mention MS-13 in the same breath, some Democrats at the time interpreted him as saying all immigrants are animals. This led to a spat between Trump and Nancy Pelosi, now U.S. House speaker, in which Trump falsely said she came out ""in support of MS-13"" when she condemned his comments. PolitiFact reached out to @markmobility on Twitter on April 8, saying we were fact-checking his tweet and requesting his contact information so we could send a query. The biography section of his Twitter page does not identify his occupation or other contact information (it links to the New York Times). We separately sent a detailed email and voicemail to a Mark Elliott, who appears to be the person behind @markmobility. We did not hear back. Less than an hour after our voicemail and email noting the context of Trump’s comment, @markmobility deleted the April 5 tweet and posted a new clarifying tweet. ""I have learned that Trump's comments were in response to a specific question about MS-13 members and not about asylum seekers more broadly. I have chosen to delete the tweet, but am copying it here. My apologies for not being more accurate,"" @markmobility’s tweet said. I have learned that Trump's comments were in response to a specific question about MS-13 members and not about asylum seekers more broadly. I have chosen to delete the tweet, but am copying it here. My apologies for not being more accurate. pic.twitter.com/oDTdNvzSdq A viral Twitter post said Trump said asylum seekers ""aren't people. These are animals."" The tweet left out important context. Trump did refer to some people as ""animals,"" but that was during an exchange about MS-13 gang members. His comment wasn’t directly about asylum seekers.

Donald Trump's ridiculous link between cancer, wind turbines
","""Idiotic,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley. ""It’s ridiculous,"" said Sen. Joni Ernst. Iowa’s two Republican senators were talking about President Donald Trump’s comment that windmills cause cancer. Trump made the off-hand remark at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee. As he often does, Trump attacked wind power as an energy source. (We checked his recent Mostly False claim that it leaves electric grids at the mercy of the wind.) ""If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75 percent in value,"" Trump told his fellow Republicans April 2.  ""And they say the noise causes cancer."" We asked the White House for evidence that wind turbine noise causes cancer. We didn’t hear back. The health impact of wind turbines has been a topic of much conjecture. The Australian parliament took the question seriously enough to form a Select Committee on Wind Turbines. The group was sympathetic to personal reports of discomfort, and the list of ailments it heard was long: ""tinnitus, raised blood pressure, heart palpitations, tachycardia, stress, anxiety, vertigo, dizziness,"" and more. But no one complained of cancer. In its final 2015 report, the committee said more evidence was needed to establish a link to any illness. Meanwhile, the Australian Medical Association said, ""The available Australian and international evidence does not support the view that the infrasound or low frequency sound generated by wind farms, as they are currently regulated in Australia, causes adverse health effects on populations residing in their vicinity. "" A 2014 review in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine of scientific studies found that ""epidemiological studies have shown associations between living near wind turbines and annoyance.""  And that ""annoyance seems more strongly related to individual characteristics than noise from turbines."" So annoyance, yes. Cancer? No. Trump’s words were particularly unwelcome in Iowa. The Hawkeye State gets nearly 40 percent of its electric power from wind — more than any other state. A couple of days after Trump spoke, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds kicked off an initiative to expand wind turbines in her state. Reynolds dodged questions about Trump’s statement, saying it wasn’t her place to comment. But Sen. Ernst had no reservations. ""It’s ridiculous,"" she said April 4 (listen at 2:20). ""Wind energy is just a tremendous asset for the state of Iowa. We are so fortunate to have so much of our electric drawn from a clean power source."" Trump said windmill noise causes cancer. The White House provided no evidence. No study supports the statement.

No, John F. Kennedy Jr. didn’t tout a Donald Trump presidency in George magazine
","Conspiracy theories about the assassination of former president John F. Kennedy abound, but the 2010s have ushered in a new wave of claims, like one that President Donald Trump says a daily prayer to the old commander-in-chief. Other allegations center on Kennedy’s son, John F. Kennedy Jr. He died in a plane crash in July 1999. Depending on the source, though, he either faked his death or was killed to clear Hillary Clinton’s political path. And — according to an April 1 Facebook post — he once praised Trump as a formidable presidential candidate. ""If my dear friend Donald Trump ever decided to sacrifice his fabulous billionaire lifestyle to become president he would be an unstoppable force for ultimate justice that Democrats and Republicans alike would celebrate,"" reads the text above a photo of Trump and Kennedy posted to Facebook on April 1. The quote is attributed to Kennedy and includes a citation: George magazine, June 1999. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s probably because Kennedy never said that in that issue of George, or ever, as far as we can tell. Liam Neeson appeared on the cover that month, and the issue includes stories featuring the actor, Ariana Huffington and tobacco lawyers. Ann Coulter wrote a column about Washington D.C.’s dating scene. But Trump isn’t mentioned in the magazine’s pages. Kennedy was the president and editor-in-chief of George, and he wrote an editor’s letter that skips from Star Wars to then-Sen. John McCain to campaign finance reform. We wondered if Kennedy made the statement about Trump elsewhere, but we couldn’t find it when we looked for news coverage online. The closest match was a November 2016 New York Post story that says Kennedy’s former business partner, Michael Berman, recalled a moment in 1996 when Kennedy flew a group of advertisers to Mar-a-Lago. According to the story: ""As frequently happened to Kennedy at his events, talk soon turned to whether he could envision himself running for president. Trying to deflect the presidential chatter, Kennedy noted that the Trump estate was far more glamorous than a Kennedy family compound a few miles away. ‘I think you should be asking those questions of Donald,' Kennedy said, according to Berman. ‘He’d clearly have the most extravagant winter White House.’"" We also searched the Nexis database of U.S. publications for any mentions of John F. Kennedy Jr. and Donald Trump in June 1999. There were two results. The first, a June 24 New York Post story comprised of smaller news items, mentions both men but not in connection to one another. The second, a similar June 9 New York Daily News story, also mentions both, but not together. ""John F. Kennedy Jr. is due to spend a few months in a cast after breaking his ankle on Martha’s Vineyard,"" the piece says. ""Friends say he is going slightly stir-crazy."" Our ruling Kennedy and Trump were not strangers. The photo that appears in the Facebook post is authentic, a shot from March 1999, when the two men watched a New York Knicks game. And while an associate of Kennedy’s said that he once complimented Mar-a-Lago and punted questions about a presidential run to Trump, Kennedy didn’t make the fawning statement the Facebook post claims, nor did he say it in his June 1999 magazine.

No, gun control regulation in Nazi Germany did not help advance the Holocaust
","On March 13, 2018, gun control activists laid 7,000 pairs of shoes on the lawn outside the Capitol in D.C. to represent the victims of gun violence since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. Soon after, gun-supporting social media users created an image meme to compare it to Nazi Germany. The viral image shows the shoes on the Capitol lawn along with the words, ""shoes left by supporters of gun control, 2018."" Below that is a photo of a pile of thousands of shoes belonging to concentration camp victims, with a caption beside it that says ""shoes left by victims of gun control, Germany 1945."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The images are authentic and not altered – both are from the time and places that the captions designate (the concentration camp image is from a facility in Dachau, Germany) – but the message that gun control measures helped cause the deaths of Holocaust victims is wrong. Let's make something clear: The Nazis did deny guns specifically to Jews. But, given the size of their forces and their methods of confiscation and extermination, this is a trivial factor. The notion that it would have made any difference is unreasonable. PolitiFact previously looked into the theory when Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson linked the Holocaust with U.S. gun control laws when he was running for president in 2015. We rated that claim False. So how is it false? Let us explain. First, strict German gun regulation was in place before Hitler rose to power and he later oversaw gun laws that loosened many firearm restrictions. According to a 2004 analysis by Bernard Harcourt, a professor at Columbia University, after the Germany’s defeat in World War I, the Weimar Republic, the government that preceded Hitler’s, passed very stringent gun laws that essentially banned all gun ownership in an attempt to both stabilize the country and to comply with the Treaty of Versailles of 1919. By the time the Nazi Party came around in the early 1930s, a 1928 gun registration law had replaced the total ban and, instead, created a permit system to own and sell firearms and ammunition. But Dagmar Ellerbrock, an expert on German gun policies at the Dresden Technical University in Germany, told PolitiFact in 2015 that the order was followed ""quite rarely, so that largely, only newly bought weapons became registered. At that time, most men, and many women, still owned the weapons they acquired before or during the first World War."" The Nazis used the records to confiscate guns from their enemies, but Ellerbrock also said the files included very few of the firearms in circulation and that many Jewish people and others still managed to stash away weapons into the late 1930s. In 1938, the Nazis adopted the German Weapons Act, which ""deregulated the acquisition and transfer of rifles and shotguns as well as ammunition,"" Harcourt wrote. Under this law, gun restrictions applied only to handguns, permits were extended from one year to three years, and the legal age of purchase was lowered from 20 to 18. Moreover, many more categories of people, including holders of annual hunting permits, government workers and members of the NSDAP (the National Socialist German Workers' Party), were no longer subject to gun ownership restrictions. Regulations were introduced, though, to impose limits on Jews. On Nov. 11, 1938, the Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons was issued. Under it, Jews living under the Third Reich were forbidden to own or possess any form of weapons, including truncheons, knives, firearms and ammunition. But the Nazis had already been raiding Jewish homes by then, and the Anti-Defamation League, an organization founded to fight anti-Semitism, explained in 2013 that ""the small number of personal firearms in the hands of the small number of Germany’s Jews (about 214,000) remaining in Germany in 1938 could in no way have stopped the totalitarian power of the Nazi German state."" Omer Bartov, a historian at Brown University who studies the Third Reich, told Salon in 2013 that even if they had weapons, Jews probably wouldn’t have had much success fighting back: ""Just imagine the Jews of Germany exercising the right to bear arms and fighting the SA, SS and the Wehrmacht. The (Russian) Red Army lost 7 million men fighting the Wehrmacht, despite its tanks and planes and artillery. The Jews with pistols and shotguns would have done better?"" Some supporters of the theory point to the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising as evidence that Jews with guns were successful in resisting Nazis. But, in that uprising, about 7,000 Jews died and 50,000 were sent off to concentration camps. Though the number of German losses from the uprising is in dispute -- ranging from estimates of less than 20 to a several hundred -- even the highest ranges come to just a fraction of the number of Jews who died. Second, experts and historians have widely criticized the argument, calling it problematic, dubious and preposterous.   In the same 2013 statement, the Anti-Defamation League said the comparison of U.S. gun laws to the Holocaust inappropriate and offensive. ""We know that the national debate over gun control is one of the most divisive issues in the land, and while Americans are entitled to have strong opinions, there is also language that is inappropriate and offensive in any such discussion,"" said Abraham H. Foxman, Holocaust survivor and ADL’S national director at the time. ""The idea that supporters of gun control are doing something akin to what Hitler’s Germany did to strip citizens of guns in the run-up to the Second World War is historically inaccurate and offensive, especially to Holocaust survivors and their families."" Harcourt also told PolitiFact the suggestion is not a tenable claim. ""There’s no empirical evidence for it,"" he wrote in an email. ""Moreover, Hitler was in favor of gun possession, and relaxed gun control laws in Germany for everyone, except Jews of course. It makes no sense to compare Hitler to the present situation in the US because all of Hitler's actions can only be interpreted through the lens of the final solution, which is not relevant here in the US."" On social media, images showing the shoes of victims of gun violence in present-day America and those of Holocaust victims suggest that gun control in Nazi Germany exacerbated the Holocaust and that the genocide could have been lessened or avoided if victims had been armed. This theory has been repeatedly debunked and refuted. German citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the Nazis, but enjoyed looser gun restrictions than in previous years. There was no lack of guns in the country, and if German citizens had wanted to use guns to revolt against the Nazis they could have, but they didn’t. As well, comparing a dictator’s regime that treated weapon possession according to racial identity to democratic procedures of gun regulations is irresponsible. This claim is False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976660C0>],/factchecks/2019/apr/08/viral-image/no-gun-control-regulation-nazi-germany-did-not-hel/

","The Texas Senate passed a resolution on April 2 that declared an emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border and called on Congress to fully fund border security efforts The resolution, filed by Republican Sen. Paul Bettencourt from Houston, was adopted in a party-line vote after more than two hours of debate. During discussion about the proposal, Bettencourt stressed the urgency of the resolution, noting that the Senate had to respond quickly to what he described as a worsening situation at the border. ""194,000 criminal aliens booked into Texas jails from 2011-2019 were charged with more than 299,000 criminal offenses,"" the resolution reads. Bettencourt’s numbers come from state data about people here illegally and they're accurate. But, experts say the figures take things out of context and don’t paint an accurate picture of any possible correlation between immigration status and criminal activity. Texas DPS data shows charges, convictions Cristie Ingram, a staffer for Bettencourt, said the data in the resolution came from the Texas Department of Public Safety, which tracks crime statistics related to people in the country illegally. The latest data on the agency’s website shows that between June 1, 2011, and March 31, 2019, there were 194,000 people classified as ""illegal aliens"" booked into local Texas jails. In total, those 194,000 people were charged with ""more than 303,000 criminal offenses"" that have resulted in ""over 123,000 convictions"" for homicide, assault, burglary and other charges. Ingram said Bettencourt and his staff ""stand behind the data"" and used numbers from the entire eight-year period because that is the time period available from the state. She did not return a request for comment asking why the resolution looks at charges in criminal cases instead of convictions. The numbers in Bettencourt’s resolution are the same as those published by the state, but experts said the implication in the resolution that people here illegally commit a disproportionate number of crimes or increase the crime rate is misleading. Graham Ousey, a sociology professor at the College of William and Mary who studies criminology, said counting the total criminal charges filed against people here illegally does not offer an accurate characterization of that community of people as a whole. He said a major flaw in the state’s data is the fact that the numbers only reflect criminal offenses recorded for individuals who are already in jail. ""If you were to go to any prison system and you selected 194,000 people across eight years of time and add up all of those offenses, you’re likely to get pretty high numbers,"" Ousey said. ""You’re self-selecting on a population that is criminal in their behavior."" He noted that past criminology research has found that a small percentage of the population is responsible for ""a disproportionate share of crimes committed."" ""A report like this, or a study that selects a sample that is (incarcerated), they’re tapping into that higher crime, smaller subset,"" he said. ""So of course the offenses that would show up would be greater in number."" But these numbers are trying to meld two things together that aren’t necessarily related — criminal activity and immigration status. ""It’s like saying, ‘Hey there’s all these crimes being committed by people who have been arrested,’ and then attaching that or making a link to criminal aliens,"" Ousey added. ""It’s clearly being cherry picked in a way that’s trying to create an association between someone’s immigrant status and their behavior."" The DPS website notes that the information it publishes does not ""attempt to allege that foreign nationals in the country illegally commit more crimes than other groups."" ""It simply identifies thousands of crimes that should not have occurred and thousands of victims that should not have been victimized because the perpetrator should not be here,"" it reads. Ousey said it’s true that, ""if an offender and a victim aren’t in the same space at the same time, crime doesn’t occur,"" but removing that one offender (or population group) would not end crime. ""The only way to get rid of crime all together is to get rid of all of the people,"" he said. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed and said the state’s argument is ""statistically nonsensical."" ""What matters is not the total number of crimes, but the crime rate,"" he said. ""That tells you how threatened you are by criminals."" Crime rate vs. totals Nowrasteh conducted research on arrest and conviction rates for people here illegally and native-born Americans using data from 2015, the most recent and complete information available at the time of his study. He found that immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the United States and that ""illegal immigrants have lower incarceration rates nationwide and in the state of Texas relative to native-born Americans."" He also found that in Texas, ""illegal immigrants had a criminal conviction rate 50 percent below that of native-born Americans."" Nowrasteh’s researched looked at these rates within each subpopulation, meaning he looked at things like rate of homicide convictions among unauthorized immigrants and separately among legal immigrants and native-born Americans. Michael Light, a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said totals for charges or convictions, like the number offered in Bettencourt’s resolution, are fine to consider, but they don’t offer much insight into overall safety or behavior. ""Imagine I were to claim that women are less violent than men, which is as close to a social fact that we have in criminology,"" he said in an email. ""And one were to reply saying that this is not true because in 2015 over 78,000 women were arrested for violent crimes, and nearly 1,000 were arrested for homicide according to FBI records. Those statistics in no way contradict the original statement that men tend to be more violent."" Light said if data showed that the rate of violent crime is higher among men than women, eliminating women would mean that the violent crime rate for the entire population would be the violent crime rate among men. ""In other words, our chance of being violently victimized would be substantially higher were the population of women removed, even though they have committed tens of thousands of offenses,"" he said. ""The same logic holds for removing immigrants."" Light said research has shown low rates of crime within immigrant communities, compared to native-born Americans, and that areas with high migrant populations tend to have lower overall crime rates than those with smaller immigrant populations. ""Those statements are not contradicted by stating the number of offenses committed by immigrants,"" he said. Our rating Bettencourt’s resolution declaring a crisis at the border reads, ""194,000 criminal aliens booked into Texas jails from 2011-2019 were charged with more than 299,000 criminal offenses."" These numbers come from data published by DPS. His figures are right, but they don't tell the whole story. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097198D00>],/factchecks/2019/apr/08/paul-bettencourt/texas-legislation-missing-important-info-about-cri/

Fact-checking a GOP talking point on walls and border apprehensions
","Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., took to Twitter earlier this year to discuss the debate over erecting a wall on the U.S-Mexico border. She said that previous barriers built on the southern border have been successful. In the tweet, Capito said, ""Beginning in the early 1990s, we built barriers in 4 sectors at our southern border. Since each was built, those sectors have seen massive drops in apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally. Let’s admit that physical barriers need to be a part of the solution."" A graphic attached to the tweet said there had been decreases of 90 percent in the Tucson sector, 95 percent in the Yuma sector, 95 percent in the San Diego sector, and 95 percent in the El Paso sector. Beginning in the early 1990s, we built barriers in 4 sectors at our southern border. Since each was built, those sectors have seen massive drops in apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally. Let’s admit that physical barriers need to be a part of the solution. pic.twitter.com/obJZzvtlTX Did the barriers in four sectors of the southwestern border result in massive drops in apprehensions? We took a closer look. Tyler Hernandez, Capito’s communication director, pointed to a ""Border Security Metrics Report"" released by the Department of Homeland Security dated May 1, 2018. This report included data back to 2006 but we were able to find additional data going further back at the Customs and Border Protection website. (Meanwhile, the fact-checking site Snopes.com noted that the statistic originated with the Republican National Committee.) Here’s a chart showing the trend lines for border apprehensions -- the typical way to measure illegal immigration into the United States from the southern border -- going back to 1990, the period Capito referenced in her tweet. Broadly speaking, the chart shows a downward trend for apprehensions at the various sectors, interrupted by a spike around 2004 and 2006. This means that for roughly the last 20 years, there has been a downward movement in migrant flows across the border. Tucson fell by 92 percent from its peak in 2000, Yuma fell by 70 percent from its peak in 2005, San Diego fell by 93 percent from ts peak in 1992, and El Paso fell by 89 percent from its peak in 1993. That said, these large declines started between 1992 and 2005 -- before passage of the Secure Fence Act of 2006. The law, which was signed by President George W. Bush, authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain parts of the southern border. That fencing was built over the course of several years after passage of the law, depending on the sector. If you measure the declines between the law took effect in 2006 and 2018, they are still substantial, but not as large as the declines from the pre-2006 peaks. El Paso fell by 74 percent, San Diego by 73 percent, Tucson by 87 percent, and Yuma by 78 percent. Those percentages are all smaller than what Capito tweeted out. It’s also important to note that some border crossings may have shifted from urban areas, where fences were erected, to more rural areas, said Tony Payan, a fellow for Mexico Studies at Rice University. ""Some barriers did go up, primarily along urban areas, like San Diego and El Paso,"" he said. ""But these barriers did not stop undocumented migration at all. They simply funneled it to areas further out from the urban areas."" In fact, the overall apprehension statistics in the southwest border fell less than the statistics for some of the relatively urban sectors Capito cited. Overall, apprehensions at the southwestern border, including areas that Capito didn’t highlight, fell by 76 percent from their peak in 2000 to 2018, and by 63 percent between 2006 and 2018. That’s a less dramatic decline than those seen specifically in El Paso, San Diego and Tucson that Capito cited. So Capito’s chosen sectors are somewhat cherry-picked. Finally, immigration experts say that security measures do not account for all -- or necessarily even most -- of the decline in border-crossing. Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research who has studied border migration for decades, has previously told PolitiFact that he considers the economy the primary factor. The Great Recession, he said, had an immense impact in slowing border crossing. In particular, dwindling prospects of finding a job in sectors such as construction, which traditionally attract a disproportionate number of Latinos, dampened the urge for potential Mexican migrants to undertake a difficult journey. Payan agreed that barriers would not have been the only factor. ""Although tougher enforcement and barriers did help,"" Payan said, ""other factors played a role, including Mexico's changing demographics, and rising middle class, and U.S. deployment of tougher checks, such as E-Verify,"" an electronic employment verification system. ""Everything helps, but it is absolutely misleading to attribute the decrease in undocumented crossings to barriers, particularly that early,"" Payan said. Capito's office reiterated to PolitiFact that her tweet said that ""physical barriers need to be a part of the solution,"" rather than the only part. Capito said, ""Beginning in the early 1990s, we built barriers in 4 sectors at our southern border. Since each was built, those sectors have seen massive drops in apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally,"" including 90 percent to 95 percent decreases in the Tucson, Yuma, San Diego and El Paso sectors.  The four sectors she cited fell substantially after hitting peaks in the 1990s and the early 2000s, but not quite as much as she indicated. And the rest of her assertion is questionable. Border apprehension declines started prior to passage of the 2006 law that authorized border fencing. Moreover, while such barriers may have had an impact, other factors, notably the troubled economy after the Great Recession, are often credited with playing a key role in the decline of border apprehensions. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971CCC40>],/factchecks/2019/apr/08/shelley-moore-capito/fact-checking-gop-talking-point-walls-and-border-a/

Does science show that unprescribed buprenorphine saves lives?
","Burlington’s efforts to fight the opioid epidemic have earned the city national attention, with Mayor Miro Weinberger and other officials touting the 50 percent decrease in opioid deaths between 2017 and 2018 in Chittenden County. During Weinberger’s State of the City address Monday, the mayor called on the Legislature to pass H.162, a bill which would make it legal to possess buprenorphine without a prescription. Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George announced in June 2018 that her office would no longer prosecute those arrested for possessing unprescribed buprenorphine. But H.162 has been met with opposition by some who argue that legalizing buprenorphine will increase the supply of an opiate that could still be abused. U.S. Attorney Christina Nolan has said she believes that more people will start using buprenorphine outside of the medical context if it is legalized. Vermont health commissioner has said legalizing the anti-addiction drug would be a good idea in any state, apart from Vermont, where he says opioid addiction treatment is accessible to everyone. Weinberger argued in his state of the city speech that the public health questions are beyond doubt. ""The public health science is clear that the use of of the addiction medicine buprenorphine saves lives whether that use has been prescribed or not,"" he said. So is Weinberger right that the public health science is clear that buprenorphine, whether it has been prescribed or not, saves lives? VTDigger decided to check it out. Olivia LaVecchia, Weinberger’s spokesperson, provided a briefing reviewing the literature on non-prescribed buprenorphine the city has relied on by a team at Johns Hopkins University. The review includes 13 articles, which overwhelmingly found that those using non-prescribed buprenorphine were using it to treat withdrawal symptoms and rarely using it to get high. The studies also found that non-medically prescribed buprenorphine is often used to self-treat opioid addiction For example, one 2013 study of buprenorphine use in Baltimore found that 91% of people who used street-obtained buprenorphine were attempting to manage withdrawal symptoms and only 2% were using it to get high. Use of non-prescribed buprenorphine is also associated with an increased interest in treatment and is associated with the inability to access treatment, the review found. A 2018 study in Rhode Island found that almost 80% of people using diverted buprenorphine were self-treating opioid use disorder or managing withdrawal symptoms. This study also found that using diverted buprenorphine was positively tied to later seeking treatment, which the authors believed showed that unprescribed buprenorphine use illustrated a severe treatment shortage. The mayor’s office also pointed us in the direction of Josh Sharfstein, a vice dean and professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who was a panelist at the city’s Opioid Town Hall in March and has been advising the city on buprenorphine. Sharfstein said devoid of all context, Weinberger’s statement could raise some questions, because buprenorphine use does have risks. But Burlington has a major opioid use problem, Sharfstein said, and studies show that those using unprescribed buprenorphine are using it to stave off withdrawal, not to feel euphoria. Sharfstein said the public health science is clear that use of unprescribed buprenorphine is an indicator for seeking treatment. While visiting Burlington last month, Sharfstein said he spoke to an emergency room doctor at the University of Vermont Medical Center who told him people are showing up in the emergency room asking for buprenorphine after using unprescribed buprenorphine on the street. ""When read in the specific context, I think it’s a reasonable statement, understanding that for the people the mayor is talking about, buprenorphine is an alternative to heroin and fentanyl,"" Sharfstein said. But is the science really clear that unprescribed buprenorphine decreases mortality rates? ""I am not aware of any literature looking at the efficacy of non-prescribed buprenorphine for decreasing mortality in patients with opioid use disorders,"" said Daniel Alford, a professor at the Boston University School of Medicine who has researched treatment of opioid dependence. Sharfstein said that he’s not aware of any studies specifically looking at the use of unprescribed buprenorphine and mortality rates. But he said that because the science is clear that use of unprescribed buprenorphine increases the likelihood of going to treatment, it would follow that going to treatment increases the likelihood of survival. ""There are studies about non-prescription buprenorphine and going into treatment, and studies that going into treatment decreases mortality,"" Sharfstein said. Our ruling Experts say there haven’t been any studies of unprescribed buprenorphine use on mortality rates, so saying the science is clear on that question isn’t a complete slam dunk. But studies suggest that unprescribed buprenorphine use is an indicator for seeking treatment, and getting treatment is proven to increase survival rates. Plus, using buprenorphine does not carry the same risk of overdose death as heroin and fentanyl, which is often the alternative for those with substance use disorder.

No, Chicago isn’t ‘often bailed out’ by Illinois taxpayers
","Illinois was settled from the south up, but the far northern Chicago region has come to dominate and that often frustrates Downstaters. Now, a group of Republican lawmakers say they want to change the dynamic by divorcing the rest of the state from its biggest city. In February, state Rep. Brad Halbrook of Shelbyville, south of Decatur, filed a House resolution that, if passed, would ""urge the United States Congress to take action to declare the City of Chicago the 51st state of the United States of America and separate it from the rest of Illinois."" In trying to make his case, Halbrook’s resolution repeats a well-worn claim about the city getting more than its fair share of state support. ""The City of Chicago is often bailed out by taxpayers in the rest of the State, such as the $221 million bailout for the CPS pension system that was signed into law,"" it reads. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner made a similar claim in 2017 as he and lawmakers battled over a plan to overhaul the way the state funds public schools. Although he eventually signed off on the plan, Rauner argued at the time it contained a ""bailout"" for Chicago Public Schools, in part because it included $221 million to help CPS cover the employer share of its teacher pension costs. We rated Rauner’s claim False, noting the state long subsidized the costs of teacher pensions for every other Illinois school district but Chicago. Halbrook’s resolution goes a step further by contending the state is ""often"" footing the bill to break Chicago out of financial binds at the detriment of Downstate taxpayers. That’s a pretty tall order — and one the facts don’t even come close to backing up. We reached out to Halbrook, but he didn’t point us to any other cases he saw as bailouts beyond the pension help plus other aspects of the state’s school funding law he thinks give Illinois’ largest school district ""extra money."" So we contacted leading experts on the state’s political and economic history to see what they made of his claim. ""It’s clearly not true in any fact-checking [sense],"" said John Jackson, a professor emeritus at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. ""It’s a very popular claim in Downstate Illinois and the further south you go, the more insistent it is."" Jackson, who is also a visiting professor at the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute, co-authored a report last year that belies such claims. He found that Cook County, which is home to both Chicago and 40 percent of the state’s population, gets 90 cents back for every dollar it sends to Springfield. Central Illinois, on the other hand, receives $1.87 for every dollar generated. And the southern region of the state gets back $2.81 for that amount. Yet a majority of Downstate residents think they are getting the short end of the stick in a state dominated politically by Chicagoans, the report stated. Historically, those complaints have sometimes centered on transportation funding, something Jackson’s economic analysis did not include. Decades ago, western Illinoisans dubbed their region ""Forgottonia"" and one foghorn-voiced lawmaker from that region famously roamed statehouse halls bellowing the name of the state transportation director in a comic attempt to draw attention to a demand for more road money. Indeed, one of Halbrook’s co-sponsors raised the claim that Chicago gets a disproportionate share of road repair and construction money. But he did not provide any concrete evidence to back up that assertion and we could find nothing to suggest transportation funding might tip the balance of the distributions outlined in the institute’s report. Moreover, other experts we spoke with described Halbrook’s claim as ""total nonsense"" and dubiously ""grounded in any kind of reality."" One even called it a myth. ""I think it’s very unfortunate that these politicians continue to pander to what amount to myths,"" said Mike Lawrence, a former director of the Paul Simon Institute who served as press secretary and senior policy advisor to Gov. Jim Edgar, a Downstate Republican who led Illinois for most of the 1990s. ""They talk about urban myths, and there may be such a thing as rural myths as well."" ""That doesn’t mean that every dime that goes to Chicago is justified,"" Lawrence added. ""It also doesn’t mean that every dime that goes to Downstate is justified. But overall, the strength of the state, the ability to provide education and other services to people in the state are reliant on all sectors of the state."" Even one of Halbrook’s co-sponsors wouldn’t go so far as to defend the notion that Chicago is regularly receiving state bailouts. ""This was more of a symbolic co-sponsorship for me,"" said state Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer of Jacksonville, the assistant House Republican leader. ""I didn’t write it. If I had written it, I probably would have written it a little differently because I do believe facts and reality are important."" Davidsmeyer, however, said he thinks lawmakers need to have a serious conversation about the ""Chicago-style policies that keep getting pushed down on the rest of the state."" Indeed, the resolution goes on to highlight the very different stances many Chicago and Downstate voters take on hot-button issues such as abortion, immigration and gun regulation, none of which have anything to do with economics or bailouts. Halbrook’s resolution claims that ""the City of Chicago is often bailed out by taxpayers in the rest of the State,"" pointing to the funding CPS received in 2017 to help cover its pension costs. We previously rated a similar claim False because the measure only provided CPS with financial support the state had long offered to all other districts in the state except Chicago. Halbrook also upped the ante by contending the money for CPS wasn’t an isolated incident, with the state ""often"" throwing a lifeline to Chicago taxpayers at the expense of those Downstate. He offered no evidence, however, and academic research has found the opposite is true. Experts we spoke with summed up the claim as a ""myth,"" ""clearly not true,"" and ""total nonsense.""

State GOP's claim about statewide recount hits target
","The race between appeals court judges Brian Hagedorn and Lisa Neubauer for a Supreme Court seat started out rather low-key, as some conservative groups that usually spend in high court races did not do so for Hagedorn. But the race heated up in the week leading up to the April 2, 2019 election, with an arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee running ads to help Hagedorn. The result: One of the closest Supreme Court races in Wisconsin history. After the polls closed, Hagedorn held a narrow lead and declared victory. Based on unofficial results, Hagedorn led by about 6,000 votes, or half a percentage point. As of April 5, 2019, Neubauer had not conceded and had not said whether she will seek a recount. Meanwhile, the day after the election, the Republican Party of Wisconsin was tweeting congratulatory messages on Hagedorn and about the futility of a recount. ""FYI: the last statewide recount in WI was in 2016. After that recount, the vote margin changed by only 131 out of the 2.7 million votes cast."" Counties have until April 12 to report certified totals to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Is the GOP of Wisconsin right about what happened in 2016? Trump win prompted recount demand In 2016, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein sought a recount after Donald Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate to win Wisconsin since 1984. Stein received just over 31,000 votes, but was able to force a recount under state law by agreeing to pay the $3.5 million cost. The recount prompted Republicans to send to Gov. Scott Walker a bill to tighten Wisconsin recount rules. Under the measure, candidates could request recounts only if they lost by 1 percentage point or less in an election with at least 4,000 votes total. For elections that don't receive that many votes, such as local races, the candidate would need to lose by no more than 40 votes for a recall. To be sure, the 2016 recount didn't change the outcome in Wisconsin. The original margin between Trump and Clinton was 22,617 votes. After the recount, the margin is 22,748 -- an increase of 131 votes. That’s part of the claim made by the GOP. What about the other part -- how many votes were cast in 2016? According to BallotPedia, here are the 2016 presidential Wisconsin voting results: Donald Trump -- 1,405,284 (Republican Hillary Clinton -- 1,382,536  (Democrat) Gary Johnson -- 106,674 (Libertarian) Jill Stein -- 31,072 (Green) Darrell Lane Castle ---12,162 (Constitution) Monica Moorehead --- 1,770 (Workers Party) Rocky De La Fuente ---1,502 (American Delta) Write-in votes --- 35,150 Total -- 2,976,150 That’s more than the 2.7 million claimed in the GOP’s tweet. Presumably, the 2.7 million figure came from adding Trump’s 1,405,284 votes to Clinton’s 1,382,536, which totals 2,787,820 votes. However, that figure disregards the votes cast for the other presidential candidates, including Stein, the candidate who demanded the recount. Our rating The GOP of Wisconsin tweeted  ""the last statewide recount in WI was in 2016. After that recount, the vote margin changed by only 131 out of the 2.7 million votes cast.""

Flanagan criticizes Dream Act funding
","Senate Republicans took aim at the recently passed New York state budget, the first spending plan in years to be crafted with Democrats in control of both houses of the Legislature and the governor’s office. ""After months of warning about the disastrous effects of one-party government, New York’s worst nightmare has been realized with the 2019-20 state budget,"" Senate Minority Leader John Flanagan said in a statement. Flanagan criticized many of the $175.5 billion budget’s provisions. That included the budget’s call to fund the Jose Peralta New York State Dream Act, which allows undocumented students to access state financial aid. It is named in honor of a senator who championed the legislation before he died in 2018.   ""Because of the new one-party government in New York, other Democrat-driven priorities that made it into the final budget include fully funding an initiative to provide free college tuition for illegal immigrants, while rejecting an increase in Tuition Assistance Program funding that would help middle-class families afford college."" We have heard this claim before and wanted to know if it is true. The Dream Act, which provides tuition assistance to undocumented students, was passed by the Assembly and Senate, but it has not yet been signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo’s news release on the budget agreement between his administration and the Legislature states the spending plan ""implements and fully funds the Jose Peralta New York State Dream Act for $27 million."" Cuomo’s budget proposal, released in January, outlined his priorities and explained the Dream Act. ""The Dream Act will give undocumented students access to the Excelsior Scholarship, the Tuition Assistance Program, as well as other state-administered scholarships,"" according to Cuomo’s budget briefing book. ""A $27 million FY 2020 investment in young immigrants’ futures is an investment in New York’s future."" A spokesman for the state Division of Budget, Freeman Klopott, confirmed that the description of the Dream Act in the briefing book is still accurate in the final budget. Scott Reif, a spokesman for Flanagan, said the enacted budget contained $27 million for the Dream Act, which provides ""free college tuition for people who are here illegally."" As for funding for the state’s Tuition Assistance Program, or TAP, Senate Republicans favored expanding access by increasing the award and by raising the income limits to allow families to qualify for it, Reif said. TAP provides grants for students to study at public or private institutions. Senate Democrats also wanted to increase funding for TAP, and they included an expansion in their one-house bill - so named because an identical bill was not carried in the Assembly. The TAP expansion was not included in the final budget, he said. The maximum TAP award is $5,165, while tuition for colleges in the State University of New York system is $6,870. The gap between the TAP grant and tuition costs is covered for eligible students by each campus. Funding for TAP increased from $915.3 million to $947.7 million. The vast majority of the increase, $27 million, will fund Dreamers, Klopott said. The rest of the increase, $5.4 million, is for other students, he said. Not counting the $27 million for Dreamers, the TAP allocation increased less than 1 percent.   A spokesman for Cuomo called Flanagan’s statement ""false and misleading"" because it ignores other actions in the budget to expand access to higher education through the state’s Excelsior Program, which provides free tuition at SUNY and CUNY campuses for in-state students. ""The Excelsior Program will enter the third and final year of a three-year phase-in, with the income eligibility increasing to allow New Yorkers with household incomes up to $125,000 to be eligible,"" said Cuomo spokesman Don Kaplan. The budget funds the Excelsior Program with $119 million. Last year's allocation was $118 million.  The Excelsior Scholarship has several rules recipients must follow, including a stipulation that they live in New York state for the length of time the award was received.  Our ruling Flanagan said the state budget provides ""free college tuition"" for people who are in the United States illegally, and that it does not expand TAP grants for the middle class.

Don’t fall for this old hoax about showering and doing laundry in California
","The police won’t come knocking for Californians who shower and do laundry on the same day, despite what some social media users would have you believe. An old hoax about California’s water conservation laws recently resurfaced after a guest on a Los Angeles TV station shared misinformation on air. ""Starting Jan. 1 California residents can’t take shower, do laundry, poop in toilet and flush on same day,"" said one Facebook post that drew thousands of views to the segment, which was broadcast Dec. 31 on KTLA. ""No really! This is not satire. 55 Gallons per person!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We debunked the same bogus information about California’s conservation efforts in 2018, shortly after then-California Gov. Jerry Brown signed two water-use bills into law. Now, as the misinformation makes a resurgence, we wanted to set the record straight: It was never illegal for Californians to shower and wash laundry on the same day. It still isn’t. The renewed controversy came after KTLA, a local TV station, ran a segment on Dec. 31 about ""unusual and underreported"" California laws taking effect in 2020.  The network welcomed Southern California lawyer Richard Lee on the show, and an anchor teed up a discussion of two California water laws that Lee said would apply in 2020.  Lee’s response parroted many of the inaccurate claims we looked at in 2018. ""Doing a load of laundry takes about 40 to 50 gallons of water,"" Lee said. ""Taking a shower for about eight minutes takes about 17 gallons of water."" ""Well, there’s a limitation on your daily use of water of 55 gallons per day,"" he continued. ""So that means, if you are taking a shower and if you’re doing a load of laundry, you can’t do both without being in violation of the law."" Lee went on to say that violators would be fined ""$1,000 per each day that you are in violation,"" and more during drought conditions, starting Jan. 1, 2020. ""Wow,"" KTLA Morning News anchor Mark Kriski said. ""So all of a sudden, I can smoke marijuana as much as I want, but I can’t take a shower. Unbelievable."" Claims that the laws ban showering and laundry on the same day are False. We fact-checked them when they first circulated in 2018. So did Snopes and a number of local news outlets. KTLA replaced the clip on its website with a correction noting that the segment ""included factual errors about two laws going into effect in 2020 regarding water conservation."" But that effort didn’t stop the video from spreading to all corners of social media and making headlines on conservative sites such as American Lookout and the Gateway Pundit.   A new California law fines you $1,000 if you shower and do 1 load of laundry in the same dayI’m not kiddingAnd if the Gov declares a drought, the fine goes up to *$10,000*Does it feel like Green tyranny yet?This is what the Climate Nutjobs want to force on everyoneRT! pic.twitter.com/KU0HO6AEd1 The misinformation spread so far and so fast that the California Department of Water Resources and the Association of California Water Agencies both issued statements debunking it.  A representative from KTLA declined to comment, but Lee told us that ""the segment was intended to simply be a quick rundown that each person in California could and should be more mindful on his or her indoor water usage."" ""I was simply stating that 55 gallons per day is the standard for per capita indoor water usage per day set forth by the state legislature,"" he said. ""Those fines are to the water agency or provider. That said, there is the question of whether a water agency or provider would pass along this fine to the individual consumer."" The false claims about California water use center on two bills — Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668 — that Brown, the state’s former governor, signed into law on May 31, 2018, as California was reeling from a five-year drought that ended in 2017.   Broadly speaking, the laws instruct cities, water districts and some larger agricultural water districts to establish strict water budgets.  But the new water limits — which kick in starting in 2023, not 2020 — won’t target individuals.  The legislation requires cities, water districts and large agricultural water districts to come up with budgetary targets for water use by 2022. They will need to meet these targets across their ratepayer bases, with failure to do so resulting in a fine of $1,000 per day or $10,000 per day during drought emergencies.   George Kostyrko, director of the office of public affairs for the State Water Resources Control Board, told us the water districts will be guided in their target-setting by a few standards, one of which is the allowance of 55 gallons per capita per day for indoor residential water use — a number that will drop to 50 gallons by 2030.  ""These are not individual mandates for homeowners, but actually a task given to each water district to average water consumption use out to hit the goal,"" Kostyrko said. ""There is nothing regulating the time a person may shower or when they may or may not do laundry,"" added Jim Metropulos, legislative director for state Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, who wrote Assembly Bill 1668. In sum, fines based on consumption will be administered to the water agencies that fail to meet their goals, not to individuals who use too much water in their daily lives.  Of course, water districts could theoretically shift those costs to individual water bills. But no resident will be fined $1,000 for doing laundry and showering on a normal day. Senate Bill 606 does give water agencies the ability to fine some individual lawbreakers, the Sacramento Bee noted. But that’s only when they violate local water-use limits during an official ""water shortage emergency"" that threatens ""human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection."" A Facebook post said, ""Starting Jan. 1 California residents can’t take shower, do laundry, poop in toilet and flush on same day."" Legislation in California means that collectively, Californians will soon need to begin using less water in order for water districts to meet the state’s efficiency standards.  But those limits haven’t kicked in yet, and when they do, the government won’t start demanding hefty fines from residents who shower and do laundry on the same day. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809679DC40>],/factchecks/2020/jan/21/facebook-posts/dont-fall-old-hoax-about-showering-and-doing-laund/

Newman's jab at Lipinski's railroad record doesn't track
","During a recent podcast interview, Marie Newman used a question about a common transportation problem that rankles drivers to take a jab at her opponent, U.S. Representative Dan Lipinski. Newman is challenging Lipinski to a rematch for Illinois’ 3rd District seat in this year's Democratic primary. He clinched a narrow victory over her in 2018. Asked at a canvassing event hosted by Indivisible Chicago what she would say to constituents frustrated by trains blocking their way on the road, Newman said, ""it actually used to be a law that idling trains were not allowed. You could only idle for a very short period of time.That was lifted right around the time that Dan Lipinski came into office and he did have a part in that."" ""Right now it stops first responders from getting to where they need to go, so that’s a big problem,"" Newman added. ""People die because of it. What goes out in terms of toxic emissions into our environment is horrifying."" That’s a lot to pin on Lipinski. So we decided to find out whether the eight-term congressman, who entered office in 2005 and currently sits on the House transportation committee, played a role in the law’s demise. The bottom line: He wasn’t involved in any way. The federal government places no limit on how long trains can block crossings, but a 1999 Illinois law formerly allowed local municipalities to fine trains that had come to a stop and blocked a crossing for more than 10 minutes unless the train could not be moved for reasons beyond the rail carrier’s control. The law was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court in 2008 after the justices found it incompatible with federal regulations on train speed and air-brake testing. That begs the question how Lipinski, a congressman, could have played a part in putting the brakes on a state legal matter settled in court. When we reached out to Newman’s campaign for an answer, spokesman Ben Hardin confirmed that was the law his candidate was referencing and acknowledged Lipinski had no involvement in the outcome of the case. Nevertheless, Hardin contended, Lipinski ""has certainly taken part in protecting corporate interests in rail over the best interests of his constituents"" in other ways, such as his role in delaying the deadline by which rail companies are required to implement technology designed to automatically slow or stop speeding trains that experts say could save lives. While that may have been a persuasive argument to some of Newman’s potential constituents, it was not one she leveraged while attacking her opponent’s transportation record at the Indivisible Chicago event. What’s more, Lipinski has been vocal in his support for addressing the issue of idling trains. In 2016, he wrote a letter to a federal board charged with regulating freight trains asking it to re-examine whether an operator was following an agreement it had made to not block crossings when its purchase of the line received federal approval. And last year, he raised the subject of blocked crossings with the Federal Railroad Administration, highlighting a government study that found average train length had increased 25% since 2008. ""While I understand the economic benefits of longer trains, those cannot be at the expense of community safety and quality of life for commuters,"" Lipinski stated in a July press release. Meanwhile, a recent Bloomberg report found railroad companies have successfully sued six other states in addition to Illinois for enacting laws aimed at unsnarling blocked crossings, including neighboring Indiana and Michigan along with Kansas, Oregon and Texas, which are also home to major freight hubs. Newman said Dan Lipinski had ""a part in"" in lifting a law that used to limit how long trains could idle at crossings. The federal government does not limit how long trains can stand at crossings. In 2008, Illinois’ top court threw out a state law that allowed towns to issue citations to trains that blocked traffic for more than 10 minutes. But Lipinski played no part in the law’s undoing, which Newman’s campaign acknowledged in response to our inquiry. We rate her claim False. FALSE — The statement is not accurate.

Cuomo’s accurate boast about New York’s historically low corporate tax rate
","In Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s 10th State of the State address last week, he claimed that under his administration, ""We have the lowest corporate tax rate since 1968.""  New York’s business climate has for years been the subject of criticism from business groups and conservative lawmakers, so we wondered about this claim.  We approached Cuomo’s office, where spokesman Jason Conwall provided us with historical tax data.  The Department of Taxation and Finance maintains this data, and a table titled ""History of Corporate Tax Rates in New York State, 1917-2009,"" shows that between 1968 and 1970, the corporate tax rate, also known as the corporation franchise tax, was 7 percent. The rate did not fall below 7 percent in later years, and in the final year, 2009, the rate was 7.1 percent.  Since 2009, the rate changed once, when it was lowered to 6.5 percent, Conwall said. The 6.5 percent rate took effect on Jan. 1, 2016. Historically, New York has had separate rates for banks and insurance companies. The bank tax was merged into the corporate tax system in 2015.   We reached out to observers of the state’s tax policies for context and to check for any conflicting data.  The Tax Foundation, a national organization, studies federal and state tax policy and advocated for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act supported by President Trump and congressional Republicans. The Tax Foundation confirmed Cuomo’s claim. ""New York saw remarkable improvement in both its corporate rate - bringing it down to 6.5 percent - and structure - cutting four corporate bases down to three - through tax reform in 2014,"" said policy analyst Janelle Cammenga.  The Tax Foundation advocates for simpler tax codes, and Cammenga noted that New York’s complex individual income tax code affects so-called pass-through businesses, such as partnerships, sole-proprietorships, and limited liability companies.    E.J. McMahon, founder and research director at the conservative Empire Center, also confirmed Cuomo’s claim. McMahon added that in the 12-county region in downstate New York served by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, a surcharge brings the tax rate to 8.34 percent there. But even with the surcharge, it’s still the lowest rate since 1970, McMahon said.  At the left-leaning Fiscal Policy Institute, executive director Ron Deutsch confirmed Cuomo’s claim.   Dave Friedfel, director of state studies at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan research and advocacy organization in Albany and New York City, said that readers should be aware that companies in New York pay more than just the corporate franchise tax. In addition to the MTA surcharge, set by the state, New York City imposes a 8.85 percent corporate franchise tax.  ""Overall, it’s good that New York State’s corporate franchise tax rates are lower than they were and are competitive nationwide, but it’s just a small part of the taxes paid by businesses in New York,"" Friedfel said.   Cuomo claims that under his administration, New York has the lowest corporate tax rate since 1968.  Though there are other taxes levied on businesses in New York, experts from the left and the right agree with Cuomo's assertion.   We rate Cuomo’s statement True.   ",[<zip object at 0x00000280975470C0>],/factchecks/2020/jan/18/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-accurate-boast-about-new-yorks-historically/
"['Vermont', 'Guns', 'John Rodgers']","
A Vermont Senator says cellphones are the #1 killer of teens. That’s false.
","Sen. John Rodgers made national news last week when he introduced a bill that would ban cellphones for Vermonters under the age of 21. It’s not a proposal that Rodgers necessarily supports, but it met his goal of starting a conversation about the lengths we are willing to go to protect children.  To drive home his point that the gun control bills are as much a waste of time as his cellphone bill, Rodgers made the claim — on many occasions over the past week — that while people are worrying about the dangers of gun violence in Vermont, they are ignoring something far more dangerous: cellphones.  ""Cellphones are far more dangerous than guns are,"" Rodgers said in an interview with VTDigger last week. ""No gun has ever been used to radicalize or recruit terrorists, neo-Nazis or fascists. And the number one killer of teens in the United States is driving while using cellphones."" In emails from his Senate account, Rodgers has doubled down on this point. ""Is it a stunt when I have people around the country talking about the number one killer of teens in America,"" he asked one constituent critical of his cellphone ban proposal.  He wrote to another angry emailer: ""So you are not concerned with the number one killer of teens in the country. You clueless f - - k!"" It’s fair to say Rodgers has been falling back on the claim often as he defends himself from cellphone ban blowback. But is he right?  We asked Rodgers where he got his stats. He quickly walked back his original claim. ""I realize that I have framed that poorly in stating several times that the cell phone use it’s self is the cause when in fact it is a major contributor but not responsible for all accidents,"" Rodgers wrote in an email. He’s onto something there. It’s true that the leading cause of teen deaths in the U.S. is motor vehicle accidents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that per mile driven, drivers aged 16 to 19 are three times more likely than drivers 20 and older to be in a fatal crash. In 2015, motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death among ""children"" 8-15, ""youth"" 15-20, and ""young adults"" 21-24, according to the most recent data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Suicide was second on the list.  That means that even including teenagers too young to drive, Rodgers’ idea that motor vehicle crashes are the number one cause of death among teenagers in the United States still holds true. But that’s where the truth in Rodgers’ statement ends.  For Rodgers’ claim to be true, an overwhelming majority of teenage motor vehicle deaths would have to have been caused by cellphone use, so much so that it would still outnumber deaths caused by suicide (which account for roughly 1,000 fewer teen deaths than car crashes per year). However, texting comes nowhere close to topping the CDC’s list of the leading causes of teen crashes. Driver inexperience takes first place, followed by driving with teen passengers, nighttime driving, and not using seat belts. Distracted driving (the category that texting while driving falls into) came in fifth. Further calling Rodgers’ claim into doubt, cellphone use isn’t even the leading cause of distracted driving. The most recent data available shows that in 2017, 271 teenagers died because of distracted driving, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Of those fatalities, only 23% — or 63 teen deaths — were caused by cellphones. There were approximately 2,500 deaths by suicide among people aged 15-19, by comparison.  Rodgers claimed that ""the number one killer of teens in the United States is driving while using cellphones."" In 2017, the CDC reported 14,103 total teen deaths (ages 10-19). The same year, the NHTSA reported just 63 deaths caused by cellphone use while driving.  That means that just about 0.4% of teen deaths are caused by texting while driving. There are many other causes of car crashes, as well as suicide, that have a far higher death toll.  We rate this claim false.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C07D3C0>],/factchecks/2020/jan/17/john-rodgers/vermont-senator-says-cellphones-are-1-killer-teens/

Fact-checking an old conspiracy about Martin Luther King Jr.’s death
","A few days before a holiday celebrating his life, conspiracies about Martin Luther King Jr.’s death are circulating on Instagram. In an image reposted Jan. 14 from another account, a brand called Olmecian Clothing claimed that, contrary to popular belief, King did not die from a gunshot wound. The post includes a photo of what appears to be King in a hospital bed. ""He was killed (smothered) in the hospital,"" the post reads. ""Also in 1999 the US government was found guilty in a court of law of conspiring to kill him but was silenced by the media."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) It has more than 9,700 likes, and similar posts were shared on Facebook. A popular Instagram and Facebook post claims Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in the hospital after he was shot. We rate the posts False. (Screenshot from Instagram) We checked Congress’ report on King’s death, as well as the book and lawsuit cited in the Instagram post. None of them provide evidence that the civil rights leader was killed in a government plot — and the photo itself does not show King after he was shot. The most authoritative report on King’s assassination is a congressional report from 1979. It said he died from a gunshot wound. According to the House Select Committee on Assassinations’ report, King was shot shortly after 6 p.m. on April 4, 1968, while standing on a balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn. He was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. at St. Joseph Hospital. An autopsy conducted at Gaston Hospital determined that King’s cause of death was a ""gunshot wound to the chin and neck with a total transaction of the lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord and other structures of the neck."" A convicted armed robber and escaped prison inmate named James Earl Ray pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of King on March 10, 1969. (He recanted his confession days later but was never able to formally withdraw his guilty plea.) Critics questioned the thoroughness of the autopsy report, but a panel of three forensic pathologists commissioned by the House committee concluded that the findings were generally accurate. They reached that conclusion after reviewing ""the report of the committee's firearms panel, as well as X-rays, medical reports, notes, and documents submitted by physicians who treated Dr. King."" The conspiracy that King was killed by someone at the hospital stems from an attorney who represented Ray. The post’s caption cites a 2016 book by the lawyer, William Pepper, titled ""The Plot to Kill King: The Truth Behind the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr."" Moor Information, the Instagram account from which Olmecian Clothing reposted the image, conceded in its caption that the book ""has never been verified."" Pepper represented Ray during the tail-end of his trial for King’s murder and has spent years trying to prove his innocence. Ray died in prison in 1998. Pepper claims in the book that Ray didn’t kill King — instead, he was framed by U.S. government agencies. RELATED: Claims about MLK often go astray ""The plan, according to Pepper, was for a team of United States Army Special Forces snipers to kill King, but just as they were taking aim, a backup civilian assassin pulled the trigger,"" reads the book’s description. There is no direct evidence that happened. Hampton Sides, author of ""Hellhound on His Trail: The Stalking of Martin Luther King Jr. and the International Hunt for His ­Assassin,"" told Time magazine in April 2018 that the source of many conspiracies about King’s death can be traced to Ray’s guilty plea, which stopped his trial from proceeding. ""There was a huge amount of evidence presented in Memphis that didn’t see the light of day in a public forum,"" Sides said. ""I think that contributed to the sense of conspiracy, like a ‘What are they hiding?’ kind of thing."" Those conspiracies are also fueled by the fact that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover spied on King during the 1960s.  Pepper has been active in other conspiracy movements, such as those that doubt official accounts of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. As for the actual photo in the Instagram post, it doesn’t show King at St. Joseph Hospital in Memphis. It depicts King after he was stabbed on Sept. 20, 1958, in New York City. As additional evidence for its claim that King was killed in a nefarious government plot, the Instagram post cited a 1999 lawsuit. But the case doesn’t show what Olmecian Clothing says it does. King vs. Jowers was a wrongful death civil suit filed by Pepper on behalf of King’s wife and children. The unlikely partnership was a result of the family’s belief that Pepper’s version of the assassination got at the real truth behind King’s death, according to the New York Times. In this April 8, 1968 file photo, Coretta Scott King, third right, is accompanied by her children, Yolanda, Bernice, Martin III, and Dexter at Sisters Chapel on the campus of Spelman College in Atlanta. (AP) Loyd Jowers was a Memphis cafe owner who claimed he hired someone other than Ray to assassinate King. A prosecutor who investigated King’s assassination said several of Jowers’ associates said he hoped to get a movie or book deal. The jury issued a verdict that said Jowers and ""others, including government agencies"" were part of a conspiracy to assassinate King. The jury awarded the Kings the $100 in damages that they sought. But in a 2000 review of the lawsuit, the Justice Department found no evidence to back up the verdict. (It’s worth noting that civil suits only require plaintiffs to prove their case by a ""preponderance of the evidence"" instead of ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" which is a more stringent burden of proof that’s used in criminal court.) ""Most of the witnesses and writings offered to support the various government-directed conspiracy claims relied exclusively on secondhand and thirdhand hearsay and speculation,"" the Justice Department wrote in its report on King vs. Jowers. ""Additionally, none of these allegations were ever linked together."" An Instagram post claimed King was smothered to death in a hospital and that ""the US government was found guilty in a court of law of conspiring to kill him."" A congressional report on King’s death determined that he died from a single gunshot wound to the chin and neck. There’s no evidence to back up conspiracy theories that King was killed in a government plot. An exhaustive report from the Justice Department found ample reason to doubt a 1999 verdict that concluded a Memphis cafe owner and government agencies were part of a conspiracy to kill the civil rights leader. As for the photo in the Instagram post, it doesn’t show King after he was shot in Memphis. It was taken nearly a decade prior in New York City. The Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2C5F00>],/factchecks/2020/jan/17/instagram-posts/fact-checking-old-conspiracy-about-martin-luther-k/

No, Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment pens didn’t cost $2,025 each
","Republicans criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for giving pens to other House members as keepsakes after she used them to sign the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on Jan. 15. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, for example, retweeted a photo of the pens and wrote: ""Nancy Pelosi’s souvenir pens served up on silver platters to sign the sham articles of impeachment...She was so somber as she gave them away to people like prizes."" But on Facebook, some users levied a new accusation against the speaker.  ""$2,025 per pen,"" a Jan. 16 post begins. ""Paid for by taxpayers. Is there any doubt Pelosi thinks she’s the Queen? Now we know why she delayed sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate… she was waiting for her gold-plated impeachment pens."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This claim is wrong. Each pen cost just under $15, according to Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff. When we asked Richard Arenberg, a professor of the practice of political science at Brown University, about the post, he told us ""the $2,025 figure is ridiculous.""  Searching through all 16 pages of Google results for $2,025 and Pelosi’s name, we couldn’t find any other mentions of the pens’ price. The only relevant results were the message in this Facebook post reshared on web forums.  The most recent Statement of Disbursements of the House, in which the chief administrative officer details receipts and expenditures of appropriations and other funds from July 1 to Sept. 30, 2019, shows that the speaker’s office spent about $29,000 on supplies and materials that quarter, and about $229,500 that year to date, but there isn’t a specific line item for pens.  In the past, reporters have combed through these quarterly reports to see how lawmakers are spending taxpayer money. In 2009, Politico reported that Pelosi spent $2,993 on flowers between June and October of that year. Then-Minority Leader John Boehner spent about $24,617 on catering.  According to Business Insider, Pelosi used 30 customized pens engraved with her name to sign her name on the impeachment articles. We would expect that Republicans outraged over the tone of the signing ceremony would also balk at the $60,750 price tag. But reviewing stories from the Washington Post, the Associated Press, Fox News, The Hill, BBC, and the Washington Times, among others, we saw no note of the pen’s price.  It’s not unusual for lawmakers and presidents to gift signing pens though in this case Pelosi’s critics argue it wasn’t appropriate. As the BBC notes, then-President Barack Obama used 22 pens to sign the Affordable Care Act, and Republican senators kept pens as souvenirs after signing oaths for then-President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1998.  We rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2C5980>],/factchecks/2020/jan/17/facebook-posts/no-nancy-pelosis-impeachment-pens-didnt-cost-2025-/

NC Democrat wrong about GOP leader taking jab at other Republicans
","One of the biggest political stories of the year in 2019 occurred on Sept. 11. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper had vetoed the GOP-controlled legislature’s budget proposal. On most days, Republicans in the legislature have enough votes for a simple majority — but not the supermajority needed to override a veto.  But on the morning of Sept. 11, many Democrats were absent. So House Speaker Tim Moore called a vote and the veto override passed. This is where Rep. Deb Butler comes in. The Wilmington Democrat gained recognition for trying to stop the vote, which she considered improper. (She famously yelled ""I will not yield"" and ""shame on you, Mr. Speaker"" while on the vote was happening.) Fast forward to January, when the legislature was scheduled to reconvene. In a Jan. 5 tweet, Butler said she’s calling on Senate leader Phil Berger ""who expressed disdain for the ambush vote in the House"" to negotiate with Cooper rather than try to override his veto. Berger, like Speaker Moore, is a Republican. It’s uncommon for the two Republican leaders to publicly criticize each other. So we wondered whether Butler was right. Did Berger ""express disdain"" for how Moore executed the veto override? Lack of evidence We asked Butler where she saw or heard Berger’s supposed disdain.  ""I can’t remember exactly where I read it, but it was in the context of the Senate rules requiring 24 hours notice of a veto override vote and then he said something to the effect that, besides he didn’t like the approach used by the Speaker,"" Butler said. ""I’m sorry I can’t remember precisely where."" We also reached out to Berger’s office and asked whether Berger holds disdain for how the House overrode Cooper’s veto, or whether he ever expressed negative feelings about how it happened. ""I'm not aware of him ever saying anything like that,"" Berger spokesman Pat Ryan said. PolitiFact and WRAL reporters could find no specific examples of Berger saying anything negative about the House budget override.  A press conference The closest Berger came to criticizing Moore and the House was during an Oct. 1 press conference. Even then, he didn’t mention Moore specifically or say the House did anything wrong. WRAL recorded the press conference. Around the 2:30 mark of the video, Berger talked about his preference for finding a budget solution. ""I’d rather have a broad, bipartisan vote — just like you saw on redistricting — than a veto override that squeaks through,"" Berger said. Then, around the 3:40 mark of the video, Berger explains the logistics of how the Senate must conduct a veto override vote. ""Before I take your questions, I’ll answer what’s probably at least one of the questions, maybe the top question: Senate rules require 24 hours’ notice before calendaring a veto override. We will adhere to the rules,"" Berger said. ""I’ll be glad to take your questions."" Berger also said he’d seize an opportunity to pass the budget. If could be argued that promise alone proves he didn’t show disdain for the House vote.  To disdain something means to feel like it’s ""not good enough to deserve your respect or attention,"" according to the Oxford dictionary. Merriam-Webster says it means to treat something as ""beneath one’s notice or dignity."" Our ruling Butler said Berger ""expressed disdain"" for how fellow Republicans in the NC House voted to override Cooper’s budget veto. She presented no evidence for her claim and PolitiFact could find no evidence of Berger making any overtly negative comments about the House vote.

Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is the first female Palestinian-American member of Congress, and at times, wears the scarf — called a keffiyeh — associated with Palestinian resistance to Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A viral Facebook post, however, wrongly says the scarf represents terrorism:  ""A U.S. Congresswoman wears the symbolic scarf patterned after the Islamic terrorist state,"" reads the post next to two images of people wearing the keffiyeh. One picture shows Tlaib on the House floor with the scarf around her neck and the other of an armed militant with the scarf over his face.  There’s no quibble that the scarf Tlaib wore stands for the Palestinian people. She’s a Palestinian-American and her grandmother lives in the West Bank. Among Palestinians, it’s an object of pride with a history that stretches back thousands of years. Tlaib wore it when she spoke against a House resolution that she said would treat her grandmother as a second-class citizen. But the tie that the Facebook post makes between the scarf and Islamic State terrorism is unfounded. Islamic State fighters wore a variety of scarves, but not in a single style that marked their cause. The scarf in the post is associated with Palestinians, not the Islamic State. Though we could not find the origin of the picture of the fighter wearing the scarf, it shows up in posts dating back to 2008, long before the rise of the Islamic State. This post plays off of a similar claim circulated in December 2019 that accused Tlaib of wearing the scarf of Hamas terrorists. Armed Palestinian groups have worn the keffiyeh. The red and white version is often associated with Hamas, while black and white is tied more to Fatah, which has renounced armed resistance. But in practice, the scarf is worn by many people worldwide, often as a matter of fashion, not politics. We rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809706BBC0>],/factchecks/2020/jan/17/blog-posting/post-falsely-ties-tlaib-scarf-islamic-state/

No, this girl doesn’t get a dollar for a kidney transplant every time someone shares a Facebook post
","Since an image of a little girl was published on Facebook on June 17, 2019, announcing that every time someone shared the post she would get a dollar for a kidney transplant, she has seemingly pocketed quite a bit of cash.  More than $87,000 as of Jan. 17, 2020, as thousands of Facebook users shared the post.   But this post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That’s because it’s a hoax. And it’s been misleading people since at least 2018. The girl’s photo appeared in October 2017 on the Brazilian website Click Paraná. Translated to English, the post is titled: ""Aninha is very much in need of your help."" It goes on to say that the girl, Aninha, was diagnosed with leukemia and undergoing chemotherapy in Curitiba, the capital of the Brazilian state Paraná. It asks people to donate blood at a hospital there to help her. It doesn’t ask for money.  This Facebook post isn’t the first to claim that sharing a photo of an ailing child will result in a cash flow.

"['Education', 'Texas', 'Elizabeth Warren']","
Did Elizabeth Warren really pay $50 to attend the University of Houston?
","U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., often stresses her Texas ties, peppering her public speeches, social media posts and debate remarks with references to her experience as an undergraduate student at the University of Houston, a law student at the University of Texas at Austin and later as a law professor back in Houston and Austin. One anecdote in particular has become a frequent refrain for the Democratic presidential candidate: When she attended the University of Houston, her tuition was $50 a semester. She repeated this claim during a town hall event in Iowa in January, as she described how she became a teacher. ""So, here's how my story goes,"" Warren says. ""I was a high school debater and I got a scholarship to college — woo hoo. And then, at 19, I fell in love, got married and dropped out — woo hoo. Now, a good life, a life I had chosen. But I thought that was it and I’d lost out on the chance to be a public school teacher. I thought I gave that up. ""We were living outside of Houston and that’s when I found it. A commuter college, 45 minutes away that cost $50 a semester. For a price I could pay with a part-time waitressing job, I finished my four-year diploma, I became a special education teacher. I lived my dream job."" Warren did not explicitly reference the University of Houston, but she has named the school multiple times in other versions of the same statement. ""It's always a good day to be reminded that I got where I am because a great education was available for $50 a semester at the University of Houston,"" she said in an October tweet. Today, tuition at the University of Houston costs about $4,000 per semester for an undergraduate student taking 12 hours. Is it true that Warren paid $50 when she attended the same school? University records show that tuition for Texas residents taking a full course load while Warren was enrolled was $50, but additional fees brought the total cost of attending the school up to about $100 a semester. Chris Hayden, spokesman for Warren’s campaign, said it was clear her claim was referencing tuition and not associated expenses. He highlighted multiple occasions when Warren specified that she was talking just about tuition. In Warren’s 2014 memoir titled ""A Fighting Chance,"" she discussed paying for her education. ""The University of Houston was about forty minutes away, and tuition was only $50 a semester,"" she wrote. The $50 amount also makes an appearance in a Medium post by Warren outlining her proposal for universal free public college, posted in April 2019. ""I thought my dream of teaching was over,"" she said in the post. ""But then a friend told me about the University of Houston, a public four-year college about 40 minutes away. We were a young couple, watching every nickel. I figured I couldn’t afford it. But it turned out that tuition was just $50 a semester."" Warren graduated from the University of Houston in 1970, according to a copy of her curriculum vitae. At PolitiFact’s request, the University of Houston provided university bulletins detailing information such as tuition and fees for four academic years around the time of Warren’s graduation: 1966-67, 1968-69, 1969-70 and 1970-71. Across the four academic years, the tuition varies based on a student’s residency (Texas residents pay less in tuition) and the number of hours a student registers for each semester. For Texas residents taking 12 or more hours, the maximum amount listed, tuition during all three academic years was $50 a semester. But there were other expenses students enrolled at the university during those years were required to pay each semester, including a Student Services fee, a University Center fee and an Academic Building Use fee. Warren describes the university as a commuter college, implying that she lived at home and traveled back and forth to campus to attend her classes, which would negate costs associated with room and board. During the 1966-67 academic year, when Warren likely started at the university, tuition was $50 a semester and the other fees were about $39, assuming Warren took a full course load and only during fall and spring semesters. That brings Warren’s grand total to $89 a semester, which doesn’t include the cost of books or other school supplies. During the 1968-69 academic year, tuition was $50 a semester and other fees totaled $41. That brings Warren’s grand total to $91 a semester, again excluding the cost of books or other school supplies. During the 1969-70 academic year, tuition was $50 a semester and other fees totaled $55. That brings Warren’s grand total to $105 a semester. Warren was not enrolled at the university during the 1970-71 school year, but tuition and fees per semester that year totaled $108 for Texas residents. Warren said that the University of Houston cost her $50 a semester while she was a student. It would have been more accurate for Warren to have said that tuition at the University of Houston was $50 a semester, a claim she has made multiple times in the past. When considering associated fees and expenses, the total cost per semester was closer to $100. Warren has repeated the accurate version of this statement multiple times since at least 2014. Overall, her claim is accurate, but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280976F5400>],/factchecks/2020/jan/17/elizabeth-warren/did-elizabeth-warren-really-pay-50-attend-universi/

Was Nancy Pelosi’s son an executive for a Ukrainian gas company?
","Does House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have a Ukraine problem? Conservative social media is saying so. ""Nancy Pelosi's Son Paul Jr. Was Exec at 'Ukraine-Based Gas Company,' Similar to Hunter Biden,"" reads a headline on the website founded by conservative radio host Wayne Dupree on Oct. 4, 2019. The story asserts the following: The Democrats are treating the Ukraine like ""Ziprecruiter.com"" for their lazy, do-nothing privileged kids. A new report out reveals that Nancy Pelosi’s son Paul Pelosi also worked as an exec at a gas company with strong ties to the Ukraine, similar to Hunter Biden. How deep does the Dem/Ukraine corruption go, for crying out loud? We’re going to need bigger shovels to dig through this never-ending mess. The bombshell report reveals that Paul Pelosi Jr. visited Ukraine in 2017 to meet with government officials in regards to a business initiative. In recently unearthed records, we now know that Paul Pelosi Jr. was an executive of a gas industry company that did a lot of business in Ukraine – a lot – and his mother Nancy Pelosi was even featured in one of the company’s promotional videos. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We previously fact-checked a similar claim and found it to be incorrect. Here too, we found no evidence that Pelosi Jr. served as an executive for a Ukraine-based gas company. • The situation is not similar to Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma.  • Paul Pelosi Jr. once served on the board of an American energy company, Viscoil. After he left the board, the company dissolved and re-formed in Singapore under a different name.  • Pelosi Jr. had no part in the new entity, which is not is not based in Ukraine. It’s unclear to what extent the company has done any business in Ukraine. WayneDupree.com did not respond to an inquiry for this article. The source appears to be an Oct. 3 tweet from Patrick Howley, a conservative writer who publishes material at the website nationalfile.com. ""BOOM: Nancy Pelosi's son Paul Pelosi Jr. (who went to Ukraine in 2017) was a board member of Viscoil and executive at its related company NRGLab, which DID ENERGY Business in UKRAINE!"" Howley said in the tweet, which has been retweeted almost 14,000 times. ""And Nancy Pelosi appeared in a promotional video for the company!"" As evidence, Howley linked to two YouTube videos published March 5, 2013. The first shows Paul Pelosi Jr. speaking at an event in Washington. The video opens with clips of a speech from Nancy Pelosi and then shows Paul at an XPRIZE Foundation competition in September 2010. The nonprofit group organizes public competitions with businesses to encourage their technological development.  RELATED STORY: PolitiFact's Trump-Ukraine-Biden coverage in one place ""My name’s Paul Pelosi, of course I’m on the board of Viscoil, and Viscoil’s here today to talk about accelerating the future,"" he says during the video. Viscoil was a California-based holding company that dissolved in 2010. An old version of the company's website said the company was created to ""engage in research and in the commercial development of hydrocarbon production methods and technologies."" After it shuttered, Viscoil was folded into NRGLab, a Singapore-based company ""specializing in different areas of scientific research."" It appears to have published the YouTube videos. The second video Howley posted shows Walter Afanasieff, a Brazilian-American musician, talking about how technology could improve oil extraction. The caption lists other artists that had promoted Viscoil’s work, including Mika Newton, a Ukrainian singer and actress. ""Mika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine,"" the caption reads. An SH-box is a kind of environmentally friendly generator, according to NRGLab. We found a Facebook page on which Newton has promoted NRGLab’s work, but we could find no news coverage about the company's dealings in Ukraine. NRGLab does not mention the country on its website. We reached out to the company for more information but did not get a response. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact last year that Paul Pelosi Jr. worked for Viscoil for a short time. He denied that it had any dealings in Ukraine when he was working for the company. ""The company was based in Southern California and focused solely on U.S. business,"" he told PolitiFact in an email. ""The company later reorganized under a different name, but Paul Pelosi Jr. played no role in the new entity."" The timeline Hammill offered fits the evidence we’ve seen. In addition, the WayneDupree.com article cited a TV appearance Pelosi Jr. made on Ukrainian television in 2017. But while Pelosi was indeed in Ukraine at the time, there is no evidence to support that he was there while working as an executive for a Ukraine-based gas company. Paul Pelosi Jr. appears on Ukrainian television in 2017 For starters, the TV interview did not mention anything about energy or gas companies. On the Ukrainian show, Pelosi Jr. said that it was his first visit to Kyiv, and it involved his employment as executive director of the Corporate Governance Initiative, specifically a partnership on youth soccer involving the World Sports Alliance and the Ukrainian government. The Corporate Governance Initiative says its mission is to help organizations ""adhere to a system of guidelines, practices, and procedures by which a company is directed and controlled."" Pelosi Jr.’s mention of the World Sports Alliance came about two years before one of its top executives, Asa Saint Clair, was indicted in November 2019 for using the ""World Sports Alliance, a sham affiliate of the United Nations, as a vehicle to defraud lenders"" through a cryptocurrency scheme, according to the Justice Department. In a 2016 news release, Saint Clair touted the Corporate Governance Institute’s governance principles and described Pelosi Jr. as ""a longtime associate, both business and personal."" Pelosi Jr. is quoted at length in the news release. Nancy Pelosi’s office confirmed that at the time of the Ukraine trip, Pelosi Jr. was working for the Corporate Governance Institute, and that the connection to the World Sports Alliance came from the alliance’s endorsement of the institute’s corporate governance principles. Her office said that Pelosi Jr. did not do any work for the World Sports Alliance and was not paid by them. None of this changes the claim in the headline — that ""Nancy Pelosi's Son Paul Jr. Was Exec at 'Ukraine-Based Gas Company,' Similar to Hunter Biden.""  Social media posts said that ""Nancy Pelosi's Son Paul Jr. Was Exec at 'Ukraine-Based Gas Company,' Similar to Hunter Biden."" Pelosi Jr. served on the board of Viscoil, a company that was not based in Ukraine. After Pelosi Jr. was off the board, a Ukrainian singer is alleged to have promoted the company. Separately, Pelosi Jr. visited Ukraine, but there is no indication that he went there to conduct energy business.

Yes, Florida ranks at bottom of states on school funding
","Florida has long had a reputation of lagging behind many states in education funding. But just how close to the bottom of the barrel is the Sunshine State? A viral post on Facebook described Florida as the ""3rd most populous state, 4th largest state economy, the 45th in state education funding."" We saw the post the same week thousands of teachers and activists rallied in Tallahassee at the outset of the state legislative session for better funding.  Unlike many of the statements we fact-check on Facebook, this one about education funding is on point. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook to combat misinformation.) Many groups rank education funding, but the one that ranked Florida 45th is a respected national education publication. Education Week’s Quality Counts report released in June showed Florida received an F grade for spending (with a score of 43.4 out of 100 possible points), ranking it 45th in that category. The states that ranked lower than Florida were Tennessee, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Idaho, Utah and Arizona. RELATED FACT-CHECK: Fact-checking Bernie Sanders’ attack on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis about school tests The ranking is based on four spending indicators: per-pupil expenditures, the percentage of students in districts spending at or above the U.S. average, the spending index, and the percent of total taxable resources spent on education.  ""Overall, 25 states get F grades for spending,"" said Sterling Lloyd, Education Week’s assistant director. ""So, Florida’s not alone there."" Florida also ranks near the bottom for the sub-category of per-pupil spending alone. Florida ranks 43rd at $9,764 per student once dollar amounts are adjusted for regional cost differences, Lloyd said. All of the data in the school finance report are from 2016, the most recent year for available  federal sources. Rankings by other groups including the National Education Association, the U.S. Census and the National Center for Education Statistics all showed Florida ranked near the bottom of states on spending. There has been some momentum to improve education funding by Gov. Ron DeSantis who declared that the 2020 legislative session would be the ""Year of the Teacher."" DeSantis has called for a new starting teacher salary of $47,500, roughly a $10,000 increase. We won’t know the outcome of his proposal until the session ends in March. RELATED: Florida Gov. DeSantis proposes starting teacher pay increase A Facebook post said Florida is ""the 45th in state education funding."" That matches an analysis by Education Week based on 2016 data.

Viral story twists Biden’s words of sympathy into womanizing advice
","A right wing website copied an article from another right wing website to put Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in a bad light. ""Biden Caught In Damaging Gaffe On Hot Mic – Tells Men To Marry Into Families ‘With 3 Or 4 Sisters’,"" read the headline on Thepoliticalbrief.com, Jan. 12. The article builds on tape of Biden working the rope line after a town hall in Vinton, Iowa, Jan. 4. A C-SPAN video catches Biden saying the words that drove the headline. ""I tell all the guys that ask me about getting married is that you always marry into a family with three or four sisters,"" Biden says. ""I married one with five. Know why? That way, one will always love you...not the same one."" ""America’s had its fill of creepy, womanizing presidents,"" the post said. ""Is he saying that he cheats on his wife… with one of her sisters?"" This plays off of stories that have dogged Biden of being too physical with women and overstepping the boundaries of personal space. But the piece gets the context of these comments decidedly wrong — Biden was talking to and sympathizing with a woman whose sister had recently died. The short video in the article misses those key details. Here’s the full exchange and setting, which begins at 1:18:30 in the C-SPAN video: Biden is mixing it up with supporters. A middle-aged woman comes up, introduces her husband and her sister. ""We had a sister who passed away four weeks ago,"" she says. Biden shakes his head in sympathy and they take a selfie with the woman and her sister.  ""I tell all the guys that ask me about getting married is that you always marry into a family with three or four sisters,"" Biden said. ""I married one with five. Know why? That way, one will always love you..not the same one. (The three laugh.) You’ll always have a partner, you’ll always have a buddy with you. I’m so sorry."" ""Yeah, a few weeks ago she passed away."" ""I’m so sorry,"" Biden says, and hugs her. ""You know what I’m talking about. God love you. How old was she? The answer is indistinct. Biden shakes his head and says, ""ugh."" Thepoliticalbrief.com copied the article word for word from a site called GOP Daily Brief. A short video snippet of the moment in Iowa came from a tweet.  The article cast Biden’s words as sexist, and by ignoring who he was speaking to and what they were talking about, it suggests he was talking to a man, not a woman. Some people might see Biden’s words as awkward, but they had nothing to do with what the article said. The article is a distortion.

Spam news site circulates hoax linking Obama to former ISIS leader’s release
","A spam website republished satire as genuine news in an effort to spread misinformation about former President Barack Obama and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The hoax story was posted Jan. 14 to AJUANews.com, a website with a long track record of republishing false, satirical stories without their original context.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story falsely claims that Obama freed al-Baghdadi, who died in a raid by U.S. forces in October 2019, from U.S. custody. Its headline: ""‘He’s low risk,’ said Obama before freeing ISIS leader al Baghdadi."" But that allegation about Obama is False. We’ve fact-checked it several times before. The AJUANews.com story seems to have been lifted word-for-word from a November article with the same headline on ObamaWatcher, a site that says it posts conservative satire.  That ObamaWatcher story is tagged as ""Barack Obama Fan Fiction"" on the site. It says Obama was responsible for al-Baghdadi’s release from U.S. custody in 2004. Obama, however, was first elected president in 2008. When we first looked into al-Baghdadi’s release, the Defense Department told us the future ISIS leader was held at a U.S. detention facility in Iraq known as Camp Bucca from early February 2004 until early December 2004. There’s no record of him being held at any other time. Baghdadi was not freed by the United States, either. Rather, the United States handed him over to the Iraqis, who released him some time later. Some politicians, pundits and news outlets have inaccurately claimed Obama let al-Baghdadi go in 2009. That misconception tracks back to a Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca. King said he recalled al-Baghdadi leaving in 2009 and saying, ""I’ll see you guys in New York."" King later told ABC News he ""could be mistaken"" and that al-Baghdadi’s ""face is very familiar."" A U.S.-Iraq agreement did drive the transfer of many detainees to Iraq in 2009, but that framework was set up by President George W. Bush in 2008. The Defense Department said al-Baghdadi was not in U.S. custody in 2009. And an article in the Guardian quoted another ISIS commander talking about meeting al-Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2004. The article said he was transferred because officials saw nothing of concern. We also found no evidence that Obama, then an Illinois state senator who had just won election to the Senate, said al-Baghdadi was ""low risk"" when he was released in 2004 — or ever.  The Obama administration designated al-Baghdadi a global terrorist in a 2011 federal notice.  AJUANews.com said, ""‘He’s low risk,’ said Obama before freeing ISIS leader al Baghdadi."" The ISIS leader was removed from U.S. custody and handed over to Iraq in 2004, before Obama was president. There’s no evidence Obama played any role in that transfer.

Fact-checking Trump's claim that Obama designated Iran's Soleimani a terrorist but did nothing
","Campaigning for re-election in Milwaukee, host city for the upcoming Democratic National Convention, President Donald Trump contrasted himself with President Barack Obama on fighting terrorism. The focus: Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, who was considered to be one of the most powerful and important officials in Iran. He was killed Jan. 3 in Iraq in a drone strike authorized by Trump. After detailing terrorist acts attributed to ""this son of a bitch,"" Trump said Soleimani ""wasn’t supposed to be there.""  Soleimani ""was a designated terrorist by President Obama, who didn't do anything about it,"" Trump charged. Trump also made the claim a week earlier to conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Is it true? Like President George W. Bush before him, Obama did not capture or kill Soleimani after a designation was placed him.  Thousands of such official sanctionings related to terrorism are made without such actions being taken. And a series of designations, escalated under Obama, made it more difficult for Soleimani to travel and conduct financial transactions. Obama didn’t take action against Soleimani beyond that. There are different levels of designations the U.S. government makes on individuals and groups related to terrorism. Soleimani was originally designated, as the government refers to it, by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2007 — under Bush — based on being commander of the Quds Force. At the same time, the Treasury designated the Quds Force for ""providing material support to the Taliban and other terrorist organizations."" In 2007, U.S. special operations forces planned a mission to capture Soleimani, but senior U.S. leaders declined to approve it, retired Army Col. Frank Sobchak told PolitiFact. Sobchak was one of the lead editors of the Army's report on the Iraq War. ""Individuals that we talked to in senior positions of the U.S. government told us that with support for the war at an all time low in 2007, the Bush administration recognized the importance of Soleimani to the war, but was not willing to risk the political capital and repercussions that could occur from expanding the war to that level,"" he said. So, the designation led to actions being weighed by Bush, but not taken. The Obama administration designated Soleimani twice. The U.S. Treasury Department designated him in May 2011 for his role as the commander of the Quds Force, ""the primary conduit for Iran's support to the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate."" The allegations had to do with Syrian protesters being killed by Syrian security forces. The more serious move came in October 2011, when Treasury designated Soleimani again, saying he oversaw the Quds Force officers who plotted an attempt to assassinate Adel Al-Jubeir, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. The killing of the ambassador was to have taken place in a bombing at Cafe Milano in Washington, D.C., according to federal prosecutors. That is the designation Trump’s campaign cited to us when we asked for information to support Trump’s claim. That Treasury action made Soleimani a ""specially designated global terrorist,"" said Jacob Shapiro, professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University.  There are more than 4,100 people on various Treasury sanctions lists, but only about 1,600 specially designated global terrorists, he said. Americans are prohibited from engaging in transactions with individuals who are designated, and any assets they may hold in the United States are frozen. ""But just because the U.S. designates a group as a terrorist organization does not mean there is an official policy to assassinate the organization's leaders or actively target the group's members,"" said Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, a global security think tank. In short, the designations made it more difficult for Soleimani to maneuver in terms of travel and conducting financial transactions, although he clearly was able to work around those restrictions, Shapiro said. When announcing his death, the Pentagon blamed Soleimani for orchestrating a series of attacks on allied bases in Iraq in recent months, most recently a rocket strike that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four other service members. ""I am unaware of any capture or kill mission that was publicly revealed against Soleimani by the Obama administration,""  Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us.  Similarly, after Soleimani’s death, Derek Chollet, assistant secretary of defense from 2012 to 2015, told the Daily Beast: ""To my knowledge, there was never a decision of ‘We’ve gotta go find this guy and get him.’"" That comment was echoed by retired Gen. David Petraeus, the CIA director under Obama, on CBS’ ""Face the Nation."" It’s also worth noting that because of a multination deal pushed by Obama with Iran to curb Iran’s ability to make a nuclear weapon, Soleimani would eventually be removed from a United Nations sanctions list.  Clearly, Obama didn’t go as far as Trump did in taking action against Soleimani. Under Obama, ""a policy choice was made to reduce U.S. military presence in the Middle East and shift capabilities to the Pacific,"" said Rick Brennan, a career Army officer and political scientist at the RAND Corp. ""At the same time, the administration was focused on gaining Iranian agreement to the Iran nuclear deal and elected not to press Iran on its regional terrorist activities conducted by the (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force) and General Soleimani, even though the IRGC-QF was becoming more and more active in places such as Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.   ""So, President Trump was correct in stating that the Obama administration did nothing that had a detrimental impact on General Soleimani or the IRGC-QF."" But it goes too far to say that Obama didn’t do anything, given that the designations themselves carried some force — for example, restricting Soleimani’s ability to travel and finance his operations. ""The sanctions reflect the fact that the Obama administration took a number of steps — some seen many others unseen — to constrain Soleimani’s activities,"" said Ned Price, who served as special assistant to Obama for national security affairs and was referred to us by an Obama spokesman. From 2011 on, Price argued, American service members and diplomats in Iraq were not attacked by Iranian proxies and militias as they have been since May 2018, when Trump implemented his maximum pressure strategy on Iran. In short, said Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute:  ""Designating entities and individuals in Iran are all meant to press Iran to change its ways, policies. So, they weren’t necessarily meant to be an end in itself."" Trump said Soleimani ""was a designated terrorist by President Obama, who didn't do anything about it."" The Obama administration did designate Soleimani as a terrorist. The designation did not mean he was being targeted to be killed, as Trump ultimately targeted him.  Obama’s designation did put some restrictions on Soleimani’s ability to travel and conduct financial transactions and, according to experts, was part of a U.S. effort to pressure Iran to change its ways on terrorism. But the terrorist attacks that the United States blamed on Soleimani continued, and Obama did not take action against Soleimani beyond the designations.
