"['National', 'Wealth', 'Charles Schumer']","
Does Donald Trump's cabinet collectively own more than what one-third of Americans do?
","President Donald Trump’s promise to ""drain the swamp"" was not convincing to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who illustrated his criticism with Trump’s billionaire cabinet, which ""has more wealth than a third of the American people total -- close to a 100 million people."" That seems like a large share of wealth in cabinet member’s pockets. But is Schumer right? He is, although his comparison is disputed among economists because so many Americans have a low net worth. Schumer specifically talks about the ""net wealth"" of cabinet members.  Net wealth is how much a person’s assets are worth once you have subtracted liabilities, like mortgage or credit card debt. If a person has high debt that exceeds their assets, their net wealth is negative. It is impossible to calculate the exact net wealth of Trump’s cabinet, because the members are only required to indicate a range while filling out their financial disclosure forms, such as ""between $15,001 and $50,000"". The ranges can vary by up to 25 million. That is a pretty vague indication. Schumer’s office cited an article from December by the website Quartz that evaluated the wealth of 17 of Trump’s cabinet members to be more than $9.5 billion. Other news media, like the NBC News estimated it to be as high as $14.5 billion. We looked at data provided by OpenSecrets and publicly available financial disclosure forms and found a much lower number: $3.5 billion, not including assets of spouses. Due to a lack of information, we could not add Sonny Perdue, the nominee for Secretary of Agriculture, and Alexander Acosta, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Labor, to that number. However, it would not have made a big difference. It also doesn’t really matter how rich Trump’s cabinet members exactly are. According to the Federal Reserve, a U.S. household had an average net wealth of $46,700 in 2013, which are the most recent numbers available. However, the bulk of wealth in the United States is owned by the top 10 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bottom half only holds 1 percent of U.S. wealth distribution. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that in 2011 the bottom quintile of Americans had a negative net wealth of -$6,029 and the second quintile had a net wealth of $7,263. This is compared to a large difference with the third quintile: $68,839 in 2011. The number keeps rising exponentially for the fourth quintile who own $205,985 and the highest quintile who owned $630,754. ""The bottom one-third of American households ranked by wealth own approximately nothing,"" says Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of Berkeley. That is because some either have a very low or even negative net wealth, due to high debt. For that matter, it does not take a lot to ""have more wealth than a third of the American people,"" like Schumer claimed, Zuchman added. So even if Trump’s cabinet were all people from the middle class, Schumer’s statement would still be accurate. Our ruling Schumer said that Trump’s cabinet had more net wealth than a third of the American people. He bases his claims on an estimate of $9.5 billion of net wealth for the cabinet. Economists familiar with those kinds of comparison told us that Schumer got his numbers right. But they also told us that there needs to be clarification on the meaningfulness of Schumer’s statement, since it doesn’t take billions of dollars to be richer than the bottom third of of the United States. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('Quartz, ""Trump’s first 17 cabinet-level picks have more money than a third of American households combined"", Dec. 15, 2016', 'https://qz.com/862412/trumps-16-cabinet-level-picks-have-more-money-than-a-third-of-american-households-combined/'), ('E-mail, Gabriel Zucman, Economist at University of Berkeley, Mar. 7, 2017', 'No link'), ('E-mail, Dan Mitchell, Economist at Cato Institute, on Mar. 7, 2017', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-s-cabinet-picks-have-combined-wealth-11b-how-did-n692681'), ('NBC News, ""Trump’s Cabinet Picks Have a Combined Wealth of $14.5B.

"['Florida', 'Richard Corcoran']","
Fact-checking Florida House speaker's claim about a watered-down Lockheed Martin jobs deal
","Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran sharpened his ax against economic incentives by calling out companies with state deals by name. Corcoran singled out aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin during a speech at the Panhandle Tiger Bay Club on March 17. Corcoran told a story about the company as an example of how easy it is to walk back ambitious job goals prescribed in state incentive contracts. ""I say, I promise you 305 jobs, and then I come back to you and say, ‘Hey, I'm not close on the jobs. Can you help me out?’ You know what they do? ‘No problem, we'll amend your contract. How many jobs can you deliver?’ Six. ‘Fine. Now, the contract says you will deliver six jobs.’ And then we go out and tout it community to community as a success."" Corcoran continued: ""That’s a true story, Lockheed Martin."" We wondered if there is evidence that a Lockheed Martin contract was amended to reduce the number of new jobs that needed to be created from 305 to just six. Corcoran’s story has some truth but oversimplifies what happened. What the state recommended at first Lockheed Martin has multiple facilities throughout the state, including in Orlando and Ocala, and is involved in more than one job incentive project on job deals, according to state data. Corcoran was referring to a $4 million incentive deal for a facility in Oldsmar, located in northern Pinellas County. In September 2012, the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, an agency created in 2011 to oversee incentive programs, informed the Legislature about a proposed deal between Enterprise Florida and Lockheed Martin to bring jobs to Pinellas County. (The DEO has to notify the Legislature when an incentive deal of this kind worth more than $2 million is being considered.) DEO provided the Legislature the first outline of the deal for Lockheed Martin's Pinellas facility, which was signed by Gov. Rick Scott. Part of the plan hinged on whether Lockheed Martin would win the bid for a contract to develop and build the U.S. Navy’s new Air and Missile Defense Radar, or AMDR. Lockheed Martin officials had said its other facilities in the Northeast were also in competition with Oldsmar for the gig. The outline said: ""If Lockheed Martin wins the AMDR contract and chooses to complete the work in Pinellas County, the company will create 305 new and retain 554 full time jobs over the life of this project."" Based on the document, Lockheed Martin and the DEO wanted to use the extra cash to renovate the Oldsmar facility and invest more in manufacturing equipment. This would make the facility more competitive with the other companies bidding for the defense contract. ""Anything that Lockheed Martin can do to help make the project more economically feasible helps to create a more competitive bid,"" reads the 2012 document. The recommendation was for the state to award the company $4 million in one chunk once the facility held 726 jobs, showed a $14 million capital investment, and maintained an average wage of $59,000. Corcoran’s team said the draft of the project was presented to the Legislature as a done deal. But that’s not how the DEO sees it. 305 jobs taken out before final contract DEO press secretary Morgan McCord said the agency informed the Legislature during the negotiation period that the recommended job metrics were being changed. Those revisions came about a month before the contract was signed and executed. McCord sent over a copy of an email sent to legislative leadership and budget staff on April 16, 2013, that went over the changes. That email shows DEO and Lockheed Martin agreed to revise a projected job creation and payment schedule. The result was a new goal: the retention of 560 jobs — just six more than the earlier draft — for an average of 700 jobs by 2022.  Why the change? DEO officials still believed Lockheed Martin was in the running for the defense contract, but the company would not need to ramp up its new jobs as high as originally thought. It would be hard to ""precisely estimate"" job levels every year over the term of the agreement, the contract said. ""As a result, the company has requested that it set a job target number (560) to be reached at a minimum each performance year to qualify for the closing fund award,"" reads the emailed explanation for the changes in payment conditions. Here's more detail:  Here's what Corcoran was calling out: the new minimum target is 560 jobs a year instead of 554. That's six more jobs. Lockheed Martin doesn’t necessarily have to meet the 700-job average every year in order to get state dollars; it just needs to hit the 560-job minimum. The DEO document said the overall goal of the project ""remains the same: the retention and expansion of the company's manufacturing operations in the City of Oldsmar."" Scott approved the revisions. The contract was finalized on May 30, 2013. Lockheed Martin didn’t find out until late October 2013 that it wasn’t awarded the AMDR contract. (It went to Raytheon.) An amended contract was approved May 26, 2015 to reflect the fact that Lockheed Martin did not win the defense contract. This change did not alter job creation requirements, wage requirements, capital investment or return on investment under the final terms of the contract.  Those stipulate that in order to get the first seven $500,000 payments from the state between 2016 to 2022, Lockheed Martin must retain 560 jobs every year. In order to get the final $500,000 payment, it has to have at least 700 jobs in year eight and average at least 700 jobs in the previous seven years. Despite losing the missile defense bid, Lockheed Martin told the DEO that it was still committed to growing its Oldsmar facility and said it would stay committed to the key terms of the project that were agreed upon in 2013. Lockheed Martin has not received any money yet for 2016. The DEO and a third-party auditor are reviewing the company's performance for 2016. If the the company met  its performance requirements, it will receive the first $500,000 payment. Our ruling Corcoran said the state reworked an incentive contract with Lockheed Martin after the company asked to lower its job creation from 305 jobs to six. Corcoran is onto something, but there's additional information readers need to know. State officials recommended Lockheed Martin receive incentive dollars as the company pursued a hefty missile defense contract from the federal government. If awarded, the state incentives contract said Lockheed Martin would create 305 new jobs in Pinellas County. Before the state contract was finalized, state officials agreed to amend the language about 305 jobs so that Lockheed Martin could receive $500,000 a year for seven years as long as it retained at least 560 jobs (six more jobs in addition to 554 already in place).  Corcoran left out that the jobs were contingent on a federal grant. With that caveat, we rate his statement Mostly True.","[('YouTube, ""Panhandle Tiger Bay Club | Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran,"" Published March 19', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=InLzdP7SPx8&app=desktop'), ('Interviews, Fred Picciolo, spokesperson for Richard Corcoran, March 20-23', 'No link'), ('Interviews, Morgan McCord, press secretary for the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, March 21-23', 'https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive?ths=true'), ('Interviews on background, JoAnne Leznoff, staff director for the House Appropriations Committee, March 22', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/mar/27/richard-corcoran/fact-checking-florida-house-speakers-claim-about-l/
"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Hugh Hewitt']","
Is Obamacare in a 'death spiral'?
","Republican leaders say they will table health care talks following the defeat of the House GOP to replace Obamacare. As House Speaker Paul Ryan put it, ""Obamacare is the law of the land."" But some conservatives say that President Barack Obama’s signature piece of legislation can’t last much longer, regardless of whether Congress finds a legislative compromise. ""It is in a death spiral,"" conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said March 26 on Meet the Press. ""The New York Times yesterday pointed out that — the president of Aetna — that you will lose coverage in many places in America for everyone, and that to me is a death spiral for those people."" The idea that Obamacare is in a ""death spiral"" — a specific term used in the health insurance industry — is a claim that we’ve heard before. Experts say Hewitt is incorrect. We reached out to Hewitt through his radio program but did not hear back. Still no ‘death spiral’ ""Death spiral"" is a health industry term built around three components: Shrinking enrollment; Healthy people leaving the system; Rising premiums. Specifically, a death spiral occurs when shrinking enrollment leads to a deteriorating risk pool (or when healthy people leave the plan due to the cost). That leads to higher premiums for the people remaining in the insurance pools, which causes enrollment to shrink even further, continuing the cycle until the entire system fails. The latest government figures show enrollment in the Affordable Care Act is slightly down from last year. Through Jan. 31, 2017, some 12.2 million people were signed up for coverage through a federal or state marketplace, which is a decrease of 500,000, or 4 percent, from the same point last year. Experts noted that marketplace sign-ups were running in line with their 2016 pace as of the middle of January, which experts said might suggest the decline in sign-ups was somehow related to the Trump administration, not an impending death spiral. For example, the Trump administration decided to at least partially halt marketing and outreach encouraging people to sign up for health coverage. But experts say the enrollment decline isn’t an indication the health care law is in a death spiral. There is no direct connection, they said, showing that the declining enrollment is causing premiums to increase. Why not? Because federal government subsidies in the form of tax credits are largely shielding customers from feeling the premium increase. As we have reported, premiums are increasing. But that isn’t affecting the cost for most consumers, due to built-in subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The subsidies cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400 percent of the federal poverty level (in 2016 that would be $47,520 for a single person). Among the people who have signed up so far for 2017, 81 percent will receive a subsidy. Data also shows no uptick in healthy people leaving the health insurance market. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports the share of people signing up for health care in the low-risk demographic — ages 18-34 — remains about the same in 2017 as it was in 2016, at 26 percent of enrollees. ""There is no data to indicate a drop in the number of younger enrolled, although the announced policy not to enforce the IRS penalty, if not reversed, could result in a decline over time,"" said John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care. Hewitt referred to a New York Times article that quotes the president of Aetna saying that in many places people will lose health care insurance. We couldn’t find that article, but a simple remark on how premiums are rising and insurers are leaving the marketplace is not enough evidence to meet the actuarial definition of a death spiral. CBO, independent analysis: No death spiral Others have also concluded that the Affordable Care Act is not in a death spiral. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, as part of its recent analysis of the GOP legislation, described the Affordable Care Act as stable. Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, similarly concluded in a recent analysis that the Affordable Care Act is not in a death spiral. Fiedler found that marketplace premium increases had little if any impact on health insurance sign-ups and that the impact on the individual market risk pool will more than likely be minor, despite the small decline in enrollment numbers. ""It therefore remains likely that insurers’ individual market business will return to a roughly break-even or slightly profitable position in 2017, absent other policy changes,"" Fiedler wrote. Our ruling Hewitt said Obamacare is ""in a death spiral."" That’s a specific phrase that describes a process where health people leaving the insurance market causes insurance premiums to rise to the point that more healthy people leave the market. At some point, the system becomes unsustainable. Experts say there is no evidence that cycle has started with Obamacare, because federal subsidies are keeping people from feeling the brunt of premium increases. The CBO and other independent analyses have found the health care system to be stable. We rate this claim False.","[('Email, Paul Ginsburg, University of Southern California professor of the practice of health policy and management, March 26', 'https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/18/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-wrongly-claims-actuaries-have-determined/'), ('Email interview, John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, March 26', 'No link'), (""Interview, Sherry Glied, dean of NYU's Graduate School of Public Service, March 26"", 'https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2017-Fact-Sheet-items/2017-03-15.html?DLPage=1&DLEntries=10&DLSort=0&DLSortDir=descending'), ('Interview with Timothy Jost, a health-care policy expert at Washington & Lee law school, March 26', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/mar/26/hugh-hewitt/obamacare-death-spiral/
"['History', 'Missouri', 'Roy Blunt']","
Fact-check: Roy Blunt wrong about Donald Trump Cabinet confirmations
","Last month during Trump’s Cabinet nomination hearings, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt stood up to deliver his support for the confirmation of Jeff Sessions for U.S. Attorney General. To open his remarks, Blunt pointed out how lengthy the process had become. ""Somebody observed this week that you have to go back to the very founding of the government to the first administration of George Washington to find a time when it’s taken longer to put a Cabinet in place,"" Blunt said. Blunt’s claim was made on Feb. 8, 2017 — just 19 days into Trump’s presidency. This seemed like a very short time period to be considered the longest Cabinet appointment process. So we wondered, whose Cabinet took the longest to put in place, and how did Trump compare 19 days in? The data A spokesperson for Blunt provided data taken from the Senate Historical Office to back his claim. The data showed every presidential nominee since 1789, their position, the date of their nomination and whether the nominee was confirmed, withdrawn or rejected. For the purpose of this fact check, we wanted to look at how many days it took after a president was inaugurated for his Cabinet to be completely in place. Part of Blunt’s claim deals with how George Washington’s Cabinet appointment process was the longest and the only one that took longer than Trump’s. So we decided to start there. The Washington administration After counting the number of days between a president’s first elected term inauguration and the date his Cabinet was in place, we found that Washington did in fact rank as the longest. Even though it only took the Senate a day to confirm most of Washington’s nominations, there were still 149 days between the time he was inaugurated and the time his Cabinet was fully in place. Much of this had to do with the fact that the country and its government were so new. The Top 5 After Washington, Barack Obama had the second-longest Cabinet appointment process. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius was confirmed on April 28, 2009 — 98 days after Obama was inaugurated. It took 42 days from the time Sebelius was nominated till the day she was confirmed. She was also just one of four Obama Cabinet members who took longer than the 19-day benchmark that was set by Blunt’s claim. Following Obama, in the third spot was Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson became president in 1963 after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so for the purpose of this fact-check, we looked at Johnson’s first elected term in 1965. His Cabinet took 64 days to be finalized, with the confirmation of Secretary of the Treasury Henry H. Fowler. Next is George H.W. Bush, with the fourth-longest Cabinet appointment process. It took 56 days for his Cabinet to be fully in place. Like Obama, four of his nominations also took 19 days or longer to be confirmed. However, one of Bush’s appointments for Secretary of Defense, John G. Tower, was rejected by a 47-53 vote on March 9, 1989. Five days later, Bush nominated Dick Cheney, who was then confirmed on March 17, 1989, to complete his Cabinet. Rounding out the top five of the longest Cabinet appointment processes was Bill Clinton. It took 50 days for Clinton to have his entire Cabinet confirmed, and the process ended with the confirmation of Janet Reno for Attorney General on March 11, 1993. His previous nominee for Attorney General, Zoë E. Baird, withdrew six days after her nomination. The context So why do some Cabinet processes taking longer than others then? Paul Light, a professor at NYU Wagner and an expert on the Cabinet appointment process, said it really has to do with each president’s preparation beforehand. ""What’s unusual is the slowness with which Trump has made nominations,"" Light said. ""Once these nominations are made, the process is just very difficult."" What Light is referring to here is the Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2015. The act gives presidential nominees money, office space and the opportunity to pre-clear potential nominees before they take office. According to Light, Trump did none of this. ""He was starting from scratch the day after the election, and he took many of those weeks after Election Day for a victory tour,"" Light said. Light also said the public isn’t always aware of what goes on before an announcement of a nomination is even made— a process that can be very lengthy . ""This is a process that is highly constrained by all the questions that have to be answered,"" Light said. ""We hear about all the delays that occur once a candidate is nominated, but we don’t hear about the delays in between making the phone call and the official announcement."" During this time frame, potential nominees are subjected to a questionnaire, as well as an ethics test. Light said that in recent years these questionnaires have become much denser. Once someone is officially nominated, the process isn’t just reserved to the Senate confirmation hearing. The FBI compiles a list of all potential problems with nominees. This happens by sending out students in the FBI Academy to speak with people who know the nominee, including neighbors. The FBI then compiles a report that is handed over to the Senate committee chairs. Where Trump falls So where does Trump fall in all of this? As of Feb. 8, when Blunt made his claim, six of Trump’s nominees had been confirmed, with the last being Jeff Sessions for attorney general. However, the Cabinet confirmation process is still ongoing, so it’s hard to tell exactly where Trump will fall when all is said and done. As of March 23, there are two nominees who have yet to be confirmed— Sonny Perdue for Secretary of Agriculture and Alexander Acosta for Secretary of Labor. But at 19 days into his term, Trump technically would fall behind Clinton, who took 50 days to have a complete Cabinet in place. Our ruling Blunt said the only Cabinet that took longer to be put in place was that of Washington's, who had the very first in U.S. history. Blunt made the claim on Feb. 8, 19 days into Trump’s presidential term. At PolitiFact, we rate statements based on the information available at the time they were made. And in that context, Blunt is clearly incorrect. We rate this claim False.","[('http://us-presidents.insidegov.com', 'http://us-presidents.insidegov.com/'), ('Youtube statement from Blunt\xa0', 'No link'), ('Telephone interview with Paul Light, Goddard Professor of Public Service at NYU Wagner', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWYnZFs0kJc')]",/factchecks/2017/mar/25/roy-blunt/fact-check-roy-blunt-wrong-about-donald-trump-cabi/

Disproportionate share of SAFE Act arrests made in New York City
","Republican lawmakers in Albany are pushing a new proposal to repeal New York state’s 2013 gun control law, the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, or SAFE Act. They want to repeal the law only in counties outside New York City. It would remain on the books for the city’s five boroughs. Marc Butler, a Republican Assemblyman from the North Country, claims the law is not effective upstate. ""We did a random survey of some of the counties,"" Butler said. ""We have counties where there have been one arrest under the SAFE Act. It indicates there's not a whole lot of interest in enforcing this in our upstate counties."" Is Butler right that some counties have only had one SAFE Act violation in four years? And is there ""not a whole lot of interest in enforcing this"" in upstate counties? The SAFE Act The SAFE Act passed the New York State Legislature in a whirlwind January 2013 vote, soon after 26 people -- 20 students and six adults -- were shot and killed on Dec. 14, 2012, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The SAFE Act places additional regulations on gun owners and dealers on what guns need to be registered, how guns can be bought and sold, and how those guns can be used. The law expanded the definition of what’s considered an assault weapon in New York state and required those guns to be registered. The law also required almost universal background checks on gun sales in New York state. The law requires anyone who wants to buy a gun to make the sale through a federally licensed dealer. Those dealers are required to perform background checks before approving the sale. Before the SAFE Act, residents were able to privately buy or sell guns without any background checks. Now, even if someone wants to give a gun to a family member or neighbor, it has to go through a federal dealer. Downstate arrests  Since the law's passage, there have been 11,893 arrests for SAFE Act violations in New York state through Feb. 17, according to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services. A disproportionate number of the arrests happened in New York City. Some 9,593 arrests were made in New York City compared with 1,641 arrests upstate and 659 arrests on Long Island or in the suburban Westchester and Rockland counties. New York City has the most SAFE Act arrests per capita with one arrest for every 692 people in the city. Long Island and the city's suburbs recorded one arrest for every 4,838 adults. Upstate arrests In upstate New York, there has been one SAFE Act arrest for every 3,411 adults since 2013. Erie County’s 254 arrests were the most among upstate counties. That's one SAFE Act arrest for every 2,870 adults in the county. Onondaga County had a higher SAFE Act arrest rate: one arrest for every 1,579 adults. Albany County had one arrest for every 5,400 residents and Monroe County had one arrest for every 3,514 adults. The arrests in most of those counties were concentrated in their largest cities. Buffalo had 78 percent of Erie County's arrests. Rochester had 81 percent of Monroe County's arrests. And, Syracuse had 87 percent of the arrests in Onondaga County. Albany County was the exception with only 48 percent of the county's arrests happening in the city of Albany. Some 172 arrests were in Oneida County, the fourth most upstate, and it had a rate of one arrest for every 1,066 adults.  Oneida County District Attorney Scott McNamara says he treats the SAFE Act like any other law. ""Whether I politically agree with a certain section of the law, or I don’t agree with it, I don’t let that affect what I do,"" McNamara said. ""What I do professionally and what I might think or talk about at breakfast with my wife are two different things. I leave my personal opinions to the side."" Eight counties, all upstate, had fewer than five SAFE Act arrests since the law took effect: Allegany, Chemung, Columbia, Hamilton, Schuyler, Wyoming, Tioga, and Lewis counties. Tioga and Lewis counties reported no SAFE Act arrests at all. Wyoming County is the only county with just one SAFE Act arrest. In that case, the offender gave a gun to someone not legally allowed to own one. ""We aren't seeing the violations,"" Wyoming County Sheriff Gregory Rudolph said. But law enforcement officials say they are not ignoring the law. People are obeying the law. ""To say our numbers are low because of lacking enforcement, we’re turning a blind eye? Never,"" Hamilton County Sheriff Karl Abrams said. ""It’s definitely less violators than downstate. They do everything by the book. They don’t do illegal transfers. They don’t do anything like that."" Our ruling Butler said ""we have counties where there have been one arrest under the SAFE Act. It indicates there's not a whole lot of interest in enforcing this in our upstate counties."" One county does indeed have just one arrest under the SAFE Act, and a handful of others have few arrests. But some upstate counties have large numbers of arrests. And even where there have been few arrests, law enforcement officials believe those numbers have more to do with residents complying with the law than authorities' lack of enthusiasm for enforcing it. We rate his claim as Half True.","[('Press conference to repeal the NY SAFE Act in upstate New York, March 1, 2017', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZZKBU0a-qY'), ('Phone conversation with Hamilton County Sheriff Karl Abrams', 'No link'), ('Email conversation with Bernadette VanDeinse from the New York State Assembly', 'https://safeact.ny.gov/gun-owners'), ('Email and phone conversation with Janine Kava from the Division of Criminal Justice Services', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/mar/24/marc-butler/most-safe-act-arrests-have-been-new-york-city/

But a high-ranking PepsiCo employee should probably understand, right? Well that’s not what it sounded like in a tweet earlier this week from the anti-tax coalition Ax The Bev Tax.

And even in the realm of sweetened beverages there are some exceptions. Drinks that are at least 50 percent milk, baby formula, 100 percent juice, at least 50 percent ""fresh"" fruit or vegetable  are not taxed. Chen’s conversation with Jones lasted for several minutes, based on the audio file from WURD’s website. So Ax The Bev Tax edited it down for purposes of the tweet. And not only did they shorten Chen’s conversation, the alteration of the clip adjusted what she said. In her original conversation with Jones, Chen said, ""We offer a tremendous amount of low calorie, no calorie options, like waters, unsweetened products, low calorie diet items. All of which unfortunately -- or most of which -- are taxed by this tax."" Ax the Bev Tax’s clip removed ""or most of which,"" the portion of her statement where she realized her error of saying all those drinks would be taxed and corrected herself. Speaking for PepsiCo and Ax The Bev Tax, Anthony Campisi said it was an editing error committed by someone ""still getting oriented with the nuances of the tax"" and that the anti-soda tax coalition had consistently claimed from the beginning the tax only applies to sweetened beverages. He called it an honest mistake and said, ""this just seems like in the grand scheme of things about the beverage tax to be really small stuff."" Our ruling The Ax The Bev Tax Twitter account played a clip of Pepsi employee Amy Chen saying ""We offer a tremendous amount of low calorie, no calorie options, like waters, unsweetened products, low calorie diet items. All of which unfortunately are taxed by this tax."" Water, as long as it has no sweeteners added, and unsweetened beverages are not taxed. Chen actually said on the radio show that ""most"" of those types of beverages were taxed, but Ax The Bev Tax’s clip was altered. Ax The Bev Tax has acknowledged the clip is inaccurate, with spokesperson Anthony Campisi chalking it up to an editing error by someone still getting familiar with the nuances of the tax. But the error was still made. A true statement by Chen was turned into a false statement by Ax The Bev Tax. PolitiFact regularly challenges politicians who make claims and then later admitted they made a mistake or misspoke or walk their original statement back. This is similar.

NY Rep. Maloney: More than half Planned Parenthood clinics are in underserved areas
","During debate on the Republican health care bill, U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., spoke passionately about the impact it will have on women’s health and especially on Planned Parenthood. ""We all know by now that the recent CBO analysis has bad news for millions of Americans, but it has some especially bad news for women,"" Maloney said on the House floor on March 16, 2017, the same day that the House Budget Committee approved the bill. ""The GOP plan makes Planned Parenthood ineligible for any reimbursement from Medicaid or Medicare for one entire year,"" Maloney said. ""More than half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or medically underserved areas."" Maloney was right that the bill restricts funds for Planned Parenthood. The American Health Care Act has a provision that won’t allow states to use direct spending of federal funds on prohibited entities.  Planned Parenthood is a prohibited entity under the bill because it is a provider that is ""primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health and related medical care"" or ""provides for abortion"" in any situation besides saving the life of the mother, incest or rape.   We were intrigued, however, by the claim that half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or underserved areas. It’s a tricky thing to measure, but the evidence suggests the claim is sound. Our research Maloney’s spokeswoman Jennifer Bell pointed us to data from Planned Parenthood’s website. Statistics there show that 54% of Planned Parenthood facilities are located in health professional shortage areas, rural or medically underserved areas.  This percentage was calculated by the Health Resources & Services Administration Shortage Area Database system. The HRSA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The HRSA's programs help provide health care to people who are geographically isolated, or economically or medically vulnerable. The agency identifies areas where health care is difficult to come by.  Planned Parenthood matched up their locations to the HRSA data.  Mark Holmes, an associate professor in health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, told us the government system of identifying underserved areas is reliable.   ""The HRSA database for shortage areas is pretty accurate.  In terms of additional context, there are multiple types of shortage areas,"" he explained. Holmes said some shortage areas are designated as a ""population"" shortage area.  ""This area is okay in general, but for certain kinds of populations, they may have a tough time getting the care they need,"" he said. He used an example of ""low-income"" populations.  ""Medicaid beneficiaries may live in an area with lots of providers, none of whom take Medicaid, so then although it looks like the area is well-served, there is actually a considerable shortage,"" Holmes said. ""In Planned Parenthood’s case, I don’t think that is a problem because so many of Planned Parenthood’s clients are lower income, according to their data."" We ran this by two other health care experts, and they said that the claim was accurate. Our ruling Maloney said, ""More than half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or medically underserved areas."" That claim is supported by data from Planned Parenthood and the federal health care database.  Experts familiar with the data told us that there is enough evidence to show Maloney was on target with her claim. We rate this claim True.","[('Twitter, Carolyn Maloney, Video of statement, March 16, 2017', 'https://twitter.com/RepMaloney/status/842422482518867969'), ('Email interview, Jennifer Bell, press secretary for Carolyn Maloney, March 22, 2017', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Catherine Lozada, Planned Parenthood media relations, March 22, 2017', 'https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/4314/8183/5009/20161207_Defunding_fs_d01_1.pdf'), ('Planned Parenthood, The Urgent Need for Planned Parenthood Health Centers, March 22, 2017', 'No link'), ('HRSA, Find Shortage Areas by Address, March 22, 2017', 'https://datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/tools/analyzers/geo/ShortageArea.aspx'), ('Email interview, Mark Holmes, associate professor in health policy and management at UNC, March 23, 2017', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/mar/24/carolyn-maloney/ny-rep-maloney-most-planned-parenthood-clinics-are/

Price is right: North Carolina would have nation's second-highest costs if AHCA replaces Obamacare
","As the U.S. House of Representatives prepares to vote on a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, North Carolina Rep. David Price said few people in the country will fare worse than North Carolinians if the repeal plan passes. ""Under the Republican health care repeal proposal: North Carolina faces the 2nd highest premium increase in the nation,"" according to a report released by Price’s office. ""North Carolina residents will face an average cost increase of over $7,500."" The Republicans’ American Health Care Act would repeal the ACA (also known as Obamacare) and would, among many other changes, replace Obamacare’s income-based tax credits for health insurance with flat tax credits. More on all that later. It’s no surprise that Price, a Democrat who represents a liberal area of the Triangle, is against the AHCA. But the numbers he threw out were a bit surprising. They could also have big political consequences for the state’s 10 Republican members of the House of Representatives – if Price’s price is right. Price’s office repeated the claim nearly verbatim in a press release and took to social media urging people to read the report. Which version of the bill is Price talking about? Price made this claim Wednesday, when he shared his office’s report on social media, calling the bill, ""devastating for lower-income and older North Carolinians."" Note: We’re fact checking Price’s claim based on the original GOP legislation, since that was what his claim referred to. Shortly after Price made this claim, the GOP canceled a planned vote on the AHCA and re-wrote some parts of it; those changes have yet to be studied in-depth. For a breakdown of the AHCA’s proposed tax credits and other changes, see this primer from PolitiFact or this fact-check on how it affects different income levels. Price is talking about the effects on the more than half a million North Carolinians who buy their health insurance individually – not people who get it through their work or through government programs, like the VA or Medicaid. Those people on the individual marketplace are about 5 percent of the state’s population. So when Price says ""North Carolina residents will face an average cost increase of over $7,500,"" that’s a bit misleading. The numbers are right – as we’ll explain shortly – but they don’t really apply to the average person, as Price insinuates. People who are insured through work or through government programs would see different effects than the average person buying insurance individually. Average cost increase Now let’s take a look at that ""more than $7,500"" average increase in costs under the AHCA. Price said that includes increases in both out-of-pocket expenses (by $5,921 on average) and insurance premiums (an average of $1,628 more). A premium is the cost of health insurance. Out-of-pocket expenses include copays, coinsurance and deductibles. And Price's math is solid. It’s been backed up by research by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care think tank, and by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""Kaiser tends to be mechanically very sound,"" said David Anderson, a researcher at Duke University’s Health Policy Evidence Hub. ""So if you see something from Kaiser, you can trust it."" Anderson said the number Price cited on premium increases checks out, and the out-of-pocket expense figure is either correct or maybe slightly high. He said it’s ""in the ballpark … maybe a little aggressive."" Price is also correct that North Carolina’s increase would be the second-highest in the country. Alaska is first by a long shot, but North Carolina’s average cost increase would be about $1,000 more than in the next state, which is Oklahoma. Alaska and North Carolina are No. 1 and 2 in both average increases and average total costs, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found. Why is North Carolina’s cost so high? North Carolina also has some of the highest costs under Obamacare. Part of the reason is that it has the country’s second-largest total rural population, as well as the highest percentage of rural residents among the 10 largest states. In rural areas where there tend to be fewer hospitals, Anderson said, insurance costs are higher. Urban areas, with more competition among hospitals, have lower health care costs. Obamacare controls for variations like that with tax credits based on income levels and local health care costs. The AHCA would instead give flat tax credits, which would cause wide variations everywhere – especially in North Carolina. So it’s hard to describe what would happen to a ""typical"" person if the bill becomes law. But here are a few examples of what could happen, as of 2020, if Obamacare is replaced by the AHCA, according to the Kaiser report. The figures include the final costs, after tax credits, for both health plans. Those findings are in line with research from Avik Roy, a conservative health care analyst. Roy was a health care policy advisor to the Republican presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney in 2012 and Rick Perry in 2016. Last week he wrote that ""the AHCA’s approach, if left unchanged, would lead to significant spikes in net insurance premiums for lower-income participants in the individual insurance market, with particular problems for those in their fifties and sixties."" He added that North Carolina is one of seven states where customers will fare the worst under the AHCA, due to its switch from an income-based tax credit to a flat tax credit. ""A means-tested credit ... has one additional advantage over the method used currently in the AHCA,"" he wrote. ""It does a better job of protecting those who live in high-cost states … like Alaska, Nebraska, Arizona, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Wyoming, and Louisiana."" Future changes The studies we’ve examined so far evaluate what would happen between now and 2020. That year is the turning point, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, for when nationwide premiums might start to become lower on average. And why would premiums, on average, go down after 2020? The Congressional Budget Office estimated 14 million people will drop their health insurance next year if the AHCA passes, and there will be 21 million fewer insured people by 2020. Many of them would be older people with high costs, so their dropping insurance would drive average costs down. But those are national estimates. We wondered what would happen specifically in North Carolina after 2020. Unfortunately, we don’t really know. The bulk of state-specific research into the AHCA so far has focused on its immediate impact, pre-2020. Our ruling David Price said that if the AHCA passes in its current form, ""North Carolina faces the 2nd highest premium increase in the nation. North Carolina residents will face an average cost increase of over $7,500."" Price’s numbers are accurate, at least in the short term as it applies to people buying insurance on the individual market. However, we don’t know what might happen after 2020. And the wording of Price’s claim is misleading in describing average ""North Carolina residents"" with no qualifier. In reality, the changes apply only to the 5 percent of people buying health insurance on the individual market. For those reasons, we rate this claim Half True.","[('Email and phone interviews with David Anderson, Duke University researcher', 'https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/david-anderson'), ('David Price’s Facebook post with the AHCA claims, Wednesday, March 22, 2017', 'No link'), ('The Brookings Institute, March 16, 2017, ""How will the House GOP health care bill affect individual market premiums?""', 'https://www.facebook.com/RepDavidEPrice/videos/1279299042138637/ '), ('Rep.

Trump: Since China joined WTO, U.S. has lost 60,000 factories
","Speaking at a March 20 rally in Louisville, Ky., President Donald Trump said he wants to be like Henry Clay, a 19th century Kentucky politician who Trump said was ""a fierce advocate for manufacturing."" From there, Trump launched into his usual critique of United States free trade policy over the last 20 years, laying out what he’s going to do to address trade imbalances with Mexico and China, in particular. ""Since China joined — that’s another beauty — the WTO in 2001, the U.S. has lost many more than 60,000 factories,"" he said. We’ve heard Trump make this claim about the effects of China joining the World Trade Organization in a few different speeches since becoming president, so we wanted to put it on the Truth-O-Meter. We reached out to the White House for Trump’s source but didn’t hear back. However, through our own research we found that the United States has, in fact, lost more than 60,000 factories since 2001, when China joined the WTO and became a bigger player in the world economy. And quite a few economists believe opening up trade with China has had a significant and negative effect on American manufacturing, though it’s not a universal view. To count the number of factories, we used the U.S. Census’ annual Statistics of U.S. Businesses series, which tallies the number of manufacturing establishments. An example of how the count works: Ford Motor Company has three U.S.-based transmission plants, two in Michigan and one in Ohio. That counts as three separate establishments. In 2001, the year China joined the WTO, the Census counted 352,619 manufacturing establishments. In 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, it counted 292,543. That’s a drop of 60,076 over those three years.   Another Census series, its Business Dynamics Statistics, tallied 348,513 manufacturing establishments in 2001 and 274,756 in 2014 — a drop of 73,757 manufacturing establishments. It’s not fair to assume that China’s economic rise is entirely responsible for all of these lost factories, as someone might think when they hear Trump’s statement, but it is certainly responsible for some. Around the same time China joined the WTO, the United States gave China permanent normal trade relations status. Both of these actions removed significant barriers to trade and investment with China, basically putting them on an even playing field with the United States’ other trading partners. In the 16 years since, United States imports from China have quadrupled, in large part because production is so cheap there, making U.S.-based manufacturers less competitive. We found three significant economic studies from the past few years that all conclude increased free trade with China has had a negative impact on American manufacturing and jobs. A  a 2014 report out of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that the U.S. trade deficit with China has cost 2.4 million manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2013. The report cites illegal Chinese policies that encourage exports and keep labor cheap, as well as a failure of the WTO agreement that endorsed China’s membership to prevent these sorts of actions. Proponents of expanding U.S.-China trade also overestimated the potential market for U.S. exports in China. Research conducted by a group of economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich and the University of California, San Diego, found comparable job losses due to import competition from China. They found that areas in the United States that had a large number of jobs in industries for which imports from China surged have suffered the most. A third analysis co-authored by Justin Pierce, a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve Board, and Peter Schott, a Yale economist, found a causal relationship between factory closures and China’s permanent normal trade relations status. One reason for this connection is that in granting China this status, the United States agreed not to raise tariffs on Chinese imports, and that newfound stability incentivized American businesses to move operations to China. While these analyses support Trump’s general idea that trade with China has caused some factory closures in the United States, none of them say how many. Robert Scott, director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute and co-author of the first study, told PolitiFact that trade with China is a leading cause of a decline in manufacturing, but there’s also growing trade deficits with other parts of Asia and Europe. A smaller factor in more recent years is the Great Recession and the slow recovery that followed. Bradford DeLong, an economic historian at the University of California, Berkeley, is less convinced that opening up trade with China had such a negative effect on U.S. manufacturing. Rather, he told PolitiFact that he estimates about one-tenth of factory closures over the past decade or so have had to do with China, but that would have happened whether or not China joined the WTO. In the years leading up to 2001, U.S. imports from China were already surging. He added that improved trade with China also might have allowed some new manufacturing establishments to open because of new opportunities to export goods and services to China. He said significantly increased manufacturing productivity in the United States, coupled with limited demand — there’s only so many refrigerators a person wants to buy — play a bigger role in factory closures in the United States. ""Manufacturing has become too productive to remain or ever again become a major source of employment on the shop floor,"" he said. Our ruling Trump said, ""Since China joined — that’s another beauty — the WTO in 2001, the U.S. has lost many more than 60,000 factories."" According to Census data, the United States has lost more than 60,000 factories since 2001. Economic experts told us that at least some of these losses can be attributed to increased trade with China, though there is not universal agreement on the extent of that impact.

Lowell Holtz says graduation rates soared for minority students when he ran the Beloit schools
","In his bid to unseat Tony Evers as state school superintendent, self-described ""kidservative"" Lowell Holtz criticizes Wisconsin’s dubious distinction of graduating white high school students at much higher rates than minority students. On his campaign blog, Holtz says his attention to safety and discipline as Beloit school superintendent from 2006 to 2009 improved the completion rate among high school students of color. Specifically, he claimed: ""Our minority graduation rate went from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%."" The statement caught our attention in part because Milwaukee and Madison have well-documented struggles with low graduation rates for black and Hispanic students. To back up his claim, the Holtz campaign pointed to data collected by the state Department of Public Instruction. It’s the best source of data in this case. We confined our review to graduation rates for African-American and Hispanic students because they make up most of the minority students in Beloit. Black students were 26 percent of the total enrollment there in 2006-’07, Holtz’s first year in the district. Hispanics made up 13 percent of the student body. Let’s look at the graduation rates from his time in Beloit, spanning three school years: For African Americans: 2006-’07: 64 percent 2007-’08: 76 percent 2008-09: 85 percent For Hispanics: 2006-’07: 74 percent 2007-’08: 75 percent 2008-’09: 84 percent The figures back up the part of Holtz’s claim about rates climbing over 80 percent on his watch. What about the contention that Beloit’s graduation rates started out below those of minority students in Milwaukee and Madison? At that time, 2006-’07, Beloit’s rate for black students was slightly lower than in Milwaukee, but slightly above Madison’s rate. So that’s a mixed bag. As for Hispanic students, the graduation rate in Beloit was higher than in either of those two districts in Holtz’s first year. But if you look back to the year before he arrived, Beloit’s graduation rate for Hispanic students was significantly lower than the rates in Milwaukee or Madison. Again, some support. For context, the graduation rate for white students in Beloit was considerably higher than for black students, but the gap between the groups narrowed dramatically by Holtz’s third year. That’s because while the rate for whites improved (topping Milwaukee and Madison), the rate for black students rose more. There is another aspect to Holtz’s claim -- to what degree did his policies influence the rate? Specific policy changes he helped enact fueled the progress, Holtz claims, pointing to improvements in safety and discipline. But experts, and Holtz, acknowledge that students, teachers, parents, elected officials and community members all have to play a role. That muddies the water on claiming credit. Our rating: Holtz says that when he ran the Beloit school district, ""Our minority graduation rate went from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%."" Rates rose significantly and topped 80 percent both for black students and Hispanic students. But the picture upon his arrival was not quite as bleak as Holtz claimed. We rate his claim Mostly True.","[('Lowell Holtz campaign blog post, March 18, 2017', 'http://www.kidservative.org/improve-discipline-safety-performance-will-follow/'), ('Interview with Charles Sanger, president, CS Communications, spokesman for Holtz campaign, March 21, 2017', 'No link'), ('Interview with Thomas McCarthy, communications director, Department of Public Instruction, March 21, 2017', 'https://dpi.wi.gov/wisedash/download-files/type?field_wisedash_upload_type_value=WINSS+Historical+Data+Files&field_wisedash_data_view_value=Certified'), ('WINSS historical data, graduation rates, accessed through Department of Public Instruction website, March 21, 2017', 'No link'), ('Beloit Daily News, ""Ex Beloit Superintendent Will Run for State Position,"" July 12, 2016', 'https://dpi.wi.gov/wisedash/download-files/type?field_wisedash_upload_type_value=WINSS+Historical+Data+Files&field_wisedash_data_view_value=Certified'), ('LinkedIn site, Lowell Holtz, accessed March 21, 2017', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/mar/24/lowell-holtz/lowell-holtz-says-graduation-rates-soared-minority/

Obama: No premium hike for 'vast majority' covered on government exchanges
","On the day House Republicans had scheduled a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare, the man whose name became synonymous with the sweeping health care law touted its accomplishments. Marking the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama released a statement saying that after a century of talk, ""we finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody."" ""Reality continues to discredit the false claim that this law is in a ‘death spiral,’ because while it’s true that some premiums have risen, the vast majority of Marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all,"" he wrote. We decided to vet the assertion that on average, the vast majority of people who signed up on a federal or state marketplaces saw no premium hike at all. Government numbers back that up, although the meaning of ""vast majority"" lies in the beholder. And it’s not as though premiums didn’t rise. They did, but most people purchasing health care through the marketplace didn’t feel it. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, about 12.2 million people signed up through a federal or state-based marketplace, also called an exchange. Of those, 7.8 million, about 64 percent, qualified for tax credits to reduce how much they personally would pay for coverage. Thanks to the tax credits, the average monthly bill for insurance stayed at $106 from 2016 to 2017, as the government chart below shows. The light blue represents the monthly premium paid by customers out-of-pocket. The darker blue represents the tax credit.  ""Premiums went up, but a lot of people were protected from that,"" said Katherine Hempstead, director of health insurance coverage at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropy and research group based in New Jersey. The Congressional Budget Office underscored that dynamic in its most recent report on health care legislation. The analysts wrote that many people ""are largely insulated from increases in premiums because their out-of-pocket payments for premiums are based on a percentage of their income; the government pays the difference."" On average, premiums rose about 32 percent. The government data on the actual premiums people pay isn’t 100 percent complete. Details on about 3 million people who signed up through state-based exchanges are missing. But Hempstead said in the past, people in both groups had similar experiences. ""The only place you can get the subsidy is through the exchanges, so for both the federal and the state exchanges, most of the enrollment is from people who qualify for the subsidies,"" Hempstead said. It’s worth noting that as premiums rise, so does the price tag for Washington. The death spiral debate Obama was rebutting fears about a death spiral. That concern lies outside this fact-check, but we’ll summarize the arguments on both sides here. A death spiral takes place when costs rise so fast, healthy people begin opting to pay a tax penalty rather than pay for health care. With sicker people making up a larger percentage of those left in the health insurance pool, the average cost of care rises dramatically. White House press secretary Sean Spicer took on Obama’s statement during his daily press briefing. ""Enrollment is nowhere near expectations and this year is actually declining,"" Spicer said. ""Insurers are fleeing the exchanges, and one in three counties only has one insurer."" A 2016 summary from Mark Farrah Associates, a private analytic service, reported that insurers who left the exchanges cited ""significant losses on Marketplace business"" due in part to lower numbers of healthy enrollees. As for enrollment overall, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, sign-ups fell by about 4 percent from 2016 to 2017. Outside analysts such as Hempstead say that’s not enough to spell trouble. ""Enrollments are largely holding steady,"" she said. ""There is no death spiral."" The Congressional Budget Office largely agreed. Comparing the Affordable Care Act with the Republican health care bill, the CBO wrote that ""the nongroup market would probably be stable in most areas under either current law or the legislation."" Our ruling Obama said that on average, the ""vast majority"" of people who have insurance through Obamacare experienced no premium increase. The actual numbers are that about 64 percent of enrollees saw their out-of-pocket premiums stay the same. So in terms of their personal experience, the former president is correct. However, premiums did rise. The reason many people didn’t feel it is because the government subsidies increased to insulate them. Obama was largely correct, but he brushed over the reality of rising premiums. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('Barack Obama, Statement from President Barack Obama On the 7th Anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, March 23, 2017', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nsp15I93gCVZQw9ajVl1zLVOpAqnm6JlKJjhNxGaCSM/edit?usp=sharing'), ('Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Health insurance marketplaces 2017 open enrollment period final enrollment report: November 1, 2016 – January 31, 2017, March 15, 2017', 'No link'), ('Congressional Budget Office, Cost estimate: The American Health Care Act, March 13, 2017', 'https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2017-Fact-Sheet-items/2017-03-15.html'), ('Washington Post, Right turn: Is Obamacare in a ‘death spiral’ or just in need of important reforms?, March 15,2017', 'No link'), ('Los Angeles Times, Obamacare 101: Are health insurance marketplaces in a death spiral?, Feb. 23, 2017', 'https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact.pdf'), (""Townhall, Analysis: Would GOPCare Actually Stop the Obamacare Risk Pool 'Death Spiral'?, March 10, 2017"", 'No link'), ('MSNBC, White House - daily press briefing, March 23, 2016', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/03/15/is-obamacare-in-a-death-spiral-or-just-in-need-of-important-reforms/?utm_term=.0513479a6f6b'), ('Fox News, Cavuto interview with Rep.

Does South Florida lead nation in gap between wages and housing?
","South Florida’s housing market spans the gamut of tony gated oceanfront mansions for millionaires and some downtrodden neighborhoods. That’s not unusual for a major urban area. But is it worse in South Florida than elsewhere in the nation? Habitat for Humanity painted a stark picture about the cost of housing in South Florida in a press release announcing that President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, retired Dr. Ben Carson, will visit the site of a future affordable housing development in Broward County on March 24. ""Studies indicate that while Broward County is the most cost-burdened housing market in the nation, South Florida ranks No. 1 in the gap between wages and housing,"" said the affordable home-building organization that partners with volunteers. We will focus on whether South Florida ranks No. 1 in the gap between wages and housing. The phrase ""cost-burdened"" refers to households that spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. People who spend more than 50 percent are considered ""severely cost-burdened."" South Florida housing market Habitat for Humanity cited a few different reports about the lack of affordable housing in South Florida. A key report included information from the Center for Neighborhood Technology along with the Center for Housing Policy, a division of the National Housing Conference. The 2012 report outlined the struggle for moderate-income families to afford housing in the 25 largest metro areas. Researchers examined data between 2006-10 from the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The report found that housing and transportation costs rose faster than income nationally, although the disparity was greater in some metro areas than others. And South Florida topped that list. In the Miami metro area, 40 percent of income for a moderate-income household was spent on housing, more than any other metro area in the study. (The Miami metropolitan statistical area was defined by the federal government at the time as stretching from Miami-Dade County, through Broward and north up to West Palm Beach.) It was followed by the Riverside, Calif., metro area and the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area. More recent research shows that the Miami metro area continues to lag behind in affordable housing, said Janet Viveiros, acting director of research at the National Housing Conference. ""Low- and moderate-income households, even those who are working, still face serious challenges in accessing affordable homeownership or renting in the Miami metro area,"" she said. The organization’s ""Housing Landscape"" report based on data from 2011-2014 found that 35.8 percent of low- and moderate-income working households in the Miami area spent more than half their income on housing. That was only exceeded -- slightly -- by the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif., area, which had 36.4 percent of those households spending that much on housing. (This report covered the 50 largest metro areas.) A study by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies in 2015 found Miami had the largest share of cost-burdened renters of any major metro in the country. An NYU Furman Center/CapitalOne report in 2016 reached a similar conclusion. While metro areas with higher rents also had higher incomes, Miami ""pops out as a troubling exception—a high-cost city without high incomes."" Anne Ray, a researcher at the University of Florida’s Shimberg Center for Housing Studies, said that data continues to show that Miami housing costs are unattainable for low-income people. ""Rent is very high and the median income is much lower, particularly in Miami-Dade, than other expensive markets,"" Ray said. Our ruling Habitat for Humanity says, ""South Florida ranks No. 1 in the gap between wages and housing."" Studies have repeatedly shown that South Florida tops the list in the gap between wages and housing. Although there are other metro areas with similarly expensive housing, wages lag behind in South Florida.

Snoop Dogg wasn’t arrested over comments about shooting Donald Trump in music video
","A series of fake news articles saying rapper Snoop Dogg was arrested for encouraging people to shoot President Donald Trump are all fabricated, and can be traced back to one website. Snoop, born Calvin Broadus, drew fire of his own for pretending to shoot a clown resembling Trump (named Ronald Klump, for subtlety’s sake) with a toy gun that released a flag that read ""BANG"" in his video for the song ""Lavender,"" released March 12. You can watch the video here if you don’t mind, um, colorful language. By March 14, the Internet was filled with versions of a post on various websites saying Snoop had suffered the consequences, most with headlines that read, ""Snoop Dogg arrested for conspiracy after talking about his ‘murder Trump’ video."" Several of these posts were flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fabricated, which they are. The posts, almost all of which appear to copy each other, say Snoop wasn’t arrested specifically because of the video. Rather, the articles included a fake quote in which the rapper allegedly said, ""I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun."" The fake reporter in the fake story then supposedly told the Secret Service what Snoop said, landing Snoop in jail. To be clear, Snoop is not a Trump fan — he called the president a ""clown"" in a Billboard interview — and the video for ""Lavender"" does not paint a flattering picture of the current chief executive. But Snoop did not say he hoped someone shot Trump. As is the case with several other claims we’ve checked before, this post originally came from a website called TheLastLineOfDefense.org. They posted the story on March 14. The site doesn’t identify the Obama story as fake, but its About Us page notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" None of the other websites flagged by Facebook indicate the story is contrived, either. But the post has been shared tens of thousands of times via various websites. Trump, who boasted as a presidential candidate, ""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,"" tweeted to decry the content of the video: Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time! Like all presidents, Obama did face death threats, although it’s tough to say just how many. At least one other official also decried the imagery of the president with a gun to his head. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told TMZ.com on March 13 that ""Snoop shouldn’t have done that."" ""We’ve had presidents assassinated before in this country, so anything like that is really something people should be very careful about,"" Rubio said, adding that if the ""wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, you could have a real problem."" The Secret Service did tell TheWrap.com on March 14 that they were ""aware"" of Snoop’s video. But it doesn’t appear they’re hauling him off to prison over his comments. It is a federal crime to threaten the president, but such actions have to be substantial and credible enough to meet the level of a ""true threat."" The First Amendment allows a lot of leeway for criticism, and Snoop Dogg is hardly the only recording artist to signal his distaste for Trump. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson, for example, released a video teaser in November 2016 for his new album Say10, in which he beheads a man dressed suspiciously similar to Trump. Snoop Dogg’s reaction since has been limited to a March 15 Instagram video in which he said he’s ""got nothing to say, mate.""

"['Rhode Island', 'Children', 'Public Health', 'Joseph McNamara']","
Rep. McNamara says 30 percent of Rhode Island youth, 22 percent of adults, are obese.
","
Obesity is a heavy topic. Too many extra pounds add to our risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, sleep disturbances and a host of other problems. Research shows that, as a nation, we are getting fatter.

That's more than a problem just for people who are overweight. When obesity levels rise and the population becomes less healthy, it drives up health costs, which affect all of us.

But is it really true that more than 1 in 5 Rhode Islanders and nearly one-third of our teens and preteens aren't just overweight, they're obese?

That was the contention of Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, when he introduced bills requiring restaurants to provide more nutrition information in hopes of combating the problem.

""About 22 percent of adults in Rhode Island and approximately 30 percent of youth (ages 10-17) are considered obese,"" he is quoted as saying in a legislative news release.

Obesity is determined by your body-mass index, a number that's cumbersome to calculate, in part because it's often defined in metric units, which is one reason why many people don't know what their BMI is.

(To calculate your BMI, take your weight in pounds and multiply it by 703. Next, convert your height to inches and multiply that number by itself. So if you’re 65 inches tall, multiply 65 by 65 to get 4,225.  Then, you take the weight number and divide it by the height number, you get your BMI. Alternatively, you can go online at www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/ and have the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute do the calculation for you.)

If your body-mass index is 25 or higher, you're overweight. If the number is 30 or higher, you're obese. In easier-to-understand terms, a 5-feet-2-inches tall, 164-pound person is obese. So is a 6-footer who weighs 221 pounds.

When we called McNamara's office to find out if that many Rhode Islanders really score 30 or more, we were directed to an online report from Eliza Lawson of the Health Department's Initiative for a Healthy Weight. Lawson, in turn, said McNamara's numbers are supported by reports based on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.

The state-by-state rankings compiled in 2009 by the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation show that Rhode Island has an adult obesity rate of 21.7 percent, which would round up to the 22 percent cited by McNamara.

The 2009 report also offers statistics for children age 10-17. That's where we found a Rhode Island number of 30.1 percent, matching McNamara’s number.

But there's one big problem.

That 30.1 percent figure isn’t for obese children. It includes all overweight children.

To get the correct number for obese children, we went to the 2010 version of the report, which shows that the obesity rate for Rhode Island's youth, based on a 2007 survey, is much lower than McNamara states -- 14.4 percent.

So how does Rhode Island rank?

As adults, we have one of the lowest obesity rates in the United States. In the 2009 report, we were 48th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia; only Connecticut, Massachusetts and Colorado had lower obesity rates. In 2010, our obesity rate rose by 1.2 percentage points and we moved to 45th.

Rhode Island's teens and preteens ranked 28th, essentially at the national average.

(The adult percentages have a margin of error of plus or minus 0.9 percentage points. The childhood percentages, because the numbers are small, have a larger margin of error: plus or minus 3.2 points.)

When we told McNamara that the data showed a much lower rate among children than he had cited, he produced a copy of an ""Eat Smart, Move More"" newsletter that gives the 30-percent figure. But that newsletter incorrectly quotes a 2010 Rhode Island Department of Health report, which had the correct figures on overweight and obesity.

In summary, McNamara's assessment of adult obesity in Rhode Island is correct, if a bit outdated, and he fails to note that Rhode Island ranks as healthier than a large majority of other states. But his statistic on childhood obesity is way off - roughly half of what he said it was.

Thus, we rate his statement as Half True.","[('\nCDC.gov, ""Obesity Trends Among U.S. Adults Between 1985 and 2009,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accessed March 22, 2011\n\nPress release, ""McNamara bills address obesity, food labeling,"" www.rilin.state.ri.us, March 16, 2011, accessed March 22, 2011\n\nNHLBIsupport.com/bmi/, ""Calculate Your Body Mass Index,"" National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, accessed March 23, 2011\n\nCDC.gov, ""Overweight and Obesity: Rhode Island,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accessed March 22, 2011.\n\nEmail, Eliza Lawson, program manager, Initiative for a Healthy Weight, Rhode Island Department of Health, March 23, 2011\n\nHealthyAmericans.org, ""F as in Fat: How Obesity Policies are Failing in America - 2009,"" Trust for America\'s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, July 2009, accessed March 23, 2011\n\nHealthyAmericans.org, ""F as in Fat: How Obesity Threatens America\'s Future - 2010,"" Trust for America\'s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, June 2010, accessed March 24, 2011', 'http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/downloads/obesity_trends_2009.pdf')]",/factchecks/2011/mar/25/joseph-mcnamara/rep-mcnamara-says-30-percent-rhode-island-youth-22/

Newt Gingrich accused of flip-flopping on Libyan no-fly zone
","
United States involvement in establishing a ""no-fly"" zone over Libya has prompted widespread commentary among politicians and pundits -- not all of it consistent.

Yesterday, we looked at whether President Barack Obama had flip-flopped between a principle for U.S. military interventions laid down in 2007 when he was a presidential candidate, and actions he took this year, when he mobilized U.S. forces to implement a United Nations-backed no-fly zone targeting Libya’s long-serving dictator, Moammar Gadhafi.

Now, we’ll look at one of the candidates who may challenge Obama for the presidency in 2012 -- former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.

Seemingly contradictory comments by Gingrich about the wisdom of imposing a no-fly zone prompted a flurry of commentary on the Internet and on cable news shows. It got to the point where Gingrich felt he needed to address his apparent rhetorical contradiction in a Facebook post titled, ""My position on Libya.""

First, we’ll look at the two comments that drove the questions about Gingrich’s stance. 
The first comment came during a March 7, 2011,  interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News. Here’s an excerpt.

Van Susteren: ""First let me ask you about Libya. It's in the news. The president has said that military options with NATO are not off the table. What would you do about Libya?""

Gingrich: ""Exercise a no-fly zone this evening, communicate to the Libyan military that Gadhafi was gone and that the sooner they switch sides, the more like they were to survive, provided help to the rebels to replace him. I mean, the idea that we're confused about a man who has been an anti-American dictator since 1969 just tells you how inept this administration is. They were very quick to jump on Mubarak, who was their ally for 30 years, and they were confused about getting rid of Gadhafi. This is a moment to get rid of him. Do it. Get it over with. …

""All we have to say is that we think that slaughtering your own citizens is unacceptable and that we're intervening. And we don't have to send troops. All we have to do is suppress his air force, which we could do in minutes. And then we have to say publicly that he is gone, that the military should switch sides now, and we should help the rebels. And if that means getting them weapons or whatever it means, the fact that there's no more Libyan air power and the fact that the United States has publicly come out for decisively replacing him, I suspect the military will dump him.""

Now let’s look at the second comment that attracted attention. It was made during a March 23, 2011, interview with Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today show.

Lauer: ""Do you think Moammar Gadhafi has to go as a result of this military intervention?""

Gingrich: ""I think that now -- let me draw a distinction. I would not have intervened. I think there were a lot of other ways to affect Gadhafi. I think there are a lot of allies in the region that we could have worked with. I would not have used American and European forces, bombing Arab and that country.""

In the blogosphere, critics on both the left and the right charged that Gingrich had flip-flopped. The liberal blog ThinkProgress wrote that ""there is no other reasonable explanation for Gingrich’s complete flip-flop"" than ""opportunism and news media publicity."" At the conservative blog site Hot Air, the anonymous AllahPundit suggested that Gingrich’s comments amounted to a flip-flop and asked, ""Is this anti-Obama pandering or just a big misunderstanding?""

We won’t address whether Gingrich’s position in either interview was accurate or justified. We’ll only look at whether Gingrich changed his position between March 7 and March 23, and if so, whether any extenuating circumstances can help explain his shift.

In his March 23, 2011, Facebook post, Gingrich dismissed the notion that he had flip-flopped, arguing that the apparent contradictory positions in the two interviews were actually consistent.

Gingrich’s argument hinges on a difference between what he would have liked to have done in theory, and what he felt he had to do given the actions Obama took. The key moment for Gingrich came on March 3, 2011, when Obama declared that Gadhafi had to go.

""Going forward,"" Obama said, ""we will continue to send a clear message: The violence must stop. Moammar Gadhafi has lost the legitimacy to lead, and he must leave. Those who perpetrate violence against the Libyan people will be held accountable. And the aspirations of the Libyan people for freedom, democracy and dignity must be met.""

Gingrich said in his Facebook post that prior to the March 3 statement ""there were options to be indirect and subtle to achieve this result without United States military forces. … The president, however, took those options off the table with his public statement. From the moment of the president’s declaration, he put the prestige and authority of the United States on the line. After March 3, anything short of a successful, public campaign for regime change would have been seen as a defeat for the United States.

""That’s why during a March 7th Greta van Susteren interview, I asserted that the president should establish a no-fly zone ‘this evening.’ After March 3rd, the President should have moved immediately to consult with Congress to implement a no-fly zone, while also making it clear the U.S. would welcome involvement from other nations.""

Gingrich concluded the post by reinforcing his support for the mission. ""Now that we have U.S. forces engaged, any result less than the removal of Gadhafi from power will be considered a defeat,"" he said. ""For that reason, I believe we must support the mission and see it through.""

Gingrich has not persuaded us that his comments were consistent. The best evidence supporting Gingrich’s explanation is that he did raise some of the themes from his Facebook post during the interview with Today. Gingrich reminded Lauer that ""the president said on March 3rd Gadhafi has to go,"" and he raised the possibility that a  failure could be harmful to the United States’ standing. ""Having decided to go there, if Gadhafi does not leave power it will be a defeat for the United States,"" Gingrich told Lauer. ""It will lengthen our engagement, it will increase our costs.""

However, if Gingrich’s position is that he was making two separate arguments -- a hypothetical one about what he would have done prior to Obama’s March 3 statement, and a practical one about what he would do once the U.S. had crossed the Rubicon of advocating Gadhafi’s ouster -- he didn’t do a very clear job of explaining himself. In neither interview did he frame the arguments in that fashion. So we think it’s reasonable for viewers to conclude that he’d flip-flopped on the issue of imposing a no-fly zone.

So where does this leave us? Gingrich has a point that Obama’s March 3 declaration about Gadhafi had consequences, and if Gingrich had provided that context of his thinking in both interviews, he could have made a reasonable argument that the two statements were consistent.

MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell: Most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant
","On MSNBC's Last Word on March 22, 2011, host Lawrence O'Donnell argued that evacuation plans for nuclear power plants in the United States are an unrealistic ""fantasy"" due to the huge population concentrations around them.
 
That's especially the case, he said, if there were a call to evacuate a 50-mile radius -- the distance the U.S. government recently urged Americans to evacuate around an earthquake-damaged Japanese nuclear power plant.

""The truth is, most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant,"" O'Donnell said.

O'Donnell and his guest, Daniel Aldrich, author of Site Fights, used the example of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York. A 50-mile radius around that plant alone includes almost all of New York City, and large chunks of northern New Jersey -- more than 8 million people.

Aldrich said evacuating a 50-mile radius around the Indian Point plant would cause a ""tremendous amount of confusion and chaos as people locally flee and try to preserve themselves.""

Said O'Donnell: ""There is no real evacuation plan from a place like Indian Point.""

The nuclear disaster in Japan naturally causes people to consider how a similar disaster might play out In the United States. So we were curious about O'Donnell's claim that most Americans live within 50 miles of a power plant.

We turned first to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees emergency response plans in the event of a nuclear accident. The website includes a map of all the nuclear power reactors in operation in the U.S., so you can see how far away you live from one.

According to a Federal Emergency Management Agency analysis using 2000 census data, there were 184 million people who lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant in the U.S., the NRC reported.

According to the U.S. Census, there were 281 million people living in the U.S. in 2000. So by our math, about 65 percent of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.

""They typically build power plants where there are large populations,"" said Patricia Milligan, senior technical advisor for emergency preparation and response at the NRC. ""Populations need power. They kind of go hand-in-hand.""

You could put power plants out in the middle of South Dakota, she said, but then the expense to transport the energy would be very high.

So O'Donnell's statistic was accurate.

But Milligan takes issue with O'Donnell's conclusion that evacuation plans are unrealistic.

The decision for the 50-mile evacuation in Japan was based on several unique factors, she said. First, she said, ""the communication coming out of Japan was confusing and contradictory."" In addition, she said, you had three reactors with significant core damage, and two spent fuel pools ""appeared to be significantly compromised.""

She's ""completely confident"" the complicating factors that led to the 50-mile evacuation recommendation in Japan wouldn't happen in the U.S. The NRC has ""extremely good communication with the licensees."" They also have an electronic reporting system, so they get the same information as the power plant operators in live-time.

""We're in a much better position to access and evaluate information,"" she said.

Emergency evacuation plans in the U.S. focus on 10-mile zones. Most accidents would not trigger an emergency response outside that 10-mile radius, Milligan said. But states and power plant operators are required to make emergency response plans for areas within 50 miles as well, including such things as protection of the food supply.

While it's true that most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant, those percentages drop off markedly when you consider 10- or 20-mile zones. According to FEMA data, about 8 percent of the American population lives within 20 miles of a nuclear power plant; and about 1.7 percent lives within 10 miles.

In other words, while power plants are usually located near large population centers, ""they tend to put them in the outer suburbs,"" Milligan said.

Evacuations are an integral part of the emergency response plan, Milligan said. The NRC has done extensive study of emergency evacuations (for everything from floods to wildfires to gas leaks), and the agency is convinced they are feasible and realistic.

""Evacuations do save lives,"" Milligan said. ""They happen all the time in the United States, and they work well.""

But back to O'Donnell's statistic. He said most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. About 65 percent of the population in 2000 lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. That's certainly most. We rate O'Donnell's statement True.","[('MSNBC, Video of Last Word program, March 22, 2011\n\nWashington Post, ""U.S. urges Americans within 50 miles of Japanese nuclear plant to evacuate; NRC chief outlines dangerous situation,"" by Brian Vastag, Rick Maese and David A.

Sen. Bill Nelson says Florida leads nation in prisoners committing tax fraud
","
The April 15 deadline for Americans to file their taxes is creeping closer. As millions of folks rush to file their 1040 forms, Sen. Bill Nelson is urging the IRS to keep better tabs of prisoners filing fraudulent tax claims.

""It's an unwelcome distinction, but the entire state of Florida led the nation last year with the most prison inmates committing tax fraud,"" Nelson wrote in a press release dated March 18, 2011.

He made the same claim in a March 17, 2011, letter addressed to IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman, noting that: ""A recent report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that nearly 45,000 fraudulent tax refund claims were filed in 2009 by prisoners in the United States, including 8,777 fraudulent claims by prisoners in Florida correctional institutions. The report also found the level of tax fraud in Florida prisons higher than in any other state.""

We decided to take a closer look at Nelson's claim -- does Florida lead the nation in prisoners filing fraudulent tax returns?

First, a little primer on the rules regarding how prisoners file their tax forms. Each inmate is in charge of requesting his or her own 1040 form and filing their taxes ""like any other citizen,"" said Florida Department of Corrections spokeswoman Jo Ellyn Rackleff. Typically, inmates don't earn enough from their prison jobs to trigger a tax withholding, but some are eligible for tax returns because they and their families receive income from inheritances or other investments.

Since 2005, Nelson, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, has pushed for legislation that would allow the Internal Revenue Service to share inmates' financial information with state and federal prison officials in hopes of stopping the fraud.

In 2008, Congress passed the Inmate Tax Fraud Prevention Act that allowed the IRS to share inmate information with federal prisons, and in 2010 lawmakers passed an amendment (which Nelson supported) that allowed the IRS to share the same information with state prisons.

However, for the exchange of information to proceed between the state prisons and the IRS, states and the federal tax-collection agency have to sign separate agreements -- a step that, to date, has not been completed.

""I am concerned that more than eight months after Congress passed a measure to crack down on tax fraud by prison inmates at state correctional institutions, the Internal Revenue Service and Florida Department of Corrections have yet to reach an information-sharing agreement that will help state prison officials identify prisoners filing false tax returns,"" Nelson wrote in his letter to Shulman.

Rackleff, with the Department of Corrections, said a memorandum of understanding is in the works and is expected to be finalized by mid April. As for other states, in February, USA Today reported that Shulman wrote a letter to the governors of the top 10 fraud states asking for their states to create agreements for the exchange of prisoner data.

The IRS' goal is to have a Memorandum of Understanding for each state in place prior to January 2012, according to the December 2010 report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).

We asked TIGTA for a listing of the tax fraud committed by state. The agency insisted we file a Freedom of Information Act request, and we've done so. Meanwhile, Nelson's office provided us with the following spreadsheets compiled by the IRS listing the amount of tax fraud committed by state, and a more detailed list breaking down the number of fraud cases specific to each state's prison.

Overall, inmates nationwide filed 44,944 false claims and were refunded $39.1 million in undeserved tax returns, according to the IRS figures. The IRS told USA Today that it could not determine how much of the 2009 refunds had been recovered because the process ""can take several years.""

In Florida, inmates submitted 8,777 bogus tax claims in 2009, the latest year available. Of those claims 2,911 were given tax refunds to the tune of $12.58 million in 2009.

For example, Gadsden Correctional, Glades Correctional and Taylor Correctional institutions each had more than 200 false returns identified, while the Tallahassee Road Prison, Cocoa Work Release Center and Berrydale Forestry Camp in Jay had five false returns each.

Of all 50 states, Florida indeed came out on top both for claims filed and refunds received. Georgia is second with 7,351 fraudulent claims filed and $3.56 million received, and California is third with 3,713 bogus claims filed and $2.76 million received. (For a full list check out this chart.)

It's worth noting that the top three states have some of the largest prison populations in the nation, with California ranked second, Florida ranked third and Georgia ranked fifth, according to the Pew Center on the States. Texas tops the list for the number of prisoners, and was ranked fourth for prisoner tax-fraud claims.

TIGTA’s December 2010 report cited by Sen. Nelson also expressed concerns over the IRS efforts to identify prisoner tax-refund fraud.

""If the IRS does not take action, the problem will only worsen and more taxpayer dollars will be lost,"" the report stated. ""Prisoners continue to find ways to exploit weaknesses in the system in order to receive refunds to which they are not entitled.""

It may not be a top ranking that Florida wishes to claim, but Nelson is correct in noting that the state leads the nation in prisoners committing tax fraud. We rate this claim True.

Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald says half of state residents are “on some kind of government handout”
","
Addressing the Wisconsin Republican Party’s annual convention on May 21, 2011, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, reflected on the transformational 2010 elections. The GOP swept to power, taking from Democrats the governor’s office as well as control of the Senate and Assembly.

""That election needed to happen. Our country is facing challenges we simply can’t ignore,"" Fitzgerald told hundreds of convention-goers at a Wisconsin Dells resort.

""Our government is growing too fast, too big; it’s becoming too expensive. One out of every five people in Wisconsin are on Medicaid or Medicare. One out of every two are on some kind of government handout.""

One out of every two people in Wisconsin -- half the state’s residents -- receive a ""government handout?""

That’s a lot of Wisconsinites.

We asked Fitzgerald’s spokesman, Andrew Welhouse, for evidence to back up the statement. Welhouse initially said his boss’ claim ""looks wrong, but the larger conversation about entitlements and government spending is long overdue.""

That’s not much of a defense.

Welhouse did cite this passage from an April 2011 analysis of federal data done by USA Today:

""A record 18.3 percent of the nation's total personal income was a payment from the government for Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, unemployment benefits and other programs in 2010. Wages accounted for the lowest share of income — 51 percent — since the government began keeping track in 1929.""

That all may be true. But it’s off point.  

The article indicates what percentage of Americans’ overall income comes from the government. But it says nothing about what percentage of individual Wisconsinites -- or Americans, for that matter -- receive government assistance.

We told Welhouse we still wanted to know what Fitzgerald defined as government handouts. When he called back, he said Fitzgerald told him he had meant to say that one in six Wisconsin residents -- not one in two -- get government handouts.

Welhouse didn’t say what Fitzgerald considered as handouts, but he provided another USA Today article, from August 2010. Analyzing state data, the newspaper found that government anti-poverty programs such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance served a record one in six Americans.

The article makes no mention of Wisconsin, however.

We contacted state agencies to see how many Wisconsinites receive government assistance from the four major programs cited in the second article that Welhouse provided. Here’s what we found: 

Since Wisconsin has about 5.65 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that means roughly one in five state residents is on Medicaid alone.

If you added the recipients in all four programs, the total would represent 2.16 million people, or more than one in three Wisconsinites. That would still be far short of the one in two that Fitzgerald claimed at the convention.

But the true figure is lower than 2.16 million because some people receive assistance from more than one of the programs. Based on the available information, we could not determine an exact number – nor could Fitzgerald.


We also contacted experts at four private organizations in Wisconsin that track government programs. None said they were aware of any study that attempted to determine what percentage of Wisconsin residents receives government assistance or a ""government handout.""

All of this is setting aside the question of what constitutes a handout, which is a subjective term.

The article cited by Fitzgerald’s aide to support the 1-in-2 claim included Social Security and Medicare, both of which workers pay into through payroll taxes. Many people would not consider those programs handouts.

Here’s the bottom line:

Fitzgerald made a bold statement at the state GOP convention -- that one out of every two Wisconsin residents ""is on some kind of government handout."" He was able to provide no evidence to back the claim, and even one of his aides essentially acknowledged it was wrong. The Senate leader later provided a different number, but the data he relied on is not specific to Wisconsin.

We rate Fitzgerald’s statement False.","[('\nWisconsinEye, video(at 1:18:30) of Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgeraldspeech to Wisconsin Republican Party convention, May 21, 2011\n\nInterview and e-mail interview, Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald communications director Andrew Welhouse, May 23, 2011\n\nInterview, Wisconsin Council on Children & Families research director Jon Peacock, May 23, 2011\n\nInterview, Institute for Wisconsin’s Future research director Jack Norman, May 23, 2011\n\nEmail interview, Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance president Todd Berry, May 24, 2011\n\nEmail interview, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute fellow Christian Schneider, May 24, 2011\n\nUSA Today, ""Americans depend more on federal aid than ever,"" April 26, 2011\n\nUSA Today, ""Record number in government anti-poverty programs,"" Aug. 30, 2010\n\nFiscal Times, ""Budget deficit: Government handouts top tax income,"" April 18, 2011\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, 2009 Wisconsin population estimate\n\nEmail interview, Wisconsin Department of Health Services spokeswoman Beth Kaplan, May 24 and 25 , 2011\n\nInterview and email interview, Wisconsin Department of Children & Family Services spokeswoman Stephanie Hayden, May 24, 2011\n\nEmail interview, Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development spokesman John Dipko, May 24, 2011', 'http://www.wiseye.org/Programming/VideoArchive/EventDetail.aspx?evhdid=4254')]",/factchecks/2011/may/26/scott-fitzgerald/wisconsin-senate-majority-leader-scott-fitzgerald-/

Rep. Dennis Kucinich says a faulty law to blame for oil companies not paying royalties for off-shore drilling
","
With the price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline selling for around $3.50 at the pump, and expected to hit $4 by summer, attention is focused on what factors influence retail fuel prices.

That U.S. oil companies reported profits of $485 billion from 2005 to 2009 only heightens that scrutiny. Particularly when despite those profits, they have received subsidies since the mid ’90s.

At the time, the average cost of a barrel of oil had plunged to as low as $11, compared to more than $100 a barrel now, and oil companies demanded incentives to explore and drill for new sources of oil.

Some of that exploration involves federal areas, but the federal government hasn’t reaped rewards from that exploration. Legislation approved in 1995 relieved oil companies from paying royalties to the federal government on drilling leases until they had recouped their investment.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee focused on that legislation as part of a hearing March 3.

At that hearing, Rep. Dennis Kucinich stated: ""Due to a flaw in the 1995 Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act, numerous oil companies are now drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in federal lands and paying no royalties to the federal government.""

Kucinich’s statement made us wonder: Is it possible that an industry swimming in profits has managed to avoid paying a simple cost of doing business like drilling royalties?

PolitiFact Ohio put the statement to the Truth-O-Meter.

Kucinich’s staff pointed us to a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office titled ""Opportunities to Reduce Potential Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and Enhance Revenue"" and a section titled ""Ensuring the Federal Government Receives Fair Market Value for Its Oil and Gas Resources Could Enhance Federal Revenues.""

The report addresses the issue of royalty relief, stating: ""Special lower royalty rates granted on leases issued in the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico from 1996-2000 could result in $21 billion to $53 billion in lost revenue to the federal government.""

Next, we compared those finding to what was said at the hearing.

Kucinich made his remark while questioning Ryan Alexander, president of the Taxpayers for Common Sense, a non-profit organization that bills itself as a non-partisan budget watchdog. The organization is one of nearly 30 in a coalition that followed up the hearing with a letter to Congress urging an end to energy subsidies.

Alexander confirmed the basic premise of Kucinich’s claim. ""There are companies paying no royalties right now as a result of an error,"" she said.

So does that mean the law is flawed?

In a followup answer, Alexander explained that the leases are flawed, not the law.

""My understanding is that there is a set of leases that were issued between 1996 and 2000 that are flawed; there was an error in the drafting,"" she said. ""And so all of those leases are exempt from royalties right now.""

Kucinich, during his questioning, cited claims by John Hofmeister, a former CEO of Shell Oil who now is head of the group Citizens for Affordable Energy, in which he said large oil companies don’t need subsidies such as royalty relief when oil prices are as high as they are now.

""The fear of low oil prices drives some companies to say that subsidies should be sustained,"" Hofmeister said in an interview with the National Journal. ""And my point of view is that with high oil prices such subsidies are not necessary.""

Alexander, too, called for changes to the subsies.

""There are subsidies for oil and gas companies riddled throughout the tax code and through different spending programs, so we think this is a big opportunity for there to be bipartisan action for reform that will help close the deficit,"" she said. ""We think that these handouts are enriching very profitable companies.""

Congressional Republicans generally support continuing subsidies for oil companies, and oppose legislation introduced in February to eliminate $5 billion in subsidies. But there appears to be support for repairing the royalty issue from both sides of the aisle.

""I do think there’s bipartisan support to still try to fix that,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who chairs the committee.

So how does Kucinich’s statement rate on the Truth-O-Meter?

Testimony at the hearing from the head of a watchdog group advocating action suggests it is the drilling leases for the Gulf of Mexico that are at fault rather than the law that established the royalty relief.

But the congressman was correct that some oil companies pay no royalties, and the GAO report his staff cited suggests that is an issue worth billions of dollars to the federal government.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kucinich’s claim as Half True.","[('\nU.S. Government Accountability Office, ""Opportunities to Reduce Potential Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and Enhance Revenue"" Pages 200-204\n\nNational Journal, ""Ex-Shell CEO Says Big Oil Can Live Without Subsidies,"" by Amy Harder Feb. 11, 2011\n\nTaxpayers For Common Sense\n\nTaxpayers for Common Sense, ""Coalition letter to Congress calls for an end to energy subsidies,"" March 17, 2011', 'http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11318sp.pdf')]",/factchecks/2011/mar/24/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-faulty-law-blame-oil-comp/

Is Barack Obama's Libya intervention a flip-flop from what he said in 2007?
","
In the wake of U.S. participation in military operations against targets in Libya, commentators on the left and the right have raised questions about whether President Barack Obama had the required authority to launch operations without specific authorization from Congress.

A reader pointed out to us that Obama himself had made a notable comment during a 2007 interview with Charlie Savage, then a journalist with the Boston Globe.

Savage asked Obama, ""In what circumstances, if any, would the president have constitutional authority to bomb Iran without seeking a use-of-force authorization from Congress? (Specifically, what about the strategic bombing of suspected nuclear sites -- a situation that does not involve stopping an IMMINENT threat?)""

While the specific context of Savage’s question concerned Iranian nuclear plants, we think Obama’s answer raised some points that are relevant for assessing the justification for the Libyan operation three years later.

Obama said, ""The president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.""

He added, ""As commander-in-chief, the president does have a duty to protect and defend the United States. In instances of self-defense, the president would be within his constitutional authority to act before advising Congress or seeking its consent. History has shown us time and again, however, that military action is most successful when it is authorized and supported by the legislative branch. It is always preferable to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any military action.""

We wondered whether Obama’s initiation of military operations in Libya represented a flip-flop on his stated principle that ""the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.""

First, some background on presidential and congressional war powers.

The Constitution (Article I, Section 8) assigns the right to declare war to Congress. But the last time that actually happened was at the beginning of World War II. In subsequent wars, the president has generally initiated military activities using his constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief.

Walter Dellinger -- former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel and acting solicitor general under President Bill Clinton -- wrote recently that ""presidential administrations of both political parties have recognized a long tradition that supports this use of force. And Congress has acknowledged its legitimacy as well.""

Specifically, Dellinger cited a pair of opinions by his office -- one from 1994 and one from 1995 -- that relied in large part on the War Powers Resolution, which was passed by Congress in 1973 and enacted over a veto by President Richard Nixon. The resolution grew out of concern by lawmakers and other critics that U.S. involvement in Vietnam had never received the necessary approval from Congress.

""The resolution requires that, in the absence of a declaration of war, the president must report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into such circumstances and must terminate the use of U.S. armed forces within 60 days unless Congress permits otherwise,"" Dellinger writes.

By regulating the principle ""that the president may introduce troops into hostilities or potential hostilities without prior authorization by the Congress,"" the War Powers Resolution effectively confirms that principle, Dellinger argues.

The experts we asked generally agreed with this line of argument. In fact, some went so far as to say that the president’s powers to initiate military activities without specific congressional consent are by now so deeply ingrained that Obama’s 2007 comment to Savage was factually inaccurate.

""The 2007 statement materially omitted key information -- I would charitably call it a ‘misrepresentation’ -- that would lead the average voter to believe that then-presidential candidate Obama was a champion of the Constitution’s restraints on executive power, as opposed to (George W. Bush) the cowboy,"" said Steven Groves, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

However, in this item, we’re not rating Obama’s 2007 comment on the Truth-O-Meter. Instead, we’re trying to judge whether Obama has changed his standards for initiating military action between then and now.

That requires taking a look the president’s justification of military operations in Libya.

In a March 21, 2011, letter to congressional leaders, Obama wrote that ""as part of the multilateral response authorized under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, U.S. military forces, under the command of Commander, U.S. Africa Command, began a series of strikes against air defense systems and military airfields for the purposes of preparing a no-fly zone. These strikes will be limited in their nature, duration, and scope. Their purpose is to support an international coalition as it takes all necessary measures to enforce the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. These limited U.S. actions will set the stage for further action by other coalition partners.""

Obama went on to say that the U.N. resolution authorized ""all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya. … (Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's) continued attacks and threats against civilians and civilian populated areas are of grave concern to neighboring Arab nations and, as expressly stated in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, constitute a threat to the region and to international peace and security. His illegitimate use of force not only is causing the deaths of substantial numbers of civilians among his own people, but also is forcing many others to flee to neighboring countries, thereby destabilizing the peace and security of the region. Left unaddressed, the growing instability in Libya could ignite wider instability in the Middle East, with dangerous consequences to the national security interests of the United States.""

So, how well does this match up with Obama’s 2007 statement that ""the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation""?

We think the question boils down to whether the actions being taken in Libya ""involve stopping an actual or imminent threat"" to the United States.

Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, said he doesn’t perceive a strong argument that Libya represents ""an actual or imminent threat to the nation."" To him, that phrase suggests ""a circumstance where the other state was engaging in or was about to engage in something tantamount to an armed attack against the United States (or, presumably, its allies). In the Libyan case, there is no such threat -- actual or imminent -- to the United States or its allies.""

Temple University law professor Peter J. Spiro said the administration could argue that the threat of a widespread humanitarian disaster in a sensitive region would be tantamount to ""an imminent threat to the nation,"" thus justifying Obama’s actions under his 2007 principle. Indeed, that seems to be the argument Obama made when he said that ""left unaddressed, the growing instability in Libya could ignite wider instability in the Middle East, with dangerous consequences to the national security interests of the United States.""

Most of our experts, however, saw that as a stretch.

Kal Raustiala, a University of California at Los Angeles law professor, said that, ""on the merits, he is right now and was wrong then."" Legal commentator Stuart Taylor Jr. said he sees ""no plausible loophole. He may possibly be right now ... but if so, he was wrong then.""

Raustiala points out that Savage specifically referenced Iran’s nuclear program in his question to Obama. But we think that Obama’s answer was sufficiently broad that it would be incorrect to assume that he was only talking about the scenario of attacking Iran over its pursuit of nuclear weapons.

Glenn Beck says Allen West is a modern-day Ronin
","During a recent discussion about the ongoing tragedy in Japan, radio host and Fox News personality Glenn Beck somehow worked in a comparison to former Army lieutenant colonel and now Florida U.S. Rep. Allen West.

The discussion, on Beck's March 18, 2011, Fox News show, started with how U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin had said people in America should buy iodine tablets (not exactly what she said), then morphed into why there is no looting in Japan and onto a parable about Japanese honor.

Norio Nishi, whom Beck described as a Japanese national living in America, explained a concept of the samurai lifestyle to Beck known as Nin Tai.

""Nin Tai means endurance, perseverance, steadfastness,"" Nishi said. ""You do not -- when you confront with danger, when you confront with the calamity, you don't shout, yell and move your head. You just take the pain. You just go forward and that is the kind of attitude or lifestyle that Samurai people built. That (feeling) permeates every single aspect of the Japanese society.""

Michael Auslin, the director of Japanese studies at the American Enterprise Institute, then explained to Beck a second part of the Japanese culture, a tension between duty and obligation.

""There's another side of it, too, that I think is equally important that developed,"" Auslin said. ""The Samurai ruled Japan for about 700 years and this other side is this tension between what they call duty and obligation. Duty is what you had to do legally. It's -- you know, if you were Samurai, you had certain things you had to do and the law bound you. Obligations were your relations with your fellow man, and they were often in tension.

""And the most famous story in Japan is something probably everyone here has heard of. 'The 47 Ronin, The 47th Samurai,' where they wanted to avenge what they thought was the unlawful death of their lord. But they weren't allowed to do it, according to duty. It was illegal. So they had to choose what to do. They chose obligation. But they didn't run away from the duty, meaning they chose it, knowing that if they were successful in repaying the honor of their lord, upholding his honor, they would go to their deaths by the legal system. And they chose to do that. They had to somehow bring the two together. But what they didn't do was attempt, for example, to say, well, it wasn't -- we weren't doing that, it wasn't our fault. And this -- this idea of duty and obligation, I think, has helped.""

Beck said the story of ""The 47 Ronin"" -- which is being made into a movie starring Keanu Reaves -- reminded him of West, a former Army officer who was elected to Congress in 2010.

""It is kind of like Allen West when he went (to Iraq) -- Congressman Allen West -- he was questioning a terrorist, knew that this terrorist had information that was going to get all of his troops killed,"" Beck said. ""So he went in and he threatened the guy and he (the terrorist) said, 'I know you, you Americans, you'll never do it.' He fired a shot right by the guy's head, scared him to death, knew that it was wrong and got the information.

""Then went right directly to his commanding officer, put his gun down, and said, what I did was wrong, I did it and I'd do it again, but I want you to know. That's the duty and the honor,"" he said.

Did Beck get West's back-story right?

The facts behind West's Iraq interrogation

Beck's claim is from 2003, when West was serving in Iraq as a lieutenant colonel overseeing an artillery battalion of about 650 soldiers and officers.

In early August, soldiers received a tip that West and one of his subordinate battery commanders were to be the subject of an assassination attempt. The same informant returned with the names of three people involved in the planning of the assassination, including an Iraqi policeman, Yehiya Kadoori Hamoodi.

Hamoodi was apprehended and brought in for questioning.

What happened next comes from accounts provided by West and the other soldiers involved in the interrogation through sworn statements they gave during a subsequent military investigation.

West joined the interrogation in progress after soldiers were unable to get useful information from Hamoodi. West said soldiers told him Hamoodi was being evasive and belligerent.

That's when the interrogation got more physical. Soldiers punched and shoved Hamoodi when he wouldn't answer interrogators' questions. At some point, West sat down across from Hamoodi, took out his 9mm pistol and placed it on his thigh pointing in Hamoodi's direction.

""I'm here for a reason,"" West said, according to a solider. ""You are going to tell me who wants to kill me, or I am going to kill you.""

Then they took Hamoodi outside and placed his head over a clearing barrel -- a barrel filled with sand where people can unload firearms safely. West showed Hamoodi the gun and told him he had five seconds to talk. ""I brought his head down toward the barrel using my left hand to shield him away from any sand or blast,"" West told investigators.

Then West fired into the sand, at least once, maybe three times, inches from Hamoodi's head.
 
Then West fired into the sky.

Some soldiers thought West had shot Hamoodi. But Hamoodi was alive, and though stiff from shock, was ready to talk.

West headed back to the operations center, and let the interrogation conclude.

The fallout from the incident

During a subsequent military hearing, Hamoodi said he was not sure what he told the interrogators, but that the information was meaningless and induced by fear and pain, the New York Times reported.

The Times reported that at least one man named was taken into custody and his home was searched. No plans for attacks on Americans or weapons were found. West testified at his hearing that he did not know whether ''any corroboration'' of a plot was ever found. ''At the time, I had to base my decision on the intelligence I received,"" West said. ""It's possible that I was wrong about Mr. Hamoodi.'' Yet he also notes that no attacks occurred after the interrogation.

Hamoodi was detained another 45 days after the incident, then released without being charged.

The military did not pursue a court martial against West, who was fined $5,000. News accounts say West decided to resign and retire during the investigation.

""I know the method I used was not right, but I wanted to take care of my soldiers,"" West said at his hearing. ""If it's about the lives of my soldiers at stake, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can.""

Breaking down Beck's story

That's pretty much the story. Our job here is to see how Beck's version stands up.

In general, it's close. But on the specifics, Beck is writing his own history, or at least a subjective version of it.

Let's break it down.

""It is kind of like Allen West when he went (to Iraq) -- Congressman Allen West -- he was questioning a terrorist, knew that this terrorist had information that was going to get all of his troops killed.""

Beck says Hamoodi was a terrorist, which was never really proven. His name was offered up by an informant as someone who knew something about a plot to assassinate West. Hamoodi was never charged. Secondly, the alleged plot was to kill West and one of his subordinates. West said he was trying to protect troops who might have been jeopardized as a result of the insurgents' plot.

""So he went in and he threatened the guy and he (Hamoodi) said, 'I know you, you Americans, you'll never do it.' He fired a shot right by the guy's head, scared him to death, knew that it was wrong and got the information.""

There's no record that we could find of Hamoodi essentially taunting West. Not in the media accounts of West's military hearing, not in the records of the investigation and interviews of the soldiers involved. Not in West's public comments on the matter. The rest of this portion of the statement is largely accurate, though it's unclear if the information was at all useful.

""Then went right directly to his commanding officer, put his gun down, and said, what I did was wrong, I did it and I'd do it again but I want you to know that's the duty and the honor,"" he said.

This line is in many ways the crux of Beck's comparison to the Ronin legend, the point of which was to say West knew he was acting improperly, chose to do so, then turned himself in to face the consequences.

It's not clear, however, that is what happened.

West did wake up his superior officer after the interrogation to recount what had occurred. But the superior officer testified that he did not remember West offering specifics, beyond saying that he had discharged his weapon during an interrogation and that no one was hurt, the Times reported.

In fact, the Times said that the investigation into West's actions began only after a sergeant in another battalion wrote a letter of complaint about the ''command climate'' under West's superior officer. In that letter, the sergeant mentioned almost as an aside, according to West's lawyer, that West had interrogated a detainee using a pistol.

A soldier also told investigators that West originally told him and others to keep the details of the interrogation silent.

""This night stays within 2-20 and 2-20 only (the number of field artillery battalion),"" the soldier, whose name was not released, told investigators. ""We all gave a hooah and continued to walk to our rooms as (West) returned to the operations center.""

West never addressed that allegation in the records we could find.

""In my anger, I do not know if I fired two shots into the barrel and one into the air and another into the barrel,"" he told investigators at one point. ""The night of this action I informed COL (name withheld) what I had personally done firing my weapon.

""The following day at my battalion update brief, I informed by (sic) battery commanders. This was not to boast but rather personally accepting responsibility and to not attempt to conceal my actions. I did embellish some points for emphasis.""

Our ruling

During a recent discussion of the crisis in Japan, Beck used a parable about the Japanese people as a way to bring up the story of West's time as a military officer in Iraq.

To be clear, we're not judging whether West should have done what he did, or whether it was honorable. We're simply seeing if Beck got the story right. In particular, we're focusing on Beck's assertion that West helped thwart a terrorist plot by shooting a gun in the direction of an Iraqi detainee, then reported the incident to his superior and said it was wrong.

Beck embellishes on some of the points of the record. West did report the incident to his superior, though it's unclear how much he said. And the investigation into the shooting occurred after another solider complained. The ""terrorist,"" Hamoodi, was a person offered up by an informant who was never charged with wrongdoing and ultimately released. And even West admits that Hamoodi may have had nothing to do with an assassination plot. No plot was ever uncovered.

It's an interesting story about West, so we think it's important to keep it as close to the facts as possible. So we rate Beck's claim Half True.","[('Glenn Beck, Fox News transcript, March 18, 2011', 'http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/glenn-beck/transcript/beck-spirit-japan?page=4'), ('CNN, ""U.S. officer fined for harsh interrogation tactics,"" Dec. 13, 2003', 'No link'), ('U.S. Army criminal investigation notes, accessed March 23, 2011', 'http://articles.cnn.com/2003-12-12/us/sprj.nirq.west.ruling_1_allen-west-iraqi-detainee-military-justice?_s=PM:US'), ('New York Times, ""THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: INTERROGATIONS; How Colonel Risked His Career By Menacing Detainee and Lost,"" May 27, 2004', 'No link'), ('Los Angeles Times, ""Surgeon general clarifies position on potassium iodide as protection against nuclear radiation,"" March 16, 2011', 'https://www.aclu.org/files/projects/foiasearch/pdf/DODDOACID000105.pdf')]",/factchecks/2011/mar/23/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-allen-west-modern-day-ronin/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Foreign Policy', 'Ted Poe']","
Ted Poe decries U.S. aid to Venezuela, Cuba
","
In a House floor speech on Feb. 9, 2011, Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, took aim at American aid to foreign countries. Poe has introduced a bill to require separate votes on aiding specific countries, thus ending the practice of bundling foreign aid into a single bill.

""Maybe it’s time to reconsider our foreign aid that we send to countries throughout the world,"" Poe said in the floor speech, which has attracted attention in conservative circles on the Internet. ""There are about 192 foreign countries in the world, … and we give foreign aid to over 150 of them.""

Poe proceeded to name some examples of countries where many Americans might be uncomfortable sending taxpayer money, including Egypt, Pakistan, Russia and China. But two of the nation’s in Poe’s speech caught our eye -- Venezuela and Cuba.

Critics of Venezuela’s leader, Hugo Chavez, call him a dictator. Meanwhile, Cuba has been a communist country for decades, led by Fidel Castro and now his brother Raul. In its widely followed rankings, the group Freedom House rates Venezuela toward the bottom of the nations it classifies as ""partly free,"" while Cuba sits at the lower end of its ""not free"" scale. And both nations have strained relations with the United States.

So Poe suggested these as two examples of what’s wrong with U.S. foreign aid.

""We give money to Venezuela. Why do we give money to Chavez and Venezuela? He hates the United States. He defies our president, makes fun of our nation. We don’t need to give him any foreign aid. We give $20 million to Cuba. Why do we give money to Cuba? Americans can’t even go to Cuba. It’s off-limits. It’s a communist country. But we’re dumping money over there.""

We looked at budget documents for foreign aid and talked to experts in the field, and here’s what we found.

Poe is correct that U.S. foreign aid flows into both countries. In fiscal year 2010, the Venezuela account showed $6 million, while the Cuba account showed $20 million. For fiscal year 2012, the administration has requested a little less for Venezuela -- $5 million -- and the same $20 million amount for Cuba.

To give a sense of context, the 2010 funds allocated for Venezuela amounted to less than 1/100th of 1 percent of the total U.S. foreign-aid budget, and the figure for Cuba was about 4/100 of 1 percent of the U.S. foreign aid budget. The percentage of the entire federal budget is even more minuscule. Still, even if the amount is small, taxpayer money is taxpayer money, so Poe has a point.

However, Poe also said in plain language that ""we give money to Chavez."" And while he didn’t say it in as explicit a fashion, Poe implied that the U.S. sends aid to the Cuban regime.

This is where it gets more complicated.

The funding for both nations comes from the Economic Support Fund, which, according to the State Department, ""supports U.S. foreign policy objectives by providing economic assistance to allies and countries in transition to democracy. Programs funded through this account promote stability and U.S. security interests in strategic regions of the world.""

Let’s take Cuba first. A spokesman for the U.S. Agency for International Development confirmed that no U.S. aid goes to the Cuban government.

In an explanation of its proposed budget, the administration writes that ""Cuba is the only non-democratically elected government in the Western Hemisphere and one of the most politically repressed countries in the world. In view of these challenges, U.S. assistance for Cuba aims to empower Cuban civil society to advocate for greater democratic freedoms and respect for human dignity.""

The $20 million designated for Cuba ""focuses on strengthening independent Cuban civil society organizations, including associations and labor groups. … To advance the cause of human rights in Cuba, U.S. assistance provides humanitarian assistance to political prisoners and their families … The United States supports nascent pro-democracy groups, the use of technology, and new information-sharing opportunities.""

A 2006 review by the Government Accountability Office noted that the aid is such a threat to the regime that it has to be kept under tight wraps on the island. ""Given the Cuban government’s repressive policies and opposition to U.S. democracy assistance, grantees employed a range of discreet delivery methods,"" GAO reported.

In other words, the money being sent to Cuba is designed to foster democracy in what is currently an undemocratic country -- not to support the government. Poe’s failure to note that distinction as he attacks aid to ""Cuba"" strikes us as misleading.

Now let’s look at Venezuela. In its $5 million budget request for 2012, the administration said it wants to ""strengthen and support a Venezuelan civil society that will protect Democratic space and seek to serve the interests and needs of the Venezuelan people. Funding will enhance citizens’ access to objective information, facilitate peaceful debate on key issues, provide support to democratic institutions and processes, promote citizen participation and encourage democratic leadership.""

Another administration document says aid helps ""strengthen the capacity of non-governmental organizations to monitor and report on government performance"" -- in other words, to be a watchdog of the government, not a supporter. The U.S. AID spokesman confirmed that no money goes to the Venezuelan government.

So far, this sounds a lot like the situation with aid to Cuba. But there’s a difference. The same administration document goes on to say that this civil-society funding ""will involve both government and opposition supporters and will be open to all regardless of political perspectives,"" providing some support for Poe’s statement. Still, most observers see the State Department’s openness to funding representatives of Chavez’s government as more of a diplomatic nicety, since foreign efforts to bolster democracy in a country with democratic shortcomings are typically framed with great rhetorical care.

Indeed, there are strong signals that Chavez himself has no use for U.S. funding.

A 2010 study by FRIDE and the World Movement for Democracy, a pair of non-governmental organizations, noted that members of a local group called Súmate who had received U.S. aid for a project on electoral observance ""were accused of conspiracy and betrayal. The trial against them, which was initiated in 2003, is still pending.""

In a 2006 article based on Freedom of Information Act requests, the Associated Press reported that Chavez accused his opponents of taking ""gringo money"" to undermine his regime.

So, while it’s possible that some U.S. aid has flowed to allies of Chavez, the bulk of U.S. aid goes to independent groups whose existence is more likely to undermine his authority than strengthen it.

Where does this leave us? The one claim for which Poe may have a point is that some U.S. aid could make its way to supporters of Chavez (though not the government per se), given how the U.S. wrote the ground rules. However, Chavez has made his opposition to U.S. aid clear, and has even gone so far as to prosecute some opponents who have taken it. Meanwhile, the aid sent to Cuba is certainly not going into the government’s coffers, and it, like the Venezuela aid, is considered far likelier to undercut the government than support it.

We take no position on the wisdom of Poe’s bill, but we do think his description of U.S. aid to Venezuela and Cuba is incorrect. The relatively small amounts of money sent to those two countries is primarily going to bolstering an opposition to their governments. So while there is a tiny sliver of truth that some U.S. aid could end up going to supporters of Chavez (though not to the Chavez government itself, nor to the Cuban government), we think the overall message of Poe's claim -- that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to prop up unfriendly, undemocratic governments -- is so inaccuate that we are rating his statement False.",[],/factchecks/2011/mar/23/ted-poe/ted-poe-decries-us-aid-venezuela-cuba/
"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'John Kasich']","
Gov. John Kasich says the state ""just clawed back about $900,000"" in development aid
","
Gov. John Kasich can’t seem to stop talking about JobsOhio, his new private economic-development corporation that replaced part of the state Department of Development. He gives the department a lot of stage time when he’s promoting his budget plan.

And Kasich heaps praise on the JobsOhio architect and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Mark Kvamme (pronounced KWAH-me), who is working for $1 a year. Kasich refers to him as ""The Great Kvamme"" and introduces his presentations as ""Kvamme Time."" (Kasich moved Kvamme into a new position March 18 to avoid a legal challenge stemming from Kvamme’s out-of-state residency.)

In his State of the State speech on March 8, Kasich said ""Mark Kvamme just clawed back about $900,000 from companies that made promises and they didn't keep them.""

The governor’s claim about efforts to recoup money got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention, given that the state’s budget is tight as a drum. So we invested some time in his statement.

Kasich is referring to state’s efforts to recoup portions of aid packages the Department of Development gives companies that agree to locate, expand or remain in the Buckeye State.

The department, for example, just gave American Greetings a package of grants, loans and tax rebates worth a maximum $93.5 million over 15 years.

Like any deal, this one has strings. American Greetings promises to stay in Ohio and keep the equivalent of 1,750 full-time jobs at its headquarters. If the card maker falls short, the state can recoup a portion of its aid package.

""We're not going to give taxpayers' money to people who are not going to keep their promise,"" Kasich said during his speech. ""We're going after the money. That's the way it ought to be.""

When Kvamme started in January, he sent out what the department informally refers to as ""clawback"" notices to 11 companies that received state aid but haven’t lived up to their end of the deal.

Specifically, Kvamme is trying to recoup from these companies all or portions of ""rapid outreach grants,"" which are used for infrastructure improvements, including water, sewer, road, and rail improvements on or near a company’s property. The state is after a total of $900,312.

Leedsworld Inc. of Warren, which makes promotional business products, received a $250,000 rapid outreach grant. But state is trying to clawback  $162,875 from the company, which fell short of its job creation goal by 65 percent. The company is out of business.

The state also wants back an entire rapid outreach grant worth $250,000 that went to Haden Prism, a paint shop in Toledo that worked with DaimlerChrysler. Haden Prism sought bankruptcy protection in federal court.

So, with this background in mind, let’s circle back to Kasich’s State of the State claim and evaluate it on the Truth-Meter.

Kasich said Kvamme ""just clawed back about $900,000 from companies.""

We think the average listener would get the impression that the state has recouped $900,000 and not understand that Ohio has only begun an effort to chase a refund. Kvamme’s actions started a specific process that began with the notices he sent in January to those 11 companies.

The distinction is important because not a penny of the $900,000 target is in hand and it’s difficult to predict how much the state might ever recover.

For example, Leedsworld went out of business in 2009 and Haden declared bankruptcy in 2006, making it challenge for the state to get money from either company.

At the moment, the Department of Development does not have a statistic to reflect its success rate in recovering money. Department spokewoman Bethany McCorkle said that because of the individual nature of each deal and company, the department can’t predict how much money it can recover or when.

In interviews, Kvamme has been more precise than Kasich on the clawbacks, specifying the state is just beginning to chase the money. He also makes the larger point that the new administration is trying to be more aggressive than past ones in recouping money.

But it was Kasich who delivered the State of the State address and the clawback claim.

His words -- ""just clawed back about $900,000"" -- do contain some element of truth.  And we’re assuming here that he’s referring to the specific process by which the state sends clawback notices to companies that have not lived up to their agreements.

But Kasich spoke in the past tense, as if it was a completed action. And he gave no hint that the process just underway with no guarantee of what can be recovered. Those details might have lessened the dramatic flair of his address, but are important for the listener to fully understand his statement.

On the Truth-O-Meter we rate his claim as Half True.","[('\nInterviews with Bethany McCorckle, Ohio Department of Development spokeswoman, March 17 and March 18, 2011.\n\nGov.

Isakson: Obama policies fuel higher gas prices
","Some Republicans have repeated an interesting claim about rising gas prices.

U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., joined them in a Twitter post.

""Just the Facts: Since President Obama took office, gas prices have gone up 67 percent,"" the senator wrote.

Isakson included a link to an article with a chart from the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundationthat found gas prices rose 7 percent during the first two years and two months of Republican George W. Bush’s presidency as compared with prices during a similar time span under Barack Obama, a Democrat who took office in January 2009.

We figured Isakson was trying to make a case that Obama is not doing enough to cap rising gas prices. Isakson’s spokeswoman, Lauren Culbertson, told us her boss was indeed making that argument. She said the Obama administration has ""contributed to the increase in gas prices"" by: Some experts dispute the argument that the president can do much about gas prices, saying they are a combination of many factors, such as demand from motorists and nations such as China, along with the rising cost per barrel for crude oil. The United States gets most of its crude oil from Canada, Mexico and OPEC nations such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela.

""[The president] has limited control over gas prices,"" said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst for GasBuddy.com, an organization aimed at helping motorists find the best gas prices.

First, let’s look at whether the Heritage Foundation got its numbers right.

Crude oil accounts for two-thirds of the price of a gallon of gasoline, according to the federal government. About 10 percent of the cost comes from refining it. About another 10 percent goes toward distribution and marketing. About one-eighth of the cost of gasoline is for taxes.

The foundation’s chart (exact numbers weren’t on the article) shows that average gas prices were slightly below $2 when Bush took office in January 2001. The chart shows prices rose slightly, but were still below $2 in February 2003. Their chart shows gas prices were just below $2 when Obama became president in January 2009 and were $3.10 in February 2011. The Heritage Foundation adjusted its figures for inflation.

The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $1.51 the week Bush took office, according to the federal government’s Energy Information Administration. Prices were $1.74 for regular during the last week of February 2003, the EIA reported. That’s a 15.2 percent increase.

By contrast, EIA figures show the average price for a gallon of regular the week Obama took office was $1.83 and has risen steadily since he moved into the White House. During the last week of February, it was $3.34. That is an 82.5 percent increase.

Isakson’s math, courtesy of the Heritage Foundation, is actually lower than the federal government’s totals.

Now, is the context Isakson used to present these numbers on target?

Isakson believes the president should allow more deepwater offshore oil drilling. Obama ordered a moratorium after the disastrous BP oil spill in 2010. The Obama administration approved its first permit since the oil spill, The Associated Press reported last month.

Obama has said domestic oil production rose to a seven-year high in 2010, but others contend that is a result of policies set in place under Bush.

The president has threatened to open the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to control prices. DeHaan compared that tactic to a classic children’s story.

""That typically cools the market off,"" DeHaan said. ""But we’ve seen so many claims that the traders also discard it. It’s like the boy who cries wolf.""

Gas price analysts such as DeHaan and H. Rao Unnava, a marketing professor at Ohio State University, say market speculation and concerns about political unrest in the Middle East have resulted in a rise in crude oil prices in recent months.

In general, they say, gas prices are largely a result of supply and demand.

Federal government data shows fuel consumption rose each year between 2001 and 2007. The average price for regular gasoline also rose in each of those years. The average price rose again in 2008, when the entire nation was feeling the recession, but consumption fell. Consumption has remained steady since while gas prices have risen since the end of 2008.

""I don’t think [rising gas prices] would have much to do with President Bush or President Obama,"" said Unnava, associate dean of undergraduate programs at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business.

Unnava said when gas prices shot past $3 a gallon in the summer of 2006, some conservatives blamed it on increasing demand, particularly in other countries such as China and India. Twenty years ago, China was not among the top five oil consumers. Today, China is second to the U.S.

So where does this leave us? There are two elements to Isakson’s claim: the actual statistics and his implication that Obama is to blame for rising gas prices.

Isakson’s precise statement about gas prices is accurate. They have increased. But the overall statement, intended as a political broadside, leaves out important details and takes things out of  context.

Filing legislation that would require someone selling property to disclose whether a home swimming pool or hot tub has a hazardous drain, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, said in a press release: ""Too many Texas children are harmed and killed in pools.""

""Since 1980, over 145 incidents have been documented of suction entrapment in swimming pools and spas, including 36 deaths of children,"" according to her Feb. 16 press release.

Her proposed legislation amends the state’s seller’s disclosure notice so that sellers say whether the property has a single blockable main drain in a pool, hot tub or spa, which ""may cause a suction entrapment hazard for an individual.""

Van de Putte spokeswoman Sarah Gomez told us the senator has offered pool safety legislation the past three sessions. In 2009, the Senate approved her measure requiring residential pools and spas built or installed in Texas to be enclosed by barriers preventing small children from entering unsupervised, among other stipulations. It died in the House.

Responding to our request for back-up for the senator’s numbers, Gomez sent us the background from a 2007 federal law, an earlier study of entrapment dangers and articles indicating a federal agency has long tracked entrapment incidents and resulting deaths.

The background section of the 2007 Virgina Graeme Baker Pool and Safety Spa Act, a federal law setting tougher safety standards for public pools and spas, says that at least 33 children 14 and younger died from 1985 through 2000 as a result of drain entrapment.

Gomez also provided a May 2006 study by Safe Kids Worldwide, a Washington-based group which launched in 1988 to advocate childhood injury prevention. The group joined with Nancy Baker to advocate for the act named after her daughter, who drowned in a hot tub at a family friend’s home in Virginia after she was entrapped by the drain’s suction.

The study states that ""entrapment occurs when part of a child’s body becomes attached to a drain as a result of the powerful suction of the water circulation system, or an arm or leg is inserted into a drain with a missing or broken cover."" A child can drown if the suction overpowers his or her ability to disengage.

According to an October 2003 Pool & Spa News article, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission confirmed 147 suction entrapment incidents from 1985 and March 2002, resulting in 36 deaths — not all of them children. We asked Gomez about the senator’s reference to 36 child deaths, Gomez said Van de Putte misread that statistic. ""It was 36 total deaths,"" she said. ""It was not intentional and she was not trying to mislead anyone.""

Next, Tanya Chin Ross, director of policy for Safe Kids Worldwide, pointed us to a May 2010 memo from the product safety commission tracking drain entrapments and deaths each year from 1999 to 2009, listing 94 entrapments in pools, spas and whirlpool tubs — including 49 incidents in residential facilities. The agency’s tally suggests that at least six entrapped children died from 2001 through 2009, a result that would make the total of confirmed child deaths from such incidents since 1985 at least 39.

According to the memo, the commission eliminated reports that didn’t involve drain entrapments or were duplicates. Commission spokeswoman Kathleen Reilly told us that the agency investigates incident reports it receives directly. Otherwise, the agency tries to confirm claims ""by getting as much data as possible,"" including hospital and police reports, she said.

Reilly told us that between 1985 and 2009, the agency received reports of 154 incidents resulting from pool, spa, hot tub or whirlpool entrapments, including 54 deaths; she didn’t have a count for children who died.  

Finally, we sought Texas-specific data. Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of State Health Services, told us the agency tabulates pool drownings, but not yet drain entrapments.

All told, it looks like Van de Putte understates the 154 people, at least, who have been sucked into a U.S. pool or spa drain. While her backup information didn’t prove that 36 children died as a result, the sources we culled suggest that at least 39 children have perished.

We rate her statement as True.","[('\nPress release: Senator Van de Putte files legislation to increase swimming pool safety, Feb. 16, 2011\n\nS.B. 710 relating to the disclosure of a hazardous drain in a swimming pool or spa by a seller of residential real property, filed Feb. 15, 2011\n\nS.B. 96 relating to swimming pool and spa safety, filed Nov. 10, 2008\n\nS.B. 971, relating to swimming pool safety, filed Feb. 27, 2007\n\nE-mail interview with Sarah Gomez, communications director for Sen.

Morgan Griffith says EPA standards are so strict that Perrier would not pass
","
What do French bottled water and Appalachian streams have in common?

More than you might think, according to Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, R-9th. A vocal opponent of the Environmental Protection Agency, the southwest Virginia legislator pledged in February to roll back regulations governing water from mountain-top mining areas.

""Not even expensive bottled water, like Perrier and Evian, are of good enough quality to pump out of mines in Southwest Virginia, according to the EPA regulation,"" Griffith wrote.

Standards so strict that Perrier and Evian would fail? We couldn’t swallow that without checking. We had two questions: Would fancy bottled water really fail a conductivity test? And would that sort of test actually tell us anything about the safety of the bottled water?

First, a word about EPA the standards and how mountain-top mining works. This form of mining relies on explosives to expose coal seams in far southwest Virginia and West Virginia. The controlled explosions generate huge piles of debris that often bury nearby valleys.

In April 2010 the EPA said ""the resulting waste that then fills valleys and streams can significantly compromise water quality, often causing permanent damage to ecosystems and rendering streams unfit for swimming, fishing and drinking.""

The agency established a new purity standard for streams near coal mining areas, saying it was updating provisions of the Clean Water Act to set new conductivity levels. Conductivity is a measurement of how well water transmits an electrical charge and gives a reading on the amount of dissolved solids in water.

The EPA set a maximum conductivity of 500 microSiemens per centimeter, which the agency says is about five times higher than a normal level and should ""protect 95 percent of aquatic life in the coal regions.""

Emily Bernhardt, an associate professor of biology at Duke University, studies water quality in coal-mining areas. She told us conductivity is a ""really inexpensive way to see if you have a lot of constituents in water.""

In coal-mining regions, she said, conductivity is correlated with sulfate. Pyrite, a mineral made up of coal and sulphur ions, is found in coal seams and filters into water.

She said if water near coal mines has high conductivity, it usually contains a lot of sulfates and metals. Streams in mining areas often show elevated sulfur levels, as well as higher levels of iron, selenium and manganese. But the test is designed solely for rural Appalachia, not for use  across the country. In urban areas, for example, high conductivity may occur when road salt is washed into streams.

So how do Perrier and Evian seep into this debate?

Beth Breeding, Griffith’s press secretary, told us the congressman’s comments were based on the EPA’s conductivity guidance. But the EPA website makes no mention of Perrier or other bottled waters.

Griffith’s claim appears to come from Alpha Natural Resources, the nation’s third-largest coal mining company. A PowerPoint slide circulated by the company says Evian, Perrier and San Pellegrino would all fail EPA conductivity tests.

We asked Rick Nida, a spokesman for Alpha, whether his company thinks the EPA test is a fair way to evaluate the impact of mountain-top mining.

""We don’t think it’s a good standard to use,"" he said. ""The point is rules are so stringent that bottle water doesn’t pass.  

Richard Yost, a spokesman for the EPA, said the standards are designed to protect aquatic species in the water, not necessarily determine whether the water is safe to drink.

""The science demonstrates that stream life present in waters contaminated by mine waste is killed when salinity levels rise above levels that would not be toxic to humans who may drink such water,"" Yost said.  ""Aquatic organisms and people respond to salinity in very different ways, so it is not technically valid to make direct comparisons between healthy levels of salinity in central Appalachian streams and acceptable levels of salinity in drinking water.""

Rather than rely on Alpha’s conductivity data, we put these bottled waters to the test. Paul Bukaveckas, an associate professor of biology at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies river ecology, invited us to conduct the tests at his lab.  

Mac Lee, a laboratory specialist at VCU, used a sensor he and Bukaveckas employ on the James River. We tested the conductivity of distilled water, Evian, Perrier, Pellegrino and, last of all, a sample taken from the James River in downtown Richmond.

Here were our test results:
  
So the bottled water has a conductivity level higher than the EPA’s 500 microSiemens threshold. We asked Bernhardt and Bukaveckas if that is a relevant piece of information.

Bukaveckas, the VCU biologist, said the argument reminds him of those raised 20 years ago by power companies disputing the impact -- or even existence -- of acid rain.

""They’d point to lakes and say, ‘These are naturally acidic.’ But if you did water tests, you’d find that undamaged lakes were acidic because of organic or naturally occurring acids,"" he said.

The damaged lakes, in contrast, contained acids created by emissions from the smokestacks of power plants.

Bernhardt, of Duke, said water is different in each environment, making a comparison between French springs and Appalachian streams pointless.

""The EPA’s data find that high conductivity is most closely correlated with the loss of species,"" Bernhardt said about Appalachian water. ""Salty water makes it harder for freshwater fish to live. So maybe it is bad for freshwater fish to be dumped in Pellegrino, but that’s not the right argument to have.""

Let’s review our findings.

After conducting an independent test, we agree with Griffith’s claim that Perrier, Evian and Pellegrino all have conductivity levels above the limits the EPA sets for streams in Appalachian coal areas.

But the fact that a Pellegrino bath could kill Virginia’s fish population is irrelevant to these water standards. According to independent water experts, high conductivity in coal country strongly correlates with the loss of aquatic species.

Griffith sought to confuse the issue with a non sequitur about bottled water. Saying Perrier is good for humans and therefore must be OK for fish seems to us like saying that because humans eat oranges, fish should too.

The congressman has ignored critical facts to give his constituents a skewed impression of an EPA rule. We rate the claim Barely True. ","[('\nRep.

Ann Coulter says exposure to low levels of radiation is good for you, reduces cancer risk
","As news broke last week that Japan's nuclear disaster may result in low levels of radiation wafting all the way to the U.S., political pundit Ann Coulter wrote a column arguing that too much is made of exposure to low levels of radiation. In an appearance on Fox's O'Reilly Factor on March 17, Coulter argued some exposure to radiation may actually be good for you.

""There is a growing body of evidence that radiation in excess of what the government says are the minimum amounts you should be exposed to are actually good for you and reduce cases of cancer,"" Coulter said.

Before you go sticking your head in the X-ray machine, a little perspective is in order here. While there are scientists who subscribe to the theory that low levels of radiation can have beneficial health effects -- it's called hormesis -- it is still an outside-the-mainstream opinion.

""There is not a shred of evidence that radiation is good for you,"" said Eric Hall, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University in New York City.

As for hormesis, Hall said, ""No one in the mainstream believes it.""

Said Fred Mettler, a radiation expert at the University of New Mexico: ""Ms. Coulter -- who I find very enjoyable -- might be better sticking to political opinions.""

Mettler, the U.S. representative for the United Nations committee on the health effects of radiation, pointed us to a chapter on hormesis from his book, Medical Effects of Ionizing Radiation.  In the book, Mettler calls hormesis ""a concept that is controversial at best.""

""Early studies in the United States seemed to suggest a hormetic effect, or at least there were areas of higher radiation background that had lower cancer incidence,"" Mettler wrote. In particular, Mettler cited the work of T. D. Luckey, professor emeritus at the University of Missouri, Columbia, School of Medicine, who argued in multiple studies that evidence shows ""a significant decrease in cancer mortality rates of lightly exposed humans.""

Mettler cautioned not to read too much into such studies, however.

""In addition to variability in populations, statistical uncertainties, potential bias factors, and chance, on one hand there will be instances in which there was less effect than predicted,"" he wrote. ""This is all understandable without invoking a unifying hypothesis of hormesis.""

Owen Hoffman, a radiation-risk expert at Senes Oak Ridge Inc., a center for risk analysis, said that studies show low levels of radiation might eliminate some cancer but initiate others. ""Certainly radiation kills cells and can stimulate immune responses,"" Hoffman said. ""Thus it is possible for precursors of cancers, which are produced in the absence of above-background radiation exposure, might be eliminated through the processes of cell killing and immune response activation. But radiation exposures, even at background levels, can also initiate, promote new cancers and accelerate the manifestation of cancers that would occur in later life in the absence of exposure.""

Hoffman also pointed to the work of Dr. Charles Land of the National Cancer Institute, who ""has shown in several of his recent publications that there is considerable uncertainty in the estimation of radiation risk. In his work, he does not give much credibility to the possibility that radiation induces a protective or beneficial effect. On the other hand, he concludes that even if some credibility could be given to the possibility of a threshold or beneficial effect of radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates, the biological and epidemiological evidence that new cancers may be initiated or promoted by radiation exposure cannot be completely ruled out.""
 
""At present,"" Hoffman said, ""carefully conducted epidemiological evidence does not support the presence of such beneficial effects in human populations that have been carefully monitored and followed up over time.""
 
In her blog post, Coulter cited the work of Bernard L. Cohen, a physics professor at the University of Pittsburgh, who ""compared radon exposure and lung cancer rates in 1,729 counties covering 90 percent of the U.S. population. His study in the 1990s found far fewer cases of lung cancer in those counties with the highest amounts of radon -- a correlation that could not be explained by smoking rates.""

We e-mailed Cohen and asked him about Coulter's statement.

""Word for word, what she says is correct,"" Cohen responded. ""It could go further and say that no other confounding factors (like socioeconomics, geography, etc., 500 were explored) can explain the results. However, my study was designed to test the assumption that the danger of radiation is simply proportional to the radiation dose, which is the only evidence that low-level radiation may be harmful. My conclusion was that that assumption is false.

""Whether low-level radiation is protective against cancer, a theory called hormesis, is debated in the scientific community,"" Cohen said. ""There is evidence on both sides.""

So where does this leave us?

We are not rating whether hormesis -- or as Coulter put it, the theory that exposure to low levels of radiation is actually good for you and reduces cases of cancer -- is correct. Reputable scientists disagree about that. We're rating whether Coulter was correct in saying there is ""a growing body of evidence"" that radiation in excess of approved exposure levels may be beneficial.

There is a small but growing body of research to back up those claims. But the fact is that the mainstream of the scientific community has not embraced the theory. They point to limitations of those studies and argue the research falls well short of scientific evidence. Coulter failed to present this counter-weight, the opinion shared by the majority in the scientific community, which doesn't buy into -- and in many cases outright rejects -- the idea that low levels of radiation can have beneficial health effects and reduce the risk of cancer. And so we rate Coulter's claim Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ","[('Human Events, ""A Glowing Report on Radiation,"" by Ann Coulter, March 16, 2011\n\nNew York Times, ""Radiation Over U.S. Is Harmless, Officials Say,"" by William J.

What does it cost governments for automatic payroll deductions?
","
Some Republicans in the Florida Legislature are squaring off against unions over a measure that would prohibit public employers from collecting union dues through automatic payroll deductions.

Republicans call the measure ""paycheck protection,"" and say it gives individual union members more power over how their dues money is spent. The law would prohibit public unions from utilizing payroll deductions and would require unions to get annual authorizations from members to use their dues for political reasons. But opponents liken the measure to union busting, saying it will make it more difficult for unions to collect dues. They also argue that the law is unnecessary because Florida is a right-to-work state where no employee can be forced to join a union and pay union dues. By choosing to join the union and pay dues, members are effectively supporting the union's agenda.

The back-and-forth has played out several times in House and Senate committee hearings where the bill has been considered. The House version, HB 1021, is being sponsored by Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary. Its Senate companion, SB 830, is sponsored by Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine.

Thrasher argued before the Senate Community Affairs Committee on March 14, 2011, that another reason to support his bill is to remove the government costs of processing union dues collections -- which in turn could be used for political purposes. Thrasher said he had heard from taxpayers who thought ""their resources ought not be used to facilitate private political agendas.""

In the middle of a complex policy discussion, this seemed like an important fact to pin down -- what do governments spend on collecting union dues through payroll deductions?

We caught up with Thrasher on the Senate floor to ask him if he had more information about the costs to government. He said he did not, but that there had to be some cost just by the nature of the government performing a task -- payroll deduction -- on behalf of a private entity.

""We need to get state and local governments out of the business of being involved in political purposes,"" he said, echoing comments he made to the Senate committee members.

Payroll deduction is common for all workers. Employees automatically have money taken out of their paycheck to pay for all kinds of things. Some deductions are voluntary: student loans, charitable donations, health insurance, life insurance, union dues. Some deductions are not: taxes, alimony and other court-ordered deductions.

The state of Florida currently has 364 groups or agencies that have the ability to take money directly from employees' paychecks. Here's the entire list provided to PolitiFact Florida by the state Chief Financial Officer's Office.

Three different state legislative analysts have examined the bill, and all at least attempted to see how much governments spend deducting union dues from pay checks. The answer was generally not much, if anything.

A House staff analysis said the elimination of payroll deduction for employee unions ""may result in a positive, but insignificant, fiscal impact on public employers.""

A second House analysis said the elimination of payroll deductions ""may result in a neutral fiscal impact to public employers.""

A Senate staff analysis declared the fiscal impact to governments ""indeterminate.""

The CFO's office, which oversees the state payroll system through the Bureau of State Payrolls, told PolitiFact Florida that the process for setting up payroll deduction is ""by and large automated.""

Spokeswoman Alexis Lambert said it's as simple as some group requesting a deduction, that request being approved or denied, and then the bureau assigning a deduction code. ""The bureau's deduction code process is, by and large, automated and represents a minimal cost,"" Lambert said.

Practically speaking, there is some personnel time required to set up the deduction and that's about it.

State statutes also permit governments to ask unions to pay for deduction costs as part of collective bargaining. Section 447.303, which discusses dues collection for public employees, says that ""reasonable costs to the employer of said deductions shall be a proper subject of collective bargaining.""

And then there's Dorworth, the House sponsor, who told members of the House Budget Committee on March 21, 2011, that eliminating payroll deductions isn't a cost-savings measure. In responding to a question about the cost of eliminating the payroll deductions, Dorworth said, ""I tend to agree. There's not any (financial) impact either way.""

Whatever the state spends on processing payroll deductions, it is so small no one can quantify it. Governments also could ask unions to pay for the cost as part of a union's collective bargaining agreement. There are reasons to vote for this bill, and Dorworth and Thrasher have articulated them, but cost isn't one of them. To us, that makes Thrasher's claim Barely True.",[],/factchecks/2011/mar/22/john-thrasher/what-does-it-cost-governments-automatic-payroll-de/

Robin Wright says coalition against Gadhafi is widest by Arab nations since 1991
","
Shortly after the launch of air and missile attacks against Libya by an international alliance that included the United States, journalist Robin Wright sought to provide television viewers with some context for understanding the coalition of nations opposing Moammar Gadhafi, the alliance’s target.

During a roundtable segment on the March 20, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, the host asked Wright -- a veteran diplomatic correspondent who’s now a scholar at the U.S. Institute of Peace -- whether Gadhafi is ""crazy"" and how secure his hold on power is.

""He could prolong this for a very long time,"" Wright said. ""This is not a man who plays by international rules, nor is he a man who thinks like even many of his counterparts in the Arab world, and that's why I think you've seen a great deal of unity in the Arab world against him. …""

Amanpour interjected, ""Which is really unusual, to have such a big Arab coalition against a fellow Arab leader.""

Wright agreed, saying, ""And we haven't had one like this since the Iraq war back in 1990-1991. And that's what's, in fact, given the international community the legs. Without that, we probably would not be engaged.""

We wondered whether Wright was correct about the scope of Arab support for these alliances. So we looked into it.

The Persian Gulf War

The Persian Gulf War was waged to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait, which had been invaded by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in August 1990. Thanks in large part to the diplomacy of then-President George H.W. Bush, a broad, international coalition was brought to bear against Hussein, and by the end of February 1991, allied troops had succeeded in pushing Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.

Troops from several Arab states took part in ground combat, notably Egypt, Syria, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Several smaller states along the Persian Gulf also took part in the war either in combat roles or by providing logistics or base support -- Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The main exception among major Arab states was Jordan, which sided with Iraq.

The Iraq War

The next major conflict involving an Arab leader was the Iraq War, launched in 2003 by President George W. Bush with the aim of toppling Hussein, who had remained in power despite the 1990-1991 war.

This conflict proved much more controversial internationally, and the Bush administration had little success signing up Arab support. Scott Althaus and Kalev Leetaru of the University of Illinois  at Urbana-Champaign have recorded in great detail the shifting membership of the ""coalition of the willing"" -- the younger Bush’s list of Iraq War supporters, but we could only find one Arab nation on the list, Kuwait.

Libya

Following a wave of popular uprisings against entrenched leaders across the Arab world, rebellion sprang up in Libya, which had been ruled for decades by Gadhafi. The rebels scored some quick victories, but by mid March, forces loyal to Gadhafi began to gain back lost territory. Fears of wider bloodshed rose, and international diplomacy kicked into high gear.

On March 12, 2011, the Arab League -- a group of nearly two dozen Arab nations that recently suspended Libya’s membership -- urged the United Nations to establish a ""no-fly"" zone aimed at crippling Gadhafi’s ability to strike the rebels from the air. On March 17, 2011, the U.N. Security Council complied, and the U.S., France and the United Kingdom drew up military plans. Attacks began on March 19.

In addition to the Arab League’s support for the mission, at least two Arab nations -- Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- have reportedly pledged tangible military assistance. On March 21, Al Jazeera reported that a French military spokesman had said that four Qatari jets were expected to take part in operations against Gadhafi.

In addition, there are unconfirmed news reports that Egypt is letting arms shipments into the rebels in neighboring eastern Libya, but the Egyptian government -- which is in a transitional status following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in a popular revolution earlier this year -- has not made any official pledges of military support.

Our conclusion

Wright is correct that the Libya campaign represents the largest alignment of Arab states against a fellow Arab leader since the Persian Gulf War of 1990-1991. However, the significance of this fact is the subject of some debate.

For starters, support for the Libyan situation is in flux. Just days after calling for the no-fly zone, the head of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, backtracked somewhat by expressing reservations about the risks of civilian deaths in the initial round of attacks. Later, in comments to reporters in Cairo, he reaffirmed support for the coalition’s efforts. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether more Arab nations will join the effort individually -- and whether troops take as significant a role in the Libyan operations as Arab troops did during the Persian Gulf War.

In other words, it’s very early in the process, and Arab support could dissipate.

On the other hand, even if the extent of military assistance by Arab states proves to be limited, experts told PolitiFact that the political and diplomatic consequences so far are by themselves notable.

""I think Robin’s point is that Arab states have not lined up together, militarily or politically, against a fellow Arab leader like this since 1991,"" said Tom Malinowski, Washington director for Human Rights Watch. ""They could have done so in other cases – in Sudan over Darfur, for example, or against Gadhafi at various points in the past, or even against Mubarak earlier this year. But they didn’t, and now they have. And I wouldn’t say that’s trivial.""

Stephen McInerney, executive director of the Project on Middle East Democracy, agreed, saying that the difference between the lack of Arab support for the Iraq War and the support for the situation in Libya is ""extremely significant.""

"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says the 2011 budget shortfall isn't that much different than what lawmakers faced in 2003
","
After urging GOP Texas House members to cut the state budget before dipping into the state’s ""rainy day"" fund, Gov. Rick Perry told reporters outside the closed-door meeting that he’d compared the situation to what lawmakers faced in the 2003 session.

""So we talked about the difference between 2003 and 2011,"" Perry said. ""And the percentage of the budget shortfall versus the budget is really not that much different than it was in 2003.""

We asked Perry’s office to elaborate, then hunted comparisons of the state’s current fiscal situation to 2003 when lawmakers resolved a $9.9 billion projected revenue shortfall with funding cuts, fee increases, federal aid and other strategies. Missing from that mix: state tax increases.

In a Feb. 20 political commentary, reporter Peggy Fikac of Hearst Newspapers quoted an expert saying today’s budget crunch is most comparable to 1987 when lawmakers and GOP Gov. Bill Clements agreed to a record tax increase. Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, told Fikac the operating state deficit then was just under $1 billion, or 4.1 percent of discretionary state revenue -- that is, income that’s not constitutionally dedicated to specific purposes. In 2003, Craymer advised, lawmakers faced an operating deficit of $1.8 billion, 2.9 percent of discretionary state general revenue.

The column quotes Craymer saying the current budget year’s $4.3 billion operating deficit -- 4.6 percent of discretionary revenue --""beats both of those . . . It’s a tougher challenge than either 2003 or 1987.""

Recently, two former Democratic elected officials pressed a similar point. A Feb. 1 letter to business leaders from former Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby and Scott McCown, a former state district judge who directs the Center for Public Policy Priorities, states: ""Texas faces its largest revenue shortfall in decades... a far larger shortfall than we faced in 2003 and even larger than we faced in 1987, until now the biggest shortfall in recent times.""

Budgetary refresher: A deficit means that the state is running short of money to cover current spending. Shortfall usually refers to a projected gap between expected revenue and future spending needs.

Fikac’s column touched on the projected $10 billion revenue shortfall faced by lawmakers in 2003, but did not compare it to the $15 billion to $27 billion shortfall that’s currently projected if the state either maintains current spending or the current level of government services through 2012-13.

However, the taxpayers association did. In a January presentation at the Capitol, the group said that in 2003, the money that had been needed to maintain current spending was equal to 12.4 percent of expected discretionary general revenue, and the money needed to maintain current government services amounted to 15.6 percent of expected revenue. According to the presentation, comparable percentages now are 17.2 percent and 26.2 percent, respectively.

Upshot: The current-spending shortfall is 40 percent larger than in 2003 while the shortfall to maintain current services is nearly 63 percent larger.

The presentation also says that in 2003, lawmakers budgeted $1.3 billion in federal fiscal relief funds while the 2011 Legislature has no expectations of similar aid. Also, the 2003 Legislature reduced eligibility for some health and human services programs while federal law now may prohibit cuts to services and eligibility, absent federal approval of waiver requests.

Finally, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us Perry’s position is that ""the situation we face today is very similar to the situation we faced in 2003."" As then, lawmakers ""don’t have as much money as we did last budget cycle. But we are going to work with what we have"" without raising taxes, Frazier said.

Our read: If it’s reasonable to make the comparisons we’ve laid out--and we think it is--then Texas faces a significantly greater shortfall now than in 2003. And that’s without taking into account the unlikelihood of a federal aid rescue and potentially greater difficulties reducing health and human services.

Whether the budget can be written without new taxes, as Perry advocates, is not the issue. His statement is False.","[('\nCenter for Public Policy Priorities, Austin, letter from Scott McCown and former Lt. Gov.
