Much of the U.S. is experiencing drought. That’s not a lie
","Following months of debunked claims that fires and explosions at farms and food processing plants were proof that planned food shortages are imminent, social media users have added a new ingredient to the plot: water.  One such post claims that the QAnon refrain ""watch the water,"" points to efforts to create food shortages and control Americans. ""When Q told us to watch the water it had nothing to do with snake venom or foreign invasion,"" read a July 6 post. ""Watch the water was concerning drought, and the control of the food supply based on climate change fraud. Why do you think so many food processing plants were being burned down? … Drought is a lie, so they can turn off the taps and limit farming to further control the food growth of this country and thus control the people."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""Q"" refers to an anonymous internet persona who promoted a widespread, baseless conspiracy theory centered on the belief that a secret cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles, including many prominent Democrats and celebrities, is operating a global sex-trafficking ring that former President Donald Trump was recruited to take down.  PolitiFact has debunked a number of QAnon claims, and this post’s claim that ""they"" are lying about drought to control Americans is false, too. Much of the U.S. is experiencing drought. The National Centers for Environmental Information describes drought as ""​​the absence of water"" that ""slowly sneaks up and impacts many sectors of the economy, and operates on many different time scales."" Just over 50% of the lower 48 states were in drought as of July 12, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Integrated Drought Information System. Including Hawaii and Alaska, 44.98% of the U.S. was in drought.  A coyote walks across dry land that was once under the water of Lake Mead near Hemenway Harbor at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area on, July 4, 2022, in Boulder City, Nev. (AP) The weekly updated U.S. Drought Monitor map shows the location and intensity of drought across the U.S. using a five-category classification: abnormally dry (predrought conditions), moderate, severe, extreme and exceptional drought.  About 218 million acres of U.S. crops, largely corn and soybeans that rely on rain rather than irrigation, were experiencing drought, and 40 states were experiencing moderate drought or worse, the week of July 6 to July 12, according to national data.  The Drought Monitor map is created by scientists from the NOAA, the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln and the U.S. Department of Agriculture who evaluate regional drought conditions, consult with experts and publish the map. ""Each week, drought experts consider how recent precipitation totals across the country compare to their long-term averages,"" the National Integrated Drought Information System’s website said. ""They check variables including temperatures, soil moisture, water levels in streams and lakes, snow cover and meltwater runoff. Experts also check whether areas are showing drought impacts such as water shortages and business interruptions.""  There’s no evidence that these organizations are lying about droughts in the U.S, as the post suggests. But we found numerous news reports in which farmers and others reported drought-related setbacks and changes. One California farmer told CNN he didn’t have enough water to plant crops on all his land, so he stopped growing asparagus and sweet corn. BBC reported that another farmer in California said he didn’t have enough water to plant his usual tomato crop. In Arizona, a farmer told CNBC he’d stopped growing cotton, which requires more water, to focus on corn, wheat and alfalfa.  In 2021, the severe drought in the West drained reservoirs, reducing hydropower plants’ output. Power production was down 25% at the Hoover Dam in Nevada, one of the largest hydropower generators in the U.S., The Associated Press reported. Compared with a 10-year average, California hydropower plants generated 48% less electricity in 2021 — and the outlook in 2022 is worse, per MIT Technology Review.  Houseboats sit in the drought lowered waters of Oroville Lake, near Oroville, Calif., on April 19, 2022. (AP) Australia’s ABC News reported that the Great Salt Lake in Utah has lost nearly half its surface area from the historic average and now contains just one-fourth of the water it held at its high point in 1987. Since 2000, the flow of the Colorado River has declined almost 20%, the Los Angeles Times reported. Researchers attribute 42% of the extended drought in the Southwest since 2000 and 19% of the severe 2021 drought in the Southwest to human-caused climate change, The Washington Post and CNBC reported. Some places have set regulations to conserve water, but there’s no evidence these actions are tied to efforts to reduce food supplies and control Americans. A Facebook post claimed that ""drought is a lie"" designed to limit farming, reduce the food supply and ultimately control Americans. There is no evidence to support this claim, which the post links to unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. Data shows that more than 50% of the contiguous United States was in drought as of July 12.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

Facebook post relies on debunked conspiracy theory for election fraud claim
","A Facebook video claims evidence of election fraud can be found in CNN’s 2019 coverage of the Kentucky governor’s race. ""What you’re about to see is the single most egregious, real-time example of electronic vote fraud maybe ever captured,"" a voiceover in the July 10 video says. ""And it occurred live on CNN."" The video features a man talking about the changing vote totals in the race between Democrat Andy Beshear and Republican incumbent Matt Bevin as it plays a snippet of CNN’s 2019 broadcast, which featured on-screen graphics showing vote totals. A large graphic took up the main part of the screen; a small banner at the bottom of the screen showed the results. Both graphics showed Beshear with 673,948 votes and Bevin with 662,235, but an update occurred during the portion of the broadcast featured in the video. After the update, the larger graphic showed Beshear with 674,508 votes and Bevin with 661,675 — a difference of 560 votes for both candidates. There was a delay in updating the totals in the bottom banner, which meant the screen briefly and simultaneously showed Bevin with 661,675 votes in the larger graphic and 662,235 in the smaller graphic. The man narrating the video claims the discrepancy is proof the votes were stolen from Bevin and given to Beshear. ""This is vote switching in the computer,"" he says. Beshear would go on to win the Nov. 5, 2019, election by more than 5,000 votes. The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although it’s not mentioned in the narration or caption, the belief that the votes were changed electronically is consistent with the Hammer and Scorecard conspiracy theory — which PolitiFact previously ruled Pants on Fire. The theory suggests the ""deep state,"" a cabal of entrenched government operatives, uses a supercomputer called ""Hammer"" to break into protected networks and change an election’s vote totals, aided by software called ""Scorecard."" A former military contractor and self-described whistleblower with a history of making wildly inaccurate statements claimed he created the computer and program. The theory gained popularity after the 2020 presidential election among supporters of former President Donald Trump, who wanted to prove the election was stolen and overturn the results. Chris Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security created by Trump in 2018, characterized the theory as disinformation and nonsense. ""It’s just that — nonsense,"" Krebs said in a 2020 tweet. ""This is not a real thing, don’t fall for it and think 2x before you share."" CISA says every state has safeguards to ensure ballots cast during an election are correctly counted. Voting machines produce a paper audit trail, which can be manually counted as a check against the voting machine’s electronic result. There has been ""no indication that cybervulnerabilities have contributed to any voting system deleting, losing or changing votes,"" the agency said. Bevin initially refused to concede the Kentucky governor’s race to Beshear, and called for a recanvass of the votes. The recanvassing involved reprinting the receipts from the state’s voting machines to check for clerical or reporting errors and recounting the results to ensure the correct totals were sent to Kentucky’s State Board of Elections.   The final results did not change for Bevin or Beshear, and there was no evidence found of 560 votes being taken from one candidate and given to another. Election experts previously told PolitiFact inconsistencies in vote totals reported by news organizations like CNN don’t mean anything nefarious. Philip Stark, a statistics professor at the University of California, Berkeley,  said the numbers reported by the media on election night are not binding. Only a government’s election agency can make the final call on a race’s vote totals. Stark said the numbers CNN relied on for its election night coverage came from a third-party vendor, making counting errors more likely. People trying to hack an election wouldn’t change the election night numbers on a widely seen news network, Stark said. They would change the numbers directly in a voting machine’s system. A Facebook video claims to show that evidence from CNN’s coverage of the 2019 Kentucky governor’s race proves the election was stolen by changing votes after they were cast.  The post relied on a debunked conspiracy theory that claims a supercomputer operated by a cabal of government operatives was used to change the results.  Government officials and election experts say there are safeguards to catch inconsistencies in the numbers voting machines send and election offices receive.  We rate this Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x00000280976F6240>],/factchecks/2022/jul/19/facebook-posts/facebook-post-relies-debunked-conspiracy-theory-el/

No, Biden didn’t admit to plotting to make gasoline prices high
","""Biden ADMITS $5 gas is being done ON PURPOSE!"" the text accompanying a video in a July 7 Instagram post says. ""This has been his plan all along.""  ""And when it comes to the gas prices, we’re going through an incredible transition that is taking place that, God willing, when it’s over, we’ll be stronger and the world will be stronger and less reliant on fossil fuels when this is over,"" Biden says in the clip.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The clip is authentic. We found the remarks in which Biden discussed gasoline prices on May 23. He was in Tokyo at the time, participating in a joint press conference with Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida.  A reporter asked Biden whether a recession in the United States was inevitable after noting that ""Americans are dealing with record-high inflation"" and ""there are just enormously high gas prices."" Biden replied that he didn’t think a recession was inevitable. After the reporter pushed him to explain why, Biden talked about new jobs around the country and a growing gross domestic product in the face of problems he said the rest of the world was also experiencing.  ""Here’s the situation,"" he said. ""And when it comes to the gas prices, we’re going through an incredible transition that is taking place that, God willing, when it’s over, we’ll be stronger and the world will be stronger and less reliant on fossil fuels when this is over."" But his subsequent comments make it clear he wasn’t suggesting that it was his plan to have high gas prices, as the post claims.  ""And what I’ve been able to do to keep it from getting even worse — and it’s bad — the price of gas at the pump is something that I told you, you heard me say before, it would be a matter of great discussion at my kitchen table when I was a kid growing up. It’s affecting a lot of families. But we have released over 200 and, I think, 57,000 — million barrels of oil, I should say.  Us and the rest of the world we convinced to get involved.  It’s helped, but it’s not been enough."" He went on to say that ""This is going to be a haul"" and will ""take some time."" ""But in the meantime, it seems to me the best thing I can do — in addition to try to get the Middle Eastern countries, including OPEC, to raise their production of oil and move along that route — is to see to it that we continue to grow our economy, create jobs,"" Biden said. More recently, Biden has said Americans will endure high gas prices for ""as long as it takes"" to keep Russia at bay — ""so Russia cannot in fact defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine,"" Biden said June 30.  He’s also proposed a three-month federal gas tax holiday and asked states to suspend their gas taxes to try to lower gas prices by $1 a gallon.  As we’ve previously reported, the country’s record-high prices at the pump followed a reduction of gasoline supplies as producers responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, when people weren’t traveling as much because of restrictions. As restrictions eased and the economy started to recover, production and supplies were slow to catch up to demand, and gas prices rose. The pandemic also affected supplies of necessary hardware for oil production, and there was a worker shortage. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also affected gas prices in the United States. The U.S. and Europe reduced their use of Russian energy, which shrank available supplies here further. Hugh Daigle, a petroleum and geosystems engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin, told PolitiFact that ""gasoline prices are still being driven by the COVID hangover as well as the geopolitical situation in Ukraine. Basically, all the movement in both oil and gasoline prices can nearly completely be explained by these two factors.""

The James Webb Space Telescope and the images it has taken are real
","The first dazzling images from the James Webb Space Telescope were shared July 12 and provided a window into the universe’s distant past. But a video uploaded to Facebook the same day questions the veracity of the photos and the telescope’s existence. The video runs for about 13 minutes and includes a man commenting over clips from a White House briefing on the telescope and a television newscast detailing the telescope’s development. ""THE REAL REASON WHY ‘NASA’ PUSHING THE JAMES WEBB TELESCOPE IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER THE WORLD WIDE FAMINE ALREADY STARTED,"" the video’s title proclaims. At the video’s beginning, the man says he is ""about to expose this fakery they got for the masses,"" referring to the James Webb Space Telescope. ""I can’t believe they keep passing off this fakery as real,"" he says. ""But, guess what? In the new world order, that’s what they’re going to be able to do. Pass off all these dumb s--- on the masses."" The man makes several outlandish claims about how there’s ""nothing sensible"" to the James Webb Space Telescope. He says the telescope can’t be real because it uses mirrors and is nothing like a traditional telescope that someone can look through. He also claims it’s impossible for the telescope to transmit images back to Earth because there’s ""nothing carrying internet in space."" The pictures the telescope took can’t be real because galaxies don’t exist and the Earth is ""covered by a dome"" and in a trapped environment, the man says. None of his claims have any basis in fact or reality. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The development and construction of the James Webb Space Telescope has been well documented over the years. The James Webb Space Telescope was first proposed in 1996 as a way to explore our cosmic history and the universe’s origins by viewing galaxies billions of miles from Earth, according to NASA. The James Webb Space Telescope is considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched April 24, 1990. Whereas the Hubble telescope orbits 340 miles above the Earth and captures images using visible and ultraviolet light, the James Webb telescope scans space using infrared light and is positioned about 1 million miles from Earth. There are two types of optical telescopes — refracting and reflecting. Refracting telescopes focus light through a lens to magnify a faraway image — similar to how eyeglasses focus light to make blurry images clear. Reflecting telescopes concentrate light by bouncing it off of a mirror to magnify an image. Although the James Webb telescope doesn’t look like traditional tube-shaped models, it is still considered a reflecting telescope. The James Webb Space Telescope uses a 19.7-foot-tall primary mirror to collect light. That light is bounced to a smaller secondary mirror, which then redirects it onto the telescope’s instruments, including a camera that records an image. Unlike what the Facebook video implies, broadcasting a signal through space is not impossible and has happened since the radio was invented in the 1890s. Radio and television signals emanating from Earth have even traveled outside our solar system. The James Webb Space Telescope is equipped with a high-frequency radio transmitter that can send information it has gathered, including images, toward Earth. That information is then collected by large radio antennas positioned around the world as part of the NASA Deep Space Network, which then forwards it to the Webb Science and Operation Center in Baltimore. The video’s claim that galaxies don’t exist is also unfounded. The concept of the night sky being filled with stars can be traced back to ancient times. The Greek philosopher Democritus theorized in the fifth century B.C. that a bright band of light that could be seen in the night sky was a collection of stars. He was describing part of the Milky Way galaxy.  For a long time, people thought the Milky Way was the universe’s only galaxy. That changed in 1923, when Edwin Hubble was observing what was then known as the Andromeda Nebula at the Mount Wilson Observatory in Los Angeles County. Hubble was looking at a dim cluster of stars and found one considered a cepheid variable, which allows astronomers to measure distance based on that star's changing brightness. Using that star, Hubble calculated that the cluster wasn’t a nearby nebula within the Milky Way; it was an entirely separate galaxy. He looked at other recorded nebulae and concluded there were millions of other galaxies in the universe. The video’s description of the Earth being covered in a dome is connected to the long-debunked flat-Earth theory, which holds that the Earth is a flat disk contained underneath a dome with the sun, moon and stars. There is plenty of evidence to disprove the theory, including the multiple images of Earth that have been taken from space over the years. Most ancient Greeks believed the Earth was round, and astronomers were able to prove it by placing two identical sticks at different locations and comparing their shadows at the same time of day. One stick had no shadow while the other stick, placed about 500 miles north, did have a shadow. If the Earth were flat, the sticks would both have had either the same shadow or no shadow at all.  A video shared to Facebook claims the James Webb Space Telescope and the images it has taken are fake.  The video makes wild claims about why the telescope is fake, offering no evidence and using debunked theories.  The space telescope has been in the works for more than 20 years, and its development, construction and launch into space have been well documented. There is also plenty of evidence proving that broadcasting a signal through space is possible and that the Earth is round.  We rate this Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B23C0>],/factchecks/2022/jul/18/facebook-posts/james-webb-space-telescope-and-images-it-has-taken/

Yes, beer prices are up. No, that’s not only because of Democrats.
","Inflation is a big topic for the U.S. — and the world — as the prices of goods and services across the economy keep rising. In June, the U.S.’ annual inflation rate topped 9%, putting the rate at its highest level since 1981, according to Forbes.  In a recent tweet, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican seeking a third term in November 2022, included this statement: ""Thanks to failed Dem policies, beer is 9.1% more expensive."" To which those of us in Brew City can say only: Whoa. Have beer prices jumped that much? And is it really Democratic policies that have caused any increase?  Let’s take a look.  When asked for backup for the claim, Johnson’s campaign pointed to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows the average price of a malt beverage in an average U.S. city over the years.  According to the data, the average cost of 16 ounces of beer has gone from $1.50 in April 2020 to $1.66 in June 2022, which amounts to a 10.7% increase in the retail price.  But there are important things to note. First, in April 2020, Republican Donald Trump was president — so, as a basic, practical matter, the blame would have to be shared. What’s more, the price of beer has been steadily rising since 1996, the bureau’s statistics show. There have been ups and downs along the way, but since late 2019, prices have started to increase a little more drastically.  So, Johnson has accurate numbers, but even within the time frame he uses, he is shifting the blame in a single direction. Let’s look deeper at the blame portion of the claim, in which Johnson maintains policies enacted by Democrats have been the root cause of inflation — driving up the cost of goods such as eggs, milk and beer.  Johnson’s team shared a link to a March 30, 2022 story by The Washington Times, a right-leaning publication. In it, the blame is placed on spending by the Biden administration, mainly pointing to the coronavirus aid package passed shortly after Joe Biden was inaugurated, which provided $1,400 stimulus checks to all Americans.  The article cites a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, but even that headline says only that Biden policies ""helped fuel"" inflation. In April 2022, PolitiFact National looked at a claim that Biden's spending ""has sent prices skyrocketing,"" rating it Half True. The item found that while some inflation was driven by those stimulus checks, that wasn’t the only cause. There are many other factors that have to be taken into account, such as changes in the labor market, rising energy prices, supply chain problems and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  A June 2022 examination by factcheck.org also said that while the stimulus money had a small impact on inflation, many other factors are playing into the rising costs. For the most part, the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic — especially the shutdown of the economy during the early days and the fast-following recovery — have played a larger role.  That upheaval in the economy caused supply chain shortages, created labor issues and changed spending habits for people forced to remain home.  In any case, on claims like these — ones targeting Democrats or Republicans — we have long held that blame (or credit) for what happens in a complicated world economy can’t be attributed solely to a single person or event. Johnson claimed in a tweet that the price of beer has risen 9.1% because of Democratic policies enacted in the U.S.  While the price of beer did rise 10.7% starting in April 2020, some of that increase came on Trump’s watch — and prices have been steadily rising since the late 1990s.  And although policies enacted by Democrats, such as the American Rescue Plan, have played a role in inflation, there are many other factors that are influencing the rising costs of goods and services, such as the fallout from the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, changes in the labor market and rising energy costs.  We rate this claim Half True, meaning it’s partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.   ",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F7E80>],/factchecks/2022/jul/18/ron-johnson/yes-beer-prices-are-no-s-not-only-because-democrat/

Mehmet Oz has said he supports more restrictions on abortion but hasn’t spelled out penalties
","Before he won the GOP primary for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, Dr. Mehmet Oz was accused by a fellow Republican of being ""pro-abortion.""  Now, with the November general election on the horizon, a group that supports abortion rights claims that Oz ""wants to make abortion a crime."" The attack comes from Planned Parenthood Votes in a TV ad. The 30-second spot begins with clips from three TV news anchors reporting about the Supreme Court’s June 24 reversal of Roe v. Wade and the ruling’s aftermath. The ad shows a montage of the anchors saying: ""The Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade … several states looking to ban abortions … with no exceptions for rape or incest.""  Then the ad’s narrator claims:  ""And now Mehmet Oz is so extreme, he wants to make abortion a crime in Pennsylvania.""   Oz supported the overturning of Roe, which protected access to abortion nationwide. He also favors letting states set their own abortion laws. Since the Roe reversal, performing an abortion is now a felony in some states. Oz backs abortions only in the limited cases of rape, incest, and if the life of the woman is in danger. He has not specified what criminal penalties, if any, he would support if a woman had an unlawful abortion. Oz also has not commented publicly on Republican efforts to remove the right to an abortion from Pennsylvania’s constitution. To back its claim that Oz wants to criminalize abortions in Pennsylvania, the ad includes a footnote citing conservative talk show host Sean Hannity’s radio program from Dec. 23, 2021.  That day, Hannity asked Oz about choosing Supreme Court justices and referenced Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Mississippi case that the court later used to overturn Roe.  Oz said he wanted the justices ""to make their decisions based on what the Constitution says."" Oz also said he is ""100% pro-life,"" but supports allowing abortions in cases of rape, incest or to protect the mother’s life.  After the Supreme Court overturned Roe, Oz said he was ""relieved that protecting the lives of America’s unborn children will once again be decided by the people through their elected representatives."" After Roe was reversed, the laws in some states, including Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Missouri and Tennessee, make it a felony to perform an abortion at any stage of pregnancy, or to do one outside of specific circumstances, such as medical emergencies. Planned Parenthood Votes cited to PolitiFact examples of Oz touting his stance on abortion, including his pledge to ""be a bold voice in the Senate and a proud champion for the ‘pro-life’ movement.""  The group argued that ""there is simply no way"" Oz can claim to be ""100% pro-life"" and support reversing Roe ""without supporting efforts to make abortion a crime across the country."" While Oz has said that he supports restrictions, he’s been silent on the question of what criminal penalties, if any, should be applied to patients or doctors. Abortion is currently legal in Pennsylvania through the 23rd week of pregnancy, and after that if the patient’s life or health is in danger, but there is a new effort under way to curtail abortion rights.  Pennsylvania currently has a Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, who supports abortion rights, but it has a Republican-controlled state legislature. On July 8, the state’s Senate and House passed a bill that would ask voters to amend the state constitution to declare that there is no right to abortion in Pennsylvania. The bill must be passed a second time and the earliest voters could weigh in is 2023. If voters support the question to amend the state constitution, it would not ban abortion or change the existing law that makes abortion legal; that would require the state to pass a new law.  Under such a new law, a governor likely would be unable to cite the state constitution if they wished to issue executive orders to protect abortion rights, said Pennsylvania State University law professor Dara Purvis.  New laws restricting abortion would also be more difficult to challenge in court on state constitutional grounds, said University of Pennsylvania law professor Allison Hoffman.  We did not find that Oz has made any statements about the constitutional amendment push. His campaign did not respond to our questions on whether he supports it. The campaign called the claim about making abortion a crime a ""lie,"" citing Oz’s Hannity interview.  Planned Parenthood Votes is a super PAC affiliated with Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit providing reproductive health care services, including abortion. The affiliate has spent nearly $3 million in the 2021-22 election cycle, $2.53 million of it against Oz, according to the nonprofit OpenSecrets. In the Senate race, Oz, a physician and former TV talk show host, faces Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. The race could help decide which party controls the Senate, which is now split 50-50. Inside Elections rates the race as ""tilts Republican"" and Sabato’s Crystal Ball rates it as a toss-up.  Planned Parenthood Votes said Oz ""wants to make abortion a crime in Pennsylvania."" Oz suported the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe, which returned abortion regulation to the states. Oz said he favors letting states set their on abortion laws, and since the Roe reversal, some states have made it a felony to perform abortions. Oz says he backs abortions only in the limited cases of rape, incest, and if the life of the woman is in danger. He has not specified what criminal penalties, if any, he would support if a woman had an unlawful abortion. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

"['Abortion', 'New York', 'Kathy Hochul']","
Zeldin supported bill with narrow exceptions
","Gov. Kathy Hochul has stepped up her attacks on Rep. Lee Zeldin, the Republican primary winner and her opponent in the November election.  A Hochul campaign advertisement on Facebook accuses Zeldin of having views that are out of step with New York voters.  ""He’s voted for abortion bans even when the mother’s health is at risk,"" the ad states.  Her ad cites two votes, both on Oct. 3, 2017, on H.R. 36, vote #549, and H.R. 36, vote #548. The bill passed in the House, with Zeldin's support, and has not passed the Senate.  Voted on during the 115th Congress, the ""Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act"" would have banned abortions after 20 weeks and outlined circumstances where exceptions to protect the life of the pregnant woman and for rape and incest would be allowed. The exception to protect the life of the mother stated: ""In reasonable medical judgment, the abortion is necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, but not including psychological or emotional conditions.""  When abortion bans allow exceptions to protect a mother, the legal distinction between ""life"" and ""health"" is important.  We asked Hochul’s campaign about the claim that Zeldin favors bans that don’t take into account the health of the mother. Jerrel Harvey, a Hochul spokesperson, provided a section of the Congressional Record where Democrats put forth an amendment during a floor debate that would have considered a mother’s health - not only her life - which Zeldin and other Republicans voted against. ""As currently written, H.R. 36 shows no concern for the long-term health of the mother, her future ability to bear children, or her ability to care for her family,"" Rep. Julia Brownley, D-CA, said during debate before the bill was voted on in 2017. ""This bill would force women to carry pregnancies to term, even when their health is at risk.""   Zeldin’s campaign spokesperson, Katie Vincentz, said that Brownley’s amendment wasn’t a substantive one, and that Zeldin’s vote was on a motion to recommit, which is a procedural vote that is typically voted on along party lines. Vincentz said the bill already had an exception to protect the life of the mother.  An exception in abortion laws allowing consideration for the health of the mother, in addition to her life, had been an established precedent. In a case in 2000, Stenberg v. Carhart, the U.S. Supreme Court found that a Nebraska statute that lacked a health exception was unconstitutional, and Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the majority, rejected arguments that there was no need for a health exception. In 2007, however, the court upheld a federal partial birth abortion ban that did not include a health exception.  Experts said that without a health exception, health care providers can be fearful about what treatment they provide.  Doctors work hard to care for patients and stay within the bounds of the law, and bans offer language that is often incorrect, not clinically meaningful, and is therefore confusing to health care providers, said Dr. Jen Villavicencio, of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which supports abortion rights.  ""The progression of pregnancy is gradual, as are the complications associated with it, whether they are newly emergent complications or the worsening of chronic conditions,"" Villavicencio said. ""In some cases, the life of a pregnant person may indeed be imminently in danger, but in other cases, that line may be harder to identify.""  Cary Franklin, a law professor at UCLA and faculty director of the Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy, said that the life exception to H.R. 36, as written, does not protect the health of the pregnant person.  ""There’s a chilling effect when you have a life exception that doesn’t include health,"" she said. ""A lot of doctors are worried and fearful that if they provide the best care in a given circumstance, that they will be hauled into court.""  Anti-abortion advocates have said that an exception to protect the health of the mother isn’t necessary or that they create loopholes and make abortion bans meaningless.  In congressional testimony in 2013, Dr.  Anthony Levatino, a former abortion provider who speaks out against abortion, said that abortion isn’t necessarily required later in pregnancy, and that he was able to save patients whose lives were threatened by their pregnancies by delivering their babies. ""In most such cases, any attempt to perform an abortion ‘to save the mother's life’ would entail undue and dangerous delay in providing appropriate, truly life-saving care,"" he said.   Critics of the bill said that it did not take into account mental health conditions, such as suicidal thoughts, and puts the threat of penalties in place for doctors, which can limit care in urgent situations.  In her ad, Hochul said Zeldin voted in favor of abortion bans even when the health of the expectant mother is at risk.  For the bill cited in the ad, that's true if the health concern for the expectant mother wasn't life threatening. The bill he voted for included an exception to the ban when the life of the expectant mother was in peril. Zeldin voted in favor of a ban after 20 weeks gestation, which included an exception to protect the life of the pregnant woman. The ban did not allow exceptions for considerations of the long-term health or the mental health of the pregnant person.  PolitiFact's ruling on the governor's claim requires understanding the distinction between the expectant mother's life and her health.  Simply put, in this legislation, Zeldin was OK with an exception to the abortion ban if the expectant mother's health problem put her life at risk. He wasn't OK with an exception if the health problem wasn't life threatening.  Given that distinction, we rate this Mostly True.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097464E80>],/factchecks/2022/jul/17/kathy-hochul/zeldin-supported-bill-narrow-exceptions/

Sex crimes in the military: Gillibrand says over half the victims are men
","
Congress is putting pressure on the American military to crack down on rape and other types of sexual crimes. The latest Department of Defense report estimates that last year there were 26,000 incidents of unwanted sexual contact ranging from groping to forced sex. 
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was talking about the full gamut of these offenses on Face the Nation on June 9, 2013. While much of the focus has been on women, Gillibrand emphasized that ""this is not just a woman's issue. More than half of the victims are men."" This seemed like a strong rhetorical point that deserved a closer look. 
PolitiFact examined a related claim by Gillibrand in April when she cited a survey that asked soldiers whether they had had any unwanted sexual contact by a fellow soldier at any point since joining the military. Given the long tenure of some service members, that question can cover a span of many years. Gillibrand said that 21.7 percent of women and 3.3 percent of men responded yes and we rated her statement Mostly True. Her latest claim is different in that she’s speaking more broadly about the gender of the victims. 
The Department of Defense defines unwanted sexual contact as ""contact that was against a person’s will or occurred when the person did not or could not consent. The term describes completed and attempted oral, anal, and vaginal penetration with any body part or object, and the unwanted touching of genitalia and other sexually related areas of the body."" 
The military uses this definition in an annual survey of soldiers and uses the answers to make a statistical estimate of the total number of incidents that took place. That's how military officials came up with the figure of 26,000. Generally speaking, the survey asks about three levels of contact: unwanted touching, attempted sex and completed sex. 
In that survey, 6.1 percent of active duty women reported that they had been a victim in some fashion. On the other hand, just 1.2 percent of active duty men described having those sorts of experiences. 
At first glance, the numbers might suggest that Gillibrand had it wrong. But Glen Caplin, her communications director, said she was correct because her tally used the percentages to extrapolate the actual count of men and women in the military who have been victims of unwanted sexual contact. 
In round figures, about 85 percent of the military are men, or well over 1 million. Caplin said 1.2 percent of the men in the military is about 14,000, while 6.1 percent of active duty women is about 12,000. ""So it is more men than women,"" Caplin said. 
We checked with the Department of Defense press office and spokeswoman Cynthia Smith confirmed Caplin’s numbers. 
We did find another measurement of the gender differences that seems to tell a different story. In the full 2012 annual report on Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the Pentagon includes the survey results along with a very different set of numbers -- the cases that made it into the official record. The second data set is much smaller, less than 3,000 cases. It represents formal allegations filed by victims plus instances when victims seeking treatment report a violation to a health care provider or staff at a sexual assault prevention office but might not file official charges. 
In that official record, women represent about 80 percent or more of the cases. 
The large disparity between the total number of men who responded in the survey that they had been victims and the relatively small number who sought treatment or made an official complaint is likely due in part to the greater reluctance of men to report unwanted sexual contact. 
Dr. David Lisak, an associate professor of Psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and founder of One In Six, an advocacy group for sexually abused men, said it is no surprise that male soldiers rarely disclose assaults. 
""Men are taught from a very young age that the core elements of masculinity are strength and toughness, and that vulnerability is completely unacceptable,"" Lisak said. ""In a culture such as the military, where the culture of traditional masculinity is often more rigidly enforced than it is in the civilian world, the stigma associated with sexual assault is intensified."" 
It also seems that on the spectrum of unwanted sexual contact, men often faced less aggressive situations. In the survey, half the men said the most serious incident they experienced was ""sexual touching only,"" while only a third of women said that was the worst thing. In comparison, over half of the women said they had been the victim of an unwanted sexual act that had either been attempted or completed. Only about 15 percent of men in total said they were the victim of an attempted or a completed sexual act. 
Our ruling 
Gillibrand said more than half the victims of sexual crimes in the military are men. That's not true in terms of the 3,000 sexual contacts that were officially reported, but it is true if you rely on the larger estimate of unwanted sexual contacts that comes from a more comprehensive survey of people in the military. 
We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C218BC0>],/factchecks/2013/jun/11/kirsten-gillibrand/sex-crimes-military-gillibrand-says-over-half-vict/

Tax policy hurts Georgia, senator says
","
State Sen. Jason Carter -- grandson of former Georgia governor and former President Jimmy Carter -- was the guest speaker at a Marietta Rotary Club meeting last month. 
In Republican-dominated Cobb County, the Decatur Democrat delivered a speech that veered from the traditional GOP message. 
Carter told the attendees that continual shrinkage of the government -- which has been a conservative standard -- is hurting Georgia in the long run. 
""We collect fewer state taxes per capita than any other state. We have won the small-government competition,"" he said. ""... And although state taxes are low, Georgia is the eighth-most-dependent state on the federal government."" 
Is Georgia collecting fewer state taxes while receiving lots of federal government funds on the back end? PolitiFact Georgia decided to look into it. 
Carter told us that The Marietta Daily Journal, where we first saw his Rotary Club comments, left out part of his statement. He told the crowd that his tax and dependency claims were based on information from the Tax Foundation, Carter told PolitiFact Georgia in a phone interview. He also cited an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article as a second source for his dependency claim. 
""The discussion was about the difference in the levels of government. And while we’ve shrunk the federal government, we’ve increased the burden on the state and local governments,"" Carter said. ""The key is the state government taxes."" 
We found the Tax Foundation statistics that Carter cited in the organization’s ""Facts and Figures"" report of state tax data, released in March. The report, by the nonpartisan tax research group based in Washington, includes state tax and federal dependency data for fiscal year 2011. 
According to the charts, Georgia ranked last with $1,639 in state taxes collected per capita.(Georgia’s 2010 population was about 9.7 million.) The chart is based on the census’ definition of state tax collections, Tax Foundation officials told us. The next closest state was South Carolina at $1,650. Alaska collected the most state taxes per capita at $7,708. 
A second Tax Foundation chart, also for fiscal 2011, showed that Georgia also ranked last in the amount of state revenue collected per capita, at $3,807. The revenue data include the taxes levied by the state as well as other general revenue used to operate, such as licenses, fees and transfers from the federal government. 
We next went to the Census Bureau’s state government tax collections summary report, released in April, for fiscal 2012 data. Governing magazine, which covers politics, policy and management issues of state and local governments, aggregated the census data. We compiled Governing’s data into a spreadsheet and found that Georgia ranked second-to-last for the lowest total state taxes per capita, at $1,711.44. New Hampshire ranked last at $1,675.94 taxes collected per capita. 
So Carter’s tax claim was correct in fiscal 2011 but off a bit for the following fiscal year. 
On the second part of his claim, Carter again used Tax Foundation data, along with an AJC story published about a week before his Rotary Club speech. 
The Tax Foundation used figures from the Census Bureau to determine states’ dependence on the federal government. The organization divided each state’s intergovernmental revenue, or grants and other aid received from the federal government, into the state’s general revenue, which includes all tax revenue. Those calculations, also in the Facts and Figures 2013 report, showed that Georgia was the ninth-most-dependent state in the nation in fiscal 2011. Federal aid accounted for about 41 percent of general revenue. Mississippi was the most dependent, getting 49 percent of its revenue from the federal government; Alaska was the least dependent with 24 percent. 
The AJC story reported that about 31.6 percent, about $12 billion, of Georgia’s state agency spending was made up of federal funds in fiscal 2012, according to the paper’s review of budget records. The paper found that Georgia has been using federal money to fill budget gaps created by shrinking tax collections and higher demand for state services such as Medicaid. Georgia legislators have discussed forming a committee to study the state’s federal government dependence. 
To sum up, Carter said that the Peach State collects fewer state taxes per capita than any other state, yet is the eighth-most-dependent state on the federal government. 
Based on Tax Foundation and census data for fiscal 2011, Carter is correct on his tax collection claim. Advance the data forward a year and Georgia moves up a step in its collections for fiscal 2012. On federal government dependence, analysis of census data shows that Georgia was the ninth-most-dependent state in fiscal 2011. 
Carter’s overall point is that Georgia is fostering a smaller state government but at the same time relying heavily on federal funds. He seems correct on that point. But his calculations were slightly off.

State Sen. Stephen Martin says Democratic party created Planned Parenthood
","In defending controversial statements by the Republican Party’s candidate for lieutenant governor, State Sen. Steve Martin made some of his own. Martin, R-Chesterfield, attended a May 23 fundraiser for E.W. Jackson, the GOP nominee for the No. 2 spot. A Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter asked Martin to weigh in on a video from last fall in which Jackson denounced the the Democratic Party, the Ku Klux Klan and Planned Parenthood in the same breath. ""The fact is that both the KKK and Planned Parenthood are creations of the Democratic Party,"" Martin said. We recently gave a False rating to Martin’s claim that the Democratic Party started the KKK. In this Truth-O-Meter, we’ll look at his contention that the party started Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger  began her crusade for birth control access through a magazine called ""The Woman Rebel"" that she started in 1914. Sanger was subsequently arrested and charged with mailing obscene materials because the magazine championed birth control, which was illegal, and published information on sex. But the Democratic Party was not involved in her trials nor her opening of clinics in Brownsville, N.Y., in 1916 or in Harlem in 1923, according to the book ""Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion."" The book’s author, Jean H. Baker, sent us an email saying Sanger ""abstained from any political commitments."" The book says Sanger was angered by politicians from both parties who refused to back birth control programs, including Democratic Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy. Baker attributed the opposition to the doctrine and power of the Catholic Church rather than any political party creed. Sanger founded the American Birth Control League in 1921. Members during its first decade were typically upper-middle-class women of childbearing age, according to the book ""Woman of Valor: Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America.""  The author, Ellen Chesler, wrote that of the members of the league willing to to list their party affiliation, ""just over half said they were Republicans, while 8 percent identified themselves as Socialists, reflecting the movement’s, and Margaret’s own, idiosyncratic histories.""   Sanger resigned in 1928 as president of the league, which became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1940. Is there any evidence the Democratic Party created Planned Parenthood? When we asked Martin, he told us he phrased his claim poorly and should have said the Democratic Party has  ""sustained"" Planned Parenthood. Soon after our conversation, Martin released a statement saying he ""regretted the carelessness and inaccuracy"" of his comments."" Although it’s not the purpose of this article to examine whether the Democratic Party has ""sustained"" Planned Parenthood, we should note that Martin’s substitute claim needs qualification. Congress did not start funding birth control efforts until 1967 -- 46 years after Sanger founded the organization that would become Planned Parenthood. For a long time afterwards, there was strong bipartisan support for funding birth control organizations. Only in 2011, with abortion debate heating up, were there partisan floor votes in which the GOP sought to strip federal money from Planned Parenthood and the Democrats insisted on preserving it. House Republicans have introduced another bill this year to end taxpayer funding for the organization. Planned Parenthood reported receiving $524 million from the U.S. government in grants and payments during the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30 -- roughly 45 percent of the organization’s revenues. Our ruling Martin said that Planned Parenthood was created by the Democratic Party. There’s no evidence to support that claim. Biographers of Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, say she shunned political commitments and was critical of presidents from both parties. Recognizing that Martin has since expressed regret for his words, we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C140600>],/factchecks/2013/jun/10/stephen-martin/state-sen-stephen-martin-says-democartic-party-cre/

State Sen. Stephen Martin says Democratic Party created the Ku Klux Klan
","State Sen. Stephen Martin was recently asked to weigh in on controversial comments by GOP Lieutenant Governor candidate E.W. Jackson that denounced the Ku Klux Klan, Planned Parenthood and the Democratic Party in the same breath. In defending Jackson, Martin sparked a controversy of his own. ""The fact is that both the KKK and Planned Parenthood are creations of the Democratic Party,"" Martin, R-Chesterfield, said in a May 23 interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. We decided to check whether the KKK really was spawned by the Democratic Party. We’ll post another Truth-O-Meter that examines Martin’s contention Planned Parenthood was created by Democrats. When we asked Martin for the facts behind his KKK statement, he said he had misspoken. ""What I should have said is it was started by Democrats, not by the Democratic party,"" the senator said. ""It wasn’t an official subdivision of the party, obviously … It was definitely founded by Democrats."" Soon after our conversation, Martin released a statement saying he ""regretted the carelessness and inaccuracy"" of his comments regarding the KKK, calling his statement an ""impromptu"" response to questions about Jackson’s comments that Planned Parenthood has been more lethal to blacks than the KKK. PolitiFact Virginia respects when people tell us they erred, but we still feel obliged to complete our fact checks of their statements. So we asked several historians about the origins of the KKK. Details about the hate group’s founding are murky -- including the exact year it began. Some cite 1865 as its start, others say it was 1867. Historians generally agree it was founded by a handful of Confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tenn. as a social fraternity and it quickly changed into a violent group that terrorized newly empowered black and white Republicans in the South. J. Michael Martinez, the author of a 2007 book ""Carpetbaggers, Calvary and the KKK,"" told us many angry Southern whites during the 1860s and 1870s were Democrats and a smaller number of them joined the KKK. So there is some historic link between Democrats and the KKK. But Martinez said it is misleading to say that the hate group was started by the Democratic Party because it was more of a grassroots creation. There’s another point to consider. ""To say that the Ku Klux Klan was started by the Democratic Party -- it’s not the Democratic party of today,"" Martinez said. ""(From the) 1930s until today, you think of the Democratic Party being considered the party of the disenfranchised."" Other historians had similar takes. Carole Emberton, an associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo, wrote in an email that various ""Klans"" that sprung up around the South acted as a ""strong arm"" for many local Democratic politicians during Reconstruction. Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest -- believed to be the KKK’s first Grand Dragon -- even spoke at the 1868 Democratic National Convention, said Emberton, author of ""Beyond Redemption: Race, Violence and the American South after the Civil War."" But Emberton added a major caveat: ""The party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today,"" she wrote to us. ""Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white ‘Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of ‘reform,’ supporting a variety of ‘liberal’ causes, including civil rights, women’s rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century."" Elaine Frantz Parsons, an associate professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh said that most post-Civil War southern whites were Democrats who were unhappy with Republican policies on Reconstruction while large numbers of newly-freed slaves were Republicans. ""So it is not surprising that the Reconstruction era Klan would have been very largely Democrats attacking Republicans,"" Parsons said in an e-mail. ""But this simply does not map well at all onto the party structure we know today. Among other things, the Republicans (during Reconstruction) were condemned as the party of big government and as wanting to centralize authority on the federal level."" Our ruling Martin said the KKK was created by the Democratic Party. He acknowledged he was wrong. Historians say the KKK consisted of a group of Southern whites after the Civil War who were Democrats. But there’s no evidence the KKK was created by their political party. It should also be noted that the anti-black Democratic Party of the 1860s and 1870s bears no similarity to the party of today. Recognizing that Martin has expressed regret for his statement.

Rep. Bob Gibbs says 30 million will be left uninsured after Obamacare takes full effect
","
On May 16, the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives held its 37th vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act that was enacted in 2010. Because the U.S. Senate is controlled by Democrats, the House had no real chance to repeal the law. As the Washington Post reported that day, its main purpose was to give Republicans a platform to bring up their objections to the law they call ""Obamacare."" 
Holmes County Republican Rep. Bob Gibbs was eager to take advantage of that opportunity. Before the vote, he delivered a House of Representatives floor speech in which he described the law as ""detrimental to all Americans"" and said that if the U.S. Senate ""really wants to pass a jobs bill, then they should listen to the American people and support repeal and replace."" 
The next day, Gibbs used his Twitter account to decry the law further. ""If #Obamacare is fully implemented, 30 million people will still be without health insurance,"" Gibbs tweeted. 
We decided to check out Gibbs’ claim that so many people would still be without health insurance after the bill is fully implemented. Although Gibbs’ office did not respond to requests to document his information, we found a Congressional Budget Office analysis released three days before Gibbs’ remark that stated:  ""In our current projections for 2023, the ACA reduces the number of people without health insurance by 25 million, leaving 31 million uninsured (compared with 30 million in our February estimate)."" That’s close to the number that Gibbs provided. 
A widely circulated CBO report from last summer said the ""ACA, in comparison with prior law before the enactment of the ACA, will reduce the number of nonelderly people without health insurance coverage by 14 million in 2014 and by 29 million or 30 million in the latter part of the coming decade, leaving 30 million nonelderly residents uninsured by the end of the period."" 
Gibbs’ statement that 30 million people will be uninsured after the health care law’s full implementation is close to the CBO’s latest estimate, but it ignores a key fact: the number of people without insurance would be much higher without the law. In the next 10 years, 25 million nonelderly people who don’t have insurance now would gain insurance under the bill. That’s important context that Gibbs overlooks in his tweet. According to CBO, the insurance rate for the nation’s non-elderly residents is predicted to rise from 80 percent this year to 90 percent in 2023. 
While Gibbs is right that many people will not have insurance after the law is implemented, his statement fails to acknowledge that it will enable millions of people to get insurance. We rule his statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280978F8C40>],/factchecks/2013/jun/10/bob-gibbs/rep-bob-gibbs-says-30-million-will-be-left-uninsur/
"['Georgia', 'Civil Rights', 'Education', 'John Lewis']","
Do numbers show black students are disciplined at higher rates?
","
In the 1960s, John Lewis marched for racial equality. Lewis, now a veteran congressman from Atlanta, recently used another approach to voice his criticism concerning what he sees as another form of racial injustice. 
Lewis, a Democrat, co-wrote an op-ed that focused on his belief that African-Americans are being treated unfairly in the criminal justice system. The problem starts early, wrote Lewis and Bryan Stevenson, who teaches law at New York University. 
""Black children constitute 18 percent of the nation's public school population but 40 percent of the children who are suspended or expelled,"" they wrote. 
PolitiFact Georgia read the op-ed and wondered about the statistics they used to back up their argument. Are 40 percent of students suspended or expelled in America’s public schools black? 
We recently examined another statement in their op-ed that claimed the violent crime rate in America was the same since 1968, but the prison system had grown by 500 percent. We rated that statement Half True. 
Brenda Jones, a spokeswoman for Lewis, said Stevenson culled the information from a U.S. Department of Education online warehouse of school suspensions and expulsions. Jones said they relied on a 2009-2010 survey to come up with the numbers and a 2012 Children’s Defense Fund report on the subject. 
""The results from the schools surveyed show public school systems where Black students represented 18 percent of students but 46 percent of those suspended more than once and 39 percent of those expelled,"" Jones said in one email. 
U.S. Department of Education researchers looked at 85 percent of the nation’s public school students in some 72,000 schools in a widely publicized report released in March 2012. They found although black students made up 18 percent of the nation’s public school population, they accounted for 35 percent of students suspended at least once and 39 percent of students expelled. 
The study also examined student readiness for college and careers, retention, and other issues. 
U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said the findings highlighted the need for educators to address the disparities. 
""The power of the data is not only in the numbers themselves, but in the impact it can have when married with the courage and the will to change. The undeniable truth is that the everyday educational experience for many students of color violates the principle of equity at the heart of the American promise,"" said Duncan, who is white. ""It is our collective duty to change that."" 
The Children’s Defense Fund cited the Education Department study in a 2013 report on how many Mississippi public school students ended up in prison, writing that 38 percent of students suspended nationwide were African-Americans. 
Some critics of the report complained Duncan and much of the news media focused exclusively on black students and wrongly assumed that the disproportionate percentage of those students being suspended or expelled was a result of institutional racism. 
""The feds have reached their conclusions, however, without answering the obvious question: Are black students suspended more often because they misbehave more?"" Heather MacDonald, a well-known author, commentator and columnist who is white, wrote shortly after the report was released. 
We found plenty of debate over the rationale for the higher percentage of black students suspended or expelled in that report. Again, we were focused on whether the statistics used to make the claim were accurate. We continued our research by looking at past studies to see whether the numbers in that report were a one-time spike. 
In a 2006 federal study, black students made up 37.4 percent of those suspended from school. White students were slightly ahead, accounting for 39.1 percent of those suspended. About 20 percent of the students suspended were Hispanic. 
Black students made up about 38 percent of expulsions in one category and 42.5 percent of expulsions in another category, the 2006 report showed. 
Our conclusion: 
Lewis co-wrote that black students make up 18 percent of the students in America’s public schools but 40 percent of students who are suspended or expelled. The percentage of the U.S. student population is accurate, while the percentage of black students suspended or expelled is pretty close to the mark. 
We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097317980>],/factchecks/2013/jun/10/john-lewis/do-numbers-show-black-students-disciplined-higher-/
"['Jobs', 'Small Business', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says Wisconsin’s ranking as a place to do business improved from 43 to 17 on his watch
","
Faced with job growth lagging behind most states, Gov. Scott Walker chooses alternative measures to put a positive spin on the state’s economic performance. 
He touts falling unemployment. He highlights the rebound in manufacturing and the modest tax cuts he pushed through. And he points to improved national rankings for the state’s business climate. 
In a Milwaukee television interview that aired June 2, 2013, the Republican governor said liberals are pushing the idea that he’s more interested in running for president than being governor because they have no other argument to use against him. 
""They can’t argue with the success,"" Walker told host Mike Gousha on WISN-TV’s Upfront show. ""We went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower. The deficit was $3.6 billion when I took office. We now have a half a billion dollar surplus."" 
He capped off his list with this talking point: 
""Our ranking in terms of the best and worst states to do business in was 43 four years ago and we just moved up to 17 two weeks ago."" 
Has the state’s business climate rank improved dramatically under Walker, who took office in January 2011? 
The rankings 
The governor points to CEO Magazine’s May 2013 ranking of Wisconsin as 17th best for business, based on a survey of chief executive officers nationally. In 2009, as Walker noted, the survey put Wisconsin at 43rd; A year later, the rank was 41. 
Just a few weeks into his term, early in 2011, the survey ranked the state as 24th. The CEO survey measures perceptions, not performance. It asks CEOs how conducive each state is for business based on taxes and regulation, workforce quality and living environment. 
What about other studies? 
We asked Walker’s office, and spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster pointed to: 
--CNBC’s ""America’s Top States for Business,"" which moved Wisconsin up to 17th from 25th and 29th in the previous two years. That index uses 51 measures of competitiveness. 
-- Site Selection Magazine’s 2012 elevation of Wisconsin to its top 25 (rank of 13th) states for business climate for the first time since 1998. The study is based in part on surveys of corporate site selectors. 
Those back up the notion that the business climate has significantly improved under Walker. 
We found six other widely quoted business-climate rankings, and they show a much more mixed picture. 
--The Tax Foundation’s ""2013 State Business Tax Climate Index"" has Wisconsin in the 10 worst states (43rd), based on how 100 tax variables affect competitiveness. That’s typical; the ranking in this study was 43rd and 40th and 42nd in the previous three years. 
-- Forbes Magazine’s ""Best States for Business"" put Wisconsin at 42nd in December 2012, with particularly low marks for growth prospects and labor supply. The ranking was 43rd in the year before Walker took office. 
-- Beacon Hill Institute’s ""12th Annual State Competitiveness Report"" ranked Wisconsin 18th, an improvement from rankings of 22, 23 and 22 in the prior three years. 
--The American Legislative Exchange Council’s ""2013 ALEC-Laffer State Economic Competitiveness Index"" put Wisconsin’s economic outlook ranking at 15th, a big improvement over the 32, 30 and 23 rankings of recent years. The study put the state’s economic performance rank at 41st, a modest improvement over 42 in 2012 and 44 in 2011. 
Two prominent studies were new or significantly revised, preventing historical comparisons. 
They show Wisconsin in the bottom half of states for business. 
--The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council ranked the state 27th in its ""U.S. Small Business Policy Index 2012."" 
--The 2013 ""Enterprising States: Getting Down to Small Business""  study sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranked Wisconsin’s business climate 39th. 
We should note that business-climate rankings have long attracted criticism from left-leaning groups.  ""Grading Places,"" a report by Good Jobs First, a labor-backed group, calls them pseudo-scientific attempts by business-friendly groups trying to justify corporate demands for lower taxes and suppressed wages. 
This item does not judge the rankings’ reliability, only Walker’s description of the state’s business climate as set out in these rankings. 
Our rating 
Walker said the state’s ranking ""in terms of the best and worst states to do business in was 43 four years ago, and we just moved up to 17 two weeks ago."" 
That’s correct, in one study of CEO perceptions, but the ""state’s ranking"" depends on which study you read. The governor cherry-picks the most favorable of three studies on his side, but ignores studies showing much lower rankings and little or no improvement, creating a misleading impression of dramatic improvement. 
In reality, the rankings are very mixed.

"['New Jersey', 'Pensions', '13th District GOP slate']","
GOP mailer claims New Jersey's pension system is solvent
","
When it comes to reducing the size and scope of government, three New Jersey Republicans claim they’re on the right path to accomplishing that goal. 
  
Assembly members Declan O’Scanlon and Amy Handlin, and state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, representing the 13th District, touted those reforms and others in a campaign flyer sent out for last week’s primary election. The flyer highlighted less spending, less government, more prosperity and standing up to the Internal Revenue Service as evidence of their efforts. The trio won their primaries Tuesday. 
  
But one claim under the heading of less government intrigued us: ""New Jersey’s once-broken pension system is now solvent."" 
  
The underfunded pension system that set off a political firestorm two years ago when Gov. Chris Christie and the Legislature ordered higher employee contributions and suspended Cost Of Living Adjustments for beneficiaries is solvent? 
  
In pension terminology, the part of the claim is correct. But the state pension system was once broken? That’s debatable. 
  
Let’s explain, starting with solvency. 
  
Some dictionaries define solvency as the ability to pay debts – and O’Scanlon and others say New Jersey has enough money in its pension funds to cut checks every month for retirees and have those checks clear. 
  
New Jersey’s pension reforms also will help keep the system more sustainable, O’Scanlon said. 
  
In addition to the temporary suspension of COLAs and increased employee contributions, New Jersey has increased the pension eligibility requirement for new hires and increased the salary timeframe on which retirement benefits are based. An improving stock market, as well as the state ramping up annual payments into the system until reaching full contributions starting in 2018 will help, he said. 
  
Two pensions experts we spoke with agreed with O’Scanlon’s assessment of solvency and emphasis on the state’s pension reforms. 
  
""If you have enough money to pay benefits in the short term or in the foreseeable future, to the extent that plans have enough cash on hand to pay benefits for the next 10 or 13 years, it’s solvent,"" said Jean-Pierre Aubry, assistant director for State and Local Research at the Boston College Center for Retirement Research. 
  
""A pension fund is solvent if it is able to honor its obligations,"" said Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators in Washington, D.C. ""If they can pay their pension liabilities they would be considered solvent."" 
  
New Jersey is able to pay its pension obligations, so it’s solvent. But was it once broken, as the mailer claims? 
  
""We would define broken as unquestionably heading on the path to insolvency,"" O’Scanlon said. 
  
""You couldn’t continue on the path we were going and end up with a sustainable system,"" he added. Either we were going to have bankruptcy or we were going to have massive tax increases to cover the obligation. With the reforms we did we now brought it in to solvency. It’s on a completely different path since the reforms."" 
  
But O’Scanlon also admitted that the state has always been able to pay its pension obligations. If that’s the case, the system was never broken. 
  
Now let’s look at pension funding levels. 
  
Each of the state’s five open pension accounts is funded well below 80 percent, which Aubry said is a threshold that has come to mean ""adequate."" The state's total underfunded liability was $47.2 billion as of July 1, 2012, according to an annual report on the state's pension fund. 
  
The state’s Public Employees Retirement System account was at 49.1 percent funding as of July 1, 2012; teachers, 59.3 percent; police and firefighters, 51.5 percent; state police, 71.2 percent; judiciary, 46 percent. 
  
Aubry and Brainard both said 80 percent funding is an oft-cited threshold of whether pension accounts are ""healthy."" 
  
""Eighty percent has come to be recognized by practitioners as an adequate funding level,"" Aubry said. ""The notion may be that at 80 percent funded you do have enough money in the pension fund to pay benefits for the foreseeable future, but the underfundedness basically helps battle the push for increase of benefits."" 
  
Brainard said looking at funding ratios is just one metric of determining the health of a pension fund, ""but it’s not the be-all, end-all."" 
  
""The objective should be to reach full funding but there’s nothing necessarily wrong with being underfunded,"" Brainard added. ""The issue is whether funding the plan is causing fiscal stress for the plan sponsor -- making the contributions to ensure that the benefits can be paid."" 
  
Bill Quinn, a state Treasury Department spokesman, said New Jersey’s underfunded liabilities will flatten out and stop growing as the state puts more money into the pension fund each year as required by the reforms. 
  
Our ruling 
  
A primary campaign flyer from Assembly members Declan O’Scanlon and Amy Handlin, and state Sen. Joe Kyrillos last week claimed, ""New Jersey’s once-broken pension system is now solvent."" 
  
O’Scanlon said ‘once broken’ refers to the state’s pension system being on a path to insolvency or bankruptcy without major reforms – but admits the state has always been able to pay its pension bills. If the system was once broken, those bills wouldn’t have been paid. Furthermore, O’Scanlon and experts told us that a pension system being able to pay its obligations means the system is solvent. We rate this claim Half True.

Sierra Club's Abel Collins says the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority has some of the fullest buses compared to similar agencies in the U.S.
","
Public transportation was one of the topics when Abel Collins, program manager for the Rhode Island chapter of the Sierra Club, was a guest on the June 2 edition of ""10 News Conference."" 
Collins, an unsuccessful independent candidate for Congress in the 2nd District in 2012, said one goal of his organization is to cut pollution by getting better funding for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, which operates the state’s bus system. 
""They're stuck. They have declining revenues and increasing demand. And RIPTA has really some of the fullest buses for its transit agency size around the country,"" he said. ""So it's really something that should get more attention and hopefully this is the year that the General Assembly sees fit to give RIPTA sustainable funding for the long term. There's a bill to do that and we've been pushing on it for years."" 
We wondered whether RIPTA does, in fact, have some of the fullest buses around. 
We called Collins. He said he was told that factoid by Mark Therrien, the authority's assistant general manager for planning. 
We called Therrien. He said Collins was correct. When we asked for details, he referred us to the Integrated National Transit Database Analysis System (INTDAS) which has national statistics over many years for transit systems throughout the United States. 
The database will generate a list of comparable transit systems around the country. We did that for RIPTA and decided to focus on the 30 that were closest based on a variety of measures such as size, according to the federal ranking. We also looked at six other systems -- in Eugene, Ore.; Fort Worth, Texas; Jacksonville, Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; Louisville, Ky.; and Des Moines, Iowa -- that Therrien said were comparable as well. 
But what to look at? 
The database, whose most recent statistics were from 2011, doesn't include a direct measurement of how full the buses are. 
We discovered there were a lot of indirect ways to estimate capacity that gave different rankings. 
Therrien said we should look at passengers per hour. By that measure, RIPTA ranked 8th out of 37 systems. 
We also looked at the number of passenger trips divided by the number of vehicles in operation during peak hours. RIPTA ranked 9th by that measure. 
Meanwhile, we received an e-mail from Albert Gan, a professor with the department of civil and environmental engineering at Florida International University, who developed the INTDAS system. 
He said the correct method would be to divide the number of passenger miles in a year by the number of miles driven when the buses were picking and dropping off passengers (known as revenue miles). By that measure, RIPTA ranked 13th out of 37. 
Then we heard back from Therrien's office, which advised us that it was best to look at the number of passenger trips divided by the number of revenue miles. In that instance, RIPTA ranked 10th. 
Some other systems were pretty crowded using that yardstick. Milwaukee had 24 percent more passengers per bus than Providence; Madison had 34 percent more; Eugene had 39 percent more; and Rochester, N.Y. had 46 percent more. 
To sum up, Abel Collins said, ""RIPTA has really some of the fullest buses for its transit agency size around the country."" 
""Some of the fullest"" is a little vague, but it implies that Rhode Island is going to be up there in the rankings. 
RIPTA, asked about the claim, suggested that we look at 11 transit systems. We ultimately analyzed data on more than three times that many, using a federal rating method that listed bus services comparable to Rhode Island's. 
RIPTA's rankings ranged from 8th to 13th. They varied a bit because there's no standardized way to calculate who has the ""fullest"" buses. 
Because there's some uncertainty but the different methods show RIPTA ranking high, we rate Collins' statement Mostly True.

Will seniors be denied cancer treatment under Obamacare?
","
According to a chain email making the rounds, people over 75 years old will be denied cancer treatment under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, after President Barack Obama. 
The email also states that vitamin B12 shots won’t be covered under Medicare because of Obamacare. Also, your primary care physician will have to admit you into a hospital -- as opposed to, oh let’s say, an emergency care doctor -- or Medicare won’t pay for it, again, because of Obamacare. 
Here’s a portion of the chain email, which a reader in Northeast Portland forwarded to PolitiFact Oregon, with a plea for more information. She said it came from a friend: 
""Your hospital Medicare admittance has just changed under Obama Care. You must be admitted by your primary Physician in order for Medicare to pay for it! If you are admitted by an emergency room doctor it is treated as outpatient care where hospital costs are not covered. This is only the tip of the iceberg for Obama Care. Just wait to see what happens in 2013 & 2014! … (ellipses) 
Please for the sake of many good people, please... pass this on. We all need to be informed. 
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS... 
At age 76 when you most need it, you are not eligible for cancer treatment page  272."" 
The email goes on with a long list of other claims as assessed by a Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. PolitiFact Oregon hopped to it. 
And we learned very quickly -- through the power of the Internet -- that a version of this chain email has been kicking around since 2009, based on H.R. 3200, a 2009 bill that did not become law. Many of the claims have been debunked. In fact, FactCheck.org found just four of the 48 claims in the original email to be accurate. PolitiFact ruled two statements to be Pants on Fire. The chain email has morphed over the years, with new assertions added. 
As for the cancer-related statement, the email cites page 272 of H.R. 3200 to back up its assertion that seniors at 76 are not eligible for cancer treatment. Later, the email specifies that under Section 1145 of H.R. 3200, ""cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age."" 
Neither statement is accurate. There is no rationing, based on age or otherwise, on cancer treatment under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law in March 2010. Likewise, there is no rationing or cut-off age in 2009’s H.R. 3200. 
H.R. 3200 contained a section on ""treatment of certain cancer hospitals."" But the American Nurses Association described the section as  ""the opposite of rationing. The section allows Medicare to pay cancer hospitals more if they are incurring higher costs."" FactCheck.org agrees with the nurses group. And again, the bill never became law. 
""All medically necessary treatment is covered by Medicare. Including cancer treatments, regardless of age,"" said Katherine Fitzpatrick with the Medicare Rights Center in Washington, D.C. and in New York. 
Yet, none of the debunking seems to matter, because four years later, the email lives on via the forward button. The Internet is unstoppable. What, we wondered, did the Texas judge think of his undying notoriety? 
""I wish it would die. I can’t control it,"" David Kithil told PolitiFact Oregon. ""I don’t know how something like that goes viral like that."" 
The former judge said he wrote a letter to his local newspaper in 2009, protesting the initial version of the health care act. The letter was published in the River Cities Daily Tribune, circulation 5,000. Somehow, he said, the letter was republished online. Kithil wants readers to disregard his letter as it is outdated and based on legislation that did not become law. 
""I’ve had calls from all over the country, 300 to 400 calls over three or four years on this,"" he said. He pleads with the callers, ""Don’t pass it on. It’s not accurate anymore. Trash it."" 
He says he still has problems with the Affordable Care Act, but that’s neither here nor there. 
Both the Medicare Rights Center and AARP, the national organization for seniors, verified that hospital admittance has to do with billing under parts A or B of Medicare, the government health plan for seniors 65 and older. The Affordable Care Act reduces Medicare payments to hospitals with readmissions within 30 days for certain conditions, such as pneumonia, but that’s not based on who admits the patient. 
Also, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid says Medicare has never covered vitamin B12 shots as a preventive benefit. Again, this isn’t related to the Affordable Care Act. 
Older patients diagnosed with cancer need not worry that treatment will be rationed or denied under the Affordable Care Act. The claim is based on an inaccurate reading of a bill that went nowhere. We don’t know where or how the specific age of 76 was added -- Kithil said he doesn’t remember including a specific age in his letter. 
But we do know enough to rule this widely debunked and ridiculous-on-its-face statement a Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097325100>],/factchecks/2013/jun/08/chain-email/will-seniors-be-denied-cancer-treatment-under-obam/

No rise in applications triggered IRS actions says Tim Griffin
","
One of the lines of defense in the current Internal Revenue Service controversy is that the agency stumbled under a heavy workload of applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status. 
Steven Miller, the former acting IRS commissioner, made this point in a piece he wrote for USA Today, describing ""a sharp increase"" in applications. The day after an audit critical of the agency went public on May 14, 2013, the IRS posted on a question-and-answer page that ""the number of applications has more than doubled in recent years."" The agency connected that directly to the singling out of tea party groups, writing ""this inappropriate criterion was used as a shortcut to centralize similar cases."" 
Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., took issue with that argument. At a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Tuesday, he spoke about myths being ""thrown around."" 
""There was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010,"" Griffin said. 
It’s possible to check whether a flood of paperwork was a contributing factor in the IRS missteps and we can see if Griffin is on solid ground. 
The IRS keeps track of its workload and according to the inspector general’s audit, IRS staff was on the lookout for tea party-type groups at least six months before we see a jump in the number of applications. In fact, the data tell us that the volume of applications had dropped a bit from the year before the screening began. 
Here’s how the activity breaks down for 501(c)(4) applications, the sort of tax-exempt group where political activity is allowed: 
2009:    1,751 
2010:    1,735 
2011:    2,265 
2012:    3,357 
The inspector general’s report said these figures came from the IRS Exempt Organizations office and were for the fiscal year. As a reminder, the government’s fiscal year starts in October, so FY 2010 begins on Oct. 1, 2009, and runs through the end of September 2010. 
The inspector general’s report also provides a detailed timeline that tracks when the tea party screening began. On about March 1, 2010, a manager asked a staffer to tally the number of tea party-related applications. According to the report, the staffer ""used Tea Party, Patriots, and 9/12 as part of the criteria for these searches."" 
The earliest that there might have been a jump in applications would have been in October 2010. That is well after the IRS began its effort to give selective treatment to tea party groups. 
The IRS is correct in saying that the number of applications doubled, but that happened later -- from 2011 to 2012. We contacted the IRS and nothing we learned changes the numbers or the sequence of events. 
Reporters for the Chronicle of Philanthropy and the Washington Post have sifted the facts, too, and reached the same conclusion: The rise in applications for 501(c)(4) status came after the IRS began treating tea party-type groups differently. 
Our ruling 
Griffin said there was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010, and the numbers from the IRS back him up. The timeline in the Inspector General’s audit shows that the selective treatment of groups based on their ties to the tea party movement began before any rise in the IRS workload.

Michael Sullivan says legislators spending $4 billion from $8 billion reserve fund, cutting it in half
","
As Texas lawmakers edged toward agreement on future spending, a conservative advocate warned that the GOP-majority Legislature was halving state reserves.

In a May 22, 2013, Twitter post, Michael Sullivan, president of Empower Texans, which advocates less government, wrote: ""#txlege will be drawing current Economic Stabilization Fund down by half: $4 billion from current $8 billion.""

Sullivan was referring to the kitty informally known as the state’s rainy day fund. As authorized by voters in 1988, the fund accumulates money from portions of oil and/or gas production taxes.

In the latest state revenue forecast, issued Jan. 7, 2013, state Comptroller Susan Combs said the fund’s balance would be $8.1 billion by the end of August 2013, assuming lawmakers did not take money out. Due to additional oil-and-gas tax revenue transfers, Combs projected the fund to grow to $9.83 billion at the end of August 2014 and to $11.76 billion a year later.

So, were lawmakers cutting the fund from $8 billion to $4 billion as Sullivan said?

To our inquiry, Sullivan noted the fund’s 2013 balance of $8.1 billion. And, he said by email, taking ""out $4 billion is taking out half of the money.""

He also said he has doubts about the fund’s future projected balances of greater than $8 billion. ""That is a forecast,"" he said. ""By definition, it is NOT money currently in the bank, or even an asset. In the bank is $8.1 billion. People hope that it will have $12 billion by late-ish 2015.""

""I know legislators want us focused on the pre-hatched chicks,"" Sullivan said, but ""I prefer to count the chickens that have already emerged from the eggs. That is, the current fund balance IS $8 billion. Every other number about the"" fund balance ""is a forecast. Indeed, looking out to 2015 is not even pre-hatched eggs, it's pre-conceived chickens.""

His analysis made us hungry to learn what lawmakers were voting to take from the fund when he tweeted.

John Barton, staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, which advises legislators on fiscal matters, told us by telephone that lawmakers approved two measures with a bearing on transfers from the fund.

A proposed constitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, would launch water infrastructure funds starting with $2 billion from the fund, if voters approve the proposition on the November 2013 ballot.

Lawmakers also approved House Bill 1025, which awaited the review of Gov. Rick Perry as of June 6, 2013. This measure provides for the $2 billion transfer that would be touched off if voters agree to the proposed amendment. In addition, according to the legislation’s fiscal note, $1.94 billion would be transferred from the rainy day fund by the end of August 2013, with $1.75 billion of that making up for a payment to school districts that was postponed by the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature. Lesser amounts would be spread among programs overseen by the governor, the Department of Public Safety, the Parks & Wildlife Department and firefighting agencies based at Texas A&M University.

By our read, this shakes out to $1.94 billion in spending from the rainy day fund through August 2013 and, if voters approve, $2 billion more by the end of August 2015, for $3.94 billion in total. It seems, too, that the rainy day fund stands to be reduced by about 25 percent as of the end of August 2013--from a balance of $8.1 billion to a little more than $6.1 billion. And the fund could shrink from an Aug. 31, 2015, projected balance of about $12 billion to about $8 billion, down 33 percent. These calculations assume HB 1025 making it into law and SJR 1 winning voter approval.

We ran this thinking by Sullivan, who replied by email that we were adding layers to his tweet, in that the $3.94 billion in intended spending accounts for half of the fund’s 2013 balance of about $8 billion. ""Some of this spending could be vetoed by the governor or the voters, but the bottom line is that the Legislature did authorize spending half of the current balance,"" Sullivan said. ""The comptroller has projected a higher balance through the end of fiscal year 2015 – but that’s a projection vs. what’s actually in the account today.""

We also shared our 25 percent/33 percent analysis with fiscal experts who track legislative deliberations.

By email, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a business group, and Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities, said our breakdown seemed accurate. Talmadge Heflin, director of the Center for Fiscal Policy at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, said Sullivan got it right.

Craymer wrote: ""If all of the (legislated) appropriations would take effect in 2013,"" Sullivan’s ""Twitter statement would be correct as of the end of 2013; however, all of the appropriations don’t take effect in 2013. The water appropriation won’t happen until and unless voters approve, with the election in  November 2013, which falls in the 2014 fiscal year.""

Craymer, who is a former chief revenue estimator for the state, also noted that about the time of that election, Combs plans to deposit more money into the fund thanks to ""excess oil and gas severance taxes collected in 2013. That deposit is currently estimated at $1.7 billion,"" Craymer wrote, ""but will probably be higher.  In 2015, another deposit currently estimated at $1.8 billion will be made,"" Craymer said, ""so essentially the fund is rapidly replenishing itself."" If all the legislated spending takes effect, he said, and money gets put into the fund as projected, its balance will go from $6.1 billion at the end of August 2013 to $5.9 billion a year later and $7.8 billion in August 2015.

""While there will certainly be less money in the fund compared to what could be there, the actual balance itself will remain somewhat flat,"" Craymer said.

DeLuna Castro summed up by email that if expectations hold, the fund’s balance will not drop to $4 billion at all.

Heflin, a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, described the ""ifs"" of legislation becoming law or voters approving the proposed amendment or the comptroller depositing more money into the fund as matters of speculation. The nearly $4 billion is nearly half the fund’s 2013 balance, Heflin emailed, so ""it looks like the Legislature authorized the fund to be drawn down by half of the current balance.""

Our ruling

Sullivan tweeted that lawmakers ""will be drawing current Economic Stabilization Fund down by half: $4 billion from current $8 billion.""

The $4 billion figure approximates legislated withdrawals from the rainy day fund over more than two years, assuming one measure makes it into law and another wins voter approval. However, it’s not correct that the fund will be halved. Its expected August 2013 balance of $8.1 billion could be cut by nearly $2 billion, or 25 percent. Down the road, the fund’s projected balance of nearly $12 billion at the end of August 2015 could shrink by 33 percent.

This statement skews these facts by counting current and future expenditures solely against the fund’s current balance. Put another way, it assumes all the legislated spending will occur while disregarding expectations that the fund will also accumulate more revenue.

The claim has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give an accurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B1C300>],/factchecks/2013/jun/07/michael-sullivan/michael-sullivan-says-legislators-spending-4-billi/

Barack Obama says his judicial nominees have faced waits three times as long as George W. Bush's
","
In the Rose Garden on June 4, 2013, President Barack Obama announced three nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In unveiling the nominees, Obama criticized Senate Republicans, accusing them of consistently obstructing his court picks. 
While Obama acknowledged that Democrats ""weren’t completely blameless when I was in the Senate,"" he added that today’s Republican opposition to his judicial picks ""is unprecedented."" 
""Time and again, congressional Republicans cynically used Senate rules and procedures to delay and even block qualified nominees from coming to a full vote,"" Obama said. ""As a result, my judicial nominees have waited three times longer to receive confirmation votes than those of my Republican predecessor … This is not about principled opposition. This is about political obstruction."" 
Is Obama really correct that his judicial nominees ""have waited three times longer"" than those nominated by President George W. Bush? 
The answer hinges on how you define the phrase ""to receive confirmation votes."" 
First, a civics reminder. The president is responsible for nominating judges, and the Senate is responsible for confirming them. Once a nomination is made, it goes to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Once it clears the committee, it goes to the Senate floor. By the book, the final confirmation vote only requires a majority, but in recent years, senators have increasingly threatened to filibuster -- that is, block -- judicial picks. This forces the Senate to first vote on ending the filibuster threat, a vote that requires 60 votes, not 51. 
The fact that there’s a two-step process -- first moving from nomination to committee, and then from committee to a confirmation vote -- has led to contradictory trends on nominee delays. Bush’s nominees tended to get delayed before winning committee approval, while Obama’s have more often been delayed on the floor. 
The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, published a thorough analysis of judicial nomination delays on May 2, 2013. Here are some of the highlights. 
From nomination to confirmation 
Measured one way -- from nomination to confirmation -- Obama’s claim is off base. 
According to CRS, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation for first-term circuit court nominees -- which include the D.C. Circuit -- was 240.2 for Obama. That was shorter than the 277 days faced by the nominees of George W. Bush. (Obama’s waits were, however, longer than for presidents George H.W. Bush, Reagan and Clinton.) 
Using the median wait, rather than the average wait, Obama’s nominees did face slightly longer delays than Bush’s did -- 225.5 days for Obama compared to 216 days for Bush. But even that was nowhere near the three-times-longer figure Obama cited. 
Obama was on safer ground regarding nominees to district courts, which are the trial courts one level below circuit courts. Obama nominees waited an average of 221.8 days, which was 42 percent longer than Bush’s nominees waited. Still, this isn’t three times as long. (Using the median showed essentially the same pattern.) 
From committee approval to confirmation 
Where Obama has a point is if you measure the time from the point of committee approval to confirmation -- in other words, the period when the nomination is on the Senate floor, where it can be filibustered. 
For an Obama circuit court nominee, the average wait from committee approval to confirmation was 138.5 days -- almost four times the duration under George W. Bush, which was 35.3 days. The median waits were similarly divergent: Obama’s nominees waited 131.5 days, compared to 18 days for nominees of George W. Bush. (Just to show how slow the process has become, George H.W. Bush's nominees waited just 7.8 days.) 
The same pattern held for district court nominees. For Obama, the average number of days was 98.5, compared to 34.9 days for George W. Bush -- about three times as long. The median figures were similar as well -- 91 days for Obama, 18 days for Bush. 
A White House spokesman, Eric Schultz, confirmed that Obama was talking about time spent on the floor after committee approval, and he argued that this is the fairest measurement. 
Schultz argued that it’s only fair to start measuring once all the preliminary requirements are done, including the paperwork, the rating process by the American Bar Association, the scheduling of hearings, the submission of senators’ written questions. Each of these steps, he said, could easily produce delays for logistical reasons rather than political opposition. 
We asked three academic experts on judicial nominations whether they agreed with Schultz’s preference for the committee-to-confirmation measurement, but we failed to secure a consensus. Paul Finkelman, a law professor at Albany Law School, said he thought the White House’s favored measurement was better, but Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who worked in the White House counsel’s office under George W. Bush, argued that measuring the full time period was preferable because committee tactics can ""include secret holds, delayed hearings, delayed votes and more."" 
And Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said that while he thinks the White House’s argument is reasonable, Obama should have been specific about the measurement he was using in his remarks -- something he could have done easily by saying, ""My judicial nominees have waited three times longer on the floor to receive confirmation votes than those of my Republican predecessor."" 
Meanwhile, Sheldon Goldman, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, created an ""index of obstruction and delay"" in a paper published a decade ago in Judicature Journal. His aim was to come up with a single number that measured both obstruction (that is, unsuccessful nominations) and delay (taking longer than 180 days from nomination to confirmation). Goldman has found that the index for Obama’s circuit court nominations was 0.9524, the highest he’s ever recorded. In a comparable period -- 2003 to 2004, when Bush was president and the GOP controlled the Senate -- the index was significantly lower, 0.6176. 
Still, Goldman told PolitiFact that his index ""does not address the three-times-as-many claim"" that we are checking here. 
Our ruling 
Obama said his judicial nominees ""have waited three times longer to receive confirmation votes than those of my Republican predecessor."" That’s true if you count from committee approval to confirmation, but not if you count the full period from nomination to confirmation. As it turns out, the average wait for George W. Bush’s circuit court nominees was actually longer from nomination to confirmation. 
Because Obama didn’t specify the measurement he was using -- and because an alternative number exists that runs counter to his claim -- Obama has essentially cherry-picked a figure that puts his situation in the most sympathetic light. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D60F00>],/factchecks/2013/jun/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-his-judicial-nominees-have-faced/

State Rep. Tom Letson suggests that Ohio Gov. John Kasich wanted campaign kickbacks from Bureau of Workers’ Compensation rebate recipients
","
Ohio Gov. John Kasich made news last month when he proposed returning $1 billion in insurance premiums to more than 200,000 public and private employers. 
The rebates, later approved by the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation board, could be worth up to millions of dollars and are possible thanks to an unexpected surplus in bureau funds. 
A couple of weeks later, the Republican Kasich noted the accomplishment among others in an email sent to his campaign’s listserv. The email drew the ire of State Rep. Tom Letson. 
A statement sent by Letson’s office called Kasich campaign’s email as a ""fundraising pitch to cash in"" on the rebates. Letson asserted that Kasich was ""raising money from an injured workers’ fund"" and that the governor has ""directly tied BWC rebates to"" political donations. 
""It is as if the Governor is implying that a portion of the rebate should be directed back to him in the form of campaign cash,"" said Letson, a four-term Democrat from Warren. 
PolitiFact Ohio decided that Letson’s provocative claim was worth a closer look. 
Let’s start with the email from Kasich’s campaign. Letson’s office attached a copy to his statement. We confirmed its authenticity after a Kasich aide forwarded us the original. 
The campaign email’s subject line: ""$1 billion back."" Here is the entire text: 
[Supporter], did you hear the recent news about the $1 billion coming back to Ohio taxpayers? Governor Kasich recently announced that Ohio's Bureau of Workers' Compensation would be returning $1 billion back to public and private employers in a move that’s aimed to help spur job creation. This plan has received a lot of praise and you can read some of the coverage below. 
Also, a recent survey of CEOs named Ohio as having the most improved business climate of all the other states in the country. It's great to see our reforms getting so much attention but there's still a lot more work to do and we’ll need your help to keep up the momentum. 
Finally, Gov. Kasich joined a Mahoning Valley company in announcing the creation of new jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in the local economy. You can read more about this great news here. 
Below are some more things for you to read and please take a moment to help us share some of them with your Facebook friends: 
We share the entire text, with the Kasich campaign’s bolded emphasis added, to show that there is no direct fundraising pitch in the text. The closest the campaign comes is the line about how Kasich has ""a lot more work to do"" and needs ""your help to keep up the momentum."" 
Immediately below the text were photos and headlines that link to six articles shared on the campaign’s website. At the very bottom of the email were two button-style links. One, labeled ""Donate Today"", links to the contribution page on the campaign’s website. The ""Donate"" button was not displayed next to any mention of the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation rebate offer. 
PolitiFact Ohio reached out to Letson’s office. Keary McCarthy, chief of staff for the Ohio House Democrats, responded on the lawmaker’s behalf. He argued that because the email included the ""Donate"" button at the bottom, it qualified as a fundraising pitch. Because the email noted the rebate program, McCarthy said it’s fair to link the rebates to a plea for campaign money. 
""Donate"" buttons are common on nearly every email sent by a political campaign. Many emails are much more explicit, whether by suggesting specific contribution amounts or making it clear that the supporter’s donation is important to meeting an incremental goal or winning a race. 
McCarthy stressed other points from Letson’s statement, which referred to past ""horrible missteps"" at the workers’ compensation agency. That’s a reference to the Coingate scandal during the Taft administration, in which lax oversight of investments cost taxpayers millions of dollars. Tom Noe, a Republican fundraiser, went to prison for raiding a $50 million portfolio he had managed for the agency. 
That context helps explain what type of behavior Letson is concerned about. But Letson spoke of misbehavior as if it already was occurring. So, do the facts back him up? Let’s review. 
In an email to campaign supporters, Kasich’s campaign touted the workers’ comp rebate program and two other recent accomplishments. The email included links to articles about these and other accomplishments and, at the very bottom, a link for those who wished to donate. So there is a fundraising element to the email. 
Letson said it was ""as if the Governor is implying that a portion of the rebate should be directed back to him in the form of campaign cash."" He is not merely asserting that Kasich was trying to raise money in the email. Rather, Letson is positing something very specific: that Kasich was asking rebate recipients to kick back some of their savings to the governor’s campaign. 
That’s a serious accusation. And though Letson hedges with words such as ""as if"" and ""implying,"" that doesn’t excuse the gravity of his claim. We don’t think anyone could reasonably come away from Kasich’s email with the impression he implied what Letson says he did.

John Lewis uses crime and prison stats to push for justice system changes
","
In recent years, elected officials, criminologists and others have examined ways to decrease the number of people sitting in U.S. prisons. 
For some officials, it’s a matter of money. In the post-Great Recession world, some lawmakers are looking for less costly ways to deal with nonviolent offenders. Other leaders, for different reasons, are concerned about how many people are in prison. 
U.S. Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon and veteran Atlanta congressman, recently co-wrote an op-ed about the ""presumption of guilt"" he believes the criminal justice system institutionally holds toward African-Americans. The op-ed included some complaints about the prison system. 
""The violent crime rate in America is the same as it was in 1968, yet our prison system has grown by over 500 percent,"" wrote Lewis, a Democrat, and Bryan Stevenson, who teaches law at New York University. 
PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out whether this claim was accurate. Is the crime rate the same as it was 45 years ago and has the nation’s prison system grown by 500 percent? 
First, let’s look at the portion of the claim about the growth of the prison system. Lewis and Stevenson were referring to the number of Americans in prison. There were about 188,000 people in state and federal prisons in 1968, according to a report the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics sent us. In 2011, the BJS reported 1,598,780 people were locked up in state and federal prisons. 
A quick comparison of the numbers shows the U.S. prison population is eight times greater than it was in 1968. A BJS official issued a caveat concerning the numbers. 
""[P]rior to 1977, prisoners in physical custody of a state were counted. Starting in 1977, BJS began counting the number of prisoners under state jurisdiction, or legal authority, since some states began housing prisoners in local jails, private prisons, and paying other states to have physical custody of the inmates,"" BJS statistician E. Ann Carson said via email. 
We also checked whether the percentage of people in U.S. prisons had increased by 500 percent since the American population is greater now than it was in 1968. 
In 1968, 94 out of every 100,000 U.S. residents were in state and federal prisons. In 2011, 492 out of every 100,000 U.S. residents were sentenced to more than one year in prison. The 2011 average is more than five times greater than it was in 1968, so that part of the claim appeared on target. 
Now, for the crime rate. 
The FBI does an annual report on crime in the United States that is used by most criminologists. In 1968, the violent crime rate was 298.4 crimes per 100,000 residents. In 2010, the most recent year available, the violent crime rate was 403.6 crimes per 100,000 residents. Obviously, that’s an increase since 1968. If it’s any comfort, the nation’s violent crime has declined steadily since its 1991 zenith of 758.2 crimes per 100,000 Americans. 
How about in Atlanta? Violent crime data is not available for 1968. The FBI does have information on what are generally considered the most dangerous crimes and puts them in what it calls the Part I category. PolitiFact Georgia had that data from 1969 onward when we fact-checked Mayor Kasim Reed’s claim that felony crimes in Atlanta are as low as they’ve been since that year. 
In Atlanta, the Part I crime rate was 6,387 per 100,000 residents in 1969. In 2012, the Part I crime rate was 7,997 per 100,000 residents. The 2012 crime rate was indeed the lowest since 1969, so we rated Reed’s claim True. 
Studies show there’s been an increase in people reporting rape, particularly by individuals they know, in the past three decades. Federal research concluded nearly 70 percent of attempted and completed rapes between 1992 and 2000 were reported. 
In December 2011, the FBI announced it had changed the definition of rape to penetration, no matter how slight, without the person’s consent. 
Brenda Jones, a spokeswoman for Lewis, said the claim was based on studies of crime in America’s highest populated state, California, and the nation’s largest municipality, New York City. The studies were done by James Austin, a criminologist who has worked inside prisons and held leadership positions in organizations that study crime and the corrections system for more than four decades. 
""Many criminologists believe that crime rate data has to be examined within jurisdictions to understand what the impact of current policies have been since we don't have a national crime policy,"" Jones said. ""It's by looking at particular jurisdictions that most data emerges that supports the claim that the violent crime rate today is where it was in the late 1960s in most places."" 
The California study includes a chart that shows the violent crime rate in California in 1968 was the same as 2012. Austin wrote in a November 2012 op-ed that the violent crime rate in California was at its lowest since 1960. 
The New York City study that they cited went back to 1986. It shows that felony arrests had declined since 1986, but misdemeanor arrests increased. City leaders credit numbers showing a decline in crime to a substantial increase in the size of its police force and computerized mapping techniques to put more officers in high-crime areas. They also cite a ""broken windows"" approach to policing, which means being more aggressive in combating low-level crime and quality-of-life issues. 
This was not an easy ruling for us. Lewis and Stevenson wrote that the violent crime rate is the same as it was in 1968, yet the prison system has increased by 500 percent. The claim was part of their argument against the growth of the nation’s prison system. The data we saw show they are correct about the growth of the prison system, but the nation’s violent crime rate has increased nationally. They used California and New York City to make their case about the crime rate, but the national crime rate has increased since 1968 and so has the crime rate in cities like Atlanta. 
We believe more evidence is necessary for Lewis and Stevenson to prove the first part of the statement. The second part is on target. 

On balance, we rate this claim as Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809770D780>],/factchecks/2013/jun/07/john-lewis/john-lewis-uses-crime-and-prison-stats-push-justic/

Bernie Sanders says six of 10 Americans say wealth should be distributed more equally
","
In a recent tweet, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., reiterated one of his most frequent themes -- income inequality in the United States. 
""Nearly 6 out of 10 believe that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people in the U.S.,"" Sanders tweeted. 
We wondered: Is the percentage holding that view really that high? 
Actually, it is -- and it hasn’t changed much for almost three decades. 
The Gallup polling organization has been asking the following question periodically  since 1985: ""Do you feel that the distribution of money and wealth in this country today is fair, or do you feel that the money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people?"" 
The most recent data comes from a Gallup survey taken April 4-7, 2013. The result: 59 percent agreed that ""the money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people,"" while 33 percent said the distribution was fair. The poll had a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points. 
Gallup has asked the question 12 times since 1985, with the percentage saying that wealth should be more evenly distributed keeping within a fairly narrow band, ranging between 56 percent and 68 percent. 
Gallup also reported a partisan divide: More than eight in 10 Democrats said money and wealth need to be more evenly distributed, compared with 28 percent of Republicans. 
It’s worth noting that there is less agreement on how this situation should be remedied. Gallup has periodically paired the question above with one additional question: ""Do you think our government should or should not redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich?"" During the 2012 presidential election, the candidates divided sharply on this question, with President Barack Obama favoring higher taxes on the rich and Republican Mitt Romney opposing any tax hikes. 
Support for higher taxes on the wealthy has zig-zagged between mild approval and mild disapproval since the 1980s, while backing for higher taxes on the rich has ranged from 45 percent to 52 percent. 
Most recently, in April 2013, Gallup found that 52 percent supported higher taxes on the wealthy while 45 percent opposed such a policy -- the second-largest gap in favor of higher taxes since the question was first asked. (In 2008, 51 percent supported higher taxes on the wealthy, while 43 percent were opposed.)

UPDATED: Ted Cruz says Americans invented ""Pong,"" ""Space Invaders"" and the iPhone
","The junior Republican senator from Texas celebrated American ingenuity in a spring commencement address. On May 11, 2013, Ted Cruz told the Hillsdale College (Mich.) Class of 2013 that the American dollar is the world’s international reserve currency and English is the planet’s language of commerce. Also, Cruz said, most movies are made in the U.S., where the telephone, automobile and airplane also were invented. ""Americans were the first to walk on the moon,"" Cruz continued. ""We invented ‘Pong,’ ‘Space Invaders’ and the iPhone."" Wait; Americans invented the iPhone plus ""Pong"" and ""Space Invaders,"" the dominant (trust us, dominant) 1970s-era arcade games? Let's recap iPhone-age, then check on those games. Apple rolled out the iPhone in 2007 with its invention credited to Steve Jobs, though it also was clear that the spinoff from the popular iPod MP3 player built on multiple creations. Journalist Mary Bellis has written that more than 200 patents were part of the design of the iPhone, ""so pinpointing one inventor would be unfair."" Still, her undated online post credits Apple employee John Casey with conceiving an iPhone-type device in 2000 by emailing colleagues about combining a phone and iPod. Jobs directed the teams that hatched the iPhone, she wrote, while Apple's British-born head of design, Jonathan Ive, is ""heavily credited with the aesthetic design and look of the iPhone."" In an Oct. 22, 2010, news article, PC Magazine said Jobs and his team ""clearly reinvented the smartphone with the iPhone, which then gave him a platform for creating mobile apps and new forms of mobile commerce."" Similarly, the California-based Computer History Museum notes in its Jobs’ biography, which appeared Dec. 2, 2011 (about two months after Jobs’ death), that when Jobs unveiled the iPhone, he ""described it as nothing less than the reinvention of the telephone: a combination ‘widescreen iPod with touch controls,’ a ‘revolutionary mobile phone,’ and a ‘breakthrough Internet communicator.’"" Most recently, Slate magazine, citing newly revealed documents, said in a Sept. 10, 2012, news article that Apple ""reinvented"" the smartphone with the iPhone, which was honed by Apple employees only; the story quotes a company executive testifying that Jobs ""didn’t let the iPhone team recruit anyone from outside the company to work on the device."" And the arcade games? ""Pong"" was mass-produced by an American company, Atari, according to web posts and news stories, and individuals credited with developing the game appear to have American roots. The Associated Press summed up ""Pong"" this way in an April 19, 2013, news article: ""The black-and-white arcade game introduced in 1972 had no complicated graphics, just geometric shapes. Players controlled digital paddles and tried to hit the ball so their opponents could not return it."" Accounts agree that Nolan Bushnell, a 1968 electrical engineering graduate of the University of Utah, steered the game’s creation after founding Atari with another engineer, Ted Dabney, in 1972. Bushnell had seen a Magnavox Odyssey version of ping-pong that spring and sought an easier-to-play version, enlisting Atari engineer Al Alcorn to perfect it. Bushnell, who grew up in Utah, and Alcorn, born in San Francisco, according to news stories, both appear to be Americans. Next, we looked into who invented ""Space Invaders,"" in which a player fires at space aliens steadily advancing from the top of the game screen; try it here, though keep in mind we’re not responsible for associated time sucks. Accounts credit a resident of Japan, not an American, with inventing the game. An Aug. 20, 2003, feature story in the Derby Evening Telegraph, a British newspaper, said a Japanese computer programmer ""wrote the game for Taito in Japan in 1978."" The story said the game heralded the introduction of arcade machines in restaurants and other places before Atari bought the rights to the game in 1980 and ""launched it on hundreds of thousands of black boxes plugged into TVs across the Western world."" The Tokyo-based Taito Corp., which says in a company timeline that it released the game in 1978, told us by email that Tomohiro Nishikado was the inventor. In a 2008 interview from his Yokohama home, Nishikado told an Australian newspaper that Taito sales people initially resisted the game, saying it was too hard to play. Nishikado also recalled concern that people would not play a game where the enemy shot back at them. ""It was never seen before,"" Nishikado said. Nishikado told the West Australian newspaper he was inspired to create the game by a magazine story previewing the Star Wars movie. ""Instantly I felt that something that takes place in outer space would be popular,"" Nishikado said. We alerted Cruz’s office to the Japanese engineer widely described as the Father of ""Space Invaders."" Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton replied by referring to the senator’s childhood, saying by email: ""Perhaps he was mistaken about ‘Space Invaders’ origins, but to an eight-year-old playing the game it certainly seemed American."" Our ruling Cruz said ""Pong,"" ""Space Invaders"" and the iPhone were invented by Americans. This appears so for ""Pong"" and the iPhone. But a Japanese programmer is credited with developing ""Space Invaders."" We rate this partly accurate claim as Half True. UPDATE, 3 p.m. June 6, 2013: This story was updated shortly after its publication to provide more information on the iPhone's development. The paragraphs drawing on Mary Bellis and an article in Slate were added. These changes did not affect the rating.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A30EE80>],/factchecks/2013/jun/06/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-americans-invented-pong-space-invade/
