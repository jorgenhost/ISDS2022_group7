First execution under Obamacare death panels? Pants on Fire!
","An old piece of Affordable Care Act mythology has come back from the dead: death panels. A reader sent us a link to a September American News article that claims an 86-year-old woman was ordered executed after a panel established by the Affordable Care Act determined that ""she is no longer useful."" ""According to recent reports, a group of death panels organized under Obamacare ordered their first execution. ""Following a hearing by the president’s Patient Resource Efficiency Board (PREB), 86-year-old Dorothy Zborknak has been ordered to death. The reason? According to the administration, she is no longer useful. ""Zborknak worked at Fleur de Lis Florist in Chicago for nearly forty years, before she made the decision to retire in 1998. Since that time, she has struggled with a host of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney failure. "" ‘Unfortunately, the cost of her care just became too expensive,’ claims Peter Johnston, a member of the Chicago PREB. ‘Under the Affordable Care Act, we have the power to make choices about end of life care and I stand by our ruling. I know it will be hard for the family to accept what’s going to happen…But from a financial standpoint, this was a very easy decision.’ We’ll offer a quick diagnosis: This claim is not accurate. Back in 2009, the myth of death panels was our inaugural Lie of the Year. Almost five years later, death panels are still not a part of U.S. health care law. Our first clue that the American News article was not real was the name of the woman who was supposedly sentenced to execution: Dorothy Zborknak. That’s the name of  Bea Arthur’s character on the TV show The Golden Girls. (Slightly misspelled -- it's actually Zbornak.) It turns out that the story is ripped from an article posted on The Daily Currant in January. The Daily Currant is a satirical website with a mission ""to ridicule the timid ignorance which obstructs our progress and promote intelligence,"" according to the website. Other headlines include things like ""Obama Announces Two-Year Golfing Trip"" and ""Al-Qaeda Member Elected to California City Council."" The debunkers at Snopes.com caught this case of copying back in September. As for the American News site, its ""About Us"" and ""Privacy Policy"" pages have no information on them besides ads. Stories are posted without attribution or bylines. We attempted to contact them through a form on the site, but did not receive a response. The article was posted on The Patriot Facebook page in September and quickly spread. It has 6,019 likes and was shared 4,906 times. For those who don’t recall it, the death panel discussion stemmed from a post on former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s Facebook page on August 7, 2009.   ""The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s ‘death panel’ so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their ‘level of productivity in society,’ whether they are worthy of health care,"" she wrote. There is no mention of such a system in the massive Affordable Care Act.  Instead, the idea originated from changes to Medicare to cover appointments on end-of-life planning, such as living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. The appointments were not required, and AARP backed the addition. The change wasn’t implemented after the controversy over Palin’s comments. Our ruling The chain email claimed that Dorothy Zborknak was ordered executed by an Obamacare death panel. We ruled on this topic five years ago, but we’ll repeat it again:  Death squads are not a part of the Affordable Care Act, and you can still catch Dorothy on Golden Girls reruns most nights.

Gwinnett spokeswoman on target with claim about school bus deaths
","About two dozen Georgia school systems have added cameras to their school buses since 2011. The cameras have one purpose: catching motorists who break a state law that requires them to stop for school buses that are picking up and dropping off students. Gwinnett County, the state’s largest school district, will be issuing warnings soon — and tickets after the Christmas break — to violators caught by its cameras. ""Prior to the law being passed that allowed for the use of cameras to enforce the law that addresses those who illegally pass a school bus, Georgia led the nation in student fatalities resulting from motorists illegally passing stopped school buses,"" Sloan Roach, the executive director of communications and media relations for Gwinnett County Public Schools, told reporters Nov. 6. That’s a grim statistic. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look. Georgia law allows police officers who witness motorists passing a stopped bus to issue a $1,000 moving violation misdemeanor. But after 5-year-old Karla Campos was killed when a driver sped past her stopped school bus in Cobb County in 2009, parents lobbied lawmakers to allow video cameras to catch violators. Their case was bolstered by a report that Campos was one of five Georgia children to die that year in bus-related accidents. That accounted for 38 percent of the 13 child fatalities occurring in 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to the 2009-2010 National School Bus Loading & Unloading Survey by the Kansas State Department of Education. They included a 7-year-old struck and killed crossing the street with another child to catch his bus. The elderly driver said he couldn’t see the boys because of fog. The 7-year-old’s companion survived. Georgia changed state law in 2011 to allow the installation of video cameras on school buses to catch violators. By the following school year, Cobb and Fayette County schools had already begun arming some of their district buses with cameras. At the time, Cobb estimated that about 1,000 violations occurred per day, or nearly one violation for each bus the district has on the road. By the end of the school year, the Cobb program caught 871 violators using cameras on 102 of the district’s buses. But because the law still required police to issue citations, those motorists only received warnings. State lawmakers have since updated the 2011 law to allow the districts or outside vendors to issue violations. Fines are $300 for the first offense and up to $1,000 for the third offense in five years. There is evidence that the increased enforcement has cut violations. In April 2013, Cobb filed 1,300 citations. This April, there were 767 citations in the state’s second-largest school district. A statewide poll of bus drivers, who reported the number of motorists who blew past a stopped bus, also saw a decline from 8,102 in the 2010-2011 school year to 7,619 last year, according to an annual survey conducted by the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services. Carlton Allen, Georgia’s representative to that group, said the new law has helped. So, too, did a blitz by the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety two years ago to focus on the problem. But Georgia still had 13 student deaths during bus loadings and unloadings in the past five years, said Allen, who is director of of pupil transportation services at the Georgia Department of Education. ""To me, part of that is the loss of a school bus safety unit in the state patrol and a reduction in our staff,"" Allen said of his office, down to three trainers from seven plus a clerical worker. That leaves it to the local systems to seek other ways to reduce violations, which in Gwinnett numbered 2,000 in a single day. American Traffic Solutions, which has taken over the program in Cobb, now sends video of violators to the county police to confirm a violation before they issue a citation. In the metro area, Decatur, Clayton and Marietta schools also use the video cameras. Atlanta and Fulton have signaled they plan to install the devices in the coming year. Georgia at one time did lead the nation in the number of students killed by motorists passing stopped school buses. That was in the 2009-2010 school year, before the state adopted a law allowing video cameras to help tackle the problem. The state has since updated the law to make it easier to ticket offenders. A growing number of school districts have begun using the video cameras as deterrents. Georgia has not had a year as bad as the record-setter of 2009-2010, with five child deaths. But it also has not been fatality-free as more than 40 states are each year. Even with the cameras, some motorists remain a problem. Roach correctly stated that a study showed Georgia led the nation for bus-related fatalities at the time lawmakers passed a bill allowing the use of the cameras. We rated her statement as True.",/factchecks/2014/nov/11/sloan-roach/gwinnett-spokeswoman-target-claim-about-school-bus/

Sean Hannity says every new GOP senator wants to repeal and replace Obamacare
","Now that the Republicans have won control in the Senate, one of the biggest questions is what they will do on health care. Fox News host Sean Hannity hammered home one strategy in his post-election analysis Nov. 5. Talking to Republican Louisiana U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy, who is in a runoff with incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, Hannity said, ""Every single candidate like yourself running for office said you will vote to repeal and replace Obamacare."" Later, in an interview with Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, Hannity said, ""Every candidate that won in the Senate promised to repeal and replace Obamacare,"" Hannity said. And he made the same point with Cory Gardner, who defeated incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado. ""Every Republican that won elections last night, including yourself, you said repeal/replace Obamacare."" All within the span of an hour. Here we're focusing on the 10 new Republicans joining the Senate. (The outcomes of races in Alaska and Louisiana are still pending.) By and large, Hannity has a point. The list David Perdue - Georgia: Posted on his campaign website, ""We need to repeal Obamacare and replace it with more affordable free market solutions."" Joni Ernst - Iowa: Posted on her campaign website, ""Joni is staunchly opposed to the Obamacare law. Joni supports immediate action to repeal Obamacare and replace it with common sense, free-market alternatives."" Thom Tillis - North Carolina: Posted on his campaign website, ""As North Carolina’s U.S. senator, Tillis will push for repeal of Obamacare, a balanced budget, and conservative economic policy."" In the most literal sense, Tillis fails to say he would replace the Affordable Care Act. The closest he comes is a vague promise ""to work to implement private sector solutions to reduce health care costs for North Carolinians."" Ben Sasse - Nebraska: In listing his agenda on his campaign website, Sasse included ""repeal Obamacare."" Sasse would replace it with a plan that creates a new tax deduction for individually-purchased insurance, allows people to buy insurance across state lines, makes health savings accounts more financially attractive, and reduces federal controls on state Medicaid programs. Notably, on Medicare, Sasse would raise the eligibility age and reduce benefits for the wealthy. Mike Rounds - South Dakota: Posted on his campaign website, ""Mike opposes Obamacare and would work to repeal and replace it with market-based, patient-centered solutions."" Tom Cotton - Arkansas: PolitiFact explored Cotton’s opposition to Obamacare and found several statements like this one on his congressional website, ""I will fight to repeal and replace Obamacare with free-market reforms that empower patients and doctors to make health-care decisions. … Obamacare must be repealed entirely."" James Lankford - Oklahoma: Posted to his Senate campaign website ""More than 55 times in the past three years I have voted to repeal, replace or delay the Obamacare law."" Further down on that page, Lankford wrote, ""I am a co-sponsor of the conservative replacement for Obamacare HR 3590. I am also the author of the only alternative that completely returns the oversight of health care back to the states."" Cory Gardner - Colorado: Posted a petition to repeal Obamacare on his campaign website. The section on that site that summarized Gardner’s record said, ""He supports legislation that repeals this misguided law and replaces it with a solution that allows the purchase of insurance across state lines, bolsters state high-risk pools to provide for those with pre-existing conditions, and enacts badly needed tort reform to reduce medical costs, among other ideas."" Shelley Moore Capito - West Virginia: During an October debate, Capito said, ""What I would vote for is to repeal and replace. I voted for that 50 times but I also recognize that the ACA has some very good things about it."" Capito went on to say she supported the ban on denying insurance for pre-existing conditions and giving parents the chance to keep kids on their plans until they turn 26. Steve Daines - Montana: When Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced her resignation, Daines said, ""While Secretary Sebelius’ resignation is a good start, it’s not enough — we need to repeal Obamacare before further harm comes to Montana families, and replace it with Montana-driven reforms that put the patient and their doctor — not government bureaucrats — in charge of health care decisions."" But during an October debate, when Daines was asked about repealing Obamacare, he gave a slightly nuanced response, ""I did not vote against Obamacare 40 times. Should check my record. I voted against it once, to repeal Obamacare. That’s my voting record."" During a June debate, Daines said he supports the law’s ban on denying insurance for pre-existing conditions and giving parents the chance to keep kids on their plans until they turn 26. Our ruling Hannity said that the new Republican senators campaigned on a platform to repeal and replace Obamacare. All 10 new Republican senators said during their campaigns either that Obamacare should be repealed or that they had voted to repeal it. The record on replacement is a little more nuanced. Republicans generally either explicitly say they want to replace Obamacare or more generally talk about health policy changes they support or parts of the Affordable Care Act that they’d like to keep. Bottom line, Hannity is clearly right on the trend line. We rate his claim Mostly True. UPDATE: After our fact-check published, Sasse's office pointed out additional details Sasse offered in his plan to replace Obamacare. Those comments are now included in this article.

Breitbart gets the wrong Loretta Lynch in Whitewater claim
","President Barack Obama made some political news over the weekend, nominating federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder. The announcement sent news staffs scrambling to better understand Lynch’s political views and to better understood the likelihood that she’ll be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Conservative news website Breitbart.com unearthed a potentially controversial line in Lynch’s biography. ""Obama’s new attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch represented Clintons during Whitewater,"" read a headline from Breitbart’s Warner Todd Houston. Houston wrote:  There is just one problem. Breitbart got the wrong Loretta Lynch. The mistake was first noted by liberal journalists at Media Matters. Breitbart eventually acknowledged in a correction that they got the wrong Lynch, but left the story up anyway.  Later, Breitbart deleted the story, though it had already spread to other conspiracy, opinion and conservative news websites like WND, Sodahead.com and the American Thinker. In this case, the Truth-O-Meter doesn’t have to work too hard to come up with a rating, but we think it’s important to address anyway because of how quickly false information spreads around the Internet. The Loretta Lynch nominated to replace Holder began working as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York in 1990, so she couldn’t have been part of Clinton’s defense a few years later. According to her official biography, Lynch was appointed by Obama on May 3, 2010, as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, an office she previously led from 1999 to 2001.  The other Loretta Lynch got a law degree from Yale and worked on several political campaigns, including Clinton’s, according to her biography. This Loretta Lynch served as president of the California Public Utilities Commission from 2000-02 and as a commissioner until 2005. We captured this image of her from her last appearance on C-SPAN, when she was addressing senators in 2002 about an alleged scheme by Enron to manipulate energy prices in California. Our ruling An article on Breitbart that has since been deleted said Loretta Lynch, Obama’s new nominee for attorney general, ""was a member of Bill Clinton's defense team during the 1992 Whitewater corruption probe."" The conservative news website got the wrong Loretta Lynch. We’re hoping the correction spreads as fast as the original story.

Rock singer Bob Seger says Gogebic mine would be built without government oversight
","The proposed iron ore mine in far northern Wisconsin -- a project that’s attracted international attention -- has been debated and discussed in all sorts of places. But not a rock and roll song. Until now. Rock legend Bob Seger offers up criticism of the mine in a song called ""It’s Your World,"" a track on ""Ride Out,"" his first new CD in eight years. The song, which addresses climate change, includes this line: ""Let's talk about mining in Wisconsin, let's talk about breathing in Beijing."" In an Oct. 12, 2014 interview with the Detroit News, Seger expanded on his concerns about the Wisconsin project. Gogebic Taconite hopes to build the $1.5 billion mine in the Penokee Hills in Iron and Ashland counties in far northern Wisconsin. The article quoted Seger as saying: ""The governor, Scott Walker, passed a bill through the state Legislature on a weekend that there will be no environmental oversight, 'we want this mine.' Well, the mine is right by a river that runs into Lake Superior, which is some of the cleanest fresh water in the world. ""But sorry,"" Seger added, ""according to Scott Walker, there isn't going to be oversight, we're going to build this thing, and it's going to be nine miles long."" We attempted to reach Seger through his label, Capitol Records, but received no response. Size claims Since we’re checking Seger, who has his own deep catalog of hits (""Night Moves,"" ""Against the Wind,"" etc.), we decided to start with our own backlist of size-related mine claims: An Al Jazeera documentary aired in 2014 claimed the mine site is ""just up the hill"" from Lake Superior ice caves at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. It’s more like 54 miles. We rated the claim False. State Rep. Evan Goyke, D-Milwaukee said the mine would be larger than his Assembly district, which is among the smallest in the state (True). And state Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, said the mine would be two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago (Mostly False). Musician and writer Dan Kaufman, a Wisconsin native, raised a number of environmental concerns about the project in an opinion piece published in the New York Times. He claimed the mine ""could be extended as long as 21 miles."" We rated his claim Half True. To be sure, in terms of its size and the length of time it would operate, the Gogebic mine  would be one of the most enormous undertakings ever seen in Wisconsin. Critics say the mine poses threats to surface water and groundwater resources in the Bad River watershed, which flows into Lake Superior. The Department of Natural Resources says it will not approve a mining permit if environmental studies show the pit and related operations will cause substantial harm to the watershed, Gogebic Taconite is at least a year away from filing an application for a permit with the state. A ""pre-application"" report filed with the state says that the size of the iron ore deposit that Gogebic has the rights to could be 21 miles. But it’s not known how much of that deposit can be mined. The company says the first stage of the project would be two pits. Each would be two miles long. The first phase of mining would last an estimated 35 years. And then the company would have to seek another permit to mine the remaining deposit. So we’re not even half way to nine miles. No oversight? The second part of Seger’s claim, that the mine would be built without ""no environmental oversight,"" is also problematic. State law gives the Department of Natural Resources authority over the mine from start to finish, including exploration, sampling, mining and reclamation of the site. That oversight is already under way. The DNR’s web site devoted to the project shows 15 entries, including correspondence between the company and the state, regarding Gogebic’s plans to take bulk samples from the site. There are nine entries in another section regarding the company’s application for a stormwater permit, and more than two dozen entries under Gogebic’s application for an exploration license. ""This is a multi-year, multi-million dollar process before an application can even be submitted to the state,"" said Bob Seitz, a spokesman for Gogebic Taconite. The next major step for Gogebic is an application for a mining permit. Expected to come in 2015, that application must include the company’s plans for mining, reclamation of the site and details about how the company will handle waste rock. The most important document will be the company’s environmental impact report, which the DNR says must include the ""anticipated environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the proposed mining project and analysis of project alternatives."" The impact of the mine on the area’s air, geology, groundwater, endangered species, wetlands, aesthetics and socioeconomic issues are among the matters that must be addressed. Once the permit is received, the state has 420 days to review the application. That time frame includes a public hearing and public comment period. ""Ferrous mining projects are extremely complex and their regulation involves a host of administrative codes, including but not limited to those regarding wetlands and waterways, air pollution, waste and materials management, wildlife and fisheries, and endangered and threatened species,"" the DNR’s website says. Additionally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will consider the mine’s impact on the Bad River watershed under the federal Clean Water Act. And the impact of the project on the nearby Bad River band of the Lake Superior Chippewa -- already on record opposed to the project -- could stir legal challenges. Our rating Seger criticizes the proposed Gogebic mine, saying it would be nine miles long and operated with no government oversight. But the size, initially, would be closer to four miles long -- two pits, each about two miles long. And the project will be subject to regulation and oversight on several fronts. We rate his claim False. Editor's note: This item was updated to clarify that the distance from the proposed mine to the Lake Superior ice caves at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore is 54 miles.",/factchecks/2014/nov/10/bob-seger/rock-singer-bob-seger-says-gogebic-mine-would-be-b/

Claim: New Jersey has had 7 credit downgrades since Chris Christie took office
","Not surprisingly, the Sunday morning pundits were already forecasting what Republicans’ midterm election gains mean for the 2016 presidential race. Republicans considering a run for the presidency need to prove they are adept money-managers, and that might be a problem for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, said Fox News host Greta Van Susteren on ABC’s This Week. Christie had a great week of election-night wins as head of the Republican Governors Association, but she said that won’t matter as much when the 2016 conversation picks up and voters ""actually dig in and look at the numbers"" of how governors managed their states. ""Two years from now, though, we’re going to be looking at the economy in New Jersey,"" Van Susteren said. ""And so far they’ve had seven credit downgrades since the time he’s been governor. That doesn’t look good."" Sure, credit downgrades sound like a bummer, but what do they actually say about a governor’s performance as state CEO? Did Christie really have that many? Bond rating basics A state’s credit rating is an expert, independent analysis of a state’s ability to meet its debt obligations, not unlike a regular person’s credit score.  Here, we’re specifically looking at a state’s general obligation bond rating. Its full faith and credit has been pledged to repay the debt, said Lisa Washburn, managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, an independent research firm. Generally, the better the rating, the lower the borrowing cost. Other types of state-backed bonds, such as transportation trust fund bonds and others secured by an appropriation commitment by the Legislature, are weaker because their repayment depends on legislative action. Appropriation ratings are usually rated below general obligation bonds due to the risk that money is not appropriated. The rating for New Jersey’s general obligation bonds has been docked eight times, not seven, we found, by the three major ratings agencies of Wall Street: Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings. The following chart details the instances in which a major credit rating agency has lowered New Jersey’s general obligation debt. Date Rating service Rating change 1 Feb. 9, 2011 Standard & Poor’s AA to AA- 2 April 27, 2011 Moody’s Aa2 to Aa3 3 Aug. 17, 2011 Fitch Ratings AA to AA- 4 April 9, 2014 Standard & Poor’s AA- to A+ 5 May 1, 2014 Fitch Ratings AA- to A+ 6 May 13, 2014 Moody’s Aa3 to A1 7 Sept. 5, 2014 Fitch Ratings A+ to A 8 Sept. 10, 2014 Standard & Poor’s A+ to A An important note lost in Van Susteren’s claim. New Jersey’s credit rating hasn’t dropped eight notches. Instead, it’s been adjusted downward a total of eight times by the three major ratings agencies. ""It’s not wrong, but it also makes it sound like the state’s credit rating itself was downgraded by itself by seven places,"" Washburn said. The agencies’ ratings tend to be similar, so it’s not surprising that over three years, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch have both decreased the credit rating from AA, the third-highest level, gradually to A, the sixth-highest rating. The Moody’s system is slightly different but tracks similarly. The rating agencies’ reasons Now let’s get into why the credit rating dropped. As the chart shows, the first drop came in February 2011, the start of Christie’s second year in office. In announcing the first credit-rating downgrade of Christie’s governorship, Standard & Poor’s mentioned long-running problems with the state’s pension and health care obligations, as well as a slow economic recovery. Christie called the public employee pension and health care system a ticking time bomb and engineered a bipartisan pension law in 2010 that called for shoring up the state’s unfunded pension liability, recently estimated at $40 billion. The full pension contributions haven’t happened, and the economy remains sluggish, so the outlooks have been generally negative. Ratings services emphasize ongoing concerns about the state’s ""structural imbalance."" Translation: As long as the state continues to rely on one-time, short-term fixes and only partially funds its pension obligations, the budget outlook and ratings won’t be getting any better. In its Sept. 5 letter, Fitch outlined how the state lacked a long-term plan to close its budget gaps in the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years amid lingering low revenues, and the ""repudiation"" of promised pension contributions set in the 2011 law that Christie did not fulfill. Christie vetoed temporary tax increases on millionaires and businesses set by Democratic legislators in effort to pay for the pension contribution. ""New Jersey’s economic performance continues to lag that of the nation, and a multitude of long-term spending demands are expected to prolong the achievement of sound financial operations,"" the Fitch report said. Just days later on Sept. 10, Christie earned an unenviable distinction among Garden State governors with another downgrade from S&P: He has overseen the most downgrades of any governor, at eight. We did not hear back from Christie’s staff in time for our fact-check. In a September story about the latest S&P downgrade, a spokesman for the state Department of Treasury told The Star-Ledger that it did not come as a shock ""given the tendency of rating agencies to follow one another closely in all actions -- as they did leading up to the financial crisis of the late 2000s."" Christie himself said the ratings agencies were ""being significantly over-aggressive because they were such bums back in ’08 and ’09 and they left everybody hanging out to dry."" In fact, an S&P analyst had cautioned Christie months earlier that another downgrade was likely to come if revenue remained stagnant and the state kept ""deferring pressures into future budgets."" The frequent downgrades do not mean the state is falling to financial pieces. Yes, the state’s credit rating is the second-worst among states in the nation, behind only Illinois. But states generally have solid credit, and New Jersey’s is rated higher than most corporations and is nowhere near the junk-bond status of Detroit or Puerto Rico, Washburn said. ""An A rating isn’t a bad rating,"" Washburn said. ""It’s still solidly within the investment grade. It’s just well below its peers."" Our ruling Van Susteren said New Jersey has had ""seven credit downgrades"" since Chris Christie became governor in 2010. We counted eight instances in which the three major credit rating agencies of Wall Street lowered the state’s general obligation bond rating. It’s important to note that does not mean the state’s credit rating has dropped eight places. Not all of the downgrades can be blamed squarely on Christie, as he inherited a large pension obligation that only grew. But the downgrades are a well-documented vulnerability in a potential presidential run, and several analysts have criticized Christie’s more recent budget moves for perpetuating an unstable budget climate.   Van Susteren’s claim is close but slightly misses the mark. We rate her claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/nov/09/greta-van-susteren/claim-new-jersey-has-had-7-credit-downgrades-chris/

Obama: Since 2009, U.S. has created more jobs than 'every other advanced economy combined'
","America’s labor market is creeping back to pre-recession levels, and President Barack Obama says its growth has surpassed that of every other advanced country combined. Obama appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation Nov. 9 in an interview with host Bob Schieffer. When asked about the Democrats’ midterm election losses, Obama said the big takeaway is that Americans don’t think Washington is working -- even though the economy is getting better. ""The economy has improved significantly. There's no doubt about it,"" Obama said. ""We had a jobs report for October that showed that once again over 200,000 jobs created. We've now created more than 10 million. The unemployment rate's come down faster than we could have anticipated. Just to give you some perspective, Bob, we've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office."" By many metrics, the United States has bounced back from the recession better than other advanced countries. (For the record, the 10-million-jobs-added figure Obama cited is just private-sector jobs and excludes much of Obama's first year in office.) But we wondered if, in the past six years, U.S. job growth has surpassed other leading economies by such a wide margin. By the numbers We turned to the International Monetary Fund for economic data. The IMF classifies 36 countries as ""advanced economies"" -- and seven of those countries as ""major advanced economies.""  We looked at total average annual employment from 2009 (Obama’s first year in office) through 2014. Using an average helps isolate against monthly fluctuations and is a better way to compare jobs pictures across countries. Country or group 2009 employment  2014 employment, est Absolute growth  Percent growth United States 139.9 million 145.9 million 5.98 million 4.27 percent IMF: 36 advanced economies (except U.S.) 326.5 million 332.8 million 6.28 million 1.92 percent IMF: G7 major advanced economies (except U.S.) 196.1 million 200.8 million 4.72 million 2.41 percent (For all the data, check out this Google spreadsheet.) So, according to the IMF, the number of people employed in the United States has grown by roughly 6 million people. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the figure at about 5.7 million.) Neither figure is literally more than all of the other 35 countries labeled an advanced economy, as Obama said, but it’s fairly close. But it is clearly more than the other G7 countries -- Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom -- combined. There is one wrinkle with the IMF's list. The IMF’s advanced economies list includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, which are not recognized as independent countries but added more than 1 million jobs. If you chose to exclude them from the IMF's list, Obama would be correct, Harvard economist Jeffrey Frankel told us. (Though Obama said ""advanced economy"" not country.) Some caveats So you could make a case that Obama is right. But you can also say that he's off. There are some other obvious caveats to point out. For starters, the United States is the most populous of these countries -- more than twice the population of Japan, which is the next most populous advanced economy (China, Russia and India do not make this list). So it’s logical that there will, in general, be higher job gains in absolute numbers compared to smaller nations.   Looking at the percentage growth rate instead of the absolute number of jobs helps to account for the population differences among these advanced nations. And by that measurement, the United States’ growth rate is lower than quite a few nations on this list, including: Australia, Austria, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Israel, South Korea, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The country with the highest job growth rate was Singapore, with a rate of more than 18 percent. Also, the number of jobs in the United States has just this year returned to a point near pre-recession levels. The United States hemorrhaged jobs in the last months of 2008 and the first few months of 2009.  This means that Obama hasn’t had non-stop job growth throughout his presidency. There have been months of overall job loss, particularly in that first year, amidst the recession. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, noted that this job growth is likely not attributable to any of Obama’s actions, even though the economic recovery happened to start soon after he took office. ""Overall these sorts of comparisons mean little because employment outcomes have more to do with the economic environments more generally rather than specifically the president's policies,"" Sinclair said. Our ruling Obama said, ""We've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office."" Using a straight definition of advanced economic nations from the International Monetary Fund, Obama is slightly off. The United States has added less jobs than a group of 35 other advanced economic nations combined, not more. However, you can make the argument that two countries on the list -- Hong Kong and Taiwan -- should be excluded. What’s equally and perhaps more noteworthy is that when you look at the rate of job growth, which accounts for population differences, the United States trails other advanced nations. Overall, we rate Obama's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/nov/09/barack-obama/obama-2009-us-has-created-more-jobs-every-other-ad/

Brat will hold the only Ph. D. in economics in the House
","In case you haven’t heard, newly elected U.S. Rep. Dave Brat is an economist. And that background, the Republican said repeatedly in campaign speeches and ads, puts him in a unique position to lead in Washington. ""If you do send me up there, and I’d be honored if you do, I’ll be the only economist in the House,"" Brat, R-7th, told voters at an Ashland rally on Oct. 15. Well, 7th District voters are sending him up there. So we decided to check whether Brat truly will be one of a kind. Let’s start by examining what economists do. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""economists study the production and distribution of resources, goods and services by collecting and analyzing data, researching trends and evaluating economic issues."" They forecast market trends and advise businesses and governments on economic issues. What qualifies one as an economist? ""There is no formal definition for ‘economist,’ although the usual distinction is that one has earned a Ph.D. in economics,"" John Siegfried, the secretary-treasurer emeritus of the American Economic Association, said in an email. ""But anyone can call themselves ‘an economist.’"" The BLS says generally most economist jobs require a master’s degree or Ph.D., although some are available to people with bachelor’s degrees in the field. Brat holds a Ph.D. in economics from American University, has been a professor at Randolph-Macon College since 1996 and chairman of its Department of Economics and Business since 2005. He’s served two Virginia governors on the Joint Advisory Board of Economists and advised a number of other organizations. Brat is an avowed believer in free markets who says his hero is Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate in economics who maintained that government should wield a feather hand on the marketplace. Brat, according to The New York Times, is not known for groundbreaking research of his own. How did Brat conclude he’ll be the only economist in the House? Brian Gottstein, spokesman for Brat’s campaign, said the information came from Congressional Quarterly,  which compiles profiles for each member of Congress. ""We did not count those House members that have undergraduate economics degrees but aren’t career economists,"" Gottstein e-mailed. We found a January 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service that breaks down House members’ occupations into 20 categories which, unfortunately, did not include economists. Almost half of the members had careers either in law, business or banking. Another CRS report from August, although not exhaustive, drilled down a little further on the occupations of members of Congress. It lists, among other things, five former Peace Corps volunteers, four radio talk show hosts, three psychologists, two almond orchard owners, one rodeo announcer and zero economists. The House clerk’s office lists 21 Ph.D. holders in the chamber. But none of their doctorates, we found, are in economics. Twenty-seven members have undergraduate degrees in economics, according to a CQ database of the various educational degrees and occupations each congressmen lists on his resume. Only two members have ""economist"" listed as a former job: Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., who also has done stints as a congressional aide and a public relations manager at a publishing firm.   Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif, says he was an economist for the Environmental Protection Agency during 1980-81. He subsequently became a lawyer. Our ruling Brat said he would be the only economist in the House. We only found two members who list economist among the jobs they’ve held before entering Congress. Both went on to other professions. Brat has been an economics professor since 1996 and would be the only congressman with a Ph.D. in the field. We’ll leave it to you decide whether Brat’s distinct background will better enable Congress to resolve economic issues.

R.I. Moderate Party’s Robert Healey says he only spent about $36 on his gubernatorial campaign
","Memorable and low-budget -- that's the type of election campaign Robert J. Healey Jr. likes to wage. While the other candidates campaigned for months and spent millions in the most expensive governor’s race in Rhode Island history, Healey didn’t enter the contest until shortly after the September primary, when he replaced the Moderate Party’s original candidate, who was unable to run because of illness. Healey, who has repeatedly run for lieutenant governor with the intention of abolishing the office, and who spent the 2002 election season handing out campaign condoms with the slogan ""Nothing never felt so good,"" got 21.4 percent of the vote after mail ballots were counted in the 2014 gubernatorial election. While the major party candidates, Democrat Gina Raimondo and Republican Allan Fung, saturated the airwaves with commercials, Healey made a few campaign appearances and put up a few signs. But his performance in televised debates in October won him support from a lot of people who like his unconventional style -- or didn’t much like Fung or Raimondo, who won the race. The day after the election, Healey told Providence Journal columnist Edward Fitzpatrick that he spent just $36.29 on his campaign. He made a similar claim on WPRO, where morning host Gene Valicenti congratulated him on his strong showing. ""Thank you. For 35, for 38 bucks, not bad,"" Healey said. ""I probably should have spent twice as much. I would have doubled my numbers and maybe be the governor."" Valicenti joked that he didn't count gas money. ""I know,"" Healey responded. ""(But) I had to go there anyway."" The Moderate Party candidate -- who also founded the Cool Moose Party -- has cited similar numbers in other venues. That prompted a reader to question the accuracy of Healey's statements. ""Someone had to spend money for those garish signs over I-195. And those signs weren't cheap,"" the reader said. Indeed, there were more than a few Healey signs throughout the state. We decided to check. Healey's most recent filing with the Rhode Island Board of Elections, for the period ending Oct. 27, 2014, shows that he raised no money and spent nothing during the previous 20 days. His previous report shows that he gave himself $35.31 and spent it all on cell phone expenses. Healey told us the amount jumps to $36.29 when you add the price of the only two purchases he made since his last financial report -- a pair of postage stamps. Filings for the Moderate Party itself show that it spent no money on Healey's race either, at least through Oct. 27. So where did the money for the signs come from? Healey said a lot of supporters downloaded the public-domain images of him and his artwork from his website ""so anybody could produce anything."" They printed their own. In addition, a local sign maker printed up his own signs and sold them at cost. The candidate also recycled signs from his past campaigns for lieutenant governor. ""We just crossed out the word 'lieutenant' and gave those away,"" said Healey. He also painted a campaign message on the wall of a building using old black paint. He initially had trouble opening the cans of Rust-Oleum paint because the covers had rusted shut. ""I found that rather ironic. They should make cans that don't rust,"" he said. In the end, ""I didn't spend any money on signs. Not at all,"" Healey asserted. In addition, ""people printed up a ton of T-shirts. I don't know what people did with them. But we're creating small business in Rhode Island. We're giving people jobs."" ""We recycled everything -- anything I could cross out the word 'lieutenant.' We recycled buttons. We had some old bumper stickers from when I ran for governor in '98. In the attic, I found a case of Cool Moose combs, which I had in '86. Yardsticks,"" he said. And did he have any leftover condoms? ""We did, but they all expired in 2003. We didn't want to be giving out expired condoms."" So when Robert Healey says he spent only about $36 on his campaign, all the evidence points to a truly shoestring operation. We rate his claim as True.

Did 100 times more people ascend to the middle class under Bill Clinton than under Ronald Reagan?
","Campaigning for Mary Burke in Milwaukee on Oct. 24, 2014, Bill Clinton reflected on his presidency, sizing it up against Ronald Reagan's. ""The thing I'm proudest of was that, as compared with President Reagan's term, we created 45 percent more jobs,"" Clinton said during a speech for Burke, who 10 days later lost her bid to unseat Gov. Scott Walker. He continued: ""But 100 times -- listen to this -- 100 times as many people worked their way from poverty into the American middle class. That’s the way this economy should work."" Clinton made the same claim a month earlier on CNN. One-hundred times as many? Now, that’s a statistic begging to be checked. Background on the issue Clinton, a Democrat, was elected in November 1992 and served two terms, from January 1993 to January 2001. Reagan, a Republican, was elected in November 1980 and also served eight years, from January 1981 to January 1989. Clinton’s spokesman cited census figures showing that there was a net decrease of nearly 7.7 million people living in poverty from 1993 to 2000. That’s 100 times more than the 77,000 fewer under Reagan from 1981 to 1988. But there’s some cherry picking going on in that comparison. Why? A president is elected in November but does not take office until January. To be consistent, you need to stick to one or the other. Earlier in 2014, Hillary Clinton made a claim similar to the one Bill Clinton made in Milwaukee. PolitiFact National rated it False. Our colleagues looked at two-eight year frames: Election years, which were 1992 to 2000 for Clinton and 1980 to 1988 for Reagan; and the years the men took office and left office -- 1993 to 2001 for Clinton and 1981 to 1989 for Reagan. Our colleagues found similar trends for each time frames, then reported figures based on the second time frame. During the eight years under Clinton, the number of Americans in poverty declined by 6.5 million -- 22 times more than the 294,000 under Reagan. That’s a lot, but it’s not 100 times. There’s one other problem with Clinton’s claim, given that he cited not simply the number of people no longer living in poverty but those that moved from poverty to the ""middle class."" His spokesman provided no evidence to indicate how many people moved into the middle class. Jonathan Schwabish, economist and senior researcher at the Urban Institute, told us there is no consensus on what constitutes the middle class. He also said it would be hard argue that all of the people who climbed out of poverty had entered the middle class. Indeed, a person whose income was $1 above the poverty line would no longer officially be living in poverty, but probably wouldn’t feel as though he or she had suddenly joined the middle class. Our rating Clinton said ""100 times as many people worked their way from poverty into the American middle class"" during his presidency compared to Reagan's presidency. Measured one way -- from the year each president took office to the election year in which each last served -- the number of people no longer living in poverty under Clinton was 100 times more than the number under Reagan. But a consistent measure -- from the year each president took office to the year each president left office -- shows the figure under Clinton was only 22 times higher. What’s more, Clinton provided no evidence that all the people lifted out of poverty during his tenure had entered the middle class. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

Jeb Bush says one-third of students drop out and can't go on to college or a career
","With the 2014 elections in the rear-view mirror and 2016 coming up fast, the political world has begun speculating about whether former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- son of one president and brother of a second -- could seek the White House himself. In a recent fundraising letter sent on behalf of the Excellence in Education Foundation, Bush discusses one of his signature issues. ""In order to have any lasting success, we must first transform our failing education system and have no tolerance for the adult-centered K-12 system that exists today. ""America's education system is a prime example of government that is completely out-of-control. Instead of focusing on what's best for our children, education in America is focused on the adults who organize in more than 13,000 heavily unionized government monopolies. ""As a result, America's high school graduation standards are shamefully low. ""Only 25% of America's high school graduates are college or career ready. ""1/3 of America's high school graduates need remediation. ""1/3 of our kids drop out, cannot go to college or start a career. ""This is a tragedy unfolding in our country in ways that will overwhelm us."" This is a lot to chew on, but we decided to check one of these claims -- that one-third of American students ""drop out, cannot go to college or start a career."" The problem, we quickly found, is that Bush’s one-third figure isn’t correct for dropouts alone, for those who do not go to college, or for the combination of the two. Before we look at the numbers, we should explain that there is more than one way to measure dropout frequency. One of the most common is the ""status dropout rate,"" which measures, at a specific point in time, what percent of people within a certain age range are dropouts. By this measure, Bush’s figure is significantly inflated. In 2012, 6.6 percent of 16-to-24-year-olds were neither enrolled in school nor possessed an alternative high school credential such as a GED. That’s one-fifth of Bush’s number. Another way of measuring dropouts is to use the ""event dropout rate."" This measures what percentage of people in an age range dropped out during the prior year. In 2011 -- the most recent year this statistic was calculated -- the percentage was 3 percent. That’s less than 10 percent of what Bush had said. So what’s going on here? When we asked Bush’s staff to explain their reasoning, they said that multiple reports show high numbers of minority students, black and Hispanic in particular, are not graduating from high school. It pointed to another federal estimate -- one that looks at how many public high school students who started as freshmen finished high school within four years. According to provisional data, the Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate, as it is known, found that 78.2 percent of of freshmen finished school in four years. That figure was 66.1 for black students and 71.4 percent for Hispanics. That flip side would be that nearly 34 percent of black freshmen and about 29 percent of Hispanic freshmen didn’t graduate in four years. Education Week data showed similar numbers for members of the high school class of 2012. However, the fundraising letter doesn’t mention anything about minority students. So the most appropriate number to use would be the overall number -- and that would be 19 percent to 22 percent, depending on the parameters you use. Either way, that’s well below one-third. Bush’s staff also pointed to data from the publishers of the ACT college-entrance exam. It found that 31 percent of those who graduated from high school and took the ACT were not ready for entry-level college courses in English, reading, math or science. However, ACT test-takers represent a fraction all of students, and it’s not wise to assume they’re the same, said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. Overall, Bills said, the Bush camp’s justifications strike him as cherry-picking. ""I think we’re getting a pretty motivated use of data,"" he said. Our ruling Bush said that ""1/3 of our kids drop out (of high school), cannot go to college or start a career."" Traditional dropout figures peg the dropout rate at 3 percent to 6 percent, and even the most generous failure-to-graduate figures are running no higher than 22 percent for the U.S. population as a whole. The percentages are higher for African-American and Hispanic students, and at the most expansive level they can reach one-third. However, Bush’s claim said nothing limiting the statistic to minority students, so using this evidence to back up that claim is misleading. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. Clarification: The headline on this story has been changed to better reflect the statement we fact-checked. ",/factchecks/2014/nov/06/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-one-third-students-drop-out-or-arent/

Liberal columnist says the least trusted news sources are the most popular
","Many words have been said and many numbers crunched to explain political polarization in America. One theory is that liberals and conservatives swim in different waters when it comes to news and information. Liberal columnist Leonard Pitts, Jr. offered a new spin on this theme. In a Nov.1 op-ed, Pitt said most of the fault lies on the right end of the spectrum. He blamed conservative hardliners who ""are more rabid in support of those who validate their views than the rest of us are in pursuit of simple truth."" To prove his point, Pitts cited a recent report from the Pew Research Center that explored the level of trust enjoyed by 36 news sources, ranging from television networks to partisan blogs. Pitts focused his column on two sources, Rush Limbaugh and Fox News. In the Pew study, 39 percent of respondents said they distrusted Limbaugh, and 37 percent voiced the same misgivings about Fox News. Pitts noted that Rush Limbaugh ""hosts the number one show on radio and Fox is the highest-rated cable news outlet."" His conclusion? ""America’s least-trusted news sources are also its most popular."" A reader asked us to check that statement and we are happy to oblige. There are two elements to check: Are Limbaugh and Fox News the least-trusted? And are they the most popular with Americans? ‘Least-trusted’ Yes, the Pew survey found that more people distrusted Limbaugh and Fox News than any other outlet. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the two outlets are the ""least-trusted"" as Pitts claimed. To find that out, you need to account for the percentage of people who say that they trust Limbaugh and Fox News. For instance, while 39 percent of respondents said they distrusted Limbaugh, 12 percent said they trust him. And for Fox News, more people (44 percent) said they trust the network then said they distrust it (37 percent). Factoring that in, Limbaugh has the biggest trust gap of any of the 36 outlets polled. But Fox News is in the middle of the pack. Here’s the calculation for each outlet in the survey. News Source Pct. Trust Pct. Distrust Net trust CNN 54% 20% +34 ABC 50% 17 +33 NBC 50% 19% +31 CBS 46% 17% +29 BBC 36% 7% +29 PBS 38% 12% +26 Wall Street Journal 31% 10% +21 NPR 29% 9% +20 USA Today 33% 13% +20 New York Times 34% 17% +17 MSNBC 38% 22% +16 Google News 25% 11% +14 Washington Post 27% 14% +13 Economist 12% 2% +10 Fox News 44% 37% +7 New Yorker 14% 10% +4 Yahoo News 20% 16% +4 Blaze 6% 3% +3 Guardian 7% 4% +3 Bloomberg 11% 8% +3 Politico 7% 5% +2 Huffington 18% 17% +1 Slate 4% 3% +1 Mother Jones 6% 5% 1 Breitbart 4% 4% 0 Think Progress 2% 2% 0 Drudge Report 8% 9% -1 Daily Kos 2% 3% -1 Colbert Report 15% 16% -1 Daily Show 16% 18% -2 Ed Schultz 3% 5% -2 BuzzFeed 2% 8% -6 Al Jazeera 9% 16% -7 Hannity 12% 21% -9 Glenn Beck 10% 24% -14 Rush Limbaugh 12% 39% -27   So while it’s largely correct to conclude that Limbaugh’s program is the ""least-trusted,"" the same cannot be as easily said about Fox News. Within cable news, Fox News rates last, but in a broader pool, it fares better. (We noted the Pew findings and called Limbaugh the ""least trustworthy"" news source in an Oct. 21 article. We did not do the same with Fox News.) ‘Most popular’ As for measuring popularity -- by the number of listeners, viewers or readers -- that can be complicated. For starters, the Pew survey includes newspapers, broadcast TV networks, cable TV networks, websites, radio organizations and individual radio shows. Pitts expanded upon his claim in terms of comparing Limbaugh to other radio programs and Fox News to other cable networks. We think that’s a fair metric. We’ll take Limbaugh first. Rachel Nelson with Premiere Networks, the company that distributes the Rush Limbaugh Show, said it is the No. 1 talk radio program in America.  ""The Rush Limbaugh Show is heard on nearly 600 stations by up to 20 million people each week and is the highest-rated national radio talk show in America,"" Nelson said. However, it’s hard to find objective confirmation for the size of the Limbaugh audience. In radio, the Arbitron/Nielsen Audio service is the leading source for independent data. In order to get firm statistics for Limbaugh, one would need to look at how his show performed in all of the markets where stations carry it. That has not been done. The closest approximation to Arbitron ratings comes from Talkers Magazine. In October, the magazine estimated Limbaugh’s audience at 12.5 million or more each week. But as the magazine notes, ""these figures are non-scientific projections based upon a significant sample and do not represent exact Nielsen Audio or any other rating service totals."" What might compete with Limbaugh? NPR’s Morning Edition. It airs on about 660 stations and according to NPR, in the Spring 2014 survey, 12,267,800 listeners tuned in each week, using Arbitron data. (In the Pew survey, 29 percent of people said they trusted NPR, 9 percent said they distrusted the public radio broadcaster.) Bob Thompson is a professor at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications. Thompson said the Arbitron numbers are themselves estimates based on statistical models. Thompson said that Morning Edition and the Rush Limbaugh Show could have similar-sized audiences. ""Those Arbitron numbers put NPR reasonably in the range of 12.5 million people who listen that show,"" Thompson said. ""It’s silly to look at them as exact, but they get us into the neighborhood."" In summary, most everyone agrees that Limbaugh is near the top. But a definitive figure of listeners is elusive. On the television side, Pitts’ claim about Fox News popularity is right when compared to other cable news networks.  Based on Nielsen data, in 2013, about 1.77 million viewers tuned in Fox News during the prime time hours between 8 and 11 p.m. That is more than the viewers for CNN and MSNBC combined. But we should note that all of the network news programs beat out Fox News many times over. On an average night, 8.4 million viewers chose NBC Nightly News, 7.7 million viewers picked ABC World News, and 6.5 million viewers tuned in CBS Evening News. ""Cable news carves up a tiny slice of the population of this country,"" Thompson said. Our ruling Pitts said America’s least-trusted news sources are also its most popular ones and focused on the Rush Limbaugh Show on radio and Fox News on cable. According to the survey Pitts used, Limbaugh’s program is indeed the least-trusted news source. However, comparing the size of the gap between people who trust to those who distrust a source, Fox News falls in the middle of the pack. In terms of popularity, Fox News clearly is the most popular channel in its genre and the Rush Limbaugh Show is likely the most popular radio talk show (or at least very close to it). Pitts’ assessment also obscures the enormous reach of network television news. The lowest-performing network, CBS, has an audience three times that of Fox News. Pitts makes some valid points but he leaves out information that might lead someone to reach a different conclusion.

Chain email claims 214,000 doctors refuse to take patients with insurance bought on marketplaces
","Are doctors en masse refusing patients who gained health care coverage due to the Affordable Care Act? That’s the claim in a chain email a reader asked us to check. ""More, truly scary Obamacare news,"" said the email, sent just before Halloween. The  accompanying story was from CNSnews.com, a site operated by the conservative Media Research Center. ""Over 214,000 Doctors Opt Out of Obamacare Exchanges,"" read a headline on CNSnews.com. We found the source of the claim. It was coming from American Action Forum, a self-described ""center-right policy institute."" The organization put out an analysis on Oct. 27 titled: ""Health Care Providers are Opting-Out of Obamacare Exchange Plans."" How many? According to the post, ""as many as 214,524 American physicians will not be participating in any (Affordable Care Act) exchange products."" It went on to list some reasons ""doctors are opting out of the exchange plans."" That’s a lot of doctors. Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let’s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it’s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don’t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It’s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. ""The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,"" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an ""upper bound"" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here’s the rub, from the research: ""The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide."" While there’s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there’s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. ""That’s a significant difference,"" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. ""I wouldn’t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians."" Let’s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn’t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are ""opting out"" of Obamacare. Many — almost half — weren’t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren’t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. ""Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they’re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),"" Ginsburg said. ""On an exchange, you don’t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans."" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won’t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans. But there is no evidence to suggest the number is anywhere near 214,000. Our ruling A chain email claimed that more than 214,000 American doctors are ""opting-out of Obamacare exchange plans."" That is based on a survey of a select group of doctors and even the makers of the survey said it can’t be extrapolated for the entire country. Further, of the doctors responding to the survey, 42 percent said they weren’t participating in marketplace plans because they were never asked to, not because they were ""opting out."" The estimate is the result of a flawed methodology and a misreading of survey data. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/nov/06/chain-email/chain-email-claims-214000-doctors-refuse-take-pati/

Facebook meme from OK House member distorts Obama's economic record
","The day President Donald Trump gave his first State of the Union address, Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., posted an image on Facebook that showed why he was ""proud to have a president that’s putting America first and investing here at home."" Mullin’s post was a side-by-side comparison of Trump and President Barack Obama. While it didn’t say so, the statistics were for the first year of each president. Against the gains under Trump, the image had these grim numbers for Obama: Jobs lost: 4 million Unemployment: Rose from 7.85 to 9.9% S&P (500): 1,115.1 GDP Change: Down 2.8% Mullin’s office told us they got the numbers from a CNN Money article and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. We checked the original sources – the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the S&P 500 index, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The numbers are right, and in fact the latest numbers for Trump would look even a little better. The message, however, is thoroughly deceptive. The CNN Money article Mullin's office cited points out the danger of judging any president based on his first year alone. It quotes historian Douglas Brinkley saying, ""It's not after year one or two that people judge a president. That can affect midterm elections. But what presidents are remembered for are the numbers when they leave office."" The examples in the article make that quite clear. President Jimmy Carter’s first year had 3.1 million more jobs, falling unemployment and a GDP of 4.6 percent. But by his last year, the country was in recession. Unemployment had gone from a low of 5.6 percent to a high of 7.5 percent. Annual GDP was a negative 0.2 percent. President Ronald Reagan’s first year had anemic job growth of 130,000 and rising unemployment that reached 8.3 percent. But when he left, the country had gained nearly 16 million jobs, unemployment was down to 5.3 percent and GDP growth was 4.2 percent. President George H.W. Bush took over with an economic wind at his back, but a downturn hit and while the economy recovered, it wasn’t enough to win him a second term. GDP growth stood at 3.7 percent when he came in and bottomed out at negative 0.1 percent. Unemployment started at 5.4 percent and climbed to 7.4 percent in his last year. President Bill Clinton had a moderately good first year, but closed out with impressive GDP growth of 4.7 percent, an unemployment rate of 4 percent and a net gain of  almost 23 million jobs. President George W. Bush had a poor first year and disastrous last one, as the country slipped into the Great Recession. GDP growth in 2001 was 1 percent. When Bush left, it was a negative 0.3 percent and unemployment had gone from 4.2 percent to 7.3 percent. When we apply the yardstick of where things stand from the beginning to the end of a president’s tenure, Obama looks quite different from the picture Mullin paints. When Obama took office, GDP was falling at a rate of 2.8 percent. When he left, GDP was growing by 1.5 percent and it had reached 2.9 percent the year before. The country had 11.2 million more jobs. Unemployment had gone from a high of 10 percent during his first year to 4.7 percent when he left. ""As most nonpartisan economists recognize, you cannot blame a new president for the economic conditions that prevail when he or she takes the oath of office,"" economist Gary Burtless of Brookings told us. ""Those are the responsibility of the previous administration. The highly partisan comparison (in the Facebook post) does not reflect this simple reality."" Obama inherited an economy in collapse, Burtless said, while Trump took over when economic conditions were strong. Mullin compared improvements in the economy during Trump’s first year with negative statistics during Obama’s. The post doesn’t note it, but Obama’s numbers are for only his first year in office. While those numbers are accurate enough, they ignore that Obama took office as the country was sliding into the depths of the Great Recession. In contrast, Trump inherited an economy on the upswing. Mullin overlooks the gain of 11 million jobs and an unemployment rate that fell by more than half under Obama. There’s some accuracy to the stats in this statement, but they aren’t labeled clearly. We rate this claim Half True.   PolitiFact Democratic guest columnist former U.S. Rep. Jason Altmire says we generously rated Mullin’s Facebook post Half True. Read his critique here.

How high are economic confidence polls under Donald Trump?
","On a number of occasions, President Donald Trump has touted the degree of confidence Americans have in the economy on his watch. He did so in his State of the Union address, when he said, ""Small business confidence is at an all-time high."" We rated that True. But during a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he offered a broader sweep. ""After years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth,"" Trump said on Jan. 26. ""The stock market is smashing one record after another, and has added more than $7 trillion in new wealth since my election. Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades."" We looked at confidence measurements for each of those three areas to see if Trump has a point. Some of the measurements were suggested to us by the White House; others we found ourselves. Overall, we found that confidence is high, but there are times in recent history when it’s been higher. Consumer confidence There are two major, monthly surveys that measure consumer confidence — one by the Conference Board and one by the University of Michigan. Both show levels of consumer confidence that are high by historical standards, but they are not ""the highest they have been in many decades."" Currently, the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index is at 122.1. That’s higher than it ever was under President Barack Obama or President George W. Bush. However, it was higher between May 1997 and December 2000, the final three and a half years of President Bill Clinton’s presidency. Calling 17 years ago ""many decades"" ago is an exaggeration. The University of Michigan data shows a similar pattern. In the most recent month for which there is data, November 2017, the rating was 98.5. The last time the rating exceeded that level was a one-time blip in January 2004. Prior to that, the index exceeded today’s level for almost four years under Clinton, from February 1997 to November 2000. (It fell below today’s level for one month during that period, October 1998.) Business confidence The survey data of business confidence generally provides weaker evidence for Trump’s assertion. There are several major surveys of CEO confidence. One by the Conference Board was at 63 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The index under Obama equaled or exceeded that on five occasions. A different survey, by the Business Roundtable, had the CEO economic outlook index at 96.8 in the fourth quarter of 2017. But the index was higher in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first two quarters of 2011. Another group, the Institute for Supply Management, surveys purchasing executives at some 300 companies on a monthly basis. The number for December was 59.7. The most recent time the index was that high was (briefly) in 2011, under Obama. Finally, YPO is an organization of 24,000 CEOs that publishes studies of business confidence around the world. The index exceeded the most recent rate under Trump nine times during Obama’s presidency. Here is the data for its survey of the United States since 2009: Manufacturing confidence This is the topic where Trump has the strongest argument. The current National Association of Manufacturers’ Outlook Survey is currently at its highest level since it was created in 1997. Our ruling Trump said, ""Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades."" In general, all three types of economic confidence are at relatively high levels today. However, it’s a stretch to say that they are ""the highest they have been in many decades."" Consumer confidence exceeded today’s level less than 20 years ago, and in several surveys, business confidence exceeded today’s level as recently as the Obama years.

"['State Budget', 'Illinois', 'Bruce Rauner']","
Rauner’s dubious balanced budget claims … again
","The Illinois Constitution requires Gov. Bruce Rauner to draw up a budget plan each year that is balanced. But a wide range of fiscal experts agree he didn’t do it in 2015 after taking office. He didn’t do it in 2016. He didn’t do it last year either, even though he claimed otherwise. Indeed, the budget Rauner proposed last year was so clearly billions of dollars out of whack that, when he presented it to the General Assembly last March, PolitiFact Illinois handed the governor the lowest possible Pants on Fire! credibility rating for contending it was in balance. So we were puzzled when Rauner on Monday declared to the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board: ""I have introduced balanced budgets every year that I’ve been governor."" Rauner followed that on Wednesday during his annual State of the State speech to lawmakers in Springfield with a declaration that unintentionally drew a boisterous round of sarcastic cackling from Democrats in the chamber. ""I will submit a balanced budget proposal next month,"" Rauner said, pausing a couple of beats before adding, ""Again."" Rauner’s budget proposal for the next fiscal year is still under wraps, so it’s too early to judge whether available revenue will align with expenditures as required by law. But his persistence in arguing that his past budgets were all balanced, despite broad and convincing evidence to the contrary, inspired us to take another look. Appearing at a mini-debate before the Tribune’s editorial board, Rauner was pressed about his budgeting by his Republican primary challenger, state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton. The incumbent protested that he’d proposed balanced budgets every year. That prompted us to ask the governor’s office if anything had changed in the last year since PolitiFact deemed his claim absurd. A spokesperson emailed back: ""Year after year, Governor Rauner has introduced balanced budgets, along with the reforms needed to save taxpayer dollars and put Illinois back on a firm fiscal footing and, year after year, he has been met with resistance from those more comfortable with the status quo. The Governor will continue to push for balanced budgets, pension reform, cutting regulatory red tape, reforms to make our jobs climate competitive, and spending reductions so that Illinois can grow again."" In short, Rauner’s office avoided a direct answer to the question we posed. The statement does, however, further a factually challenged narrative that the governor often repeats. There’s history here. Critics say Rauner’s balanced budget boast which earned him a Pants on Fire! in 2017 was no anomaly. ""He has never introduced a balanced budget,"" said Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a Chicago-based think tank partly funded by labor unions. ""What he has put out there doesn’t even rise to smoke and mirrors."" Martire said the same air of unreality applies to Rauner’s latest statements on the budget. ""Maybe in a place where they have unicorns?"" Martire said. Last year, in panning Rauner’s claim about his 2017 budget, PolitiFact pointed to some stark numbers that didn’t add up. ""Democratic opponents have suggested Rauner’s plan is $4.6 billion to $7 billion out of balance,"" PolitiFact wrote then. Much of that might have been dismissed as the product of partisan sniping, except for one suspect entry in Rauner’s budget in which he penciled in $4.57 billion in savings for what was described in vague terms as ""working together on a grand bargain."" The ""bargain"" in question depended on lawmakers hammering out a broad compromise on a range of spending and ancillary issues including contentious topics like workers’ compensation and tax reform. Rauner ultimately sank the package by withholding support even though he factored its approval into his budget calculations. While the ""grand bargain"" itself never materialized, attempts at reaching it evolved into a bipartisan effort in the Legislature to break an historic budget stalemate that lasted a total of two years. Last summer, a handful of Republicans crossed the aisle to help override Rauner’s veto of a spending plan authored by Democrats. After PolitiFact bestowed a Pants on Fire! on Rauner’s earlier budget claim, new information came to light that only served to underscore the rating. In the budget blueprint he proposed last year, Rauner called for creation of a 401(k) style savings plan for newly hired public school teachers and public workers. He estimated that would slice $500 million in savings off the state’s pension costs for fiscal 2018, which began last July 1. Despite the budgetary feuding, the Democratic budget included the 401(k) plan Rauner had asked for. Even so, an investigation by the Better Government Association later raised doubts that any savings from the new retirement program would materialize before 2019 at the earliest. Ironically, Rauner in vetoing the Democrats’ budget faulted them for counting on the same $500 million in savings that he had included in his own spending plan months earlier. Head spinners like that have provided ample fodder for those in Springfield who question Rauner’s credibility when it comes to budget matters. Prominent among the critics is Democratic state Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who issued this statement following the governor’s State of the State address: ""We just heard Governor Rauner's re-election speech. Now he has 14 days to deliver a balanced budget that doesn’t involve pixie dust and magic beans."" Rauner last year earned PolitiFact’s Pants on Fire! rating for his claim that a state budget he proposed was balanced. Indeed, fiscal experts say Rauner has never proposed a balanced budget as required under the state Constitution since taking office in 2015. All facts to the contrary, Rauner repeated a similar claim this week during an appearance at the Chicago Tribune. ""I have introduced balanced budgets every year that I’ve been governor,"" Rauner said. Aides to the governor filibustered when we asked them to back up his latest statement. A year ago, PolitiFact called Rauner out on his balanced budget claim. His most recent comment is equally outrageous. Once again, we rate it Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2018/feb/02/bruce-rauner/rauners-dubious-balanced-budget-claims-again/

How legal immigrants to U.S. break down by 'chain migration,' diversity-refugees-asylum and work
","President Donald Trump drew boos when he said during his first State of the Union address that under what Republicans call ""chain migration"" -- and Democrats refer to as family reunification -- a ""single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives."" PolitiFact National rated his claim Mostly False. Lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can petition for a spouse and unmarried children to come to the United States; and U.S. citizens can also petition for married children, parents and siblings. But neither permanent residents nor citizens can directly petition for an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent. Nevertheless, Trump’s remark underscores a broader claim made by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on the ways in which legal immigrants enter the United States. Johnson’s claim is different than Trump’s, but helps provide a clearer picture of the sources of legal immigration. Johnson’s claim On Jan. 12, 2018, more than two weeks before the State of the Union, Johnson was interviewed about immigration on Wisconsin Public Television’s ""Here and Now"" show. He said he wants to limit ""the abuse of chain migration"" and then made a four-part statistical claim, telling host Frederica Freyberg: From my standpoint, we have got to start closing the loopholes created by bad law, bad legal precedent that incentivize people to come to this country illegally. We have to limit ""chain migration"" to a common-sense level. Right now, Frederica, we let about 1.1 million people in this country legally -- in terms of permanent, legal residence -- every year. Sixty-five percent of that is some kind of ""chain migration""; 22 percent is diversity lottery, ""asyling"" and refugees. Only about 14, 15 percent has anything to do with work. That is a crazy system, when you have literally millions -- probably hundreds of millions of people want to come to this country -- we can’t assimilate all those people. We’ve got to limit and we’ve got to limit it on a merit-based system. So, we’ve got to fix our system. Chain migration, Johnson continued, ""allows an immigrant to allow in their parents, their children -- but what ends up happening is, it does chain, where those people can bring in their children, their parents; and all of a sudden, one individual and you’ve got cousins and adult children and adult siblings -- that’s what we need to limit to something that just makes common sense."" As we’ll see, three parts of Johnson’s four-part claim are essentially on target. But a major part of his claim -- saying that 65 percent of legal immigration is through ""chain migration"" -- is misleading. Johnson’s breakdown To back Johnson’s claim, his office cited data from from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security yearbook of immigration statistics. The first part of his claim, on the total number of legal immigrants -- 1.18 million in 2016 -- is correct. As for the other three parts, here are figures for 2016, the latest year available, based on how Johnson breaks down legal immigrants: ""Chain migration"" 804,793 -- 68% Diversity lottery, refugees, asylees and other 240,819 -- 20% Work-related 137,893 -- 12% (Diversity lottery allocates visas to individuals from countries with historically low rates of immigration to U.S.; a refugee is a person outside his or her country of nationality who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution; an asylee is a person who meets the definition of refugee and is already present in the United States or is seeking admission at a port of entry.) So, Johnson’s claim -- based on the way he breaks down immigration groups -- is within several percentage points on the second and third categories for 2016. Moreover, those two percentages have been roughly stable for years, experts told us. But his reference to ""chain migration"" -- a relatively new term in the Washington lexicon that the New York Times says has been ""weaponized"" to sway public opinion -- is misleading in alluding to the immigration of extended-family members. Individuals in that category are admitted to the United States based on family relationships, as opposed to the other two categories Johnson cites. But in round numbers, only 120,000 of the 800,000 immigrants that Johnson lists as ""chain migration"" were not the spouses, children or parents, according to Stephen Legomsky, a Washington University law professor emeritus and immigration law specialist. That means extended-family members, based on Johnson’s categories, make up only 10 percent of the 1.18 million total legal immigrants. Syracuse University political science professor Elizabeth Cohen, whose specialties include immigration, told us: This idea that an immigrant receives a visa and all of a sudden five or 10 close and distant relatives are being pulled in on a chain is completely unrepresentative of how our immigration system actually works.
  Our rating Johnson says about 1.1 million people legally enter the U.S. each year as permanent residents -- ""65 percent of that is some kind of chain migration; 22 percent is diversity lottery, ‘asyling,’ refugees; only about 14, 15 percent has anything to do with work."" He’s correct on the total number, and his breakdown of two of the categories is essentially on target.   But to say that 65 percent come through ""chain migration"" -- which typically refers to the extended-family members of an immigrant in the United States -- is misleading. The vast majority of individuals in that group are spouses, children or parents, not more distant relatives. Johnson’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.   Related fact check: Would Trump bill have kept his grandfather and Melania from immigrating to U.S.?

Trump's State of the Union ratings are not the highest in history
","Television ratings have long been a fixation for former reality TV star President Donald Trump, so it’s no wonder he shined a spotlight on the ratings for his first State of the Union. ""Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in. Delivered from the heart!"" Trump tweeted on Feb. 1, 2018. Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in. Delivered from the heart! Trump exaggerated crowd sizes before, so we wondered whether ratings backed up his latest boast. His claim about Fox News holds up, but not so much for total State of the Union viewership. The Nielsen Company, the primary collector of television ratings data, indeed reported that 45.6 million Americans above the age of 2 tuned into the president’s address across 12 networks between 9 and 10:30 p.m. That wasn’t a record, though. Trump came in sixth in total State of the Union viewers since Nielsen began collecting the data in 1993. George W. Bush garnered 62 million viewers in 2003; Bill Clinton 53 million in 1998; W. Bush 51.8 million in 2002; Obama 48 million in 2010; and Clinton 45.8 million in 1994. The ranking is even lower when we also count first addresses to the Joint Sessions of Congress. That’s the first-term equivalent of the State of the Union, but the president is assumed to be too new to describe how the nation is faring. Including those addresses, Trump’s State of the Union ranks ninth, outdone by his own first address to the Joint Sessions of Congress, which had 47.7 million viewers. Clinton ranks first with 66.9 viewers in 1993, and Obama’s 2009 address had 53.2 million viewers. When we asked about the ""highest number in history,"" the White House said Trump had been talking about cable news history. That works only if we exclude Trump’s Joint Address to Congress in 2017 and only include the three major cable networks (CNN, Fox News Network and MSNBC) dating back to 2001, when all three aired the address. Nielsen does not track State of the Union viewership from cable and broadcast networks separately, so we tallied up ratings for the major networks across the years. That wasn’t clear in the tweet, however, as the 45.6 million people encompassed watchers of both cable and broadcast networks. Fox News had an average of 11.5 million viewers between 9 and 10:30 p.m., according to Nielsen. Using the same data set, Fox reported 11.7 million viewers between 9:15 to 10:30 p.m. (The speech ran from 9:09 to 10:30 p.m.) That was a record high for Fox News during a State of the Union speech. It came in second for a presidential address to Congress only to Trump’s Address to the Joint Sessions of Congress last year. Fox indeed beat out the other major networks, as Trump claimed. CNN raked in 3.1 million viewers and MSNBC had 2.7 million viewers during the State of the Union. ABC delivered 5.4 million viewers, NBC 7.1 million, CBS 7 million and FOX 3.6 million, according to Nielsen. If, as the White House explained, Trump was talking only about cable news networks, that wasn’t the first time Fox News beat out the other cable networks during a State of the Union address. While the time stamps vary slightly for each network, Fox beat out CNN and MSNBC every year according to Nielsen, save for 2016. Trump said ""45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in."" 45.6 million people watched Trump’s State of the Union, but that wasn’t the highest number in history. Five other State of the Union speeches raked in more viewers, and eight other presidential addresses to joint sessions of Congress did, too. If we only look at cable news airings of the State of the Union among the major networks, this year indeed raked in the highest numbers. That wasn’t clear in the tweet. Fox News delivered 11.7 million viewers for the duration of the president’s speech, give or take a few minutes. It beat every other network airing the speech. That wasn’t a first, though, as the network’s ratings have consistently beaten other cable providers’ during the event. Given the misleading nature of the first statement, and the accuracy of the second, we rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/feb/01/donald-trump/trump-state-union-ratings-not-highest-history/

Texas ranks No. 1 in feral hogs. It's not home to 75 percent of nation's wild pigs.
","Texas happens to be home to most of the nation’s feral pigs, according to a publication focused on farmers and ranchers in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Southwest Farm Press declared in a January 2018 news story that while 39 states have reported wild pig problems, ""Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state — an estimated 50 percent to 75 percent of all feral swine in the nation."" Really all of that for Texas by its lonesome? We wondered. Texas No. 1 in feral hogs? From our previous feral-hog investigations, we already suspected that Texas, with its vast open spaces and habitat-friendly Gulf Coast, was home to more of the pesky animals than any other state. Our attempts to verify that part of the publication’s claim led us to a South Carolina expert, Jack Mayer, Ph.D., who responded by emailing us his 2014 paper finding Texas to be home to the most wild hogs. According to the paper, 99 percent of U.S. wild pigs live in 10 states: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. ""As an individual state, Texas had the largest numbers,"" the paper says, accounting for 30 percent (1.8 million) up to 41 percent (3.4 million) of the nation’s total depending on which estimates are chosen. States with the next-most feral hogs, the paper suggests, were Georgia and Florida. Then again, there’s at least one other way to judge population differences. In that vein, we adjusted the average estimate of feral hogs in each of the 10 high-hog states for the state’s 2014 human population. By this metric, Oklahoma led with nearly 13 hogs per 100 residents with Texas landing fifth with a little under 10 hogs per 100 residents. Up to three in four feral hogs live in Texas? We separately asked Southwest Farm Press the basis of its finding that Texas was home to ""50 percent to 75 percent"" of U.S. feral hogs. By email, Eric Braun responded with an explanation attributed to the story’s author, Logan Hawkes. ""Fair question, tough topic,"" Hawkes wrote, adding that every count offered of feral hogs is an estimate. Hawkes specified that he reached his finding that 50 percent to 75 percent of U.S. feral hogs reside in Texas drawing on information from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Texas A&M Agrilife Extension Service. Hawkes said that ""if the U.S. population is estimated as much as 6 million feral swine (USDA-APHIS), and the Texas population is as much as an estimated 4 million feral swine (Texas Agrilife), then I believe  my percentage would be on target. If we take the lower estimated figures instead of the highest, then that percentage would, of course, be less. Again, the range is wide and all numbers are estimated. I should have pointed that out in retrospect."" Braun pointed out that Gail Keirn of the APHIS National Wildlife Research Center was quoted in February 2017 saying that there are likely between 5 million and 6 million invasive wild pigs in at least 35 states. More recently, Braun noted, the inspection service has said the national count exceeds 6 million. Per feral pigs in Texas, Braun pointed out that Texas Agrilife said in a 2012 report that Texas was home to 1 million to 4 million feral hogs. Counting Texas feral hogs But that 2012 report, we found, presents the described estimate of 1 million to 4 million feral hogs in Texas (in the past tense) before declaring a lower estimate. The report initially states: ""Often, the number of feral hogs are reported from 1 to 4 million in Texas. These estimates are not based on scientific studies."" But the authors subsequently describe their efforts to gauge feral hog concentrations in different parts of Texas and to adjust for suitable hog habitats before reaching their own estimate.  ""By multiplying the density estimate to the total potential suitable feral hog habitat,"" the report says, ""we estimated the number of feral hogs statewide to be between 1.8 and 3.4 million, with the average being 2.6 million."" We also connected with the USDA’s Keirn, who agreed by email that Texas has one of the country’s largest ""feral swine populations."" Yet Keirn said the state’s share of U.S. feral hogs probably runs closer to 30 percent to 50 percent. Nationally, Keirn told us, the feral hog population is ""currently estimated at over 6 million and is rapidly expanding. Range expansion over the last few decades is due to a variety of factors including their adaptability to a variety of climates and conditions, translocation by humans and a lack of natural predators."" Keirn similarly noted the 2012 Texas report suggesting an average of 2.6 million feral hogs statewide while she said that the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department estimates there are more than 1.5 million feral swine in the state. ""The accurate estimation of wildlife populations is difficult and requires considerable investment of resources and time,"" Keirn wrote. When we reached out to TPWD about its hog estimate, Steve Lightfoot responded by emailing us a September 2017 document presenting 42 feral hog questions and answers written by a Texas A&M professor emeritus, Billy Higginbotham. The document says there are no U.S. estimates of the feral hog population based on scientific data but guesstimates suggest a national population of 8 million to 9 million. In Texas, the document says, ""we estimate 2.6 million head based on several population studies."" Another Higginbotham answer says a Texas A&M AgriLife Extension survey of landowners made in 2010 ""estimated that we are removing approximately 761,000 pigs from our 2.6 million population annually, which accounts for only 29% of the population. We estimate that in Texas we need to be removing 66% of the wild pigs annually just to hold the population steady."" We asked Higginbotham about the accuracy of the Southwest Farm Press claim. By email, he replied that it’s most likely that feral hogs in Texas comprise 20 percent to no more than 33 percent of the U.S. population. Mayer, the South Carolina expert, later advised by phone that he’s part of a research team drawing on improved hog-density research to devise fresh counts. As of 1982, Mayer said, a little more than half the nation’s feral hogs resided in Texas. Mayer said the team’s yet-to-be completed paper will say that in 2016, some 2.5 million Texas feral hogs accounted for nearly 37 percent of 6.9 million U.S. feral hogs. Texas’s reduced share, Mayer said, can be attributed to hog populations surging elsewhere. We shared some of what we’d gleaned about U.S. feral hogs in Texas with Southwest Farm Press. By email, Braun replied that its story would be corrected. The story was shortly amended to say: ""Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state — an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation, according to USDA.""   Our ruling The publication said: ""Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state — an estimated 50 percent to 75 percent of all feral swine in the nation."" Texas remains home to the most feral hogs, we confirmed, though several states topped by Oklahoma lately have more hogs per 100 residents. It looks otherwise like Texas accounts for about one third of the nation’s feral swine--considerably short of 50 percent to 75 percent. We rate this since-modified claim Half True.

Fake story says Democrats booed families of MS13 victims at State of the Union
","A bogus story on Facebook claims that Democrats booed during the recent State of the Union address when President Donald Trump addressed introduced the families of teenagers who were killed by MS-13 gang members on Long Island. Democrats ""booed families of children murdered by MS13,"" said a Jan. 30 headline by CSC Mediagroup.USA. ""This just goes to show that Democrats would rather support illegals who cause harm to Americans rather than support actual American citizens. What does this say about them? They’re DemocRATS."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that video of Trump’s speech showed a bipartisan chamber stood up and applauded the victims’ parents. Trump invited the parents of Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens, two teenage girls from Long Island, to listen to his speech. The girls were murdered in September 2016 while walking together in their hometown. Members of the MS-13 gang have been charged with their murders, including some who were illegal immigrants. We listened to and watched videos of Trump’s speech to examine the chamber’s reaction. Just before he introduced the girls’ parents, Trump made a statement about illegal immigrants that drew an audible hiss from some members. (Listen around minute 43:30) ""For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives."" But then when Trump spoke to the girls’ parents, the chamber sounded silent. Speaking to the girls’ parents, Trump said: ""Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand,"" he said, as the parents then stood. ""Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you."" The videos show that members stood up and applauded the girls’ parents. Some Democrats did boo and hiss a separate part of Trump’s speech about immigration when he called for an end to ""chain migration."" ""Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives,"" Trump said. Many Democrats brought to the speech as their guests Dreamers, people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The future fate of Dreamers is up in the air following Trump’s decision announced last year to end an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. CSC Mediagroup.USA’s disclaimer proclaims that it isn’t fake news and that it publishes news from a conservative perspective that the mainstream media ignores.

Rep. Paul Gosar asks police to arrest illegal immigrants at State of the Union
","A Republican representative from Arizona contacted law enforcement in response to reports that Democrats planned to bring Dreamers, immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union.

The fate of Dreamers, which played a role in the January federal government shutdown, appears uncertain. In September, Trump announced that he was ending Obama’s program that temporarily deferred deportation for certain illegal immigrants, prompting talks about how to come up with a permanent solution. A White House framework would offer a path to citizenship over 12 years in exchange for $25 billion for the border wall and other improvements, but members of both parties have raised objections. Gosar, who was first elected to his Arizona district in 2010, received an A+ from NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for lower levels of immigration. Gosar posted a few tweets from his U.S. House account at 1:33 p.m. Jan. 30, hours before Trump’s State of the Union address: ""Today, Congressman Paul Gosar contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asking they consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance.

Following Joe Kennedy's speech, Breitbart says Fall River, Mass. not built by immigrants
","In his Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III talked about the immigrant roots of a city in his Boston-area district. ""We are here in Fall River, Massachusetts, a proud American city,"" Kennedy said, speaking from a vocational technical high school. ""An American city built by immigrants."" Breitbart, a conservative website formerly run by Steve Bannon who served as Trump’s strategist, fired back at Kennedy’s description of the city. ""No, Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants,' "" stated the headline. ""Fact-Check: Mostly False."" We decided to do a fact-check of our own of Breitbart’s claim. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found the Breitbart story glosses over the role of immigrants in the city’s history. As evidence, Breitbart wrote that Fall River was established in the 1600s by English settlers ""who were not ‘immigrants’ but colonists."" Breitbart wrote that a native-born family, the Bordens, ran a mill in what became the town before and after the American Revolutionary War. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Breitbart said that immigrants arrived at the end of the 19th century. Breitbart has a point that English settlers arrived before other immigrant groups, but when the town truly took off due to the textile mills, it was waves of immigrant labor that fueled the growth. We interviewed Bridgewater State University professor Philip Silvia who wrote his dissertation on local history, The Spindle City: Labor, Politics and Religion in Fall River (1870-1905). Silvia has taught courses on Fall River’s immigrant and labor history. Fall River was settled by English immigrants in the 1600s when few people lived in the area, Silvia said. But ultimately, ""it attracted immigrants like no other place,"" Silvia said. Fall River became prominent in the 19th century when textile factories were constructed. The mills drew various waves of immigrants from different nationalities, including the English and the Irish. Fall River incorporated as a town in 1803 and as a city in 1854. The real surge occurred after the Civil War when Fall River became the pre-eminent textile city in the United States, fueling a massive influx of immigrant workers. A gigantic wave came from French Canada, the largest immigrant group for decades. ""Technically one could argue it wasn’t immigrants supplying the capital who built the mills, but without workers, the mills would not have succeeded as they did,"" Silvia said. Breitbart pointed to immigrant statistics in 1910 and wrote that immigrants ""never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak."" But Silvia, who wrote his dissertation on the topic, said that by 1875, more than half of the population was foreign born. By the 1870s, three-quarters of the mill population were immigrants and that population climbed even higher. Eventually immigrants included those who were Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Jewish and Scottish. Later waves came from Vietnam and Cambodia. Around 1900, there were 18 ethnic groups in the city. ""It is an immigrant city,"" he said. Kennedy’s spokesman pointed to an article by the local newspaper that covers Fall River, The Herald News, documenting visible signs around the city that show its immigrant history. ""From the Fabergé egg-shaped bell towers of St. Anne’s Church to the Portuguese bakeries that line Columbia Street, Fall River would not be Fall River without its immigrants...,"" stated the newspaper following Breitbart’s article about Kennedy’s speech. ""Fall River’s notable churches and many of its landmarks were built by the people who began arriving on its streets in the mid-19th century from Ireland, Canada, Italy, Lebanon, Poland and Portugal, and in recent years from Brazil, Syria, Haiti, Cambodia and elsewhere."" As of 2016, about 18 percent of the city’s population of 90,000 is foreign born, according to the U.S. Census. We attempted to reach Breitbart and did not get a reply. Breitbart wrote that, ""Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants.' "" English settlers first established Fall River in the 1600s when it was sparsely populated. But Breitbart gives short shrift to the role waves of immigrants played in growing the community as it turned into a prominent textile city in the 1800s.

New York consistently ranks low for voter turnout
","Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the top-ranking Democrat in the New York State Senate, claimed New York state has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the country. New York state, which has the fourth most registered voters among states, historically does not have high voter turnouts, the Westchester Democrat said. ""New York consistently ranks as one of the worst voting turnout states in the nation,"" Stewart-Cousins said. Democrats in the Senate want Republicans, who control the chamber, to support legislation they believe would increase turnout. More than a dozen bills introduced by Stewart-Cousins and other Democrats would allow automatic voter registration and early voting among other changes. Is voter turnout really as bad in New York state as Stewart-Cousins said? Presidential election years In the November 2016 election, New York state had the eighth-worst voter turnout among states, when 57.2 percent of voting-age citizens went to the polls, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures. Before 2016, New York state has ranked in the bottom half of states for voter turnout in all but one election during the last two decades, according to the census figures. The state ranked 29th in voter turnout among states in the 1996 presidential election. Some years have been better than others, but the state’s turnout has mostly declined since then. 2000: New York state ranked 35th in voter turnout at 59 percent. 2004: The state ranked 42nd, but the turnout rate increased that year to 60.2 percent. 2008: Turnout dropped to 58.8 percent. The state ranked 43rd that year. 2012: The state ranked 39th with a turnout rate of 58.7 percent. The state has also ranked poorly in most non-presidential election years, when turnout is generally lower in all states.  1998: New York state ranked 23rd among states, its best ranking in the past two decades with a turnout rate of 48.2 percent. 2002: The ranking went down to 39th with a turnout rate of 43.6 percent. 2006: The state ranked 45th at 42.5 percent. 2010: New York state ranked 37th at 43.6 percent. 2014: Turnout dipped to 34.4 percent. New York state ranked 48th. Except for 2014, the state’s voter turnout rate has not varied much between four-year periods. Rates for other low-turnout states have shifted New York state’s ranking each year. Turnout in Georgia, for example, has increased from about 51 percent in 1996 to 60 percent in 2016. Other data Election data experts also rank New York state near the bottom of states for voter turnout. The United States Election Project, with election numbers dating back to 1980, ranked New York state 14th lowest in voter turnout in 2016. The project uses different methodology than the Census Bureau to calculate turnout, according to Dr. Michael McDonald, the University of Florida professor who created and manages its database. The Census Bureau tracks turnout rates based on self-reporting from people in each state. McDonald, instead, uses the total population of eligible voters in each state drawn from administrative records. He then compares that population with the number of votes for the highest office on the ballot each year. New York state ranked in the bottom 10 states for voter turnout in all but two elections over the last decade, according to McDonald’s numbers. Our ruling Stewart-Cousins said ""New York consistently ranks as one of the worst voting turnout states in the nation.""

Family members or law enforcement officials could ask for such an order for those they believe to be a danger to themselves or others. Kavanagh said his bill would make New York state an even safer place to live. But is he right that the state already ranks third lowest in gun-caused deaths? Data on gun deaths The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks firearm mortality by state each year. The data includes suicides, homicides and accidental gun deaths. New York state reported that 4.4 of every 100,000 residents died from gun-related causes in 2016. Only Rhode Island and Massachusetts had lower rates. Massachusetts was lowest, with 3.4 gun-related deaths for every 100,000 residents. Alaska had the highest gun death rate, with 23.3 of every 100,000 people dying from gun-related causes in 2016. New York state reported 900 gun deaths in 2016, the 17th highest number in the country. Texas had the most, with 3,353 such deaths. What’s in the data? More than half of those who died from gun-related causes in New York state took their own life in 2016. The state reported 490 suicides. That said, New York had the third-lowest rate of suicidal gun deaths  -- 2.5 for every 100,000 residents. Montana had 15.5 suicide gun deaths for every 100,000 residents, the highest in the country. New York state ranked higher in gun homicides. About two out of every 100,000 people were killed by a firearm assault in New York state in 2016. Seven states had lower rates, and six other states had so few gun homicides that the CDC considered their calculated death rates unreliable. Our ruling Kavanagh said ""New York has the third-lowest rate of gun-caused death in America."" Government figures confirm Kavanagh’s claim.

Do downstate NY residents contribute more in income tax than upstate?
","More than two-thirds of income tax collected by New York state comes from downstate residents, the state’s budget chief said. ""The reality is that 70 percent of the income tax that the state collects happens to come from Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk and New York City,"" state Budget Director Robert Mujica said in a radio interview. Mujica was defending a proposal to overhaul the state’s tax code that would primarily benefit the state’s high-income earners. Many of the earners live in New York City and its suburban counties. Is Mujica right that 70 percent of the state’s income tax revenue comes from the New York City area? In context State lawmakers are considering several options to respond to the new federal tax code’s cap on state and local tax deductions. The new federal law caps those deductions at $10,000. One proposal would shift state income tax from the employee to the employer. Businesses and corporations can still deduct state and local taxes without a cap under the new tax law. The employee would no longer pay a state income tax, but the employer would take on a new, deductible tax. The shift would be voluntary. If a business did not want to make the change, it could choose not to do so. The proposal would primarily benefit residents with higher incomes who could no longer deduct their full income tax. Data  The state collected more than $47.5 billion in income taxes in the last fiscal year, according to the state Division of Budget. About $19.2 billion, or 40 percent, came from New York City residents alone. Those in Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk counties paid $12.1 billion in state income taxes. The total for those in New York City and the three counties came to $31.3 billion, or 66 percent of the state total. Another $7.8 billion came from non-residents who commuted into New York state for work. Most of those filers worked in New York City, according to a spokesperson from the agency. If you add the revenue from non-residents to that of New York City, Westchester, and Long Island filers, the share increases to 82 percent of the state total. The New York City region’s high share of income tax revenue shouldn’t come as a surprise, considering its population. Close to 12.3 million people live in New York City, Westchester and on Long Island. That counts for about 62 percent of the state’s total population. Residents in upstate counties, meanwhile, paid close to $8.4 billion in income taxes, or about 18 percent of the state total.

Are college basketball graduation rates at an all-time high, as John Calipari said?
","College basketball has been in the midst of soul-searching since federal investigators uncovered an alleged black market for top high school prospects and college players. The federal probe into bribery and corruption, which led to 10 arrests in 2017, raised fresh questions about a system where young men generate billions in television and marketing revenues but are prohibited from being paid. The NCAA — college sports’ regulatory body — has long maintained that compensating players would undermine its goal of placing education ahead of athletics. ""In the collegiate model of sports,"" the NCAA states, ""the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first, athletes second."" In theory here’s the basic bargain: College athletes, especially Division I football and men’s basketball players, collectively form a highly profitable commercial enterprise, and in exchange they receive a quality education. In a recent interview, John Calipari, who coaches the powerhouse University of Kentucky men’s basketball team, defended the NCAA model by emphasizing that student-athletes are earning college degrees at historically high rates. ""I go back to this: We have the highest graduation rate of basketball players in the history of the NCAA,"" Calipari said during a Jan. 20 broadcast of ESPN's College Gameday. ""We have the highest graduation rate of African-American basketball players in the history of the NCAA in basketball."" The NCAA's official numbers back up Calipari's claim, but those numbers are manipulated to make graduation rates appear more positive. Meanwhile, a debate rages about whether college basketball players get a quality education from the current system, or if academics for big-time athletes are a distant priority. One of the ways the NCAA monitors the academic outcomes of college athletes is by looking at the graduation data colleges report each year to the federal government. In general, a graduation rate is found by taking the number of graduates in a cohort and dividing it by the total number of students in that cohort. The federal graduation rate for the 2014-17 cohort of Division I men’s basketball players is 47 percent, according to the NCAA’s 2017 report. That’s just shy of the 48 percent rate of the 2001-04 cohort. The NCAA did not respond to our request for a broad sample of its federal dataset. But we found six NCAA reports of Division I men’s basketball graduation rates from the last 14 years. The eight years for which we were unable to find data are left blank in the chart below.  According to the available data, the rate appears to have been stagnant for some time. It’s also not the highest it’s ever been. An aide to Calipari indicated that the coach based his claim on a different measurement known as the ""graduation success rate"" — an alternative formula developed by the NCAA. The NCAA’s model differs significantly from the federal graduation rate, and paints a sharply contrasting portrait of student-athletes’ academic achievement. Specifically, the two measurements take very different approaches to students who leave school before graduating. Under the federal formula, when a student leaves college for any reason they are counted negatively against a school’s graduation rate. That’s the case even if the student ultimately transfers and graduates from another college. The NCAA has long complained the federal calculation understates the true graduation rate of athletes, and that it takes an overly rigid approach to its handling of transfer students. ""It only measures persistence at a student’s first school when approximately one-third of all students nationwide transfer at some point in college,"" said Meghan Durham, an assistant director of public and media relations at the NCAA. The NCAA’s formula makes an entirely different accounting of students who leave school before graduating.    Student-athletes who leave in poor academic standing (typically below a 2.0 grade-point average) are counted negatively against a school’s graduation rate. But players who leave school in good academic standing are simply removed from the NCAA’s graduation rate calculation. Because of their good academic standing, this latter group is considered still eligible to play college sports at the time they leave school, hence they’re referred to as ""left eligibles"" in NCAA parlance. In effect, when left eligibles depart college for any number of reasons — whether to pursue an NBA career, or because they were cut from a team and lost their scholarship — the NCAA simply drops them from their graduation rate tally. ""They are treated as neither a success nor a failure but rather as if they were never in that school’s cohort,"" reads an NCAA explainer titled ""Why the GSR is a Better Methodology."" For its part, the NCAA says its treatment of left eligibles is fair. According to the NCAA’s estimate, the vast majority end up transferring elsewhere.  But watchdogs note the NCAA does not track left eligibles after they leave school, so their academic outcomes are unknown, including the number of college dropouts who never graduate. While the NCAA does include incoming transfers in its graduation rate, this number is consistently far below the number who leave. ""Thus, the NCAA system is not held accountable for a significant number of recruited athletes,""  wrote the authors of a recent article titled ""The Hoax of NCAA Graduation Rates."" ""Even for those included in the GSR cohort as transfers, the original recruiting school is absolved of responsibility for failing to retain them."" Using its alternative measure, the NCAA’s rates are currently at all-time highs for Division I men's basketball (82 percent) and African-American players in particular (78 percent), since this accounting method was introduced in 2002.   ""In the sport of men’s basketball, the overall rate increased 2 percentage points to 82 percent. The rates for African-American student-athletes in the sport rose 1 percentage points to 78,"" the NCAA wrote in its latest graduation trends report. ""Both of these rates represent all-time highs."" Woody Eckard, an economics professor at the University of Colorado Denver and an expert on student-athlete graduation data, said the steep climb of the NCAA’s rate could be the result of more left eligibles, instead of an actual graduation rate increase. But so long as the NCAA's data is not publically available, he said, this hypothesis cannot be tested. Eckard said both the federal and NCAA models have a flawed approach to players who leave before graduating. The federal rate understates the true graduation rate, because it effectively assumes none of the athletes who leave school before graduating will transfer and graduate from another school. But the NCAA’s formula makes the opposite error, he said. ""The federal rate undershoots, and the NCAA’s rate overshoots,"" he said. ""The truth lies somewhere in the middle, between the two."" Richard Southall heads up the University of South Carolina’s College Sport Research Institute, one of the more vocal critics of the NCAA’s graduation success rate. He contends the NCAA inflates graduation rates by removing left eligibles, or ""eligible dropouts,"" from its calculation. ""If you remove all the eligible dropouts, who else is left in your athlete graduation cohort? Really those who make it to their senior year,"" Southall said. ""If the sample — after removing these eligible-dropouts/transfers — only includes athletes who make it to their senior year, then the ‘graduation success rate’ really measures how many athletes left school ineligible or flunked out, which should not be very many."" Eckard and Southall are among several NCAA critics who say the graduation success rate was engineered to deflect public scrutiny of consistently low federal graduation rates among Division I football and men’s basketball players. In 1984, for example, the graduation rate of men’s basketball overall was 38 percent, and 29 percent for African-American male players, which clashed with the NCAA’s preferred image as an institution with a dedicated educational mission. ""Athletes were increasingly viewed as commercial chattel, whose value was based on their ability to produce revenue for universities and provide entertainment for fans,"" Eckard, Southall and Gerry Gurney of the University of Oklahoma wrote in their article ""The Hoax of NCAA Graduation Rates."" In response to mounting pressure, the authors argue, the NCAA launched a decades-long rebranding strategy to discredit federal graduation rates while holding up its own graduation success rate as a superior methodology. ""More likely, however, the NCAA’s rates are ‘alternative facts’ (i.e., propaganda) designed to obfuscate its members’ exploitation of their most valuable assets: big-time football and men’s basketball players, and deflect attention from a shameful litany of academic-fraud scandals,"" the authors wrote. The College Sport Research Institute proposed its own model for tracking the academic outcomes of student-athletes. Their formula is based on federal data, but differs from the federal graduation rate in one significant way. The federal formula lumps together full-time students and part-time students. This causes trouble when comparing the graduation rate of the student body as a whole to that of a cohort of student-athletes, because virtually all athletes are full-time students. Take the NCAA’s latest report on Division I graduation trends, for example. It suggests black male basketball players graduated at a 9 percent higher rate than the African-American male student population at large. But the College Sport Research Institute’s formula paints a very different picture. Their calculation, known as the adjusted graduation gap, filters out part-time students, which they say allows a more accurate comparison of full-time students to their full-time student-athlete peers. While this data doesn’t exactly contradict the NCAA, it certainly tells another story. The institute’s most recent data shows graduation rates for men’s Division I basketball players lag behind those of full-time male students, with African-American players showing substantial gaps. In major conferences, the full-time all-male graduation rate was 78 percent. The rate for African-Americans was 41 percent, a 37 percentage point gap. (Major conferences include the American Athletic, Atlantic 10, Atlantic Coast, Big 12, Big East, Big Ten, Conference USA, Mountain West, Pacific-12, and Southeastern conferences.) Southall said the biggest gaps exist at schools in the ""Power Five"" conferences (the Atlantic Coast, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and Southeastern ), which he described as the ""premier academic and athletic conferences."" He noted that it’s easy to overlook that athletes in big-time sports programs are essentially working full-time jobs — spending 40 hours a week or more on their sport — while also trying to go to school full-time at rigorous academic universities. ""The NCAA was aware of the problem in the late 1980s,"" Southall said. ""But instead of addressing the problem, they created the ‘graduation success rate’ to rebrand academic success."" Critics say a singular focus on graduation rates masks serious concerns about the quality of education players receive. Mark S. Nagel, a professor of sport and entertainment at the University of South Carolina, said schools with big-time sports programs commonly make less rigorous classes available to athletes. ""To keep the athlete’s mind focused almost exclusively on sports, easier classes and majors are selected, and ‘friendly faculty’ are targeted,"" Nagel said. ""There is no doubt that in the age of ‘graduation means everything,’ many schools have ‘easy’ paths to graduate."" Academic advisers are often assigned to make sure athletes who play on revenue-generating teams remain eligible, and in some cases advising turns into ""doing the work for the athlete,"" said Nagel, who is an associate director at the College Sport Research Institute. ""Most advisers are not evaluated by the post-college enrollment outcomes for former players; they are evaluated on if the current athletes are eligible to compete,"" he said. ""In theory, having these academic resources for athletes is helpful, but it can easily spin out of control."" At the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, for example, around 1,500 athletes were enrolled in and got credit for so-called ""phantom classes"" between 1993 and 2011. According to a report the university released in 2014 following an internal review, the classes ""had played a large role in keeping underprepared and/or unmotivated players eligible to play."" When schools funnel athletes into easier majors and classes in order to keep them eligible, their graduation rates exaggerate the educational value their athletes received, said Eckard of University of Colorado Denver. ""I worked in college athletics for years and many ‘graduated’ without requisite skills and many could barely read — but they stayed eligible,"" said B. David Ridpath, professor of sports business at Ohio University. ""Eligibility is not education."" Ridpath is a member of the Drake Group, an NCAA watchdog, which has called on big-time sports programs to disclose student-athletes’ entrance exam scores, majors, professors, advisers and post-graduation employment. ""Considering most institutions guard these things like state secrets and claim privacy, I don’t think what Calipari is saying is remotely close to the truth,"" Ridpath said. Not everyone believes academic skullduggery at big-time sports schools is a problem, at least when it comes to college athletes bound for the pros. ""Some students, especially elite athletes, are not interested in an education,"" said Warren K. Zola, a professor at Boston College University and sports law expert. ""Rather, they use the NCAA or their institution as a means by which they can play in the NBA."" ""If one accepts the premise that the purpose of college is to help students enter the workforce,"" he added, ""then students who play for one year and then progress into the NBA could be considered a success."" But a relatively small share of college athletes end up going pro. Some argue that to the extent there’s exploitation in college basketball, the vast majority of cases cut in favor of schools and against players, particularly African-Americans. ""It’s simple,"" said Victor Kidd, a doctoral student who works with Southall and Nagel at the University of South Carolina. ""Black players are being taken advantage of. Period."" Maureen Weston, co-director of the Entertainment Media & Sports Law Program and a law professor at Pepperdine University, said schools are under intense pressure to track grades, academic progress and graduation success rates. But she believes most schools are diligent about educating student-athletes, even if some fall short. ""My experience with student athletes in the classroom is excellent,"" she said. ""I’m convinced the discipline it takes to excel at sports transfers to the classroom in most cases."" ""But the pressures to win and meet standards with jobs and funding on the line can cause  temptations to fudge numbers,"" she added. Calipari said, ""I go back to this: We have the highest graduation rate of basketball players in the history of the NCAA. We have the highest graduation rate of African-American basketball players in the history of the NCAA in basketball."" According to available data, the federal graduation rate appears to have been stagnant for some time. It’s also not the highest it’s ever been. The NCAA’s own formula shows remarkable growth in graduation rates since 2002 when its metric was introduced. Indeed, under the NCAA’s measure, graduation rates are at an all-time high. However, experts we spoke to believe these numbers are exaggerated. Some believe the growth is due to an increase in transfer students, not a higher rate of graduates. For context, we looked at an independent metric that compares the graduation rates of full-time men’s Division I basketball players to those of other full-time students. Under this measure, student-athletes graduate at lower rates, and have lost ground to their non-athlete counterparts since 2011. Critics also note that an overemphasis on athletes’ graduation rates as a mark of academic achievement masks serious concerns about the quality of education players receive. We rate this claim Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2018/feb/01/john-calipari/college-basketball-graduation-rate-all-time-high-j/
"['History', 'Florida', 'Kionne McGhee']","
Did slaves help build the Old Capitol building in Tallahassee?
","Rep. Kionne McGhee, D-Miami, offered an emotional speech about the role slavery played in Florida’s history as the Florida House prepared to vote on a slavery memorial at the Capitol. McGhee, the bill’s sponsor, referred to a mural in the House chamber that depicts a slave woman holding a bushel of cotton near Andrew Jackson, the state’s military governor who would later become president. ""Because her lips were sealed, I will attempt to do justice,"" McGhee said. ""You see, if she were able to talk on this day, she would tell us that in 1824, the slaves from Gadsden (County) came here, on this capitol complex some 200 yards away to clear the field."" ""She would also tell us that just behind us, there were slaves in 1845 who helped construct and build the Old Capitol, as we call it, that’s what she would tell us,"" McGhee said. The Florida House voted unanimously for HB 67, the companion of which has not yet been considered by the full Senate. If approved, the slave memorial would join other Capitol Complex monuments honoring fallen police officers, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Civil War soldiers from Leon County, among other structures. We wanted to take a look at McGhee’s claim that enslaved people helped build the ""Old Capitol."" (We have previously found slaves helped build the White House in Washington.) We found very little documentation about enslaved people building the Old Capitol, but history experts said it was very likely they helped build it, given the large role slaves played in Florida at the time. McGhee’s team said the claim can be found in The Old Capitol: The Florida Center of Political History and Governance, an informational pamphlet compiled by Museum of Florida History staff to accompany the opening of a new exhibit. The booklet said that the Old Capitol was ""built in part"" by enslaved people, but does not say anything else about its construction. Florida commissioners picked Tallahassee as the capital in 1824, between two existing governmental centers — Pensacola and St. Augustine. The building that came to be known as the ""Old Capitol"" was completed in 1845, just before Florida was admitted as the 27th state. The Florida Capitol Complex we know today includes the Old Capitol, plus House and Senate office buildings, and the 22-story building sometimes called the ""New Capitol."" We asked the Florida Historic Capitol Museum, the Museum of Florida History and the Florida Department of State for additional information about the pamphlet McGhee cited, but came up empty-handed.   The Florida Historic Capitol Museum has a webpage dedicated to the Old Capitol, but it does not mention anything about slave labor. (Rachel Porter, the director of research and programming at the museum, collected the information for McGhee’s claim.) Every expert we spoke to said that slave labor was integral to every aspect of Florida in the 19th century. However, specific records about slaves’ contributions often went unrecorded, as slave owners rarely disclosed the extent of their labor. ""The fact that there is only a cursory mention of enslaved Africans building the Capitol is not unusual,"" said Larry Rivers, a distinguished history professor at Florida A&M University. ""Enslaved Africans were regarded, like in other antebellum southern states, as objects to be simply worked until they died."" According to Census information from 1840, Richard A. Shine, the supervising architect and primary contractor for building the Old Capitol, was listed as a slave owner. Andrew Frank, associate history professor at Florida State University, said Shine was known to have used slaves on other projects in Tallahassee or to have hired out some of them as manual or skilled laborers. Frank added that Shine’s son, Richard Shire Jr., later described himself as an ""auctioneer"" or slave trader. ""They, like most residents in what was known as Middle Florida, were deeply invested (financially and socially) in slavery,"" he said. Edward E. Baptist, a history professor at Cornell University who has written a book about slavery in Florida, said almost every building in pre-1865 Tallahassee was built at least in part with slave labor. ""It would in fact be shocking if the Old Capitol was not built with enslaved labor,"" Baptist said. ""Artisans like white carpenters and masons owned slave laborers and craftsmen."" McGhee said enslaved people ""helped construct and build the Old Capitol."" African-American slaves were part of almost every facet of Florida life in the 19th century. Historians said they did all possible work in Florida, which would have included the building McGhee referenced.  However, we were unable to find conclusive documentation about the construction of the Capitol building. Without that certainty, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/feb/01/kionne-mcghee/did-slaves-help-build-old-capitol-building-tallaha/

Donald Trump inflates Apple investment
","In his State of the Union address, President Donald Trump led off with the economy, and he drew particular attention to the recently passed tax law. ""Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses,"" Trump said. ""And it’s getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers."" A number of readers asked us to take a closer look at his claim about Apple, so we did. We can see where Trump got his number. Under the headline ""Apple accelerates US investment and job creation,""  Apple announced on Jan. 17 a series of initiatives to bolster its position in the United States. ""Combining new investments and Apple’s current pace of spending with domestic suppliers and manufacturers — an estimated $55 billion for 2018 — Apple’s direct contribution to the U.S. economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years,"" the statement said. Notice that Apple did not say it plans to invest $350 billion. It described its ""direct contribution to the U.S. economy."" Charles Lee, accounting professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, told us the distinction is huge. ""Apple certainly did not just announce it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America,"" Lee said. ""This is a statement about its importance to the U.S. economy, not a statement about its new investments due to the tax law change."" So what did Apple’s press release actually say? It said its purchases from other companies will be large -- about $55 billion in 2018. Lee said if that number didn’t grow, Apple would spend about $275 billion over five years. But that’s ""pre-planned,"" Lee said. It’s the cost of doing business and doesn’t represent new investment. If it isn’t an investment in expansion, such as building new facilities, buildings and data centers, that brings the investment total down to $75 billion. But even that figure is too high. Apple wrote the $75 billion includes expected ""repatriation tax payments of approximately $38 billion."" The new tax law offers a lower tax rate for companies that move profits off the books of their overseas subsidiaries and put them on their domestic balance sheets. Not only is paying Uncle Sam not an investment, Lee cautioned that it doesn’t even mean that Apple is doing anything with those overseas profits immediately. ""It simply means they are pre-paying the taxes on that cash right now to take advantage of the lower rates,"" Lee said. ""This ensures Apple will not need to pay any more taxes when, if ever, they decide to bring the cash back."" After subtracting the taxes, Lee said ""My best estimate of the change in Apple's U.S. investments attributable to the new laws is at most $37 billion."" It could be a few billion less. In a section called ""Growing Apple's U.S. operations,"" the company wrote that it ""expects to invest over $30 billion in capital expenditures in the U.S. over the next five years and create over 20,000 new jobs through hiring at existing campuses and opening a new one."" In addition, it will add $4 billion to an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, an Apple program that helps finance American and foreign companies to expand in America. That adds up to $34 billion over five years. Trump said that Apple said it will invest $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000 workers. Trump got the new hires figure right, but Apple’s own announcement doesn’t back him up on the investment dollars. After deducting the costs of paying suppliers and paying taxes, an accounting professor estimated the investment at no more than $37 billion. And based on the press release, it could be $34 billion. That’s still a lot of money, but it’s less than 10 percent of what Trump said. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2018/jan/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-inflates-apple-investment/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump's misleading claim about chain migration, unlimited sponsorship of distant relatives
","President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address called for tighter control of legal immigration and for an end to ""chain migration."" ""Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives,"" Trump said Jan. 30. ""Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children."" The White House did not respond on the record for this fact-check, but it appears that Trump meant a distant relative is anyone who is not a spouse or minor child (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services defines ""child"" as being unmarried and under 21 years old). Neither U.S. citizens nor lawful permanent residents can directly petition for an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent to come to the United States. Theoretically, one immigrant’s arrival in the United States could lead to the immigration of an aunt or uncle — if the first immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen and petitioned a parent, that parent could eventually become a U.S. citizen and petition his or her siblings. But there is a long queue for certain relatives seeking to come through family sponsorship. For brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, the waiting period for a visa is over 13 years. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can bring certain family members to the United States to live here permanently. But there are restrictions. No one can directly petition for an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent, according to USCIS. Green card holders can petition for a spouse and unmarried children, including unmarried sons and daughters 21 and over. Sponsorship categories expand for U.S. citizens, who can also petition for married children. Sons and daughters of U.S. citizens can include their own children in the petition. If a U.S. citizen is over 21 years old, he or she also can sponsor parents, brothers and sisters to come here on a green card. Additionally, U.S. citizens can also sponsor a fiance or fiancee to come on a nonimmigrant visa, and eventually file for a green card after marriage. Unmarried, under 21-year-old children of a fiance, fiancee or spouse of a U.S. citizen can also be admitted on nonimmigrant visas and later adjust their status. If an immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen, he or she can sponsor a parent. If that parent eventually becomes a U.S. citizen, he or she could sponsor a brother or sister (the aunt or uncle of the original immigrant), noted Steven Camarota, director of research for Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low immigration levels. ""You could see that as indirect sponsorship of aunts and uncles,"" Camarota said. Indirect sponsorship is theoretically possible, but would take a long time, said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013. An immigrant would first have to become a naturalized citizen — an option available after being a permanent resident for at least five years. As a naturalized citizen, an immigrant can petition for siblings, and the siblings could bring in their spouses and unmarried children. But there are limits on the number of visas issued per year per family category. More than 3.9 million people were in line for a visa as of Nov. 1, 2017, according to the U.S. State Department. Brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens fall under a ""fourth-preference"" category, which had 2.3 million people waiting for a visa — the wait period is over 13 years for immigrants from most nations, but even longer for some countries with heavy demand, such as Mexico and the Philippines. Siblings in the Philippines would have to wait at least 23 years for a visa, and Mexican siblings at least 20 years. ""As a practical matter, because of these long backlogs there is not as much chain migration as President Trump claims,"" said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School. Trump said ""a single immigrant can bring in unlimited numbers of distant relatives."" Trump’s team did not go on the record to identify who Trump considered to be ""distant relatives,"" but it appears he’s referring to anyone who is not a spouse or minor child. Green card holders can sponsor a spouse and unmarried children, including unmarried sons and daughters over 21 years old. For U.S. citizens, the categories expand to include parents, married children, brothers and sisters. No one can directly petition an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent. But theoretically, one immigrant’s arrival in the United States could lead to the immigration of an aunt or uncle — if the first immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen and petitioned a parent, that parent could eventually become a U.S. citizen and petition his or her siblings. Still, there are numerical limits on visas issued per year per family category. For some relatives, the wait period for a visa is over 13 years.

Scott Walker's overstated attack on governor rival Paul Soglin over business and murder in Madison
","Republican Scott Walker, aiming to smack down the latest Democrat seeking to deny him a third term as governor, got off to an early start in attacking Madison Mayor Paul Soglin. At 6:41 a.m. on Jan. 10, 2018, the day Soglin announced his candidacy, Walker tweeted: The last thing we need is more Madison in our lives. @Paulsoglin is the latest extreme liberal who wants to take our state backward -- just like he did in Madison, where businesses have left and murders have gone up. We want to go forward. The capital city is generally known for having economic vitality and relative safety. So, let’s check the attack: Walker is claiming that in Madison, businesses have left and murders have gone up, and that Soglin is at least partly to blame. (We’ll note: The Wisconsin Republican Party unveiled an anti-Soglin website the same day and made an attack on Soglin similar to Walker’s.) Businesses leaving To back the first part of Walker’s statement, his campaign cited to us two large employers that left the city: 1. Spectrum Brands, the owner of Rayovac, Remington and other consumer product lines, announced in 2012 it was moving its headquarters and more than 500 employees from Madison to Middleton, a suburb. Soglin complained that Spectrum Brands didn’t give Madison a chance to bid on keeping the company in the city. The company said its Madison facility was outdated and not energy efficient, and that it did consider sites in Madison. The company also said the cost savings --  along with a $4 million award from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., a state agency under Walker -- ""were substantial enough to shelve plans to move"" to Florida. 2. Heinz Kraft, the parent company of Oscar Mayer, announced in 2015 it would shut down its 1,000-employee Oscar Mayer plant in Madison. Kraft Heinz said the decision was part of a plan to close seven factories in the United States and Canada, following its merger with Oscar Mayer. State Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, a Republican, pointed a finger of blame at Soglin, while Soglin criticized the Economic Development Corp. for not trying to keep the plant in Madison after learning that other states were trying to get the Wisconsin facilities. Walker’s campaign also pointed to criticism of Soglin over Oscar Mayer by former Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz. But Cieslewicz concluded that the company’s decision to close the plant ""almost certainly couldn’t have been headed off by state or local efforts, even if officials knew it was coming. This appears to be a straightforward business decision that had to do with changes in the industry and the configuration of the aging plant here."" So, based on news reports of the companies’ own statements, it’s not clear how much of a role, if any, Soglin played in the companies’ decisions. Moreover, Walker didn’t provide any evidence that the two cases are anything more than isolated examples. We thought it was important to look at the number of businesses in Madison overall. Finding those numbers isn’t as simple as it might appear. These entities don’t count businesses at the City of Madison level: the state departments of Workforce Development and Financial Institutions; the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and the Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce; and three federal bodies -- the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The best count we could find is from the City of Madison assessor’s office, which tracks business that are subject to what is known as the personal property tax, but is only paid by businesses, based on their equipment and furnishings. (Utilities and manufacturers are excluded from the counts.) Business in Madison, per city assessor counts 2011 (Soglin takes office in April) 4,700 2012 5,095 2013 4,791 2014 4,949 2015 4,701 2016 4,704 2017 4,847 So, the figures indicate the number of businesses has gone up and down during Soglin’s tenure, but there are more now than when he took office. In other words, it isn’t a picture of a net loss in businesses. Murders in Madison Homicide in Madison is uncommon enough that, to the best of the Madison Police Department’s knowledge, the number has been in the single-digits in every year but one. So, even one or two incidents could cause an increase in a given year. In contrast, although Milwaukee’s population is only about 2.4 times larger than Madison’s (595,000 to roughly 252,000), it had more than 11 times as many homicides (124) in 2017. Here’s a look at the numbers: Homicides in Madison Year Number of homicides 2011 (Soglin took office in April) 7 2012 3 2013 5 2014 5 2015 6 2016 8 2017 11 So, the number of murders in 2016 and 2017 was higher than in every other year during Soglin’s tenure. In fact, the 11 in 2017 is a record for the city. Like many mayors, Soglin has sometimes clashed with his police chief over police staffing. And policing certainly is one factor in homicides. But criminologists say many other factors are involved. Northeastern University professor of criminology, law and public policy James Alan Fox told us Soglin can’t be singled out for blame, saying: As is common for jurisdictions that tend to have fewer than a dozen homicides a year, there is a substantial volatility in the homicide counts that have little to do with any policy or practice. Such factors as whether a gunshot victim is struck in a vital organ or not, and how quickly an assault victim is brought to the hospital for emergency treatment, can impact whether a crime is a homicide or an aggravated assault. (Police policies and staffing could affect homicides), however, staffing levels have little impact on many forms of homicide. And whatever impact there is, it is hard to connect that with an increase of a few homicides. Said Rick Rosenfeld, a criminology and criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis: These numbers are simply too low to draw meaningful conclusions about an increase, not to mention assigning ""blame."" Homicide counts will vary one year to the next simply because a bullet hits or misses a vital organ. Social scientists refer to such variation as measurement error.  The Madison numbers are well within expected measurement error of this sort.
  Our rating Walker says Soglin took Madison backward -- ""businesses have left and murders have gone up."" There are, of course, examples of businesses having left Madison, but the total number of businesses appears to be higher now than when Soglin took office. As for murders, they increased by two in 2016 and by three in 2017, hitting a record high of 11. But the two large companies cited by Walker that pulled out of Madison cited business reasons, not Soglin, for leaving. And while a mayor can play some role in combating homicides, primarily through a police department, there are many factors that lead to murder. Walker’s statement contains an element of truth but is overbroad. We rate it Mostly False. div class='artembed'>",/factchecks/2018/jan/31/scott-walker/scott-walkers-overstated-attack-governor-rival-pau/
