How Biden’s Keystone XL pipeline executive order affects American jobs
","President Joe Biden spent his first day in the White House signing a spate of executive orders aimed at undoing the policies of the Trump administration. One of them sparked outrage on Facebook over its effect on American jobs. On Jan. 20, Biden signed an order that revoked the permit for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. In a Facebook post published the same day, one user said the move would cost thousands of jobs. ""By revoking the Keystone pipeline permit, Biden is destroying 11,000 jobs and roughly $2 billion in wages,"" the post says. ""Democrats couldn’t even get through Day 1 without killing jobs for middle class Americans."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We’ve seen several similar posts offer other figures for how many jobs were lost as a result of Biden’s executive order, ranging from 12,000 to 83,000. So we wanted to take a closer look. (Screenshot from Facebook) TC Energy Corp., the Canadian company that owns the Keystone XL pipeline with the Alberta government, has said more than 1,000 people are out of work because of Biden’s executive order. The 11,000 and $2 billion figures cited in the Facebook post are estimates published by the company, but most of the jobs would be temporary. We reached out to the user who published the post for their evidence, but we didn’t hear back. The Keystone XL pipeline is an international project years in the making. Without support from the U.S. government, it’s effectively halted. The 875-mile pipeline would carry a heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries. Biden’s order revokes the permit that was granted March 29, 2019, by then-President Donald Trump on the grounds that it is harmful to the environment. While an 11-volume State Department report on the Keystone XL pipeline found in 2014 that it would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution, critics say the project threatens Alberta’s rivers and forests. And the project has become a symbol for the political debate over fossil fuels.  The Obama-era State Department had denied TC Energy’s request for a permit in 2015. Trump revived hopes for the project once he took office, ultimately approving it with an executive order. Construction began in April 2020, but that same month, a federal court said that the project had to go through a full endangered species review. TC Energy appealed the ruling, but the Supreme Court upheld it in July. Before Biden signed his executive order, only a 1.2-mile section of the pipeline had been completed in Montana near the U.S.-Canada border. Over the past several years, we’ve fact-checked many claims that the Keystone XL pipeline would create thousands of American jobs. Several of them lack context about the duration and nature of these positions, and this Facebook post is similar. In a Jan. 20 statement, TC Energy said Biden’s order ""would directly lead to the layoff of thousands of union workers."" It did not specify exactly how many jobs would be lost.  President Richard Prior told the Associated Press that the layoffs would number more than 1,000. We reached out to TC Energy for more information, but we haven’t heard back. The 11,000 figure in the Facebook post appears to stem from an Oct. 28 press release on the pipeline’s website. In October, TC Energy awarded contracts to six American union contractors to build the Keystone XL pipeline in three states in 2021. Those contractors were ""responsible for hiring 7,000 union workers."" RELATED: Keystone XL pipeline: Unbuilt, opposed by Biden, mired in lawsuits ""When combined with additional 2021 contracts to be announced later, the total number of American union workers constructing Keystone XL in 2021 will exceed 8,000 and $900 million in gross wages,"" the release said. ""In total, Keystone XL is expected to employ more than 11,000 Americans in 2021, creating more than $1.6 billion in gross wages."" That’s close to what the State Department found in its 2014 report. In the report, the agency wrote that 10,400 estimated positions would be for seasonal construction work lasting four to eight-month periods. Since the State Department defines ""job"" as ""one position that is filled for 1 year,"" that would equate to approximately 3,900 jobs over a two-year period.  In short: Most of the estimated jobs were temporary. The State Department forecasted that no more than 50 jobs, some of which could be located in Canada, would be required to maintain the pipeline. Thirty-five of them would be permanent, while 15 would be temporary contractors. We reached out to the White House for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. A Facebook post says that Biden’s executive order revoking the Keystone XL pipeline ""is destroying 11,000 jobs.""  That number is an estimate, and the claim lacks context about the longevity of Keystone jobs. TC Energy said more than 1,000 people are out of work because of Biden’s executive order. In October, the company said it expected to employ more than 11,000 Americans in 2021 and generate more than $1.6 billion in gross wages.  But both TC Energy and the State Department have said the majority of those jobs would be temporary. A 2014 report found that the company would need only 50 employees to maintain the Keystone XL pipeline once it’s finished, 35 of them permanent. Temporary jobs are still jobs. But this post could leave the wrong impression without full context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2021/jan/21/facebook-posts/how-bidens-executive-order-halting-keystone-xl-pip/

No, military tribunals didn’t start on Jan. 20
","On Jan. 20, President Joe Biden was sworn into office.

Raphael Warnock, Jon Ossoff and Alex Padilla.  And that night, an Inauguration Day special starring singers like Bruce Springsteen that was hosted by Tom Hanks aired on several networks.  Followers of QAnon, a vast and baseless conspiracy theory with many tentacles, have preached about the military tribunals where a cabal of pedophiles then-President Donald was supposedly fighting would finally be punished.   But after Trump boarded Air Force One for Florida and no tribunals materialized, some QAnon adherents started to grapple with the falsehoods they had come to believe.  The events widely broadcast on Jan. 20 were a presidential inauguration ceremony and a musical special, not a tribunal.  We rate the claim Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2021/jan/21/facebook-posts/no-military-tribunals-didnt-start-jan-20/

On Inauguration Day, Rush Limbaugh falsely claims Joe Biden didn’t ‘legitimately’ win
","President Joe Biden was inaugurated Jan. 20, putting to rest his predecessor’s months-long effort to overturn what national, state and local officials affirmed was a free and fair election. Biden’s inauguration came two weeks after Congress counted and certified the electoral votes despite a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters storming the U.S. Capitol to disrupt the process.  But as Biden began his work in the White House, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh pushed ahead with the false narrative that Biden’s election was illegitimate. ""With 74 million, maybe 80 million people who did not vote for Joe Biden, there is no way they can honestly say to themselves that they represent the power base of the country,"" Limbaugh told his millions of listeners Jan. 20. ""They're going to have to take it. They're going to have to hold on to it and never let go of it. They have not legitimately won it."" Limbaugh, whom Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2020, did not respond to a request for comment. He argued on his radio show that the heavy security presence and hundreds of thousands of flags lining the National Mall in place of a celebratory crowd were ""replacements for people"" because Biden’s camp was not ""confident a bunch of people would show up.""  Limbaugh also posited that Biden had too little support to welcome a large Inauguration Day crowd because ""nobody showed up at Joe Biden political rallies.""  In reality, the small, socially distanced inauguration crowd was a reflection of the pandemic that has killed more than 400,000 Americans. And the National Guard was summoned in large numbers to prevent a repeat of the Capitol riot that led to Trump’s impeachment a week earlier. Biden’s campaign events, too, were often deliberately kept small due to concern about the coronavirus, which spreads easily in big crowds. Finally, Limbaugh claimed the election was ""arranged rather than legitimately sought and won,"" and he said Biden was ""credibly accused of winning"" thanks to ""massive election fraud.""  PolitiFact has examined many such claims and rated them Pants on Fire. The presidential election was not unusually close. Biden, the former vice president, won 306 electoral votes, compared with 232 for Trump. He received 81 million votes overall to Trump’s 74 million. ""Joe Biden legitimately won the presidency,"" said Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine. ""There is no credible evidence to the contrary, that any state in the Union wrongly reported its election results or had election irregularities that called the results into question. There was no massive voter fraud."" Trump refused for months to concede defeat, even as dozens of judges in courtrooms across the country rejected lawsuits from his campaign and allies to flip the results. The challenges failed in part because they did not present evidence of the widespread fraud that was alleged. Some states held recounts, but the results did not change. After states certified their results, the nation’s electors cast their ballots and sealed Biden’s victory in December. State and local election officials, including in key swing states like Georgia, maintained that the results they certified were accurate. International observers said they saw no evidence of fraud, and so did Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr. Trump’s most senior cybersecurity official said the election was the ""most secure in American history."" PolitiFact fact-checked a wide array of claims alleging election fraud. We found no evidence to suggest that Biden did not win ""legitimately,"" as Limbaugh claimed.

Biden took a private plane to his inauguration. He’s still the legitimate president
","Joe Biden was duly sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Jan. 20, despite false claims that the outgoing administration formulated a scheme with the military that would have kept Donald Trump as president for another four years. Many who believed these QAnon conspiracies have realized the so-called ""storm"" was never coming. But on social media, some are still trying to hold on to the baseless conspiracy theory in the face of evidence that shows otherwise. One post shared widely on Facebook claims that Biden took a private jet to Washington D.C. for his inauguration, an indication, the post says, that Biden is not the legitimate president and that the military will soon take over the government. ""That’s why they didn’t send a government plane for the President-Elect,"" the lengthy post says, ""because they know he is not a legitimate President and, once he was sworn in, the government became illegitimate (belligerent) and the military is now responsible for restoring legitimate civilian government."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden is in fact, the legitimate president, and the military is not taking over the government. Biden, once a devoted Amtrak commuter, originally planned to travel to Washington by train from Delaware, but that plan changed when it was deemed too great a security risk. So he took a private jet, which was also a break from tradition.  Usually the outgoing administration provides a government plane to bring the president-elect to Washington for the inauguration. Trump, who refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory until early January, opted to not attend the inauguration, becoming the first outgoing president in more than a century to skip the event. We reached out to the White House, but couldn’t confirm whether the Trump administration offered to provide transportation to the Bidens. CNN reported that ""a source familiar with the matter"" said the government didn’t offer the Bidens a plane, but did not provide further details.  Regardless, Biden’s form of travel has nothing to do with the legitimacy of his presidency.

Checking Pat Toomey’s claim that families with ‘six-figure incomes’ would get thousands under plan
","Sen. Pat Toomey this week criticized President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, saying the direct payments Biden wants to send Americans are poorly targeted to those most in need.  ""There will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who’ve had no income interruption whatsoever,"" Toomey (R., Pa.) said Tuesday during a Senate confirmation hearing for Janet Yellen, Biden’s nominee for Treasury secretary.  We wondered just how much such families will receive if Biden’s plan is signed into law.  Toomey is right. Married couples making up to $150,000 annually would qualify for $2,800 in new payments, on top of the $1,200 they should have received this month from the relief package then-President Donald Trump signed into law late last year.  Together, those payments would total $2,000 per person — the target Democrats in Congress set, Trump made a late and unsuccessful push for, and that Biden is now pursuing from the White House.  Individuals making up to $75,000 would qualify for $1,400 in new aid on top of the $600 payments they just got. And adults with dependent children ages 16 and younger would qualify for an additional $600 per child.  Analysts estimate this component of Biden’s plan could cost $465 billion.  During the Senate Finance Committee hearing, which took place the day before Biden’s inauguration, Toomey argued against direct payments for upper middle class families who haven’t endured any loss of income during the pandemic.  Yellen acknowledged the payments aren’t designed to target the people hurting the most, but rather intended to support families and stimulate the economy broadly.  ""Some families presumably don’t greatly need the money, but there are many families who are under stress,"" Yellen told Toomey.  The eligibility criteria for direct payments under Biden’s plan mirrors the one Congress agreed to a few weeks ago, which set the upper income limit for the smallest payments at $174,000 for a married couple.  Toomey told Yellen it would be tough to find bipartisan support for Biden’s proposal, but several Senate Republicans have already endorsed the idea, including Marco Rubio of Florida, Josh Hawley of Missouri, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.  Democrats were first to pitch the idea of $2,000 per person direct payments, but it was Trump who made a late push for them in December, threatening to withhold his support for the relief package unless the payments were included. He eventually relented and signed the package into law without the larger payments.  Toomey said families with six-figure incomes who’ve had no income interruption will get several thousand dollars in payments under Biden’s coronavirus relief package. That’s right. Couples who make up to $150,000 annually will get $2,800, plus $600 for each child age 16 and under, on top of payments received from the last relief package.

In attacking Paris accord, Texas oil regulator selectively cites economic numbers
","Wayne Christian is fed up with environmentalists and what he described as the ""woke"" liberal policies threatening to disrupt the smooth recovery of Texas’ energy sector from pandemic blows.  The Republican oil and gas regulator, one of three commissioners of the Texas Railroad Commission, penned a missive earlier this month that took aim at those who've recently cast Texas natural gas in a bad light — the French government for cutting ties with a Houston company over environmental concerns, the ""sensationalist fake-news media"" for downplaying improvements in emissions, and the ""environmental extremists"" for promoting Green New Deal policies. In the letter, posted to the agency’s website on Jan. 5, Christian took a swipe at President Joe Biden’s pledge to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, which he fulfilled on his first day in office by executive order. Former President Donald Trump withdrew in 2017 from the international treaty, designed to reduce carbon emissions, although terms of the agreement stipulated that the U.S. could not formally exit until Nov. 4, 2020.  ""This would be a tremendous mistake,"" Christian wrote. ""The accord carries sky-high costs with very low benefits and unfairly imposes a double standard based on unproven assumptions and climate models that are wrong nearly all the time.""  Then Christian pointed to a 2017 study released by an economic research firm on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Council for Capital Formation, a pro-business think tank on economic policy.  ""The cost of the Paris Climate Accord to the American economy is steep. The agreement will cost American workers 6.5 million jobs and $3 trillion in economic growth by 2040,"" Christian wrote, citing the 2017 study.  The study, entitled ""Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Regulations On the Industrial Sector,"" was also cited by Trump when justifying his decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.   ""The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that,"" Trump said in his 2017 announcement from the Rose Garden.  The bleak outlook sparked scrutiny over the figures. When the U.S. initially joined the accord in 2016, the Obama administration set long-term goals for reducing economy-wide emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2050. The administration listed a mix of existing and planned policies that would help the U.S. meet that goal, but reductions stemming from those policies would still fall short of the 2050 target.   Although there’s debate over how far short the policies would come, ""it is clear that such a gap cannot be filled without contributions from the industrial sector,"" reads the study, which was conducted by NERA Economic Consulting. The profit and job loss figures cited by Christian and Trump represent the economic cost of closing that gap according to NERA’s analysis.   Trump and Christian repeat the report’s findings accurately. More restrictions on fossil fuel emissions mean higher cost of production, and higher cost of production means the closure of uncompetitive manufacturing businesses, and those closures mean fewer manufacturing jobs. These losses and their knock-on effects beyond the manufacturing sector would amount to 1.1 million jobs lost by 2025 and 6.5 million by 2040, according to NERA.  The loss of jobs results in a corresponding decline in gross domestic product, with a loss of $250 billion by 2025 that accelerates to $3 trillion by 2040.   ""The decline in GDP accelerates over time as the targets become much more difficult to comply with and the targets start to constrain output in all sectors,"" the study says.  But the study’s authors note an important caveat to their key findings that Trump and Christian omit. Not only are the long-term projections subject to a great deal of uncertainty, they said, the study did not factor in all of the offsetting job gains and GDP growth associated with a clean tech transition.  In a news release following Trump’s announcement of U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement, NERA stated that ""the Trump administration selectively used results"" from its study.  ""NERA’s study was not a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris Agreement, nor does it purport to be one,"" their statement said. ""The objective of the study was to estimate the range of cost sensitivity associated with meeting deep U.S. emissions targets under alternative implementation approaches affecting U.S. industrial sectors. NERA’s study does not provide any recommendations regarding any specific international agreements.""  There’s a smattering of predictions for how climate action will create opportunities for economic growth. For instance, a 2018 report by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate — an economic policy initiative commissioned by seven countries in 2013 — says that the green transition could create $26 trillion in benefits across the global economy by 2030. And as new technologies accelerate the transition, new jobs could be created therewith.  For example, over a million Americans are employed in the fossil fuel sector while close to half that amount are employed in solar and wind, even though solar and wind comprise just 10% of the energy mix, according to the commission's report.   ""It is expected that reduced employment in fossil fuels through the transition can be more than offset by a rise in employment in renewables and construction,"" the study said.   Globally, the commission found that low-carbon jobs may employ up to 65 million people by 2030, which could offset employment reductions in declining sectors.   When asked about considering possible offsetting benefits in his criticism of the Paris accord, Christian only questioned the logic of eliminating existing energy jobs while subsidizing jobs in renewables. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, global direct subsidies to renewables are expected to increase from $166 billion in 2017 to $192 billion in 2030, while subsidies to fossil fuels fall from $447 billion to $165 billion over the same 13-year period.  ""I do not see a benefit in putting in place punitive policies that eliminate well-paying energy jobs and then using our taxpayer dollars to create new jobs through subsidizing other less efficient forms of energy,"" he said. Under the Paris accord, the U.S. committed to reducing emissions by about 25% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels. Biden’s move to rejoin the accord means that the U.S. must submit an emission reduction plan, although the details are not yet known.  ""Since our state makes up 40% of the nation's production, we will be disproportionately impacted compared to other states in terms of economic and job loss,"" Christian said.  The NERA report also doesn’t factor in the cost of climate-related disasters that, by most scientific accounts, are projected to increase in frequency as global temperatures rise. Over the past two decades, global climate-related disasters — primarily floods and storms — accounted for $2.3 trillion in damages, with the U.S. bearing the brunt of the economic losses, according to a report by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. Under a future scenario with limited or no emission reductions, these disasters are expected to worsen in severity and frequency, meaning that a business-as-usual response to climate change can cost the economy trillions.  ""Current economic models are deeply inadequate in capturing the opportunities of such a transformational shift, or the grave dangers of climate inaction,"" the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate study says. ""We need a new class of economic models that can capture the powerful dynamics at play, including technological advances, preservation of essential natural capital, and the full health benefits of cleaner air and a safer climate including the containment of pandemic diseases.""  Like Trump, Christian has been vocal skeptic of climate science. He was first elected to the Railroad Commission in 2016 having attracted endorsements and contributions from industry groups, energy companies and other state officials.   He’s repeatedly made arguments against global warming and its man-made causes, calling those who underscore future impacts of climate change ""climate catastrophists.""  ""These activists repeatedly imply that climate change is ‘settled science’ and that 97 percent of scientists agree that the main reason for global warming is manmade greenhouse gasses. However, real science is never ‘settled’ and 97 percent of scientists don’t agree. ... This is far from settled science,"" Christian wrote in a 2019 letter to Gov. Greg Abbott.  A 2016 survey of scientific studies found that 97% of actively publishing climate scientists agreed on the cause of global warming.  ""The vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists – 97 percent – agree that humans are causing global warming and climate change,"" according to NASA. ""Most of the leading science organizations around the world have issued public statements expressing this, including international and U.S. science academies, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a whole host of reputable scientific bodies around the world.""  Christian wrote in an open letter that reentry into the Paris Climate Accord will ""cost American workers 6.5 million jobs and $3 trillion in economic growth by 2040,"" accurately citing a study released in 2017 by NERA Economic Consulting.   Those figures were similarly referenced by Trump in justification of his decision to withdraw from the accord. After that announcement, authors of the study said the ""Trump administration selectively used results"" and failed to consider key limitations of their findings.   Christian similarly omitted these caveats.   We rate this claim Half True. ",/factchecks/2021/jan/21/wayne-christian/attacking-paris-accord-texas-oil-regulator-selecti/

Minimum wage increases and the myth of the $38 burrito
","President Joe Biden’s proposal for an $1.9 trillion economic rescue package calls for more than doubling the federal minimum wage, which was last raised over a decade ago. The plan has stirred up online chatter about the impact of a proposed $15-an-hour federal rate, with one conservative commentator warning that it would send prices soaring. ""If you want $15 minimum wage, don’t complain when your Taco Bell order costs $38 for a burrito,"" said Jordan Rachel, a Turning Point USA contributor, in a Jan. 16 tweet.  Business groups have long opposed sharply higher minimum wages on the grounds that they would hurt employment and raise consumer prices. But $38 for a burrito? That seemed like a hefty price at any restaurant, let alone a fast-food chain like Taco Bell, which still has several $1 items on its value menu. So PolitiFact decided to put Rachel’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We reached out to Turning Point USA and a spokesperson for Charlie Kirk, the organization’s founder, about Rachel’s claim, and we got no response. Soon after we sent our inquiries, Rachel’s tweet about Taco Bell disappeared from the platform.  We did, however, hear back from Taco Bell. The company, part of the Yum! Brands family of restaurant chains, told us that it already does business in places where local laws set a higher wage than the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum. In those places, burrito prices haven’t skyrocketed. ""Taco Bell and our franchisees have already adapted to many minimum wage increases on a local level, and we are committed to maintaining our leadership in value on a national level,"" Taco Bell said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""For example, at our company-owned restaurants in New York City, where the minimum wage is $15 an hour, our Bean Burrito is $1.89 plus tax and Crunchwrap Supreme is $4.49 plus tax."" Several economists we talked to described Rachel’s warning about $38 burritos as far from accurate and easily countered by evidence. ""A price of $38 is clearly absurd,"" said Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton University economist who has used the price of McDonald’s Big Mac sandwiches to compare wages worldwide. The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 per hour since 2009, but 29 states and Washington, D.C., have minimum wages above the federal level, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  Some cities and counties have already bumped their rates to $15 or higher. And a recent report from the National Employment Law Project said that by the end of 2021, 40 more cities and counties will have a minimum wage at or above $15 than at the end of 2020. Efforts to increase the federal rate have accelerated in recent years. The House in 1999 voted to raise the hourly minimum to $15 by 2025 — the bill stalled in the Senate — and Biden promised during his campaign to seek a $15 floor. That pledge made its way into Biden’s coronavirus relief proposal released Jan. 14. On Jan. 15, some 1,000 fast-food workers went on strike to protest low wages. They and other proponents of raising the minimum wage say doing so would lift low-income workers out of poverty, while opponents warn of hamstringing businesses and forcing layoffs. Prices at Taco Bell restaurants and other chains vary by location. And experts said it would be reasonable to expect increased prices with a bump to a $15 federal minimum wage. But Rachel’s warning of a $38 burrito isn’t supported by evidence. ""I can think of no economic justification that would lead to a prediction anywhere close to the estimate of a $38 Taco Bell burrito,"" said Steven Fazzari, a professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis. A simple way to gauge the potential impact on prices is to look at places where the minimum wage is already $15 or more per hour, experts said. Plenty of cities work as benchmarks, including New York, Washington, D.C., Seattle and San Francisco. In San Francisco, for example, the minimum wage is $16.07 per hour. But the burrito prices there are not much different from cities with lower minimum wages. Sometimes they’re the same. ""Some of Taco Bell’s most expensive burritos show no price difference whatsoever between places with very high and very low minimum wages,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, who called Rachel’s claim ""easily disproven."" Burtless compared prices for two different types of burritos at San Francisco’s 710 Third St. Taco Bell to prices for the same burritos at a Taco Bell in Alexandria, Va., where the state’s minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour, equal to the federal minimum.  In Alexandria, a Bean Burrito goes for $1.29, while a Burrito Supreme costs $4.19. At the San Francisco location, a Bean Burrito sells for $1.99, and a Burrito Supreme costs $4.19.  Two screenshots from Taco Bell's website show the prices listed for a Bean Burrito and a Burrito Supreme at Taco Bell locations in Alexandria, Va., and San Francisco, on Jan. 20, 2021.​ The most expensive burrito on the menu, the Crunchwrap Supreme, costs $4.19 in Alexandria and $4.49 in San Francisco, a difference of about 7%. ""We find absolutely no evidence that a higher minimum wage will boost Taco Bell burrito prices by anything that comes remotely close to 807%, the price increase implicitly predicted by Jordan Rachel,"" Burtless said. Bryan Stuart, an assistant professor of economics at George Washington University, said burrito prices in major cities like New York City and San Francisco likely represent ""an upper bound"" on the average burrito price if the federal minimum wage goes to $15. That’s because the price of a Taco Bell burrito depends on more than just worker salaries. ""The price of burritos depends on the cost of land, taxes, etc., and many of these costs are higher in cities that have a minimum wage at or above $15,"" Stuart said. Ashenfelter, the Princeton economist, said labor costs represent between 20% and 30% of the final consumer price. He said new research of his, on McDonald’s wages and Big Mac prices, estimated that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would raise Big Mac prices by 1.4%.  That suggests that Taco Bell burritos could cost more in some places under Biden’s proposal — which would increase the federal minimum by more than 100% — but nowhere near $38. Rachel said a $15-an-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38. This claim is countered by available evidence, including the current burrito prices at Taco Bell locations in cities and counties where a $15 minimum wage is in effect. Four economists characterized the claim as a far-off estimate at odds with economic theory.

Virginia is among the slowest states in vaccine rollout, as Cox says
","Del. Kirk Cox has been leading Republican criticism that Virginia is off to a slow start in getting COVID-19 vaccines into the arms of citizens. Cox laid the blame on outgoing Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam on Jan. 13 during the GOP response to Northam’s State of the Commonwealth speech. ""The Northam administration’s ability to distribute and administer vaccines has been extremely disappointing,"" Cox said. ""Ranking in the bottom third of states nationally, every state we border is doing a better job than Virginia in administering this life-saving vaccine."" Cox, from Colonial Heights, is a former speaker of the House who is seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination this year, and his criticism is likely to become a campaign issue. So we fact checked his claim about Virginia’s bottom-third ranking and found that he was being charitable in describing the roll out. The day Cox made his statement, Virginia ranked 39th among states in getting its allotted vaccine doses into people’s arms, according to Becker’s Hospital Review, a health systems website that, among many other things, analyzes data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since then, Virginia’s ranking has fallen. On Jan. 19, the latest date of CDC data available at this writing, Virginia ranked 48th. From the 853,000 vaccines distributed to the state, 327,000 shots were given - a 38.3% rate. The national rate was 50.4%. The two states trailing Virginia were Georgia and Alabama. North Dakota had the highest rate, using 82% of its allotted vaccines for shots. Northam’s response At a Jan. 14 news conference, Northam said he was satisfied with the vaccine rollout. ""This is probably one of the most massive logistical efforts that has ever taken place in Virginia, when you think about it, to get 8.5 million Virginians not one dose, but two doses,"" he said. ""I’m pleased with the way we’ve rolled."" Administration officials have said published Virginia data is undercounted because of delays and glitches in the state’s electronic reporting system. During the seven-day period ending on Jan. 19, Virginia averaged giving 17,464 shots a day, according to the state Department of Health’s dashboard. Northam said he wants to reach 50,000 shots a day and have all Virginians double vaccinated by early to mid summer. Northam took steps last week to speed things up. He announced that all people 65 and older would now be eligible for the vaccine, and so would people aged 16 to 64 with health problems. Northam said that makes about half of Virginians eligible for vaccines. The rest will qualify later.  Our ruling  Cox said on Jan.13 that Virginia ranked ""in the bottom third of states nationally"" in getting its allotted COVID-19 vaccines into arms. Virginia ranked 39th in the nation on that date. Although not part of this ruling, it should be noted that Virginia has since fallen to 48th, even though it has picked up pace in giving vaccines.

Yes, Wisconsin vaccine rollout among slowest in Midwest
","Wisconsin’s vaccine distribution — like most everything else in Wisconsin in recent years — has sparked a partisan blame game. Republicans have criticized the rollout as slow and uncoordinated, asserting Democratic Gov. Tony Evers doesn’t have a sufficient plan. Evers has countered that he’s doing the best he can with the available supply, claiming Vice President Mike Pence had promised vaccines from a federal reserve that didn’t actually exist. Republican Rebecca Kleefisch, a potential 2022 gubernatorial candidate, said Evers is leading an effort that ranks among the worst in the region. ""Wisconsin is second to last in the Midwest in our vaccination rate and the governor says he’s ‘satisfied,’"" Kleefisch, the former lieutenant governor under Gov. Scott Walker, said in a Jan. 14, 2021, tweet. Does Wisconsin really rank that poorly? Let’s dig in. We’ll leave for another day the question of who’s to blame for the speed of Wisconsin’s vaccine rollout. But the status is clear — Wisconsin is among the slowest in the nation. In fact, Kleefisch was over-stating the Midwest ranking. State-by-state data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed 2.4% of Wisconsin residents received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine as of Jan. 13, the most recent data available when Kleefisch sent out her tweet. That ranked dead last among the 12 Midwest states. North Dakota and South Dakota led that ranking with more than 5% receiving a first dose, while Ohio and Missouri joined Wisconsin at the bottom, with 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively. In the preceding days, Wisconsin had ranked second-last in the Midwest. Nationwide as of Jan. 13, Wisconsin ranked 41st out of all 50 states in vaccination rate, well off the national average of 3.1%. The ranking only worsened in the ensuing week, with Wisconsin dropping to 44th by Jan. 19 while remaining last in the Midwest, according to the CDC. Pushing back against Kleefisch’s claim, Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback pointed to CDC data on the raw number of vaccinations administered. That showed Wisconsin ranked seventh out of the 12 Midwest states as of Jan. 13. But that’s not a reasonable way to compare progress when dealing with states that vary dramatically in population. It would be like arguing Texas is the highest-crime state because it has the most prison inmates. The latter may be true, but only because Texas has one of the highest populations. Comparing it to other states requires examining the number of inmates relative to the population (in which case Texas is not first). That’s where the per capita rate comes in — which is the vaccination metric used by the CDC and referenced by Kleefisch. Cudaback also said Wisconsin’s ability to administer vaccines is limited by its large long-term care population. Vaccines are made available to states based on population, but states are required to store enough doses for everyone in long-term care before any doses can be administered to other groups. State officials say Wisconsin has a higher proportion of long-term care residents than many states and therefore has to build a larger bank before administering vaccines, slowing the process. That brings us to the second part of Kleefisch’s claim, that Evers is comfortable with where the state stands. She’s off a bit there, at least in how she framed it. In a Jan. 13 interview with WISN-TV, Evers was asked, ""Is this acceptable to you where we’re at"" as a state on vaccinations. ""Given what we have, we can’t give any more. That’s the issue,"" the governor said. ""Yes, I'm satisfied where we're at because that's all we had."" So Evers isn’t necessarily saying he’s satisfied with being second-last (or last). He’s saying he is satisfied with the progress given what he has had to work with. Whether that’s a valid excuse is a topic for another fact check, as there are of course vaccines on hand in Wisconsin that haven’t yet been administered. But he’s not quite using the word in the same way Kleefisch characterized it. Cudaback also said Wisconsin’s ability to administer vaccines is limited by its large long-term care population. Vaccines are made available to states based on population, but states are required to store enough doses for everyone in long-term care before any doses can be administered to other groups. State officials say Wisconsin has a higher proportion of long-term care residents than many states and therefore has to build a larger bank before administering vaccines, slowing the process. Criticizing the rollout under Evers’ administration, Kleefisch said Wisconsin is second to last in the Midwest in vaccination rate. Kleefisch is making the general point that Wisconsin is in worse shape than surrounding states, and that’s correct. But it’s in fact even worse than she asserted. After a stretch as second-worst in the Midwest, Wisconsin moved to last on that list shortly before Kleefisch’s tweet. And Evers did say around the same time he was satisfied with the state’s progress, though he used the term with a caveat about vaccine availability.

Beasley says she's been 'very clear' about filibuster stance
","One of North Carolina’s U.S. Senate candidates told voters that she has been misquoted about her stance on the filibuster, a tool used to block legislation. Cheri Beasley, former chief justice of the N.C. Supreme Court, is one of several Democrats running for the senate seat that Republican Sen. Richard Burr will vacate at the end of 2022. During a campaign event at Duke University in mid-October, she was asked about her position on whether the U.S. Senate should eliminate the filibuster. A man asked Beasley: ""I read online that you’re the only Democratic U.S. Senate candidate from North Carolina that supports the filibuster. How can you justify that position amid everything going on in D.C.?"" Beasley responded this way: ""I appreciate the question. I can only tell you that I remember the article that you read and it just is not quite true. Let’s take a look back. Because the reality is there is something deeply wrong when there is a process that allows a procedure which really is a tool of gridlock, which stops and prohibits the passage of the kind of legislation that the majority of the American people support — like voting rights. We need filibuster reform, and I’ve always been very clear about that. I’m sorry I was misquoted on that."" She went on to say she hoped the U.S. Senate would pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which Republicans ultimately blocked.  Given the confusion at the Duke event, we wondered: Has Beasley always been very clear about supporting filibuster reform, as she asserts?  Her previous statements on the issue certainly show a willingness to consider filibuster reform. However, it’s an exaggeration to say Beasley has ""always been very clear about her position."" The filibuster, a loosely-defined term, generally refers to a rule allowing a minority of senators to hold up legislation. Lawmakers can delay things by speaking on the Senate floor for hours at a time, as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) did in 2013 when he read the children’s book ""Green Eggs and Ham"" in an effort to defund the Affordable Care Act. The speeches can influence other senators or stall the vote to give lawmakers time to reach a compromise. In some cases, the speeches go down as merely performative — having no influence on legislation. Senators don’t actually need to speak for hours on the floor to effectively use the filibuster, as PBS explained earlier this year. They can simply say they object to the legislation under consideration. Then, to end debate on the bill, the Senate must trigger what’s known as ""cloture."" But that tool requires 60 favorable votes. Republicans effectively used the tool last month to block the Democrats’ voting rights legislation, known as the For The People Act.  Democrats control the White House and Congress, but their majority is so narrow that a filibuster can effectively block almost any controversial legislation. In North Carolina, Democrats running for Burr’s seat have been repeatedly asked about this issue on the campaign trail. While several candidates are seeking the party’s nomination, Beasley is considered a top contender because she has won a statewide election and because of the amount of money she has raised. Other leading candidates include state Sen. Jeff Jackson and former state Sen. Erica Smith. Smith called for eliminating the filibuster early in her campaign. Jackson has taken a wait-and-see approach while criticizing Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) for saying he would under ""no circumstance"" consider scrapping it.  While the National Republican Senatorial Committee accused Jackson of flip-flopping on the issue, PolitiFact NC found that Jackson repeatedly tied his position to how Republicans treated Democrats’ top legislative priorities. The Jackson campaign told PolitiFact NC on Nov. 17 that he supports eliminating the filibuster. ""The filibuster is simply being used as a bad faith tool of gridlock by Mitch McConnell, particularly around voting rights legislation,"" campaign spokesman Dylan Arant said. ""If there weren’t enough support for elimination, then Jackson would also support the ‘talking filibuster’ reform to make it harder to obstruct."" Beasley, for her part, announced on Oct. 28 that she fully supports eliminating the filibuster. The move came after months of Beasley saying she would ""take a look at"" full elimination. But was she always ""very clear"" about wanting reform? Let’s take a look at what Beasley has said about the filibuster. May 1: WFAE-FM asked Beasley whether she would eliminate the filibuster in order to pass H.R. 1, the voting rights bill. She responded: ""I am glad to take a look at it, but what I am confident of is that legislation that supports the people of North Carolina, that there be no barriers to that passing. Voting rights are very important. We really must do everything in our power to make sure that people are not prevented from casting their ballot and stating their choice for those who offer themselves for service."" Asked specifically about eliminating the filibuster, she said it’s ""something that I would take a look at."" June 11: WXII-TV asked Beasley if she would vote to end the filibuster to pass H.R. 1. ""I would certainly think about the relevancy of it.""  July 26: The News & Observer reported on the Democratic U.S. Senate candidates’ positions on the filibuster. Beasley told the paper: ""A procedural rule shouldn’t stand in the way of policies that the overwhelming majority of Americans and North Carolinians support, which is why I’d take a look at changes that would benefit our state, recognizing that it also has been used to block harmful legislation in the past.""  Aug. 16: Beasley was asked about her position during a webinar with supporters dubbed, ""Women for Beasley."" She responded: ""You know, I have thought deeply about it. And the reality is, it has in many ways benefited Democrats and people across North Carolina and this state. I’ll certainly take a look at it. What I am confident of, is that legislation that people here in North Carolina care deeply about, and people across the country (care deeply about), like voting rights, should not be held up by the filibuster."" Aug. 17: WXII-TV reported ""Two months ago, Ms. Beasley did not provide a definitive answer on the Senate filibuster that’s holding up voting reform. That position did not change today."" Beasley told the reporter: ""It’s a tough issue. HR1, SR1 need to pass. They absolutely do. The filibuster is a much bigger issue."" Aug. 28: When asked in an interview with WCNC-TV whether she’d vote to eliminate the filibuster, Beasley didn’t give a yes or no answer. She said: ""I am very concerned and understand that, here we are 56 years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, and we are still fighting for basic fundamental rights around the right to vote. I’m deeply concerned about that. I also know it’s been almost 200 days that the Senate has sat on the For The People Act. And the For the People Act is exactly what the people of North Carolina want passed. They want to know there’s voter protection, and they also want to know that there will be a senator there who’s going to fight to protect this very basic and fundamental right to vote. And they don’t want the Senate to play around with that."" Sept. 1: The Daily Beast reported on comments Beasley made during an Aug. 16 ""Women for Beasley"" event. Campaign spokeswoman Dory MacMillan told the Daily Beast that Beasley ""believes a procedural rule shouldn’t stand in the way of solutions that an overwhelming majority of North Carolinians support"" and that ""given the grave threat to democracy she would support a carve out for legislation to support voting rights, and as she has said, would consider broader reforms to the filibuster."" Oct. 22: In a video forum with LGBTQ+ Dems, Beasley said this about filibuster reform: ""And so as you ask about the filibuster, the reality is we must be deeply concerned about a process where there’s a procedure that contains a tool of gridlock that prohibits the passage of legislation the majority of Americans support. And the reality is the majority of Americans support the Equality Act and the Voting Rights Act — and so many other pieces of legislation that the Senate is not able to get passed. We must get past this, and we absolutely must have filibuster reform."" During her campaign event at Duke University, Beasley claimed she had been misquoted about her position. When we inquired with her campaign about what was misquoted, MacMillan said Beasley was referring to the headline of the Daily Beast story, which said, ""New footage shows NC Dem Senate candidate lauding filibuster."" Beasley merely noted how the filibuster had been used in the past, MacMillan said, and didn’t ""laud"" it as the Daily Beast headline suggested. The definition of ""laud"" means to praise or extol, according to Dictionary.com and Merriam-Webster. While Beasley highlighted how the filibuster has worked to benefit Democrats — something she would certainly be grateful for —  footage reviewed by PolitiFact NC didn’t show Beasley explicitly stating that the filibuster is a positive thing. Beasley said ""We need filibuster reform, and I’ve always been very clear about that."" Beasley’s quote makes it seem like, prior to her October commitment to eliminate the filibuster, she had come out fully in favor of some kind of reform.  From May through July, she said she’d ""take a look at"" or ""think about"" eliminating the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. Based on the information PolitiFact NC has reviewed and Beasley’s campaign has provided, it wasn’t until September that Beasley’s campaign explicitly said she would ""carve out"" the filibuster to support voting rights and would ""consider"" broader reforms. Her statement contains an element of truth — she has consistently said there should be no barriers to passing voting rights legislation. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression — she didn’t specify her stance on filibuster reform until September. And only in October did she clearly state ""we absolutely must have filibuster reform."" We rate the claim that she has always been clear about that Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/nov/18/cheri-beasley/beasley-says-shes-been-very-clear-about-filibuster/

Facebook post overstates rapper’s role in Seattle’s police-free protest zone
","Last year’s Capitol Hill Organized Protest in Seattle was not as organized as its name implied. Alternately called the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest and the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, the protest area that became known as CHOP did not have a clear structure or leader, making it easy for social media claims to fill in the gaps with falsehoods. One such viral Facebook post has a photo of a man with the words, ""Remember me? I conquered part of Seattle, handed out guns to form a paramilitary force that murdered three people including a child, robbed the locals, and I walked away without being questioned."" The man pictured is not identified in the post, but it is rapper Raz Simone, who is mentioned by name in the comments. The post concludes with, ""Remember me when they criticize Kyle Rittenhouse,"" referring to the Wisconsin teenager who was on trial for shooting three people, two of them fatally, during 2020 protests in Kenosha, Wis. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim oversimplifies what happened in Seattle’s police-free protest zone and overstates Simone’s role there. No single person ""conquered"" the area known as CHOP; it emerged after police vacated a police precinct and allowed protesters free rein for more than three weeks. And while Simone was shown on video giving out a gun, we did not find evidence linking that gun to fatal shootings that occurred later. We also did not find evidence that a paramilitary force carried out the two fatal shootings, one of which was between two people who had been feuding since 2019. Finally, we did not find evidence that Simone robbed locals. The multi-block zone known as CHOP was established in the aftermath of nationwide protests that followed the death of George Floyd. The Seattle protests centered on the police department’s East Precinct, which became a kind of battleground between police — who erected barricades and used tear gas, flashbangs and pepper spray on the crowds — and protesters, who wore riot gear and threw projectiles at officers. On June 8, 2020, police boarded up the precinct and left the area, and protesters used the police barriers to create the CHOP zone. Protestors had several demands, including defunding police and reinvesting funds in community programs. Initially, the area seemed peaceful, with a community garden, food booths and documentary screenings. On June 20, though, one man was killed in a shooting just outside the CHOP zone, and police said the crowd denied them entry to the area. Then on June 29, two teenagers were shot, one fatally, which  prompted the city to shut down CHOP a few days later, The Seattle Times reported. The role of Simone in CHOP depended on who was describing it. CNN referred to him as the ""de facto"" leader of the area, but other media outlets were less definitive. A PolitiFact check of a different claim called him a regular figure at the protests, The Seattle Times called him ""a frequent presence at CHOP,"" and a KOMO TV reporter said, ""Some have told me (he) is one of the leaders in what many said is a ‘leaderless’ group of protesters."" Conservative national media outlets, meanwhile, referred to him as a warlord. The claim says Simone handed out guns to form a paramilitary force that murdered three people, but there’s little evidence for that description of events. Snopes checked a claim that Simone gave a semi-automatic weapon to a fellow protester and rated it true. In a video posted June 9, 2020, on Simone’s Facebook page, he can be seen at the 2:08 mark removing a gun from the trunk of his Tesla and giving it to someone he does not appear to know. Some of the protesters served as armed guards within CHOP, and Washington state allows the open carry of guns. It’s not clear whether Simone’s transfer of the gun was legal. However, we did not find evidence to support the claim that the gun Simone gave out was linked to shootings that occured in and near CHOP, or that a paramilitary force carried out the shootings. No news reports corroborate any of those details, and police have not said that. The first shooting, on June 20, involved two people who had a history of fighting. Marcel Long was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Horace Anderson. Footage of a 2019 fight between them was posted on YouTube, The Seattle Times reported. The second shooting happened on June 29, and no arrests have been made or suspects named publicly. But no news reports indicate that a paramilitary was suspected of being involved. There are also no news reports about Simone robbing locals, as the claim says, and he has not been arrested or charged with any crimes related to CHOP. This year, however, two women accused Simone of abuse and coercion, with one saying Simone forced her to strip for money that he took and the other accusing him of pushing her into prostitution. He has not been charged with a crime in connection with those allegations, but one of the women sought and was granted a court order of protection against him. A Facebook post says Raz Simone ""conquered"" part of Seattle, handed out guns to form a paramilitary force that murdered three people, robbed the locals and walked away without being questioned. Simone did not ""conquer"" the area known as CHOP. It was established after police vacated a police precinct and allowed protesters free rein. Simone was shown on video giving out a gun, but neither news reports nor police have linked that gun to fatal shootings that occurred later. Two people were fatally shot in or near CHOP, not three. One of the fatal shootings was between people who had been feuding since 2019. No arrests have been made in the other shooting, but no news reports indicate that a paramilitary was suspected of being involved. Simone has not been arrested or charged with robbery or any other crimes related to CHOP. We rate this claim Mostly False.   ",/factchecks/2021/nov/18/facebook-posts/facebook-post-overstates-rappers-role-seattles-pol/

Jen Psaki incorrect in saying no economist thinks Biden bill will boost inflation
","The White House is running into turbulence over concerns that President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better safety net bill could drive up inflation, which has already soared to its highest level in three decades. The bill is nearing a vote in the House. The current version, which may be changed in the Senate even if it passes the House, would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years on clean energy initiatives, child care subsidies, extended child tax credits, paid family leave and hearing aids for Medicare beneficiaries. It would be partially paid for through additional taxes primarily aimed at wealthy taxpayers and by letting the government negotiate certain drug prices. The White House has argued that the bill would reduce inflation, citing a letter signed by 17 Nobel laureates in economics suggesting it would ""ease longer-term inflationary pressures."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki went a step further during the Nov. 15 press briefing when she was asked, ""Why should Americans not be concerned that injecting another $1.75 trillion or more would further raise inflation?"" She answered, ""Because no economist out there is projecting that this will have a negative impact on inflation. And actually, what it will help do is it will help increase economic productivity.  It will help economic growth in this country. That, and the Build Back Better Agenda will help reduce inflation, will help cut costs for the American people over the long term."" Is it really true that there’s not a single economist who thinks the bill will boost inflation? No. Many economists have stated for the record that they think the inflationary impact of the bill will be small and brief. But we found lots of economists who say they expect modest inflationary pressure, at least initially. Skeptics of the White House’s argument, including the Washington Post Fact Checker, have said the White House is glossing over the fact that the economists it cited were focusing on the measure’s ability to curb inflation in the medium to longer terms, rather than the short term when inflation is already unusually high.  The White House did not respond to inquiries for this article.  ""I’m an economist, and I disagree,"" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum, told PolitiFact. ""We know there’s lots of spending in the bill, and that it’s front-loaded"" into the earlier years, he said. ""If you cut taxes and increase spending, financed by debt, that will put upward pressure on inflation."" Other economists have expressed the same view. • Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America: ""You should wind up with primarily a deficit-financed spending bill that is going to be rolled out in an economy near full employment … . It will make the labor market even hotter and create even more price pressure.’’ • Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist for JPMorgan Chase: ""Right now, anything that expands aggregate demand is not warranted, not advisable. … The economy seems to be operating pretty close to its capacity constraints."" Some economists have said the inflationary effects will be modest and manageable, but that they will exist. For instance, Noah Smith, a former Bloomberg opinion columnist and a former assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University, wrote, ""I expect Biden’s bills to push upward on inflation, rather than downward. That said, the inflationary impact will be very small."" Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, told the New York Times that ""it’s more likely a small positive for inflation in 2022, because it’s preventing a big reduction in spending that would otherwise have happened that year.""  However, Furman has also written that ""over the medium and long term,"" the bill would ""have a minuscule impact on inflation."" Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton who was more aggressive in his inflation worries than other Democrats earlier this year, recently wrote that the bill would have a ""negligible"" impact on inflation. ""I do think there will be an inflation risk, because we’re in a bad situation already,"" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""It could be the last-log-on-the-fire syndrome. But my guess is that the inflationary impact will be pretty small, and I think that’s the consensus."" Why would the Build Back Better bill be expected to lead to more inflation? It’s textbook economics. ""Inflation is the result of too much demand chasing too little supply,"" said John Leahy, a professor of macroeconomics and public policy at the University of Michigan. ""Anyone arguing that the bill is inflationary can point to any standard economic textbook: An increase in government spending should increase demand and thereby increase inflation. This will happen even if the spending is fully paid for through taxes, since the government spending increases demand one for one and the taxes reduce demand only to the extent that firms or consumers reduce their spending as a result, and this reduction is typically less than one for one."" Some of the bill’s inflationary elements include the extension of the child tax credit and the expansion of the state and local tax deduction, which was capped in 2017. The bill also includes provisions that would raise wages for union members and child care providers, Goldwein said. Meanwhile, the tax hikes that could theoretically temper inflation are largely targeted at the wealthiest taxpayers. This would tend to weaken the anti-inflationary impact, since tax increases may not do much to dampen spending by wealthier households. That said, the bill does include some provisions that would counter inflation, such as the investments in infrastructure, which would bring supply into closer alignment with demand, and the child care subsidies, which could push people back into the labor force and, in so doing, increase the supply of goods and services. Timing also matters. ""Some have argued that the impact on demand should be small since the spending and the taxes are spread over 10 years,"" Leahy said. And in the context of the U.S. economy, the bill isn’t enormous, especially compared with the coronavirus relief packages that passed as recently as early this year, which were both large and designed to be implemented quickly. Leahy’s back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the bill will boost demand by $660 billion over 10 years, a period in which overall gross domestic product will be roughly $200 trillion. ""By this calculation, the increase in demand is on the order of one-third of a percent of GDP,"" he said. ""This seems small to me."" Finally, what the Federal Reserve does will ultimately determine how much the bill increases inflation. One of the Fed’s core duties is to keep inflation within a reasonable band, usually in the range of 2% per year, and ""over the medium to long term, the consensus is strong that the Fed will step in to prevent higher inflation,"" Goldwein said. The bill is not in its final form, so its potential impact on inflation could change. And while economists base their projections on textbook economics, there’s always a chance that households will react in unexpected ways to the bill’s economic incentives. Psaki said, ""No economist out there is projecting that (the Build Back Better bill) will have a negative impact on inflation."" She’s wrong to say that no economist foresees inflation as a result of the bill’s passage. Numerous economists, including some allies of the White House, have gone on the record saying there probably will be inflationary effects, especially in the near term, if the bill is passed.  However, the broad consensus among analysts has been that the bill’s inflationary impact will be modest and brief.

No evidence Keystone pipeline was canceled for Warren Buffett’s benefit
","On his first day in office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order revoking the permit for the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, which would have helped carry crude oil from Canada to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. Months later, a curious social media post suggested the demise of the planned pipeline was the work of former President Barack Obama and was done ​​as a favor to billionaire investor Warren Buffett. The post from Oct. 27 misspells Buffett’s last name and shows an image of a train with the text underneath referencing Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate headed by Buffett. ""In the last 2 election cycles,"" the image reads, ""Buffet gave extensively to Democrat causes and candidates. He also bundled and hosted numerous fundraisers for Obama. If anyone believes the Keystone Pipeline isn’t being blocked by Obama on Buffet’s behalf, I’ve got a bridge to sell you."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  One reason this claim seems a bit out of place? Reverse-image searches show it was being shared as early as 2015, midway through Obama’s second term. At the time, Obama did reject a permit for Keystone XL, arguing in his Nov. 6, 2015, statement that the pipeline would not lower gas prices, increase the nation’s energy security or make a meaningful long-term contribution to the U.S. economy. The Keystone XL pipeline was first proposed more than a decade ago during a period of high oil prices. It would have carried up to 830,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries.  When President Donald Trump took office, his administration backed the project in the face of objections from environmental groups and attempted to revive the pipeline, but ultimately made little progress.  According to Federal Election Commission records, Buffett did not contribute to Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. He did, however, donate to the presidential campaigns of both Obama and Hillary Clinton, and in 2019 he donated $248,500 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official campaign arm of the Democrats in the House of Representatives. Between 2007 and 2012, Buffett gave more than $75,000 to organizations supporting Obama.  Buffett has expressed his support for the Keystone XL Pipeline, even though it would have competed against his Burlington Northern railroad, which transports crude.  Buffett said the pipeline would be good for Canada and America. Buffett assistant Debbie Bosanek told the Associated Press, ""Mr. Buffett has never seen any report by BNSF projecting whether the Keystone Pipeline would increase or decrease the revenue of the railroad."" A Facebook post claims the Keystone Pipeline was blocked by Obama to benefit Buffett. That’s incorrect. The Keystone XL Pipeline has been blocked multiple times for climate, economic, and perceived national-interest reasons. We don’t find evidence that the decision was intended to benefit Buffett.  Buffett, in fact, supported its construction. We rate this claim False.

Iowa group corrects statement on Charles Grassley’s infrastructure vote
","The bipartisan U.S. Senate and House votes were made in the past few months, setting the stage for President Joe Biden to sign on Nov. 15 a landmark, $1 trillion infrastructure bill.  Once the bill was signed, the political progressive activist group, Progress Iowa, of Des Moines, issued a prepared statement from executive director Matt Sinovic. It read, in part: ""Today, Iowans can look toward a brighter future as investments in broadband, roads, bridges and more are officially coming to Iowa. The bi-partisan infrastructure bill signed into law this afternoon will bring about $5 billion worth of improvements to our state. It’s a shame only one member of Iowa’s federal delegation, Rep. Cindy Axne, put Iowans first and supported this historic legislation."" The statement went on to urge Iowa’s Republican congressional delegation to support the pending Build Back Better Act. There was a problem, though, with the statement. Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley also voted for the bill when it went before the Senate on Aug. 10. The bill wasn’t perfect but an improvement over what the House at that time was considering, Grassley said in his own prepared statement about the vote.  We contacted Progress Iowa the morning after Biden’s signing ceremony and the Iowa group’s statement was made. Sinovic replied that he was preparing a corrected statement. ""It’s a shame only one member of Iowa’s federal House delegation, Rep. Cindy Axne, put Iowans first and supported this historic legislation,"" the corrected part of his statement released Tuesday morning said.  While Axne and Grassley voted yes on the bill, Reps.

Elections administrator right on who can decide when someone is incompetent to vote
","The Wisconsin Elections Commission and its non-partisan administrator have come under Republican fire, including a resolution backing a reprimand and calls for her resignation over allegations of irregularities with nursing home voting. Meagan Wolfe, the administrator, has said calls for her resignation are ""not productive"" and ""just partisan politics.""  The uproar followed a Oct. 28, 2021 news conference held by Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling who accused state elections commissioners of committing felonies by telling election clerks to mail absentee ballots to nursing homes instead of visiting them in person during the COVID-19 pandemic. Schmaling said the investigation determined one resident of the Ridgewood Care Facility in Mount Pleasant likely voted illegally in the November 2020 election against a court order declaring the resident incompetent to vote.  Racine County Sgt. Michael Luell said another seven residents with cognitive problems were ""victimized"" because trained poll workers were not allowed on site, which led to nursing home workers filling out information on ballots and ballot envelopes for the residents.  Wolfe has been critical of Republican demands in her public responses, including in an interview that aired Nov. 5, 2021 on ""PBS Here and Now.""  ""I think it really highlights a lack of understanding about how special voting deputies work in normal circumstances, let alone how that process works during a pandemic,"" Wolfe said. ""I think it overlooks the fact that special voting deputies were not being allowed into facilities last year. They were not being allowed into facilities as recently as this spring.  ""And I also think it overlooks the fact that only a court can decide that somebody is incompetent to vote. I mean, the commission cannot force facilities, private facilities, to allow special voting deputies or anyone into a private care facility."" Is Wolfe right that ""only a court can decide that somebody is incompetent to vote"" and the commission  ""cannot force facilities, private facilities, to allow special voting deputies"" inside? When asked for backup, Wolfe’s staff pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to state statutes addressing the issue. Let’s start with Wisconsin statute 54.25(2)(c)1.(g), which says, in part: ""No person may be denied the right to register to vote or the right to vote by reason that the person is alleged to be incapable of understanding the objective of the elective process unless the person has been adjudicated incompetent in this state."" It later notes:  ""Regardless of whether a guardian is appointed, a court may declare that an individual is not competent to exercise the right to register to vote or to vote in an election if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is incapable of understanding the objective of the elective process.""  Rick Esenberg, president and general counsel of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, said the first part of the statement is ""generally correct."" ""A person may not be denied the right to register or vote because he or she is unable to understand the objective of the electoral process without a judicial finding,"" he wrote in an email, adding: ""A nursing home administrator, relative, special voting deputy, municipal clerk or, for that matter, WEC could not make the decision that someone is incompetent to vote.""  On the second part of the claim, that the commission cannot force facilities to allow deputies inside, Wolfe’s office pointed to state law that covers the limits of what the commission can do. And its discretion, understandably, is on election officials. According to Wisconsin statutes 5.06(6):  ""The commission may, after such investigation as it deems appropriate, summarily decide the matter before it and, by order, require any election official to conform his or her conduct to the law, restrain an official from taking any action inconsistent with the law or require an official to correct any action or decision inconsistent with the law. The commission shall immediately transmit a copy of the order to the official. An order issued under this subsection is effective immediately or at such later time as may be specified in the order."" That is, the commission has the ability to order an election official to do something or not under that section. But that doesn’t mean the commission can order someone else to do something -- in this case, a private care facility owner, operator or staff member to allow election workers inside. ""These look to be accurate statements of Wisconsin law,"" said Robert Yablon, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School, of Wolfe’s claim. ""I am not aware of any statute or court decision that expressly empowers the Elections Commission to compel private care facilities to allow in special voting deputies."" Esenberg, meanwhile, called this part of Wolfe’s claim ""a bit of a misdirection.""  ""Sec. 6.875 empowers municipal clerks to send (special voting deputies) to residential care facilities,"" he said. ""I am not aware that anyone has ever tested whether that implies a legal obligation for licensed facilities to let them in."" The real question raised by the scenario, he said, is a different one -- whether the commission can send absentee ballots directly to voters in nursing homes, as it did in an effort to get around being unable to have a deputy go inside. ""An administrative body cannot change a statute,"" he wrote. ""What WEC actually had no authority to do is send ballots directly to residents of these facilities. Maybe it would be good if it could during the COVID pandemic but it just doesn’t. The statutes make clear that absentee voting is a privilege and not a right and that its requisites must be strictly complied with.""  He added: ""One can sympathize with the fact that the pandemic made absentee voting from nursing homes extremely difficult – maybe practically impossible – during at least portions of the pandemic. But that doesn’t give WEC the power to change the law."" To be sure, it is local election officials, not the state election commission that actually sends out the ballots. Wolfe said ""Only a court can decide that somebody is incompetent to vote"" -- the state Election Commission ""cannot force facilities, private facilities, to allow special voting deputies"" inside. There is little, if any debate on the first part -- declarations of incompetency are the purview of the courts, not election officials or anyone else. On the second part, Wolfe is on target, but in making the claim muddies the waters a bit on the issue at hand. At issue is whether ballots could be mailed directly to nursing homes. No one has argued the state could have -- or should have -- forced such facilities to change policies and let deputies inside. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True. Editor's note: This item was updated on Nov. 29, 2021 to note that local election officials, not the state elections commission, actually sends out absentee ballots. The change does not affect the rating.           ",/factchecks/2021/nov/18/meagan-wolfe/elections-administrator-right-who-can-decide-when-/

It includes hashtags like #truthcomesout and #firefauci. The video appeared on Facebook, where it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) COVID-19 vaccines did not fail in animal trials or result in the death of the animals tested. The vaccines are not a form of gene therapy, which modifies a person’s genes to replace or fix mutations that lead to diseases. The scientists cited in the video have spread misinformation about the vaccines. The footage is an excerpt from a longer video posted online Oct. 13 called ""Kill Shot,"" by Greg Reese, an editor and producer for the website InfoWars, which has spread other vaccine misinformation. Most recently, InfoWars was in the news because its founder and host, Alex Jones, was found liable for defamation against the families of victims from the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which Jones has portrayed as a hoax. In the TikTok video, a narrator says that 22 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, ""We have all the information needed to paint a clear picture of what’s going on."" The narrator then recites a laundry list of false claims about Dr. Anthony Fauci, PCR tests, the ingredients of vaccines and more. The narrator says, ""The COVID vaccines are not vaccines but rather highly controversial mRNA tech that failed miserably on its animal trials, a type of gene therapy that several top scientists warn will kill you,"" a statement that contains multiple falsehoods. First, COVID-19 vaccines did not fail animal trials. Fact checkers have debunked this claim, noting that the two vaccines most widely used in the U.S. — Pfizer and Moderna — produced desirable outcomes in animal testing. Results from Moderna’s animal testing were published in the New England Journal of Medicine after monkeys had a robust immune response to the vaccine. Animals also did not die during the vaccine trials. Full Fact reported that had any animals died, human trials that were running concurrently would have been halted, which they were not. Next, COVID-19 vaccines are not a type of gene therapy; PolitiFact and others have reported that the claim is false. Gene therapy is a process of modifying genes to replace or fix mutations that lead to diseases, according to PolitiFact. That’s different from mRNA vaccines, which send instructions to the body’s cells to make a piece of spike protein, which is also found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19, so that the immune system can respond to it. Finally, the video’s narrator says ""several top scientists warn"" that the COVID-19 vaccines ""will kill you,"" and names Dr. Ryan Cole and Dr. Nathan Thompson. Cole, who is licensed to practice medicine in several states and is under investigation by the Washington Medical Commission, falsely claimed in the spring that mRNA vaccines cause cancer and autoimmune diseases. He was rebuked by the author of the medical paper he cited as evidence for the claim. The other doctor identified, Thompson, has claimed that COVID-19 vaccines weaken the immune system, which PolitiFact rated False. A TikTok video posted on Facebook says COVID-19 vaccines ""failed miserably"" in animal trials and are ""a type of gene therapy that several top scientists warn will kill you."" The video originated on InfoWars, known for spreading conspiracy theories. The vaccines did not fail in animal trials or result in the death of the animals tested. COVID-19 vaccines are not a type of gene therapy, which involves modifying genes to replace or fix mutations that lead to diseases. The mRNA vaccines do not change a person’s genetic makeup and never enter the part of the cell that hosts DNA. The scientists cited in the video have spread misinformation about the vaccines. We rate this claim False.   ",/factchecks/2021/nov/17/tiktok-posts/video-originated-infowars-filled-falsehoods-about-/

Misinformation about Astroworld death toll spreads on social media
","Houston police and fire officials continue to review footage from Travis Scott’s Astroworld music festival, where a crowd surge left hundreds injured and, as of Nov. 14, 10 people dead.  Nine-year-old Ezra Blount became the latest — and youngest — person to die from injuries sustained in the crush at the Nov. 5 festival, the Houston Chronicle reported. About 300 were treated at the festival site that day, and 13 people were hospitalized.   And yet an unfounded claim about the media covering up the true death toll continues to spread on social media.  ""There are several accounts that claim the local news in #Houston is LYING,"" reads a screenshot of one such tweet. ""It’s not just ‘8’ it’s close to hundreds.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Before Blount and another victim, Bharti Shahani, died on Nov. 10, the death toll was eight according to news reports and local officials.   On Nov. 6, the day after the festival chaos, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner issued a press release extending his condolences ""to the families of the eight people who died."" In another press release, on Nov. 9, Turner again said ""eight people died"" and ""hundreds more were injured."" A spokesperson for Turner said on Nov. 17 that ""the mayor’s office is aware of 10 deaths as a result of the Astroworld Festival"" and referred PolitiFact to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, which conducts autopsies for the county.  The institute also told PolitiFact that 10 people died. We’ve checked a few other false posts related to Astroworld, including that Live Nation packed 50,000 people into a venue that only had capacity for 20,000 and that the tragedy was related to COVID-19 vaccines. Both claims were wrong, and so is this one.   Hundreds were injured, but there’s nothing to support the claim that ""close to hundreds"" of people died. The New York Times published profiles of the 10 people whose deaths were confirmed in connection with the festival.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/nov/17/viral-image/misinformation-about-astroworld-death-toll-spreads/

Facebook post gets details about Kenosha response wrong
","As the Wisconsin National Guard was activated Nov. 12 in preparation for a verdict in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, a viral meme questioned why that didn’t happen last year.  The meme, shared on Facebook, says, ""500 National Guardsmen being called to Kenosha ahead of the Rittenhouse verdict. Had they done this in the first place, there wouldn’t have been a trial.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim implies that the National Guard was not in Kenosha in August 2020 when Rittenhouse, then 17, shot three people, two of them fatally. But Gov. Tony Evers called in the National Guard on Aug. 24, and the guardsmen arrived the same day. The Rittenhouse shooting happened the following day, Aug. 25.  The events that unfolded in Kenosha that summer began on Aug. 23, when Jacob Blake was shot in the back by a police officer who was trying to arrest him on an outstanding warrant. Blake was left paralyzed. He had been armed with a knife during the encounter, and the officer was not charged with a crime.  A bystander’s video of the shooting circulated widely and reignited protests that had blanketed the U.S. earlier in the year, after police brutality against other Black people such as George Floyd. Protesters poured into Kenosha, the New York Times reported.  The day after the Blake shooting, protests grew violent, with more than 30 fires set and dozens of buildings destroyed. Evers activated the National Guard and 125 members arrived in Kenosha on the night of Aug. 24. On Aug. 25, Rittenhouse was invited by a friend to go to Kenosha to protect a car dealership during the protests. He has testified that he went to provide first aid. He was armed with an AR-15.  That evening, just before midnight, Rittenhouse shot three people, killing two and wounding the third. He is charged with intentional homicide, reckless homicide and other crimes, and he has pleaded self-defense. A Facebook post says, ""500 National Guardsmen being called to Kenosha ahead of the Rittenhouse verdict. Had they done this in the first place, there wouldn’t have been a trial.""  The claim implies that the National Guard was not present in Kenosha when Rittenhouse shot three people, two of them fatally.  The National Guard was activated and arrived in Kenosha on Aug. 24, 2020. The Rittenhouse shooting happened the following day, Aug. 25, 2020. We rate this claim False.  CORRECTION, Nov. 22, 2021: We corrected an inaccurate description of how George Floyd was killed by a police officer.",/factchecks/2021/nov/17/facebook-posts/post-gets-details-about-kenosha-response-wrong/

The photo of a Kansas City tourism sign with a glaring typo is a fake
","A viral image from 2018 that purportedly shows a funny — or vulgar, depending on your sense of humor — typo on a sign is rearing its head again on social media. A Facebook post shows a photo of a sign from a Kansas City, Mo., tourism group that reads, ""Did you know? Kansas City welcomes 25 million visitors anally."" The caption on the image says: ""You sure we shouldn’t just get a proofreader in here to take a quick glance at it?"" ""Nope, looks great. Run it."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The numbers on the sign are correct — Kansas City does welcome 25 million visitors a year — but that’s obviously not why we’re here. It turns out those visitors, many of whom likely came to try the city’s famous barbecue, were welcomed much more politely than the image indicates. The image of the sign with the typo originally began appearing online in May 2018. However, the photo was digitally altered, according to the Kansas City tourism group Visit KC, which said on Twitter then that the photo ""is a fake"" and had been ""doctored to show a misspelling where there is none."" It also tweeted a photo of the original image from two angles. A spokesman for Visit KC said in a statement to PolitiFact on Nov. 15 that the image resurfaces occasionally and that the online community is always quick to come to the tourism group’s defense, but it has nothing new to add on the matter. Several stories said the original post was made by an account that has been suspended by Twitter as of Nov. 15. The Kansas City Star pointed out that the account, You Had One Job (@_youhadonejob1), got the wrong location for the sign in its tweet, which read, ""Welcome to Kansas."" A Facebook post claims that a sign reads that Kansas City welcomes 25 million visitors ""anally,"" instead of ""annually."" However, the image was a fake. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/nov/17/facebook-posts/photo-kansas-city-tourism-sign-glaring-typo-fake/
