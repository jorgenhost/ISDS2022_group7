Does Oregon have the lowest beer tax in the nation?
","After the decision by Washington voters last year to privatize the sale of liquor, Oregon legislators are now wrestling with whether to follow suit. While no decision is likely during February’s monthlong legislative session, issues surrounding alcoholic beverages are very much on the table in Salem these days. At a recent work session on the topic, Sen. Rod Monroe, D-Portland, noted that prices climbed dramatically in Washington after voters there allowed large retailers such as Costco to sell distilled spirits. He said Oregon should be cautious in making big changes and observed that if more money is the goal, expanding the number of state-owned liquor stores would provide one solution. Then he added: ""If our concern is revenue, we ought to look at the fact that we have the lowest beer tax in the nation."" While this may be welcome news, coming right before next weekend’s Super Bowl, we wondered if that’s true. Does Oregon have the lowest beer tax in the country? PolitiFact Oregon checked. We called Scott Drenkard, an economist with the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group in Washington, D.C. Its website includes a weekly map of the United States showing beer tax rates in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Drenkard, noting that the statistics are drawn from another group, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said Oregon ranks 45th nationally with consumers paying a tax rate of 8 cents a gallon of beer. That comes out to just under 4 cents tacked on to the price of a six-pack. The rate puts Oregon behind only Colorado, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Wyoming, which has a 2 cent-a-gallon beer tax. Tennessee, by contrast, ranks first at $1.17 per gallon. Alaska’s $1.07 is second. Monroe, contacted via email for a response, wrote: ""If you add in the sales tax, Oregon has the lowest. The states that are lower than Oregon have a sales tax. When you add the sales tax to the beer tax the total is higher than Oregon."" According to the Federation of Tax Administrators, a Washington, D.C., tax-research group, Monroe is correct when it comes to sales taxes. Oregon is one of nine states that does not have a sales tax. However, general sales taxes apply to most retail items, not just beer. We called Drenkard back to get his thoughts. ""Sales taxes do affect the price of beer, but it’s not a beer-specific tax,"" he said, noting that 20 states do impose additional taxes pertaining specifically to malted beverages. ""Then again, corporate taxes also affect the price of goods, including beer. Should we add those in as well? Where do you draw a line?"" Oregon, according to a national group that tracks beer taxes, has one of the lowest such rates in the county. The 8-cents-a-gallon rate -- sixth-lowest nationally -- has remained unchanged since 1978. But Monroe claimed that Oregon has the lowest beer tax in the U.S. Later, he tried to justify that assertion by saying it’s the lowest if Oregon’s lack of a sales tax is taken into account. He didn’t make that specification in his original statement, though, and sales taxes aren’t specific to beer. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jan/24/rod-monroe/does-oregon-have-lowest-beer-tax-nation/

More state abortion restrictions were enacted in last 3 years than previous decade, Sen. Patty Murray says
","Forty-one years ago this week, the Supreme Court decided Roe vs. Wade, the landmark case that expanded women’s abortion rights. Fast forward to today, and access to abortion is still a hotly debated issue. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., defended abortion rights in a statement on her website for the case’s Jan. 22 anniversary. ""In 2013, our nation saw yet another record-breaking year of state legislatures passing restrictive legislation barring women’s access to abortion services,"" she said. ""In fact, in the past three years, the United States has enacted more of these restrictions than in the previous 10 years combined."" We wanted to zero in on the numbers of state abortion restrictions to see whether the number of restrictions skyrocketed over the last three years. Murray’s office didn’t return our requests for comment, but we found data compiled by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and and abortion rights. The group first outlined the differences in abortion restrictions by year in a report released Jan. 2, 2014. Counting different provisions in the same bill independently, the group tallied 205 new abortion restrictions during the period 2011 to 2013, compared to 189 during the 10 years through 2010. Now, out of the 205 restrictions, there are 25 not currently in effect, either because a court struck them down or a court case is pending. Guttmacher tracked these all 205 restrictions in 10 categories, four of which accounted for nearly half of the restrictions from the last three years: abortion bans, regulations on abortion providers, abortion medication, and private insurance coverage for abortion. (Using the Guttmacher data, the Washington Post made their own handy breakdown of abortion restrictions by state.) For perspective, in 2000, Guttmacher considered the two most restrictive states to be Utah and Mississippi, both of which had restrictions on the books in five of the institute's 10 categories. By 2013, 22 states had five or more restrictions. Louisiana had restrictions in all 10 categories. Methodological differences mean there’s room for debate over the exact number of restrictions, even among abortion-rights groups. While Guttmacher reported 205 abortion restrictions over the last three years, the Center for Reproductive Rights counted approximately 130, said Amanda Allen, the center’s state legislative counsel. That’s because the Center for Reproductive Rights counted each bill just once, regardless of how many different provisions it may have included. The center hasn't been tracking the legislation since 2000, so they don't have a comparable number to pit against Guttmacher's 189 from that decade. While both groups that compiled the numbers are pro-abortion-rights, their figures aren’t being contested by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. A spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List told PolitiFact that the Guttmacher study ""certainly appears to be accurate."" Our ruling Murray said there have been more state-level abortion restrictions in the past three years than in the 10 years before that. A Guttmacher Institute report counted 205 restrictions from 2011 to 2013, compared to 189 from the previous decade. It's worth noting that 25 of those aren't currently in effect, but Murray specifically referred to restrictions enacted, not restrictions currently enforced. Both abortion-rights advocates and anti-abortion advocates told PolitiFact that they concur with Guttmacher's data. We rate her claim True.",/factchecks/2014/jan/24/patty-murray/more-state-abortion-restrictions-were-enacted-last/

Law didn't muzzle or censor Ron Paul for cooling-off year after he left House
","Was the some-would-say-irrepressible Ron Paul of Texas muzzled for a year? So the former congressman and past presidential candidate wrote in a Jan. 14, 2014, email blast soliciting contributions to Campaign for Liberty, a political group. ""You may not know this…,"" the email opened. ""But for the past year, I was censored. Believe it or not, federal rules governing former members of Congress for their first year after retirement limited my ability to mobilize Americans to advance liberty."" Paul, whose last day in the House was Jan. 3, 2013, wrote: ""Every communication had to be carefully crafted, and often even double-checked by C4L’s lawyers, to make sure I didn't violate federal law. But as of January 4th, the muzzle has been removed!"" Paul’s email included a postscript beginning: ""Due to my retirement from Congress, federal law has restricted what I could say and do for the past year. But the muzzle's been removed--and I'm now free to speak my mind."" In the email, Paul proclaimed a 10-day ""Freedom Bomb"" with the goal of flooding Congress with 20,000 ""Defend Liberty Directives"" letting every member ""know the R3VOLUTION is alive and well."" Paul wrote, too, that the effort’s priority would be forcing the Senate to vote on a proposal to audit the Federal Reserve. Group cites House rules We asked Campaign for Liberty, which says it is devoted to promoting ""individual liberty, constitutional government, sound money, free markets and a noninterventionist foreign policy,"" to illuminate how Paul was censored and muzzled for a year. By email, an unidentified staff member said Paul ""was not allowed to talk about certain things during the past year because of House Ethics Rules. This requires that you stay quiet about certain things for 1 year after your retirement from the House of Representatives."" The staff email included a web link to a document, revised in January 2012, presenting highlights of the House’s ethics rules and a section titled ""Post-Employment Restrictions,"" which the section says apply to House members. According to the section, for one year after leaving office, a member may not communicate with or appear before a member, officer or employee of the House or Senate or any legislative branch office with ""intent to influence official action on behalf of anyone else."" Also, according to the section, a member ""may not represent or advise a foreign government or a foreign political party"" or ""represent oneself, a state or local government, or the U.S. government as an official or employee of a government agency or entity."" Finally, according to the section, a member ""may not lobby the staff of a member in lieu of lobbying the member directly."" Violations of the prohibitions, the section says, are felonies punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. Experts say restriction doesn't leash free speech We spotted nothing there about being leashed from speaking your mind or coaxing others to do so. Experts agreed. Attorney Kenneth Gross, former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission, told us by email that Paul was restricted for one year under the standard one-year ""cooling off"" period for all House members and senior staff; senators face a two-year limit. ""During that time,"" Gross said. ""a former member may not appear before Congress on substantive matters but that restriction does not prohibit public appearances."" By email, another expert, attorney Brett Kappel, who specializes in campaign-related laws, agreed with Gross’ analysis. Melanie Sloan of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which says it promotes ethics and accountability by targeting government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests, told us by phone the one-year restriction could extend to keeping Paul and other former House members from lobbying members by testifying before a committee. Then again, Sloan said, members could still be invited to offer their views on topics. By email, she noted a May 12, 2010, report by the advisory non-partisan Congressional Research Service stating: ""The prohibition goes only to advocacy-type of communications, that is, communications ‘with the intent to influence’ a member or officer or employee of the legislative branch concerning ""any matter on which such person seeks official action"" by that member, officer or employee, or by either house of Congress. There are also several specific exceptions to the general prohibition, including, for example, exceptions for lobbying and advocacy work for state or local governments, testifying on matters under oath, and generally for representations or communications on behalf of political candidates, parties and political organizations."" Upshot: A former House member must take a year off from advocating positions on issues with members of Congress. Sloan and Gross each said, though, that former House members aren’t restricted from generally speaking out. Paul, Gross said, ""was permitted to make public appearances and espouse views. However, he was restricted in making one-on-one appearance(s) before and lobbying members of Congress and staff."" After reading a portion of Paul’s email blast, Sloan commented by email: ""From the missive, it appears Paul does have legislative interests. If he wanted to personally lobby Congress on these issues, he was prohibited from doing so for the past year... Sending emails to supporters trying to galvanize them around issues like auditing the Fed isn’t lobbying and would be permissible. So the concept that every word in these emails had to be reviewed by lawyers to comply with the lobbying ban is nonsense."" Sloan said in a follow-up email: ""I have trouble imagining what Paul wanted to do that he couldn’t do--if he wanted to write op-eds, appear on television, or have speaking engagements, all of that would have been allowed."" Paul spoke out during year A search for news stories using the Nexis news database gave indications that Paul often aired his views in the year at issue. On April 23, 2013, Paul gave an interview to Bloomberg News covering the value of the dollar and also touching on his views of the bitcoin and immigration laws. On June 10, 2013, Paul gave thanks for leakers of documents revealing the government’s eavesdropping efforts, according to a CNN news blog post. A day later, Paul said in a telephone interview on Fox Business News that the government might kill leaker Edward Snowden with a missile. On CNN’s Aug. 15, 2013, ""Situation Room,"" Paul questioned New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s qualifications to be president and said his son, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was prepared to be president. His comments also touched on his concerns about central economic planning by the Federal Reserve. On Sept. 19, 2013, Paul appeared on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe,"" offering his interpretation of an announcement by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve. An Oct. 1, 2013, US News news story quoted Paul describing the temporary government shutdown as ""less of an event than everyone’s claiming it to be."" Paul said generally: ""Republicans and Democrats are basically in agreement with authoritarianism. They believe that one way or another you have to be an authoritarian, to tell you how to spend your money [and] both of them tell you how to run your personal life. And they're both very excited about telling every country what to do, and giving them money if they behave or bombing them if they don't."" In the year, Paul also helped launch the online RonPaulChannel, telling the Washington Times for a news story posted Aug. 8, 2013: ""It will give me an opportunity to talk about the issues I've been talking about for 30 years. But it's in a different format. I won't be cut off from my subscribers because we plan to take their questions through email, interview individuals and go in-depth."" The story quoted Paul as saying that the channel had pulled in 200,000 subscribers within hours of a publicity announcement that week, drawn by his personal guarantee they would not confront censors, or the ""games and lies"" of traditional broadcast and cable channels. The channel’s website has about 40 taped video messages from Paul that were placed online before the one-year cooling-off period ended, starting with an Aug. 15, 2013, commentary on Egypt and the United States extending to a Jan. 2, 2014, commentary on Iran sanctions. Our attempt to reach a spokeswoman for Campaign for Liberty about our findings was unsuccessful. Our ruling Paul said he was censored and muzzled for the year after he left the House. That's not factually supported. Far as we could tell, in contrast, Paul freely voiced his views on issues in most every way possible during the year, though he was barred, as a former member, from directly lobbying lawmakers.

Has the potency of pot changed since President Obama was in high school?
","Apparently, back when President Barack Obama would get high with the Choom Gang, he was tokin’ on some weak product by today’s standards. At least, that’s what one former congressman says. After Obama told The New Yorker that marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol — which opened the door to a broader conversation about legalizing or decriminalizing a drug that’s on the federal government’s most restrictive list, Schedule I — former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., said the president needs to brush up on his pot knowledge. ""I think the president needs to speak to his (National Institute of Health) director in charge of drug abuse,"" said Kennedy, who chairs Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes legalization. The NIH director ""would tell the president that, in fact, today’s modern, genetically modified marijuana (has) much higher THC levels, far surpass(ing) the marijuana that the president acknowledges smoking when he was a young person."" Obama’s exploits as a pot-smoking adolescent are well documented in his own memoir, Dreams from My Father. More recently, in journalist David Maraniss’ biography Barack Obama: The Story, readers learned that Obama as a high schooler in the late 1970s rolled with a group called the Choom Gang — friends from Hawaii who frequently got high. But has marijuana changed that much? We decided to investigate. What is THC? Cannabis contains roughly 500 compounds, 70 of which are psychoactive. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant. The level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain. When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC. THC levels also differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants). Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla. Both of these have become more popular in recent years. But what about marijuana itself? Has weed as we once knew it become more potent? The answer is: yes. THC levels are on the rise, and they have been for quite some time. The University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972. The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 3.4 percent in 1993 to about 8.8 percent in 2008. Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 5.8 percent to 13.4 percent during that same time period. Back in the late 1970s when Obama was in high school (he graduated in 1979), the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent, said Mahmoud ElSohly, director of marijuana research at Ole Miss. Further, the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly, from 3.2 percent in 1993 to 21.5 percent of the 1,635 marijuana samples collected in 2007. But while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count, the high mark in potency (somewhere around 25-27 percent) remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isn’t likely to increase, ElSohly said. How did it get so strong? The former congressman said the reason for the increasing levels of THC is genetic modification. That’s not quite right. Genetic modification or genetic engineering involves altering a substance’s DNA at the molecular level. Producers of marijuana on the illicit market don’t have the ability to pull off those kinds of lab-based modifications. However, genetic selection involves breeding marijuana plants with the highest concentration of THC. Genetic selection, unlike genetic modification, has been practiced for centuries. Think about how we got different breeds of dogs or varieties of tomatoes. Genetic selection is quite prevalent in marijuana, ElSohly said. Drug dealers have steered toward these methods in hopes of creating a product that enables them to sell smaller volume at a higher cost. Cultivation methods that allow growers to control climate, water and soil levels have dramatically improved production as well, he said, and they have a better idea what parts of the plant produce the highest concentration of THC. There is some genetic engineering of marijuana in labs, but it’s not widespread yet and it’s not the cause for the increase, ElSohly said. What does it mean? What does this rise in potency mean in a practical sense? Let’s start with what the National Institutes of Health says, since Kennedy singled out the government agency. Noting that the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana has increased in recent decades, the NIH warns that ""daily use can have stronger effects on a developing teen brain than it did 10 or 20 years ago."" Researchers have warned against marijuana use by teens and even young adults, noting that developing brains have an increased risk of dependency. That was an issue even before potency factored in, though the growing strength of the drug does have health officials more concerned. Those concerns are also directed at populations who had already been advised against smoking marijuana when THC levels were lower, such as individuals with cardiovascular diseases or those with certain mental illness, such as schizophrenia. But for the average adult recreational or habitual user, there’s a lot less certainty about what rising THC levels mean. Only a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels. Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana, they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level. In that regard, THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content: People tend to drink whiskey in shots, wine by the glass and beer by the mug. Marijuana may work the same way, said Carl Hart, a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs. Roger Roffman, a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation, noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today, especially in products like hash oil, meaning we don’t know everything about its potential impact. Beyond dependency, health officials also warn that smoking marijuana can cause paranoia and in some cases anxiety attacks. Hospital visits caused by marijuana are on the rise over the last decade, from 359,795 in 2004 to 540,340 in 2011. However, it is unclear if that is caused by higher potency levels, greater usage of marijuana or other factors. This is all important food for thought, because the debate is ongoing and more research is needed. However, this didn't affect our ruling. Our ruling Kennedy said that marijuana today is ""genetically modified,"" with THC levels that ""far surpass the marijuana"" of the 1970s. Generally speaking, the potency of marijuana has been on the rise since Obama’s youth, though experts disagree about what impact that rise could have on marijuana’s negative health effects, in part because the research so far has been incomplete. The most off-base part of Kennedy’s claim is that the rise in THC levels comes from ""genetic modification."" It’s actually from genetic selection, a very old process of producing desired traits from crops. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jan/24/patrick-kennedy/has-potency-pot-changed-president-obama-was-high-s/

Fox's Kilmeade: Colo. food stamp recipients can turn their benefits into cash at ATMs
","We are a scant few weeks into the era of legal recreational pot in Colorado and so far, there are no reports of increased driving accidents or violence. But Fox News found a different point of concern. Brian Kilmeade, co-host of Fox and Friends, honed in on the connection between pot and food stamps, otherwise known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. ""Can people collecting food stamps in Colorado add marijuana to their shopping list?"" Kilmeade asked. ""Right now, the answer is yes. Because there’s nothing blocking using government benefit cards in pot shop ATMs."" In this fact-check, we are looking specifically at Kilmeade’s claim that people receiving food stamps in Colorado can use an ATM to get cash that they can use in turn to purchase marijuana. We reached out to Fox News and got no response. Federal and Colorado law says that food stamps must be used for food (hat tip here to Media Matters). The U.S. Department of Agriculture says ""SNAP benefits can never be withdrawn as cash."" So if SNAP benefits can’t be withdrawn as cash, how can people use them at Colorado pot shops? They can’t. Colorado gives SNAP recipients a Quest Card, which is basically a debit card. It’s a cover-all card used by people who sign up for SNAP, low-income energy assistance, welfare (Temporary Aid for Needy Families or TANF) or any other aid they might qualify for. People receiving benefits from those other programs can use their Quest Card at an ATM to get cash. But not SNAP, and the card knows the difference, officials with the Colorado Department of Human Services told us. ""The card is programmed to distinguish between a cash withdrawal for TANF, or any other cash benefit, and a food purchase with SNAP dollars,"" said Dan Drayer, the department’s communications director. ""There’s no way they can get SNAP benefits from a machine."" Kilmeade would have been more correct if he had focused on another federal benefit -- Temporary Assistance For Needy Families, or TANF. Nothing would prevent a person with a Quest Card with TANF money on it from using the card in any ATM to get cash, which they could then use to buy marijuana. Two final points. First, marijuana stores do have ATMs. ""Due to the lack of access to banking services for cannabis businesses, purchases generally must be done in cash,"" said Taylor West, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, a trade group. Second, a SNAP benefit card will only work with foods that are the approved by the USDA. A rumor that food stamps could be used to buy marijuana brownies falls flat because no food that can be eaten in the store, laced with pot or otherwise, would be on the government’s list. Our ruling Fox News’ Kilmeade said ATMs give food stamp recipients in Colorado a way to buy marijuana. The technology behind government electronic benefit cards blocks that. While the card could have cash value from another program such as TANF, no ATM would dispense cash based on a person’s food stamp allowance.

Nancy Grace says pot users 'shoot each other' and 'kill families'
","An amusing Web video pits tough-talking former prosecutor and HLN host Nancy Grace against a combative adversary on the subject of pot: Nancy Grace. In one frame, Grace argues smoking marijuana makes users less prone to picking a fight or ""basically starting Mortal Kombat."" They’re more likely ""to lay on the sofa and eat,"" she said while discussing Trayvon Martin having marijuana in his system at the time of death. In the other frame, Grace is heated up about the debate du jour: legalized recreational pot in Colorado. In a recent show, Grace dismissed the arguments of a marijuana advocate who thinks the drug should be legalized and regulated like alcohol. She argued about whether the drug is ""highly addictive"" with Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Mason Tvert, who suggested Grace is against legalization because ""she does not like the people that use marijuana."" She disagreed. ""The reason I’m against legalization of pot is that I’ve seen too many felonies, and I don’t mean pot sales or growing pot,"" she said. ""I mean people on pot that shoot each other, that stab each other, strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families — wipe out a whole family."" Tvert went on to chastise her ""1930s"" tone, and the argument went on. For many, Grace’s comments about people using marijuana and committing violent acts raised eyebrows, so we decided to check it out. HLN publicists did not respond for comment. The consensus among drug and psychiatry experts: Marijuana alone does not propel one to commit acts of violence. Most users are not lighting up and heading over to Fight Club. They want to wind down, not amp up. And while there is evidence that people who commit crimes often smoke marijuana (in part because smoking marijuana is a crime in many places itself), there is little support to back up the idea that it drives people to commit crimes, especially violent ones like Grace described. ""Clearly the majority of users don’t become aggressive,"" said Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and chief of the Division of Substance & Alcohol Abuse at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. ""Definitely in terms of clinical work, violence is not the first thing that comes to mind when people are dealing with marijuana."" That said, marijuana is still a mind-altering drug, and it could have a different effect on people who are predisposed to aggression and anxiety, he said. It could induce fear or paranoia when people cannot process an environment, though some may withdraw instead of reacting aggressively. Other psychologists and psychiatrists essentially agreed with Salloun. ""Other than people driving under the influence, there’s no scientific basis for what she’s saying,"" said Matthew Johnson, associate professor in the psychiatry department at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The effect is often not as dramatic as driving under the influence of alcohol, Johnson said. Usually people who drive while high drive slower, and the impairment is usually noticed when the driver’s attention is divided, he said, akin to the effect of some prescription medications. People who come to treatment facilities are typically using multiple drugs, making it tough to suss out which substance was responsible for a violent act. Violence is not typically associated with the use of marijuana, unless the victim is a ""chocolate chip cookie,"" joked Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, professor and vice chairman of the University of Florida’s Department of Psychiatry and chief of the Division of Addiction Medicine. Levity aside, Teitelbaum stressed some people can still become addicted to the drug, and he worries about more young people using it with further legalization. A spokeswoman for the St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Drug Free America Foundation directed us to a slew of news clips documenting shootings related to marijuana theft, grow houses and co-ops. The clips also highlighted marijuana use of gunmen from some of the country’s most recent and notorious shooting sprees. ""In many cases of violence, such as with Benjamin Bishop, Jared Loughner, James Holmes and the Pentagon shooter, these gunmen actively were or previously had been marijuana users,"" said Calvina Fay, the foundation’s executive director, in a statement. She pointed to a 2012 study by researchers from Duke University, the University of Oregon, King’s College London and University of Otago in New Zealand that highlighted brain development in teens who smoke marijuana. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, relied on data for more than 1,000 people who were tracked from the time they were born to age 38. People who started using marijuana as teens and used it at least once a week showed the biggest loss in IQ points. People who picked up the drug as adults didn’t show the same loss in mental functioning. Johnson, the Johns Hopkins professor, says this research is controversial because it’s tough to eliminate marijuana use from all other factors that make people willing to engage in behavior that isn’t socially acceptable. ""But even if that were true, we’re talking about a small minority,"" he said. ""It’s not a question for the large majority of the public."" Gil Kerlikowske, the White House director of national drug-control policy, released an analysis in May that attempted to show a link between crime and marijuana use. It found that 80 percent of adult males arrested for crimes in Sacramento, Calif., in 2012 tested positive for at least one illegal drug. The most commonly detected drug was marijuana, which was found in 54 percent of those arrested. The analysis didn't say what percentage of the crimes were violent and did not conclude that marijuana was the reason people committed crimes. (A positive urine sample only indicates use in the past month.) FBI data for violent crimes with reported drug and alcohol involvement is not broken down by substance, so there is no telling which violent crimes as reported by law enforcement agencies are at least linked to marijuana use. A 2003 report by the National Bureau of Economic Research found ""surprisingly few"" studies have tried to nail down a direct link between marijuana use and crime. After reviewing related academic studies and crunching arrest and crime data, the NBER researchers determined people involved with violent crimes are also likely to use marijuana, but ""the marijuana use is not necessarily related to their decision to engage in crime."" Their report highlighted a 20-year-old study by the National Research Council that suggested longterm marijuana use may affect a person's nervous system so he or she becomes more violent. Still, the causal link ""remains in question,"" the NBER report said. The researchers did find a positive association between marijuana use and property-damage crimes, particularly among youth. Finally, on the subject of high-profile murderers who use the drug, Johnson said there is bound to be overlap between people accused of murder and those who use marijuana given how popular it is. But the same could be said for people who have blond hair and commit murders, he said. One is not a direct result of the other. Dr. Antoine Douaihy of the University of Pittsburgh College of Medicine said even though he thinks Grace is overreaching, there are concerns about the unknown social risks of legalizing marijuana in more states. Often, he said, people are passionate about the topic without noting nuances or differentiating among legalization, decriminalization and authorizing cannabis for medicinal purposes. Our ruling Grace said, people on pot ""shoot each other ... stab each other ... strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families.""

Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert says 40 years ago, 'hardly anybody' in the U.S. had health insurance
","Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, went on Fox News recently to explain an unusual decision he’d made: intentionally going without health insurance. Fox host Brian Kilmeade asked Gohmert about it during an interview on Jan. 23, 2014. Gohmert told him, ""When Obamacare actually kicked in, just as we knew, if you liked your insurance, as I did -- I had a health savings account -- then I wasn't going to be able to keep it because it doesn't meet the requirements."" Gohmert continued, ""I don't have an extra $1,200 a month. And we are setting money aside in the event we need it. But Brian, don't forget, you know, 40 years ago, hardly anybody in the country had health insurance, and this is one of the areas we really need reform in."" Going without insurance is Gohmert’s decision to make. Presumably, he would be subject to the penalty under Obamacare for not having insurance. That would be $95 per adult or 1 percent of family income, whichever is higher, for 2014, and $325 per adult or 2 percent of family income for 2015, whichever is higher. The penalty goes even higher starting in 2016. For this fact-check, however, we wondered whether Gohmert was right that ""40 years ago, hardly anybody in the country had health insurance."" Gohmert’s office didn’t respond to an inquiry, but right off the bat, we knew there was a problem with this claim. Forty years ago was 1974 -- almost a decade after the creation of Medicare (the universal health care program for Americans age 65 and up) and Medicaid (the health care program for qualifying low-income Americans). By 1975, Medicare was covering almost 25 million Americans, and Medicaid was covering about 20 million Americans. Even accounting for some overlap between the two programs’ beneficiaries, that’s a lot of Americans who had insurance 40 years ago. The U.S. population at the time was about 214 million, so roughly one of every five or six Americans was covered by these two programs alone. But maybe Gohmert was talking only about private insurance. So we located data on that, too. A 2009 paper published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that in 1974, nearly 149 million Americans had private insurance, mostly from their employers but in some cases purchased individually. That works out to four out of every five Americans under age 65 with private insurance coverage in 1974 -- a far cry from ""hardly anybody."" Gohmert’s claim ""might have been closer to being true in the 1930s or ‘40s, but it does not characterize the United States 40 years ago,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. (Here’s an earlier story we published about how health coverage operated prior to Medicare and Medicaid. It’s fair to say that health coverage was a whole lot spottier in the early part of the 20th century.) Michael Tanner, a health-policy specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute, suggested that 40 years ago, insurance may have been more likely to cover big-ticket items such as hospital care and less likely to cover smaller, more routine medical procedures. Tanner appears to have a point. According to 1974 data published by the Social Security Administration, 75 percent to 80 percent of Americans with private insurance were covered for hospital stays, surgery and X-rays, but only about 60 percent were covered for ""office and home visits,"" and about 70 percent were covered for prescription drugs outside of the hospital setting. Still, not even these figures help Gohmert’s case, since even the lower percentages for non-hospital care aren’t anywhere near the trivial numbers of insured Americans Gohmert claimed. Gohmert’s statement is ""just flat wrong,"" Wilensky said. Our ruling Gohmert said that ""40 years ago, hardly anybody in the country had health insurance."" Even ignoring the millions of Americans covered in 1974 by Medicare and Medicaid, 80 percent of Americans under age 65 back then had private insurance coverage, and a solid majority of those plans covered routine doctor visits and prescription drugs in addition to hospital care. These numbers are so far off from Gohmert’s claim that we rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/jan/24/louie-gohmert/texas-rep-louie-gohmert-says-40-years-ago-hardly-a/
"['China', 'Corporations', 'Federal Budget', 'Public Service', 'Workers', 'Virginia', 'Mark Warner']","
Warner says US government is ""largest enterprise in the world""
","No man-made entity is larger than the U.S. government, says Sen. Mark Warner. The Virginia Democrat made the claim last month during an interview on a radio show hosted by one of his colleagues, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. Warner was stressing his trademark theme: that Congress needs to take a more organized and long-range approach to budgeting instead of going from crisis to crisis. ""I think if folks across America understood how crazy what we were doing in that the largest enterprise in the world is the federal government of the United States of America,"" he said. ""The single largest subset of that is the Defense Department. When you run that large an enterprise on three- and six-month short-term funding resolutions, you actually cost the taxpayer more money that you save because you stop and start contracts, you’re not able to hire people for a long period of time...The amount kind of lost to the taxpayer as well as what it does to our military preparedness, for example, staying on defense, is a huge, huge issue."" We wondered if the U.S. government really is the biggest show on earth. Warner spokesman Kevin Hall sent us links to the president’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2014, which ends in September, and to news articles listing the revenue and employee figures for large corporations. Let’s look at employees first. According to White House figures, Uncle Sam employed the equivalent of about 4.3 million full-time workers during the 2013 budget year, which ended Sept. 30. Of them, about 1.5 million are in the military and another 800,000 are civilian workers at the Department of Defense. For comparison, Warner’s office sent us a list of largest worldwide employers published in 2012 by the BBC. We searched on our own for a more current list, but couldn’t find one. Here are the largest employers, behind the U.S. government: There’s a problem with these figures, however. They don’t offer-to-apples comparison of central government employment in the United States to that in China, the world’s most populous country. Although the data give us an idea of the size of China’s military and its two largest state-owned companies, experts say there is no reliable data on how many people are employed in all sectors of the Chinese government. Two years ago, Liu Xirong, a member of the National People’s Congress in China, cited what he said were official figures showing his nation’s bureaucracy had grown from 6 million public servants in 2006 to 10 million in 2010, according to an article in News China. In response, the State Administration of Civil Service said China’s number of public servants stood at 6.89 million in 2010. These figures did not include state-owned enterprises and organizations, which would grow the number to more than 30 million, News China reported. Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies China’s economy, said it’s reasonable to include the employees of state-run corporations in the count. But even if you don’t, logic says China’s rolls of government workers would be longer than the United States’ roster of 4.3 million employees. ""In the U.S., labor is expensive and we have substituted technology as shown by the large decline in clerical workers,"" he said. ""In China, technology is expensive and workers are cheap. I do not know of any fully comparable data. I would be quite confident that on most comparisons, China's workforce would be larger, if for no other reason than the size of its army and security forces."" In addition to number of employees, Warner’s office also told us it defines ""largest enterprise"" by the money an organization takes in and spends. We were pointed to the latest information in the CIA’s World Factbook. It shows the U.S. in 2012 -- with $2.5 trillion in revenues and $3.5 trillion in expenses -- topped all nations in both categories. China, by comparison, collected $1.9 trillion in and spent $2 trillion. Those figures don’t include revenues for China’s state-run corporations which, if added up, would easily exceed the U.S. government’s cash flow. The United States’ budget figures dwarf the finances of the largest corporations in the world. According to CNNMoney’s list,  Royal Dutch Shell had the largest revenues last year -- $482 billion. It was followed by WalMart, $469 billion; Exxon Mobil, $450 billion; Sinopec Group, $428 billion; and China National Petroleum, $409 billion. Our ruling Warner said the U.S government is the largest enterprise in the world. His staff said the statement was based on the federal government’s employment and budget. The claim runs aground in China. Warner’s office cites statistics that compare the employment of the U.S. government to parts of the Chinese government, but not the whole. China has issued conflicting numbers on its total number of civil servants, but they all greatly exceed the number of workers paid by the U.S. government. Warner is on better footing on the budgeting side of his claim. A variety of widely used statistics shows no government or corporation raises and spends more money than the U.S. So Warner is wrong on one of measurements and right on the other. We’ll split the difference and rate his statement Half True.  ",/factchecks/2014/jan/24/mark-warner/warner-says-us-government-largest-entity-world/
"['Georgia', 'Economy', 'Income', 'Jason Carter']","
Carter on target on family income
","Anyone listening to the Republican governor’s State of the State address and the Democrats’ response left with a head-full of statistics. Gov. Nathan Deal’s numbers were upbeat about the state economy under his watch. The ones from the Democratic minority, not so much. Jason Carter, a Democratic state senator from Atlanta running for governor, gave the Democratic response. For a moment, it looked like the 2014 race for governor was in full swing. Among the claims by Carter, the grandson of former governor and President Jimmy Carter, was that Georgians have taken a pay cut over the past decade. ""Adjusted for inflation, the average Georgia family in effect makes $6,000 less than the average family did 10 years ago,"" Carter said. Have families really taken that kind of financial hit? PolitiFact Georgia wondered. We deemed that a factoid worth checking. A Carter spokeswoman sent us a link to a U.S. Census Bureau report that she said was part of the basis for the senator’s comments. We looked at that report and found some very bleak numbers for Georgia -- reflected accurately in Carter’s comments. He actually was conservative in saying what’s happened to Georgia’s median family income. He said it was down $6,000. The U.S. Census Bureau report said it was actually $6,682 less in 2012 than in 2002, when inflation is factored in. In 2012 dollars, the median family income in that period fell from $54,803 to $48,121, the census report states. That brought Georgia down considerably in the state rankings for median family income, Carter pointed out. Carter uses terms ""average"" and ""median"" interchangeably, though technically they are not the same. Average is the sum of all income divided by the number of households, and median is just midpoint of all household incomes. Jeffrey Humphreys, director of the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia, said the outcome would likely be about the same under either calculation. ""I doubt that the rankings (etc.) would be very different regardless of whether or not the median or the average family income is used,"" Humphreys said. Experts generally believe -- and officials in the governor’s office say -- that the fall in the median family income occurred because the epicenters of the last two recessions were industries that account for an above-average proportion of Georgia’s economy. Specifically, the dot-com, or 9/11, recession hit Georgia’s outsized information industry and air transportation industries. Then, Georgia got hit harder than the nation by the Great Recession and underperformed during the first years of the recovery because of its heavy dependence on construction and real estate development, Humphreys said. The state took direct hits in those industries and indirect hits in the large building materials manufacturing and forestry industries, he said. Humphreys prefers to look at per capita personal income data, instead of median family income, although, from each, essentially emerges a less-than-pretty picture. The per capita income data shows that Georgia began losing ground relative to the nation in 1997, Humphreys said. ""Since then, we’ve seen an almost continuous slide of per capita income in Georgia relative to the U.S.,"" he said. Georgia dropped 15 places in the national rankings, from 25th highest per capita personal income in 1996 to 40th in 2012, Humphreys said. In 2012, Florida, Tennessee and North Carolina fared better than Georgia, with their per capita personal income ranking of 27th, 34th and 38th respectively. Alabama and South Carolina trailed the state, ranking 42nd and 48th respectively. Deal officials cite other numbers showing that the economy is improving. They point out that Georgia’s unemployment rate — while 40th for the nation at 7.7 percent in November 2013 — is still the lowest it has been in five years. Jobs are coming back in retail, financial services and construction. But they are still at pre-recession levels. And manufacturing and information-tech jobs are still down, latest figures show. Our ruling Carter said that an average Georgia family in effect makes $6,000 less than the average family did 10 years ago. PolitiFact Georgia’s research shows Carter didn’t exaggerate the problem with median household income. If anything, he underestimated it.

Scott Walker says typical property tax bill this year will be lower than in 2010
","In an hour-long State of the State speech, Gov. Scott Walker made 42 references to taxes while unveiling proposals for additional income- and property-tax cuts. One statement in particular grabbed our attention. ""With the tax controls we already put in place, property taxes on a typical home in December of 2014 will actually be lower than they were in December of 2010."" The Republican governor says that even before his new plan for more property tax relief would kick in, he and GOP lawmakers already have lowered the typical bill by virtue of past tax controls they put in place. Is he right? Walker draws his numbers in part from reports by the respected, non-partisan budget scorekeeping agency, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Every year, the bureau estimates the property tax bill of a median-valued home taxed at the statewide average property rate. It’s an illustration, not a real-world example. Even if your home is right at that statewide average, your results might be different due to various factors. And there are other variations -- higher and lower -- due to property values and levies in individual communities. Statewide, combined property tax collections for 2014 are likely to be somewhat higher than they were in 2010, noted Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. That’s partly because the controls put on school districts and municipalities were not absolute. But the Fiscal Bureau’s single-property illustration is an oft-used benchmark that politicians use to communicate state budget math in a down to earth fashion. The bureau’s numbers: In December 2010, just before Walker took office, this hypothetical median home had a tax bill of $2,963. The projected figure for the end of 2014 is lower by $9 -- $2,954. (Walker also cites a state Department of Revenue report that puts the decrease at $8). It’s a tiny drop, but it’s worth noting that from 2006 to 2010, the typical bill went up by $230. So the turnaround is significant. A major factor in the drop are the tax and spending restraints Republicans have placed on local governments and schools during Walker’s tenure. We gave Walker a Promise Kept for virtually freezing property taxes in his first budget. Additionally, the property tax picture was affected by the negative news in the home market. The recession and its aftermath pushed down home values, dropping the median-valued home from a peak of $172,000 in 2008 to $148,000 by 2013. It’s projected to pop up to $151,000 by December 2014, the Fiscal Bureau estimated. Those falling home values contributed to smaller bills, said Knapp. Finally, it’s important to note that the figures Walker relies upon are projections subject to change. So when he says the median bill ""will actually be lower"" it should be kept in mind that we don’t know that yet. But that’s what the projection shows -- and it will be helped if legislators approve Walker’s new plan for even more property tax savings. Our rating Walker said, ""With the tax controls we already put in place, property taxes on a typical home in December of 2014 will actually be lower than they were in December of 2010."" It wasn’t all because of the Republican actions, and the claim is based on projections that could change. But the governor’s main point is solid based on the specific citation he highlights from a respected source. With the caveats noted, we rate this Mostly True.

Voting-rights activist says one-quarter of disenfranchised felons in U.S. live in Florida
","A few days before the Martin Luther King holiday, voting rights activists held a protest in front of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi’s Tampa office. Their goal: to make it easier for ex-felons (or ""returning citizens"") to regain the right to vote once they complete their sentence and leave prison. Voting access -- including restoring the rights of felons to vote -- could be a hot topic during the governor’s race this year. In 2011, Bondi, the newly elected Republican attorney general, spearheaded a move by the Florida Cabinet to make it more difficult for felons to regain the right to vote upon completion of their sentence. And in a Jan. 15, 2014, post on BloggingBlackMiami announcing the protest in Tampa, the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition called out the state for its record on disenfranchising ex-felons: ""Of the approximately 6 million disfranchised citizens in the Unites States, one-quarter are Floridians,"" said Desmond Meade, one of the event organizers and President of FRRC. ""Florida's disfranchisement rate is the highest in the country, more than 10 percent of the state's voting age population is disfranchised, and a shocking 23 percent of Florida's African-American population is disfranchised. Many of those who have lost voting and civil rights are men and women of God: preachers, pastors, deacons and apostles."" (""Disfranchised"" and ""disenfranchised"" mean the same thing -- we will use ""disenfranchised"" in our report.) We wondered whether Meade was correct that a quarter of disenfranchised Americans who were convicted of felonies are Floridians. Felon disenfranchisement in Florida ""Felon disenfranchisement"" refers to laws that restrict voting access for residents convicted of felonies. When voting rights activists talk about ""disenfranchisement"" more generally, that can also include other reasons citizens can’t vote, such as not being able to comply with voter ID laws. But we’re not looking at that broader category here, only at ex-felons. Scott and Charlie Crist -- Scott’s predecessor as governor, and now his opponent as he runs for a second term -- have clashed over the restoration of felon voting rights. (Scott is a Republican. Crist was elected as a Republican but is now running as a Democrat.) PolitiFact Florida previously fact-checked a claim by Dan Gelber, a former state House Democratic leader from Miami Beach, who wrote on Crist’s campaign website that Crist, during his tenure as governor, ""sought for and got approved the automatic restoration of felon rights for nonviolent offenders for the first time in Florida history (since reversed by Governor Scott)."" We rated Gelber’s claim False because Gov. Reubin Askew pushed for similar reforms in 1975, and as a result of our fact-check Gelber added some information about Askew’s role. Still, it was correct that Crist did ease voting-rights restoration for some ex-felons, even if some advocates said the changes didn’t go far enough. Under the reforms Crist spearheaded in 2007, ex-offenders convicted of less serious offenses could regain their rights without a hearing, while those convicted of crimes such as murder would require a more thorough investigation and a hearing. The new rules enabled more than 150,000 restorations, though a backlog of 100,000 remained unsettled by the time Crist he left office, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In February 2011, Bondi argued that the process was too easy for released felons. So in March, the Cabinet scrapped the process and set a minimum five-year waiting period. Under those new rules, 954 ex-cons have had their rights restored through mid January. Felony disenfranchisement nationwide and in Florida The Florida Rights Restoration Coalition argues that Florida should automatically restore felons’ rights to vote upon completing most of the terms of their sentence. Meade, the president of the coalition, is an ex-felon convicted of cocaine possession and possession of a firearm in separate cases about a decade ago. He is now a law student at Florida International University on track to graduate in May. Meade said he applied to get his voting rights back in 2011 but was rejected. Meade’s claim stems from research by two sociology professors -- Christopher Uggen of the University of Minnesota and Jeff Manza of New York University -- who published the book Locked Out: Felon Disenfranchisement and American Democracy in 2006. Nationwide, they found, approximately one out of 40 voting age Americans can’t vote due to a felony conviction. The numbers in each state vary because each state has different voting prohibition rules -- and Florida is among the most restrictive in the nation. Their most recent updated figures show 1.5 million disenfranchised Americans in Florida, as of December 2010, out of 5.85 million disenfranchised nationally. That’s roughly 25 percent. (The Sentencing Project, another advocacy group, used Uggen’s data to create a state-by-state map.) ""In 2010, more people were disenfranchised in Florida than in any other state and Florida’s disenfranchisement rate remains the highest among the 50 states,"" Uggen wrote in a 2012 paper. We interviewed Uggen, who has been researching the numbers of disenfranchised citizens since the late 1990s. Uggen acknowledges in this paper that his numbers are partly based on estimates. ""It is an estimate -- it’s not a head count,"" Uggen told PolitiFact. ""We try to use reasonable and conservative assumptions in specifying in these models so we are not exaggerating the populations but the fact is the numbers mount pretty quickly in states that disenfranchise former felons."" The straightforward part are the numbers of felons who are in prison now and those on probation or parole -- that comes from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The trickier part involves ex-offenders who finished their sentences -- that accounts for about 45 percent of his total, or about 2.6 million nationally. We should note that Uggen was an expert witness on behalf of plaintiffs who filed a federal class-action lawsuit against then-Gov. Jeb Bush, Crist’s Republican predecessor, that sought to overturn a voting ban for felons. However, we asked a spokeswoman for the Florida Parole Commission -- the entity that oversees restoring the right to vote -- whether the commission had any information to support or refute Uggen’s numbers. We received a one word answer: no. (A spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections and Bondi’s office had referred us to the parole commission.) Our ruling Meade said that of the approximately 6 million disenfranchised felons in the United States, ""one-quarter are Floridians."" The numbers come from research done two professors, Uggen and Manza, who concluded that 5.85 million felons couldn’t vote nationally as of December 2010, including 1.5 million in Florida -- about a quarter.  However, part of the researchers’ totals are based on an estimate of ex-cons who have completed their sentences but still can’t vote. We couldn’t find any alternative calculations, but different methods of estimation could reveal different figures. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jan/23/desmond-meade/one-quarter-disenfranchised-felons-live-florida/

Wisconsin college tuition: Average increases 5.5%, never before been frozen two straight years?
","One accomplishment Gov. Scott Walker claimed Jan. 22, 2014 in his State of the State speech is of particular interest to students attending college in the University of Wisconsin System. And their parents. ""After years of 5.5 percent average tuition increases,"" Walker said, ""we now have a two-year tuition freeze for the first time in the history of the UW System."" This is likely a statement Walker will repeat as the campaign for the November 2014 gubernatorial election picks up steam. Knowing that tuition rates vary among the different UW System institutions -- four-year universities vs two-year colleges, for example -- we wondered if the increases have averaged 5.5 percent and if there has never before been a two-year tuition freeze. The system The UW System is made up of 13 four-year universities, 13 freshman-sophomore colleges and the statewide UW-Extension. Altogether, the system serves some 181,000 students each year and employs more than 39,000 faculty and staff, with an annual budget of $6 billion. The system was created in 1974 by a law that merged the state’s two public university systems under an 18-member Board of Regents. That board -- 16 members are appointed by the governor and two are state school officials -- sets tuition. Generally speaking, the regents request that 65 percent of instructional funding come from state general fund money and the remaining 35 percent from tuition. Freezing Before we dive into the numbers, it’s important to note there are four tuition rates within the UW System: one for UW-Madison; one for UW-Milwaukee; one for the other four-year schools, such as Superior, Eau Claire and La Crosse; and one for the two-year colleges, such as UW-Fox Valley and UW-Waukesha. The two-year tuition freeze Walker highlighted in his speech has gotten plenty of news coverage. It was included in his 2013-’15 state budget, which became law in June 2013. The governor had proposed the freeze the previous month amid anger over how the UW System cash reserves had grown in recent years even as tuition kept increasing. A table listing tuition rates that was posted by the UW System in January 2014 shows that once before, in 2000-’01, there was an across-the-board freeze for all four tuition rates. There have never been back-to-back, across-the-board tuition freezes until the current one, which covers 2013-’14 and 2014-’15. But for the two-year colleges, tuition was locked for four straight years, from 2007-’08 through 2010-’11. 5.5 percent As for the 5.5 percent part of Walker’s claim, here's a look at each of the four rates. UW-Madison: Tuition rose 7.9 percent to $9,273 in 2012-’13, the table shows. Over the previous five years, tuition increases ranged between 5.5 percent to 9.73 percent. That includes a base tuition increase of 5.5 percent each year, plus an additional ""differential"" approved by the regents and UW-Madison students, UW System spokesman David Giroux told us. Money from differentials, which are also done by other UW campuses, gets targeted to needs such as high-demand classes that need more instructors, he said. UW-Milwaukee: Tuition rose 5.5 percent to $8,091 in 2012-’13. The increases were also 5.5 percent in each of the previous five years. Other four-year schools: The rates of increase were the same as at UW-Milwaukee. Tuition for 2012-’13 was $6,298. Two-year colleges: After the four-year freeze, tuition rose 5.5 percent in each of the next two years, and was $4,750 in 2012-’13. Our rating Walker said: ""After years of 5.5 percent average tuition increases, we now have a two-year tuition freeze for the first time in the history of the UW System."" Tuition increases were 5.5 percent or more for at least the two years before the current two-year freeze, depending on whether you’re considering tuition at the four-year universities or the two-year colleges. The current freeze is the first two-year freeze system-wide, but not the first for the system’s two-year colleges.

Filmmaker claims 6,000 oil and gas spills in 2012, more liquid spreading than 1989 Exxon Valdez
","Some environmental advocates object to calling the seepage of 7,500 gallons of coal-cleaning chemicals into the Elk River (thereby cutting off access to tap water for 300,000 West Virginia residents) as a ""spill."" Environmental activist and documentary filmmaker Josh Fox offered ""state of permanent criminal negligence"" as an alternative descriptor in a Jan. 19 appearance on MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry. ""A spill is something that happens by accident. You knock over one of these cups on the table, that's a spill,"" said Fox, director of the 2010 documentary Gasland. ""We had 6,000 oil and gas spills in 2012. That was 16 a day, amounting to more oil and gas spreading in the United States than the entire Exxon Valdez spill."" Fox’s statement is a bit different from the topic at hand, as the chemical storage facility leak in West Virginia is not an onshore oil or gas production site. Still, we were intrigued by Fox’s statistic and emailed him about his figure. Fox replied with a July 2013 investigation by EnergyWire that almost precisely offered the same information. The story, part of EnergyWire’s five-part ""Overflow"" series, took reporter Mike Soraghan four months to report. Soraghan examined state and federal data for onshore oil and gas sites in 2012. There is no central, uniform reporting system for companies to report oil and gas leaks at onshore drilling sites, so Soraghan compiled data from 16 oil states using computer-assisted reporting methods. By his count, the best one available, 2012 saw more than 6,000 reported spills ""and other mishaps"" at onshore oil and gas sites, amounting to ""more than 16 spills a day"" and ""more than the volume of oil that leaked from the shattered hull of the Exxon Valdez in 1989."" Most of the incidents were 100-gallon leaks that could be contained and cleaned up in a day, Soragan wrote. In sum, the spills amounted to at least 15.6 million gallons of oil, fracking fluid, contaminated wastewater and other liquids spilled in 2012. The Exxon Valdez oil spill, in which a tanker hit a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, resulted in more than 11 million gallons of crude oil spewing from its hull. The EnergyWire report tallies several kinds of toxic spills, not just gallons of crude oil. That's not a perfect comparison to the Exxon Valdez, of course, but it does show the relative scope of accidents occuring at oil and gas sites. Soragan says his number for onshore well spills is an undercount for several reasons, including the fact that some states where drilling is popular don’t always include the amount of liquid, and he did not include spills from offshore wells, interstate pipelines, or from trains. He points out that North Dakota had the most spills in 2012, but it could be a result of its more stringent reporting standards compared to other states (minimum of 1 barrel, or 42 gallons, compared to 10 barrels in Oklahoma and Montana and a 5-barrel threshold in Texas). ""If there was doubt, I left it out,"" he said. (Interestingly, Soraghan authored a fact-check of Fox’s documentary and its attackers when the film was nominated for an Academy Award.) The federal government maintains data for offshore site spills (like the 2010 BP Gulf of Mexico disaster) and some onshore spills at the federal National Response Center and for pipelines at the Department of Transportation. The rest is often left to states. ""We imagine that the number is bigger because there are probably spills that haven’t been identified yet and haven’t been reported,"" said Anna Mall, senior policy analyst for land and wildlife program of the National Resources Defense Council. ""It’s a pattern in the country that we’re very concerned about."" Spills that occur at well sites usually happen before a well moves into its formal production phase, said Kenneth B. Medlock III, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University. And as Soraghan’s report points out, they are cleaned up rather quickly and do not have much effect on the environment. ""In general, operators do everything they can to avoid release of any product because oil and gas production volume is what earns the return for the expenditure on the well,"" Medlock said. Medlock told us finding a true tally for the number of oil spills is difficult because it requires meticulous tracking of well records and an ability to understand the extent -- and therefore the impact -- of a ""spill."" In 2011, the BP rig explosion and oil spill still fresh in the public’s mind, CBS News published a similar investigation for incidents and wells, as well as pipelines, from 23 oil- and gas-producing states and federal agencies. ""Not counting the BP disaster, we found at least 6,500 spills, leaks, fires or explosions nationwide -- that's 18 a day. Overall, at least 34 million gallons of crude oil and other potentially toxic chemicals were spilled. That's triple the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill."" We checked in with oil and gas industry officials to see if we were missing anything. The American Petroleum Institute directed us to a 2009 report about overall American oil spill trends from many sources -- refineries, pipelines, cargo ships, offshore wells -- over the last several decades prepared by an outside environmental consultant. According to the study, overall oil spillage is down 77 percent since the 1960s-70s. However, as the EnergyWire report points out, decreases over the previous decade were mainly at offshore platforms and pipelines, refineries and transportation vessels (but not tanker trucks). Spillage at inland production wells increased, according to the American Petroleum Institute report. Our ruling Filmmaker-activist Josh Fox claimed the country had ""6,000 oil and gas spills in 2012, ... amounting to more oil and gas spreading in the United States than the entire Exxon Valdez spill."" He correctly cites an energy publication’s investigation about the number of spills at oil and gas sites in 2012. We can’t independently verify the data, as there’s no central hub for it and the reporter compiled it mainly from state agencies over four months. The comparison to the Exxon Valdez spill, however, requires a bit more explanation. The report measures oil, fracking fluid and contaminated wastewater spills, which Fox short-handed to ""oil and gas."" That's not 100 percent correct and requires a minor clarification. As such, we rate Fox's claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jan/23/josh-fox/documentary-filmmaker-josh-fox-claims-6000-oil-and/

No, courts did not 'quietly confirm' MMR vaccine causes autism
","With a measles outbreak currently spreading in Washington and New York, old rumors about the MMR vaccine are starting to pop up online. One story recently resurfaced after it was shared in a Facebook group called ""Vaccine Resistance Movement: VRM Updates & News From The Trenches."" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found the article misleads readers about information related to the potential adverse side effects of the MMR vaccine, which is used against measles, mumps and rubella. The story, posted on alternativenewsnetwork.net, is actually the same account published in 2013 on a blog called WhiteOutPress. The story was debunked by Forbes when it first came out. The center of the ""courts confirm"" claim comes from a 2012 finding of an Italian court that linked a child diagnosed with autism to the MMR vaccine the child received a year earlier. The court relied heavily on the now retracted and discredited 1998 Wakefield MMR Lancet paper, which was deemed scientifically and ethically flawed because of deliberate fraudulent conduct. Wakefield’s medical license was later revoked. In several subsequent studies since, scientists have not been able to show any association between the MMR vaccine and autism. The court also heard the testimony of one doctor, Massimo Montinari, who was hired by the child’s parents and known to encourage parents to avoid giving their children vaccinations. Montinari also wrote a book on how vaccines cause autism and touted an autism ""cure"" that he allegedly created, Forbes reported. In 2017, he was reportedly suspended for six months due to a lack of scientific evidence that his method, for which patients are said to have paid thousands of euros, was effective. The alternativenewsnetwork.net story also claimed vaccine ""courts"" in the United States are paying off families whose children experience adverse side effects after being vaccinated in an attempt ""to buy their silence."" But this court is actually a long-standing mechanism called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), which was established on Oct. 1, 1988, to evaluate vaccine injury claims. It was borne out of the The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 after a series of lawsuits threatened to cause vaccine shortages and reduce U.S. vaccination rates, possibly causing a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases. ""Most people who get vaccines have no serious problems, but like any medicine, they can cause side effects – most of which are rare and mild,"" the program’s website says. ""In very rare cases, a vaccine can cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction. In those instances, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) provides individuals with an opportunity to file a petition or claim for financial compensation."" In regard to autism specifically, after thousands of parents had filed claims under VICP that alleged vaccines had caused their children’s autism, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims created an Omnibus Autism Proceeding — similar to a class-action lawsuit — to resolve them. Three special masters were appointed to evaluate three test cases from the group. Ultimately, the court denied compensation and ruled that evidence presented in the cases did not prove a link between autism and certain early childhood vaccines, MMR included. In a statement shortly after the release of the decisions, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a statement saying, ""Hopefully, the determination by the Special Masters will help reassure parents that vaccines do not cause autism."" A years-old story claims courts have ""quietly confirmed"" the MMR vaccine causes autism. The story relies heavily on a 2012 Italian court case, which was based on a retracted and discredited 1998 study. It also incorrectly suggests that U.S. ""courts"" are quietly paying off families for vaccine-linked autism cases. In fact, the well-known National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has evaluated vaccine injury claims since 1988. A link between autism and vaccines has been disproved by court proceedings and several scientific studies. The story misrepresents the relevance of court rulings and provides obscure examples and sparse evidence.

Was there one school shooting a week in 2018, as a Florida lawmaker said?
","Florida Democrat Rep. Alcee Hastings criticized President Donald Trump for ignoring the topic of gun violence during his State of the Union address. Trump’s speech came nearly a week before the anniversary of the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that left 17 people dead. Lawmakers invited three fathers of children who died to watch Trump speak. Hastings, of nearby Boynton Beach, called on Trump to support gun control and cited a statistic about school shootings nationwide. ""In 2018, we endured a school shooting nearly once a week,"" Hastings said in a statement to the media. Hastings' spokesman told us he arrived at the one-shooting-per-week statistic by citing a database of school shootings compiled by Education Week, a national education publication. Hastings divided a 180-day school year by 24 shootings to arrive at one shooting every 7.5 days. It is not apparent from Hastings' statement that the underlying data lumps together various types of shootings on school property — everything from indiscriminate mass shootings to an accidental shooting. There is no consensus about how to define a school shooting. Some tallies include shootings in which someone was killed or injured, for example, while others may include only K-12 schools and not colleges and universities. ""No two school shootings are alike and therefore the circumstances surrounding each must be assessed and considered,"" stated a 2018 report by the Naval Postgraduate School Center for Homeland Defense and Security, which examined more than two dozen shooting databases. ""Choosing to include or exclude any of these criteria comes with a level of risk by directly affecting the statistical narrative on school shootings."" The count by Education Week includes 24 school shootings on K-12 school property that resulted in firearm-related injuries or deaths. Shootings that happened on school grounds during school or a school event are also counted. Suicides and self-inflicted injuries are not. Other groups arrive at higher totals by looking at every time a gun goes off on school property. A database from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, found at least 102 incidents of gunfire on school grounds, including K-12 as well as colleges, in 2018. The Naval Postgraduate School database found 97 school gun violence incidents in 2018, the most in any year. (In 2018, none of the incidents were only cases in which a gun was brandished; a gun went off each time.) Hastings' statement is on the lower end of these tallies, but that doesn't make it more precise. Experts offered some key caveats about Hastings’ statement and databases of school shootings. Jaclyn Schildkraut, an associate professor in the Department of Public Justice at the State University of New York at Oswego, said that Hastings’ statement omitted context that he was referring to an academic year. If he applied the same 24 shootings to a calendar year, it would have worked out to a shooting incident every other week. But Schildkraut and other experts have warned that it creates confusion when mass shootings are combined with other types of shootings that occur on school property — for example, two people getting into a fight after a school sporting event. Most of the shootings are not the indiscriminate mass shootings such as Parkland or Sante Fe. Schildkraut said she would consider about six on the list of 24 as school shootings. The database includes incidents such as two people shot in a fight outside a high school football game, a parent shot when a gun discharged accidentally in another parent’s pocket, and three students were injured when a teacher accidentally fired his gun in a classroom as he was teaching a gun safety lesson. These various types of shootings require different responses, Schildkraut said. ""We are not going to do a threat assessment on every person who goes to a football game, but we would on a troubled student,"" she said. While each loss of life by firearm is too many, ""the way we respond to events needs to actually take into account the totality of the situation and not only there was a gun at the school."" Education Week acknowledges the difficulty in coming up with a methodology. Staff writer Evie Blad explained that ""setting — and sticking with — a simple definition was more elusive than we expected."" Nine of the 24 school shootings determined by Education Week resulted in deaths — or about one per month in an academic year. ""In sum, the one-per-week statement can easily be misunderstood without such clarification,"" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. While mass school shootings draw the most attention, the majority of children and teenagers killed by a gun are shot somewhere other than school, such as at home or on the streets. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that school-associated homicides consistently represent less than 2 percent of all youth homicides in the United States when examining data from 1994-2018. Hastings said, ""In 2018, we endured a school shooting nearly once a week."" He arrived at that figure by looking at the 24 school shootings documented by Education Week and dividing that into a 180-day school year. (If we applied the same math to a calendar year, it would work out to half that amount.) A statement about the number of school shootings warrants an explanation of what types of shootings were included. The Education Week database includes any K-12 shooting on a school property during school or a school event that resulted in injury or death. That means it includes both indiscriminate mass shootings as well as other types of incidents such as fights in a parking lot after a football game or an accidental shooting. Hastings’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details about the database he cited. We rate this statement Half True.",/factchecks/2019/feb/11/alcee-hastings/was-there-one-school-shooting-week-2018-florida-la/

No, viral photo does not show the KKK at the 1924 Democratic convention

PolitiFact has already fact-checked a claim that the Ku Klux Klan was formed by the Democratic Party (that’s false, and you can read why here). But did Klansmen crowd the 1924 convention? Well, there was a gathering of the KKK across the Hudson River on the 10th day of the political convention that year — but this photo that's making the rounds on social media is not from that event. Here's what we know. The Democratic National Convention was held at Madison Square Garden in New York in 1924. Back then, according to the New York Times, the KKK was ""the most powerful bloc in the Democratic Party."" It was the longest convention in American history, the paper reported in the March 15, 2016, story, replete with fistfights, roosters and the defeat of a resolution some delegates proposed that would have condemned the KKK. The convention is often referred to as the ""Klanbake,"" according to Politico. During the convention, 20,000 klansmen attended a rally across the river in New Jersey. But the photo pictured in the Facebook post isn’t from that rally, or from the convention. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, Arthur Vinje, a photographer for the Wisconsin State Journal, took it in Madison, Wisconsin, on Dec. 2, 1924. Klansmen were parading down King Street to Schroeder Funeral Home for the funeral of a police officer, Herbert Dreger.

Preckwinkle misrepresents Mendoza’s death penalty stand
","A few months ago we gave a Mostly False rating to a claim by Chicago mayoral candidate Susana Mendoza that, as a member of the Illinois House in 2011, she had cast the deciding vote to abolish the state’s death penalty. Mendoza, now the state comptroller, did vote to end executions, but records and news reports from those days made it clear that the fate of the measure didn’t turn on her support. Now, mayoral rival Toni Preckwinkle is out with a new ad that revisits Mendoza’s death penalty stand. It uses selective and deceptive video editing of a House floor speech by Mendoza just prior to that Jan. 6, 2011 vote to make it wrongly appear she was an enthusiastic supporter of capital punishment. But there was a lot more to Mendoza’s remarks that the Preckwinkle campaign chose to leave on the cutting room floor. And those deletions tell a very different story. Transcripts of the House debate from the day in 2011 that Mendoza spoke make clear that her point was to describe an evolution in her thinking. She opened her remarks by explaining how the day marked ""the end of a long and difficult journey"" for her on the issue, and then talked about her earlier push to expand the death penalty. That is where Preckwinkle’s ad picks up. In the ad, Mendoza’s line about how she could administer the death penalty ""‘...and sleep like a baby at night…’"" is emphasized with text. What both the edited footage and those ellipses leave out, however, is that she was referring only to cases where she knew ""without a doubt"" that a convicted criminal was ""a cop killer or a serial murderer."" The ad also cuts off Mendoza’s remarks a sentence before she reaches her main point — that too many people on death row in Illinois had later been found innocent. ""This debate for me is no longer about whether or not guilty killers deserve to die for their crimes, they do deserve to die,"" Mendoza said, according to the debate transcript, just as she does in the ad. But she then went on to describe how the state’s track record of sentencing people to death row who were later exonerated had changed her mind. ""I have come to realize that in order to ensure that justice is served in the form of death to an evil cancer in our society we must accept the possibility of executing an innocent person. I'm not OK with that and none of us should be OK with that,"" she said at the time. Preckwinkle’s ad not only omits all that but also leaves the impression that Mendoza was arguing to keep the death penalty in place. It does that by juxtaposing the selectively edited portions of her remarks with an old citation from a story by FactCheck.org that references the state’s woeful record of wrongful convictions. The problem of course is that Mendoza, in the remarks the Preckwinkle ad chose to omit, specifically refers to those wrongful convictions as the reason she had changed her mind about the death penalty. When we reached out to Preckwinkle’s campaign to ask why it considered the ad an accurate representation of Mendoza’s record, spokeswoman Monica Trevino responded with an email highlighting a House vote by Mendoza in 2001 for the death penalty expansion. She also sponsored that bill. ""Mendoza, despite her vote in 2011, gave testimony at that same time saying she still believed in the death penalty, and that she could administer the death penalty herself and sleep like a baby at night,"" Trevino added. ""The ad was reflective of her extreme values on this issue."" With highly selective editing, Preckwinkle’s ad uses video clips from a speech Mendoza gave on the Illinois House floor in 2011 in which she declares opposition to the death penalty to leave the impression that she actually remained an enthusiastic supporter of it. While it is true that a decade earlier Mendoza backed an expansion of the death penalty, the speech from which the clips are taken made an entirely different point. She had changed her mind and wanted to end capital punishment in Illinois because the state had sentenced too many people to death row that later had been found innocent. Indeed, Mendoza then voted for a measure that abolished the death penalty. None of that footage or context was used in the ad, which grossly misrepresents Mendoza’s position.

Trump supporter spreads fake news about NC governor, yearbook photo
","Old yearbook photos received new attention this week after an image of Virginia’s governor emerged and jeopardized his political career. A page for Gov. Ralph Northam in the 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook features a photo of a man in blackface and another man in Ku Klux Klan robes. Northam, a Democrat, apologized for the photo on Feb. 1, then later claimed neither man is him. In North Carolina, similar racist images in the 1979 UNC yearbook emerged on social media. At least one political activist, prompted by a story published in a British news organization, tried to tie the blackface scandal to the N.C. Governor’s Mansion. Here are the facts, as of Feb. 8: To detect fake news, readers can look for specific things when they encounter questionable claims. In this case, the false claim about Cooper apparently evolved from a misleading headline. Here’s how it happened. A TWEETED PHOTO About 1:45 pm on Feb. 6, Colin Campbell, editor of the NC Insider, part of The News & Observer, tweeted photos from the 1979 UNC-Chapel Hill yearbook. (PolitiFact NC, which wrote this fact check, is a partnership of PolitiFact and The News & Observer.) One of the photos shows two white students dressed in white hooded robes like those worn by the Ku Klux Klan. The students are holding onto a noose that was around the neck of another white student, who was covered in blackface makeup. The photo appeared on a yearbook page for the Chi Phi fraternity. Cooper was in a different fraternity – albeit one with a similar-sounding name – called Chi Psi. Chi Psi was known for being inclusive and had several black members at the time, according to Brad Kutrow, a lawyer in Charlotte who on Feb. 8 spoke with News & Observer reporter Jane Stancill. A MISLEADING HEADLINE Later on Feb. 6, the UK-based DailyMail.com posted a story about the photos. But a Daily Mail headline said, ""Blackface lynch pics from Roy Cooper North Carolina yearbook."" The Mail’s tweet said: ""Blackface lynching pictures from UNC Chapel Hill 1979 yearbook emerge - the same year NC Gov Roy Cooper graduated."" Although the headline doesn’t specifically say the governor was in the controversial photos, readers could interpret it to mean he was. A subheadline says, ""Cooper was in the different Chi Psi fraternity did not feature on their pages,"" but that subheadline is in smaller font. It takes several paragraphs for the story to clarify the facts. The fourth paragraph says: ""There is no suggestion that Cooper is in any of those photos."" In the ninth paragraph, the Daily Mail reports: ""Cooper was a member of a different fraternity, Chi Psi, and while the 61-year-old from Nashville is indeed pictured in his yearbook edition, he does not feature on his frat page according to a list of students who don’t appear."" (This sentence is verbatim from the article, though it doesn’t make sense.) A FALSE TWEET On Feb. 7, conservative activist Jacob Wohl tweeted the 1979 photo of the UNC students in the white robes and blackface. ""BREAKING: Racist picture of Democrat North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper emerges just days after he called on Ralph Northam to resign - Daily Mail,"" Wohl tweeted. He didn’t include a link to his source, nor did he respond to a question from PolitiFact. As of Feb. 8, PolitiFact isn’t aware of any photo of the governor in racist attire. And PolitiFact found no Daily Mail story that specifically implicates the governor. The Daily Mail’s headline is misleading, but its story doesn’t support Wohl’s statement. Nonetheless, Wohl’s tweet was retweeted by 3,000 accounts and likely seen by thousands more. Wohl has more than 181,000 followers. After his tweet, several Twitter accounts repeated Wohl’s claim. A HISTORY OF MISINFORMATION Wohl has a history of making dubious claims. He recently claimed that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, a senator from California, is ineligible to run for president. PolitiFact rated his claim Pants on Fire. Wohl’s Twitter account might not raise red flags on first glance. He has a ""verified"" Twitter account, has hundreds of thousands of followers and is constantly tweeting. So how would anybody be able to guess that the account is spreading misinformation? Wohl doesn’t link to the original Daily Mail article which, while misleading, clarifies that Cooper is not in the photo whatsoever. A quick Google search with keywords including ""Cooper"" and ""blackface"" tell a different story than the one Wohl presents. Headlines from mainstream news outlets focus on the fact that these photos are associated with the university and not the governor. It’s also important to know who the source is, and that can be done with another Google search. NBC News has described Wohl as a ""pro-Trump conspiracy peddler."" If there are statements or claims you’re unsure of, send them to us through our tip page or email us. OUR RATING Wohl tweeted, ""Racist picture of Democrat North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper emerges just days after he called on Ralph Northam to resign - DAILY MAIL.""

There's no evidence that Muslim immigrants are responsible for most of London's knife attacks
","England has experienced a surge in knife crime, but are Muslim immigrants responsible for a majority of attacks? ""What politicians and the (mainstream media) refuse to tell you,"" reads a Feb. 4 Facebook post featuring a photo of a bloody hand clutching a knife. ""In the past 12 months, 13,000 knife attacks were committed in London. 11,000 of those we’re (sic) done by Muslim immigrants."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s take it piece by piece. First, consider the time period. The past 12 months is approximately February 2018 to January 2019 but the most recent data available from the Metropolitan Police Service, London’s police force, is December 2018. During the calendar year of 2018, there were 14,700 recorded knife crimes, according to the service. That’s more than the Facebook post claims. Knife crime was on the rise in London prior to 2018. In a foreword to ""The London Knife Crime Strategy,"" published in 2017, Mayor Sadiq Khan said, ""Our communities are sick and tired of the damage being done by knife crime,"" singling out the city’s ""most troubled young people"" as both potential victims and offenders. Seventy-five percent of victims of knife crime are males younger than 25, according to police data from 2016 and 2017. Among male offenders, more than half were described as black males younger than 25. ""There is a huge overlap between victims and offenders,"" according to the knife crime plan. Next, let’s look at who the offenders might be. The 80-page document makes no mention of Muslims or immigrants. Rather, in a section titled, ""Who are the offenders and who are the victims,"" the plan cites a police analysis that found almost 90 percent of offenders were male in 2016 and 2017, and of those, 62 percent were people described as having black, Asian and other minority ethnic backgrounds A public information request PolitiFact sent to the Metropolitan Police Service on Feb. 5 seeking information about the 2018 offenders’ religion, ethnicity and immigration status was not immediately answered. The service doesn’t release information about the religion or immigration status of criminal suspects, said Callum Jones, a spokesman for the service. ""There is no way that police or any other agency would have released statistics based on the religion and/or immigration status of offenders, so the information is clearly false,"" he said of the Facebook post. ""We don’t normally give out ethnic breakdown of perpetrators/victims,"" Jones also said. But he added that ""knife crime disproportionately affects boys and young men of African-Caribbean heritage."" In the 12 months through November 2018, 94 percent of offenders were male. It’s relatively unusual for a violent incident to involve a knife in England, according to a BBC story from Nov. 5, 2018. ""Most violence is caused by people hitting, kicking, shoving or slapping someone, sometimes during a fight and often when they’re drunk."" Knife crime is more prevalent in large cities, like London, the BBC reported, saying that the reasons cited range from police budget cuts to gang violence. Finally, lacking hard numbers proving the claim true, we turned to some experts. Stephen Case, a criminology professor at Loughborough University in England called the Facebook post ""absolute nonsense."" He said he hasn’t seen any police statistics that substantiate it. ""I would doubt that the police collect stats on immigration status or religion at point of arrest,"" he said. ""This one’s pretty outlandish!"" said Iain Brennan, a psychologist who studies criminology at the University of Hull in England. The claims about the religion and immigrant status of offenders are unlikely to be verifiable, he said, because they’re not official categories that the country’s Ministry of Justice would include in their statistical releases. ""At the very minimum,"" he continued, ""it’s false because the date of posting means it would be impossible for the fact to be verified as any claim would have to be based on convictions, which take a long time to occur."" Where does that leave us? We could find no data showing that Muslim immigrants are responsible for most knife attacks in London. A spokesman for the city’s police service denied that the claim was true, and academics we reached out to concurred. The burden of proof is on the Facebook post, and discovering no evidence to corroborate its claim, we rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2019/feb/08/viral-image/theres-no-evidence-muslim-immigrants-are-responsib/

It's not clear Ben Carson suggested illegal immigrants should be stripped of citizenship
","Did President Donald Trump’s secretary over the Department of Housing and Urban Development claim that undocumented immigrants who vote illegally should lose their citizenship?

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Close (and not-so-close) readers will have realized that undocumented immigrants don’t have citizenship in the United States. We reached out to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to ask whether Carson, who was sworn in to lead the department in March 2017, ever said ""illegal immigrants caught voting should be stripped of their citizenship."" A spokesman for the agency said did not respond to PolitiFact’s email. He also did not answer PolitiFact’s questions about a column Carson wrote in 2014. We discovered the column after searching and failing to find a legitimate source of the statement. While Carson doesn’t say in the column what this post attributes to him, there is similarity. ""Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked,"" wrote Carson, who went on to launch a 2016 bid for the Republican nomination for president. MSNBC, among others, pounced. ""Ben Carson: Strip citizenship from non-citizens who vote,"" the headline on the Nov. 13, 2014, story said before wondering about the logic behind Carson’s idea. ""If these are non-citizens, as the context suggests, how can they have their citizenship revoked? If they’re citizens, where are they being deported to?"" The MSNBC story cites a column WND.com published on Nov. 11, 2014: ""A common-sense prescription for immigration reform."" When we visited the website on Feb. 5, the line was no longer in the column. However, it also appears in Carson’s 2015 book, ""What I Believe: A Collection of My Syndicated Columns,"" under the title ""As Long as U.S. Leaders Game the System So Will Illegals.""   Let’s look at the sentence in context. Carson said: ""As long as we reward people who break laws, they will continue to break laws. We do need a continual flow of immigrants, but choosers need not be beggars. We make decisions based on our needs. People who refuse to comply with the rules must forfeit chances of legalization in the future. Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked. The point is this: we must create a system that disincentivizes illegal immigration and upholds the rules of law while providing us with a steady stream of immigrants from other nations who will strengthen our society."" No states run their elections exactly the same, but across the country, citizenship is a requirement to to vote in U.S. elections. Noncitizens, including permanent legal residents, cannot vote. Depending on the state, people with felony convictions or people who are mentally incapacitated can’t vote either. Our ruling As far as we can tell, Ben Carson never said ""illegal immigrants caught voting should be stripped of their citizenship,"" as the Facebook post claims. He did say that someone involved in voter fraud should lose their citizenship and be deported. But there’s enough ambiguity in his words that it’s possible to interpret them multiple ways. He could have meant that naturalized citizens should lose their citizenship if they engage in voter fraud, though barring other circumstances—if they have a felony conviction in some states and voted anyway, for example—casting a ballot wouldn’t be illegal on its own. He could have meant that Americans who commit voter fraud should lose their citizenship, though it’s unclear where they would be sent should they be deported. And because he espouses his idea in a column about illegal immigration, he could have meant what the Facebook post says: That undocumented immigrants who commit voter fraud should lose their citizenship (though they wouldn’t have citizenship if they were undocumented immigrants). The Facebook post assumes that’s what he meant—it’s not clear from his column—and goes one step farther, attributing to Carson what appears to be a made-up quote.

No, border barrier did not drive down crime in El Paso, Texas
","As he promotes his border wall, President Donald Trump holds up El Paso, Texas, as a successful test case. ""The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities,"" Trump said during his Feb. 5 State of the Union address. ""Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives."" That wasn’t the first time Trump hailed El Paso’s barrier as a solution to crime. And it might not be the last: Trump plans to be in El Paso on Feb. 11 for a campaign rally. But the claim is not true. To start, El Paso has not been considered one of the nation’s most dangerous cities. Its violent crime rate has been significantly below the national average compared to cities of similar size. Even more, the violent crime rate went up — not down, as Trump claimed — after the construction of a border fence in the region. An FBI tool allows users to view violent crime rates reported by police agencies, from 1985 to 2014. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program classifies four offenses as violent crime: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Every year from 1985 to 2014, El Paso’s violent crime rate was significantly lower than the average for all localities of similar size. (Note: Not all departments reported data every year.) El Paso falls under the 500,000 through 999,999 population group (24 cities total). Other cities in that group were Tucson, Ariz., Boston, and Fort Worth, Texas. Immigration and crime researchers told us that El Paso historically has not been regarded as one of the most dangerous cities in the United States. ""El Paso has been considered one of the safest cities, even when El Paso's sister city of Juárez (Mexico) has been one of the most violent in the world,"" said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an associate professor of government at George Mason University, whose expertise includes Mexico-U.S. relations. The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s questions regarding the specific years or barrier on which Trump based his claim. It’s possible that Trump echoed remarks from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Paxton at a Jan. 10 border security roundtable told Trump that a barrier over 100 miles long was placed in El Paso, and then the crime rate became one of the lowest in the nation. ""I think it was under the Bush administration,"" Paxton told Trump. In a news release, Paxton’s office later said he was talking about a 131-mile fence completed in 2010. Texas does have about 131 miles of pedestrian fencing. But not all of it is in El Paso, and it’s been added over several periods. Former President George W. Bush signed the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for the construction of barriers at the southwest border, including the El Paso region. About 42 miles of fencing were built in the El Paso Sector between August 2008 and July 2009, said a report from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It’s unclear which specific fencing finished in 2010, as Paxton’s office said. Still, Trump’s boast of an immediate crime drop doesn’t hold up. In 2007, the year before fence construction started, El Paso’s violent crime rate was 417.8 offenses per 100,000 population. From 2007 to 2010, the rate increased 5.5 percent. From 2007 to 2011, the rate increased 3.2 percent. It also increased from 2006 to 2011, by 9.6 percent. Even though the violent crime rate went up after the fencing, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the fence caused the spike, said Charis E. Kubrin, a criminologist at the University of California-Irvine. Likewise, if the violent crime rate had gone down, it’s improper to say it was just because of the fencing, she said. ""If you really want to make a conclusion in one direction or another, you have to do a study that isolates the impact of a wall on crime, controlling for other factors,"" Kubrin said. Empirical data suggests no significant difference in the average violent crime rate in border and non-border metropolitan areas, said a 2016 border security report from the Congressional Research Service. ""The specific impact of border enforcement on border-area crime is unknown, however, because available data cannot separate the influence of border enforcement from other factors,"" the report said. Trump said, ""The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country."" Crime data shows that El Paso has not been one of the most dangerous cities in the nation. From 1985 to 2014, El Paso’s violent crime rate was significantly lower than the average for cities of comparable size. Border authorities added fencing in the El Paso region in the late 2000s. In the immediate years before and after construction, the violent crime rate went up, contrary to Trump’s claim. Trump’s statement is inaccurate.

On expanded Medicare proposal, Cory Booker cites nonexistent CBO study
","Sen. Cory Booker, as most Democratic presidential candidates, says he backs some form of Medicare for All. When pressed during an appearance on CBS to say how much the universal government health insurance program would cost, the New Jersey Democrat answered a different question. ""Even the (Congressional Budget Office) says if you lower Medicare to allow 50 year olds to get into it, you can not only save the government money, but you can lower premiums for all Americans,"" Booker told CBS News on Feb. 4. There is no such CBO report. We reached out to Booker’s office, and staff told us he was drawing from a 2017 article in Health Affairs that floated the idea of mandatory enrollment in Medicare when people turn 55 — not 50, as Booker said. The article also didn’t predict the savings that Booker described. Insurance markets aren’t simple. Yes, pulling people ages 55 to 64 out of the private market would leave a younger and healthier population behind, which could leave room for lower premiums. Yes, putting that same age group into Medicare would reduce the average cost per person in Medicare. But the government would still have to pay for the care those 55-to-64-year-olds received. With higher costs, Washington would need new revenues. The article said, ""The costs of Medicare-at-55 would have to be borne by the younger population."" It suggested a 1 percentage point hike in the payroll tax, plus a surcharge on employers who provide insurance to their workers. Tricia Neuman, director of the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Medicare policy program, said figuring out the total impact on government spending gets even more complicated when the Affordable Care Act policy subsidies and expanded Medicaid are factored in. ""It would depend on the change in average spending for these 50-to-64-year-olds in the marketplace compared to Medicare, fewer people getting subsidized coverage in the marketplace, and fewer  people getting coverage through Medicaid expansion."" Neuman is unaware of a full net cost estimate. By the way, current proposals to open Medicare to people as young as 50 offer early enrollment as an option. The Health Affairs article talked about making it mandatory at age 55. Booker said the CBO had reported that allowing 50-year-olds into Medicare would save the government money and reduce premiums for everyone. The senator’s office acknowledged there is no such CBO report. The article behind Booker’s statement discussed a different idea — making it mandatory for people 55 and over to switch to Medicare. While it said there would be some follow-on savings, it also said there would be higher costs, and it made no attempt to say what the net effects would be.

Wisconsin state Rep. John Nygren hits pay dirt with property tax claim
","Many homeowners are currently receiving receipts stamped ""Paid"" in the mail for their 2018 property tax bills. Whether the bill goes up or down each year is of paramount importance to homeowners. So politicians are also eager to weigh in on the issue. ""Today, property taxes are lower than they were in 2010. Allowing taxpaying to keep more of their hard-earned money has been and will continue to be a top priority,"" state Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, said Jan. 11, 2019 in a tweet. Property taxes are levied on most types of real estate -- including homes, businesses, and parcels of land. The amount owed depends on the fair market value of the property, as determined by the local assessor. Is Nygren right? Are property taxes lower today than they were in 2010? The evidence The year 2010, of course, is not an arbitrary starting point. It marks the year Republican Scott Walker was elected governor and when the GOP won full control of the Legislature. Democrat Tony Evers is now in the governor’s office, after topping Walker in the 2018 election. When asked for backup to the claim, Nygren’s chief of staff Nathan Schwanz pointed to a January 2019 report from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau on median property tax payments in the state. The nonpartisan fiscal bureau is considered the gold-standard on such financial and budget issues. Here is its breakdown for the years in question: 2010 - 2011-- $2,963 2011- 2012 -- $2,953 2012 - 2013 -- $2,943 2013 - 2014 -- $2,926 2014 - 2015 -- $2,831 2015 - 2016 -- $2,849 2016 - 2017 -- $2,852 2017 - 2018 -- $2,876 2018 - 2019 -- $2,870 (preliminary estimate)   So, the 2018-19 total is, indeed, lower than the 2010-11 total. The fiscal bureau regularly does such estimates, and they are routinely cited by politicians of both stripes.

But it’s important to note they are an illustration -- some people's property taxes went down, some went up. Even if your home value was right at the statewide average, your tax bill might have been higher due to various factors, including levies in individual communities. Past ratings Meanwhile, we have checked variations of this claim in the past: *July 15, 2015: Walker claimed that because of his actions, property taxes were lower than they were four years earlier. Walker’s actions to limit the ability of local governments and school districts to raise levies played a major role. But we found the lower property taxes to that point were also due in part to declines in housing values. Our rating: Mostly True. *Jan. 13, 2017, Walker said property taxes -- as a percentage of personal income -- were ""the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II"" An analysis by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance showed that on the measure Walker cited, they were lowest since 1946. Our rating: True. *June 7, 2017, after a ""lower than 2010"" claim from Walker, we wrote that fiscal bureau estimates of the hypothetical property tax on a median-valued home found the tax was indeed lower. That time we found the drop in residential property taxes was due to commercial and manufacturing properties rising at a faster rate -- not due to collecting less revenue. Our rating: Mostly True. Finally, we also used the Walk-O-Meter to monitor a promise by Walker to continue to reduce the tax burden on working families and seniors every year he was in office. This, of course, applied to all taxes -- not just property taxes. We rated the pledge Promise Kept.   Are there any wrinkles this time? Yes. According to the fiscal bureau, the change over the latest two years -- from 2017-18 to 2018-19 -- is a net decrease for homeowners, even though the gross tax bill is projected to increase. What’s behind the difference? Funding for the lottery and gaming property tax credit increased by about $66 million, which contributed to the decrease in the median net tax bill.   Where Wisconsin ranks To be sure, Wisconsin property taxes remain among the highest in the United States. Various property tax trackers place Wisconsin in the top 10, sometimes in the top five. The personal finance website WalletHub analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The website also used rates to obtain the dollar amount paid in real estate taxes on a median-valued home in each state. It ranked Wisconsin as the fifth worst state for property taxes. With the median home value sitting at $167,000, the typical tax bill comes to $3,257, according to WalletHub. Filling out the rest of the top five for 2018 were:
  Median Home value                     Taxes New Jersey: $316,400            $7,601 Illinois:  $174,800                  $4,058 New Hampshire: $239,700     $5,241 Connecticut: $269,300            $5,443 Wisconsin: $167,000              $3,257 But Nygren’s claim was not about the state’s rank. So that does not factor into our rating. Our rating Nygren said ""today, property taxes are lower than they were in 2010."" Data from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau shows the statement generally rings true. But there have long been wrinkles on these claims -- from declining property values driving the drop to an increase in commercial and manufacturing property values shifting the burden from homeowners. Those sorts of factors are still in play, this time with tax credits contributing to latest decrease. And the rating is still Mostly True.

Facebook post repeats unsubstantiated claims on Red Cross CEO pay, donations
","Over its 138-year history, the American Red Cross built a reputation for helping people in times of need. But the organization has come under intense scrutiny in recent years over its emergency response efforts and fiscal management. Questions of propriety have dogged the $2.7 billion charity following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Haitian earthquake in 2010 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. A popular social media post draws on some of that scrutiny, while managing to spread its own inaccuracies. The post, which has been shared on Facebook more than 242,000 times since April 2018, reads: ""Marsha J. Evans president and CEO of the American Red Cross. Salary of $651,957 plus expenses. Only 9 cents of every dollar donated to the American Red Cross goes to helping people in need."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are a few issues here. First, Marsha J. Evans has not been the president and CEO of the Red Cross since she stepped down in 2005. The current CEO — Gail McGovern — does not make quite that much per year. More importantly, there's no evidence that only 9 cents per dollar goes toward helping people in need. This claim derives from an outdated rumor that surfaced over 10 years ago, in one form or another. After it started getting shared again as a chain email around 2012, the Red Cross issued a statement addressing it. The charity said that McGovern’s base salary was $500,000 and has been since she joined the organization in 2008. Since the statement was released several years ago, we looked at more recent records and reached out to the organization to get their updated figures. In the organization’s 2017 Form 990 filing, the most recent available, McGovern was reported as making a base salary of $500,000 but her total reportable compensation came in at $603,564, which includes bonuses and incentives ($100,000) and expenses and other allowances ($3,564). An additional $18,392 accounts for her retirement and benefits. ""This is considered in the middle range for executives of large nonprofits like the Red Cross, an organization with an overall budget of more than $2.7 billion a year,"" Red Cross spokesperson Greta Gustafson said of the $500,000 base salary, which she said has been unchanged. ""McGovern has personally given more than $500,000 in charitable donations to the American Red Cross since becoming CEO in 2008."" The post claims the Red Cross only uses 9 cents out of every dollar toward helping people, and that is simply not true. In a response to the claim, Gustafson said that the organization keeps its expenses low and ""an average of 91 cents of every dollar the American Red Cross spends is invested in humanitarian services and programs."" But that 91-cent figure has been called into question, too. In 2014, ProPublica and NPR challenged the Red Cross over the validity of its then-frequent claim that ""91 cents of every dollar that's donated"" goes to services. According to the NPR and ProPublica analysis, fundraising expenses cost the organization between 14 and 26 cents on every donated dollar. And that doesn’t account for additional overhead. Following that reporting, the Red Cross changed its wording to say, as Gustafson told us, that 91 cents of every dollar ""spent"" goes toward humanitarian services and programs. But NPR and ProPublica called that claim misleading as well because of the billions Red Cross spends selling blood to health care providers: ""Of the more than $3 billion that the Red Cross spent last year,"" reporters Jesse Eisinger and Justin Elliott wrote at the time, ""two-thirds was spent not on disaster relief but rather on the group's blood business."" Charity Navigator, which evaluates the financial health, accountability and transparency of more than 9,000 charities, reports that the Red Cross spends about 89.3 percent of its total expenses on its programs and services, 4.2 percent on administrative expenses and 6.4 percent on fundraising expenses. Over its three most recent fiscal years, the website calculated, the Red Cross spent 27 cents on fundraising efforts for every dollar donated. Red Cross fundraising expenses also meet the standards set by nonprofit watchdogs. The Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance says that fundraising expenses should not exceed 35 percent of related contributions. A Facebook post shares an outdated rumor about the American Red Cross, claiming that CEO Marsha Evans makes ""$651,957 plus expenses"" and ""only 9 cents of every dollar donated"" actually goes to helping people in need. Marsha Evans is no longer the Red Cross CEO, and the current CEO and president, Gail McGovern, made $603,564 in 2017, with benefits, allowances and expenses factored in. When it comes to the percentage of donor dollars that go toward helping people in need, it is a little more murky. The organization has long touted that an average of 91 cents of every dollar donated is spent on humanitarian efforts, but that number has been challenged before, with different reports estimating it may be as low as 73 cents on every dollar. Still, we found no evidence or any report that puts that number as low as 9 cents, as the post claims.

Yes, President Trump, Congress also investigated Barack Obama
","President Donald Trump, facing a newly installed Democratic House majority with the power to hold oversight hearings on the executive branch, vented on Twitter that he was subject to a double standard in congressional investigations -- ""unlimited presidential harassment,"" as he called it. In a pair of tweets on Feb. 7, 2019, Trump teed off on Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff has announced the committee will look at connections between the Trump campaign and Russia: ""So now Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so. Never happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment. The Dems and their committees are going 'nuts.' The Republicans never did this to President (Barack) Obama, there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt!"" ....The Dems and their committees are going “nuts.” The Republicans never did this to President Obama, there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt! In this article, we will look at whether Republican-led congressional committees ""never did this to President Obama."" Short answer: They certainly did investigate Obama, though the subjects were different. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. During the Obama years -- as in previous presidencies -- Congress regularly asserted its right to conduct oversight on the executive branch. This oversight can be particularly aggressive when at least one chamber of Congress is controlled by the opposite party of the one holding the White House. For the final six years of Obama’s presidency -- 2011 to 2017 -- Republicans controlled at least one chamber of Congress. Not all congressional committee investigations are identical -- some target in-the-weeds concerns deep within executive branch departments, far from the higher echelons of the White House. But others quickly take on a partisan cast, with the findings reflecting on the president, his top aides, or his core agenda. We’re not aware of any congressional investigations into Obama’s personal finances, as could happen to Trump, whose business and real estate holdings are much more extensive than Obama’s. One possible Democratic effort, to obtain Trump’s tax returns, wasn’t needed under Obama because Obama released his voluntarily, as had all presidents going back to Richard Nixon. But while the nature of the controversies were different, we found at least five examples of congressional investigations in which congressional Republicans used the investigation process to put Obama on the political hot seat: • Loans to the solar company Solyndra. The company collapsed after taking a $535 million federal loan guarantee, and Republicans noted that a campaign bundler for Obama was a key investor. The loan default prompted an investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. • Alleged political bias at the Internal Revenue Service. This controversy involved charges that IRS officials were unfairly targeting conservative groups for unusual scrutiny in applications to become a tax-exempt organization. This attracted an investigation by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, and a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee. • The Benghazi consulate terrorist attack in 2012, in which four Americans died, including the U.S. ambassador. The circumstances surrounding the attack were investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, several House panels led by the House Intelligence Committee, and a specially created House Benghazi committee. In 2015, the specially created committee called Hillary Clinton -- who had been secretary of state during the attack and who was widely expected to run for president -- for a full day of televised testimony. (The two Senate investigations were actually conducted by a Democratic majority of a Democratic president.) • The ""gun-walking"" program known as Fast & Furious, in which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, partly during Obama’s presidency, allowed guns to be sold to Mexican nationals in the hopes of tracking down drug cartel leaders. The program was investigated jointly by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. • The botched 2014 launch of the Affordable Care Act website, healthcare.gov. At first, the website was largely inoperable, though the government was eventually able to fix it. The rollout was the subject of hearings by the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, the Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee, and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. It’s worth noting that prior to becoming president, Trump himself tweeted actively about these five controversies, mostly to cheer on the probes or to criticize the Obama administration. According to searches through the Trump Twitter Archive, Trump tweeted 15 times on Solyndra, 13 times on Fast & Furious, three times about the IRS bias controversy, 58 times on Benghazi, and 28 times about the problems of the Affordable Care Act website. Trump tweeted, ""The Dems and their committees are going ‘nuts.’ The Republicans never did this to President Obama."" Obama didn't face the types of investigations of his personal and financial life the Trump did, partly because Obama was more transparent about his holdings and his personal finances were less complicated. Still, the Republican-led House and Senate actively pursued several investigations in which Obama and his administration were put through a wringer. The topics included Solyndra, Fast & Furious, alleged IRS bias, Benghazi and the Affordable Care Act website. To one degree or another, the Republican-led probes -- often conducted by overlapping committees in one or both chambers -- were a mix of legitimate governmental oversight and partisan warfare.

Premiums have gone up 160 percent in West Virginia in 4 yrs — bankrupting families & destroying choice.""   Just how much have premiums gone up in West Virginia in the last four years? We took a closer look. Premiums have gone up, but not by as much as Morrisey said. Morrisey’s office pointed to a document published on May 23, 2017, by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. The document broke down premiums by state between 2013 and 2017. A table in the report said that premiums in West Virginia rose from $261 in 2013 to $702 in 2017, a 169 percent increase. By this measure, Morrisey actually understated the increase slightly. But there are two caveats to note. First, the period 2013 to 2017 is not the most obvious interpretation of ""premiums have gone up 160 percent in West Virginia in 4 yrs,"" because data also exists for 2018 and 2019. And second, the choice of 2013 data adds a complication, said Linda Blumberg, a fellow at the Urban Institute specializing in health care policy and the Affordable Care Act. That’s because Obamacare mandates -- such as barring denials of applications and requiring certain ""essential benefits"" -- hadn’t kicked in yet. Regulations changed in 2014, making it difficult to compare 2013 with 2017. ""The 2013 plans, on average, had lower actuarial value, covered fewer benefits, and excluded significant segments of the population -- those with significant health problems or risk of health problems,"" Blumberg said. Because of this, ""the premium comparisons are inappropriate across the periods, unless of course, you want average in the infinite premiums charged to people denied coverage outright, or the very high premiums charged to people who decided the plans offered were not worth the high prices charged to them."" Morrisey’s office also provided updated data showing that the premiums for West Virginia using this method rose from $702 in 2017 to $855 in 2018. That demonstrates continued premium hikes -- a 228 percent increase over 2013 -- but in addition to using the problematic base year of 2013, this covers a span of five years, not four, as Morrisey had said. So what does the data look like over the most recent four years, from 2015 to 2019? This is an apples-to-apples comparison because the Obamacare mandates were in place all four years. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on health policy, tracks data on Affordable Care Act premiums by state. According to the foundation, the average benchmark premiums for West Virginia in the online insurance marketplace have risen from $289 in 2015 to $596 in 2019. That’s an increase of 106 percent. Using this measure, premiums did rise over the period Morrisey mentioned, though not quite as high as the 2013-to-2017 premiums did. Blumberg offered a similar figure -- 94 percent -- for the same period, using an online tool that tracks the state-by-state change in the lowest-priced ""silver"" premium, a mid-range category of coverage. Blumberg added that the 2018 and 2019 premiums experienced an extra bump because Morrisey’s fellow Republicans in the Trump administration stopped paying for cost-sharing subsidies directly, meaning that insurers have had to work those costs into their premiums. Morrisey said that Obamacare premiums ""have gone up 160 percent in West Virginia in 4 yrs."" The source cited by Morrisey’s office offered a figure close to 160 percent, but it used data for 2013 to 2017, which is not the most recent data. Also, it’s important to know that there was a change in the regulatory rules in 2014. However, the actual rise in West Virginia premiums over the most recent four-year period, while not quite as fast as Morrisey said in his Facebook post, has been substantial. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/feb/07/patrick-morrisey/did-obamacare-premiums-rise-160-percent-west-virgi/

There are holes in President Trump’s claim about the San Diego border wall
","In his State of the Union Address this week, President Donald Trump pointed to San Diego’s border fence with Mexico as an example of where ""walls work and walls save lives."" ""San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings,"" he claimed. Given the many arguments for and against Trump’s border wall, we decided to fact-check the second part of the president’s claim, that the San Diego barrier ""almost completely ended illegal crossings."" Was it the barrier that led to this dramatic change? Or did other factors help reduce illegal entries? We set out on a fact check. Our research  The president is correct about the dramatic drop in illegal border crossings, which are measured by border patrol apprehensions. Those arrests in the San Diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630,000 in 1986 to 26,000 in 2017, according to the Associated Press. The biggest drop took place in the late 1990s, several years after San Diego’s first border fence was built. But illegal entries across the entire Southern border, and not just in San Diego, have been on the decline for nearly two decades. They’ve dropped from more than 1.5 million in 2000 to less than 500,000 in 2018, according to the The New York Times. Based on these news reports, plus interviews with experts on the border and a 2007 Congressional Research Service report, PolitiFact California found that San Diego’s fencing was not the only reason for the dramatic decrease in illegal crossings.   ""It’s not only the fence,"" said Victor Clark-Alfaro, a Latin American Studies professor at San Diego State University. ""It has to do with (expanded) job opportunities in Mexico, it has to do with rhetoric from Trump."" The federal government ""also increased technology and staffing,"" added Paola Avila, vice president of international business affairs at the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. ""You need to see the whole picture."" The White House did not respond when asked about Trump’s statement. Doubling of border patrol agents The Congressional Research Service is Congress’ nonpartisan public policy research arm. The research group’s 2007 report found migrants successfully bypassed, or in some cases went through, San Diego’s initial, primary fence in the early 1990s. That led to the construction of a triple-layer fence plus a more-than doubling of border patrol agents and an increase in technology used to stop the illegal entries. ""Although much of this reduction in apprehensions in those stations and in San Diego sector may have been due to the construction of the triple-fence,"" the report said, ""the sector also saw an increase in other resources that may account for part of the reduction. For example, the number of agents assigned to the San Diego sector increased significantly during this period — from 980 agents in 1993 to 2,274 in 1998. Additionally, the number of underground sensors deployed in the San Diego sector almost tripled from 1993 to 1998, and the fleet of vehicles increased by over 150% over the same period."" David Shirk, professor of political science and international relations at the University of San Diego, said in an email that the added physical barriers in San Diego helped reduce illegal crossings. But the rapid increase in border agents also played a key role, Shirk said, by diverting ""migrants to other crossing points east of San Diego, in much more dangerous mountain and desert areas, causing thousands of people to die due to exposure to the elements over the last 25 years."" Avila, of the San Diego regional chamber, cited one more piece of the border picture: Tunnels. She said dozens of completed tunnels have been discovered under the San Diego border in recent decades, potentially skewing the number of illegal crossings and the notion that fencing alone prevents unauthorized migration. Our rating President Trump claimed San Diego’s border fence ""almost completely ended illegal crossings."" He’s right that border patrol arrests have plunged, declining 96 percent along the San Diego sector, from 1986 to 2017. The biggest drop took place in the late 1990s, after a triple-layer barrier replaced an initial fence built in 1993. But experts on the border, along with a congressional report, show San Diego’s border fence was only one factor in helping reduce the crossings. A surge of border patrol agents, vehicles and technology along with improved economic opportunities in Mexico all played important roles. Trump’s statement ignores these key factors, giving credit only to the barrier. We rate his claim Half True.

No, Stacey Abrams didn't dismiss agriculture because people can buy food at groceries
","Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate who gave the Democratic rebuttal to Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, has come under fire from some critics for her rebuke of the president. Among the salvos lobbed at Abrams in the hours after both addresses was the charge that she dismissed agriculture, claiming people can buy their food from the grocery instead. ""Who needs agriculture when you can just get food at the store?"" a Facebook post published on Feb. 5 alleges Abrams said. ""Yes, she actually said this and is really this damned stupid."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A spokeswoman for Abrams did not immediately respond to an email from PolitiFact about the quote. But it’s not an old claim. Social media accounts were sharing it back in October, before Abrams lost her bid for governor. Still, we couldn’t find credible evidence that Abrams ever said this. When she was on the campaign trail, though, she did make comments that drew the attention of her opponent, now Gov. Brian Kemp. On Oct. 16, Abrams told a crowd that she wanted to ""create lots of different jobs,"" according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""Because people shouldn’t have to go into agriculture or hospitality in Georgia to make a living. Why not create renewable energy jobs?"" An attack ad later featured a clip of Abrams making the remarks, and Kemp’s camp called them ""brash and condescending."" In response to the criticism, Abrams tweeted: ""To be clear, my point is that we must continue to diversify our economy and raise wages across the board. Agriculture and hospitality are vital sectors of our economy in Georgia - but we can do more and lead in new sectors as well."" She did not ever appear to clarify a statement on ""who needs agriculture when you can just get food at the store"" because, as best we can tell, she never said it.
