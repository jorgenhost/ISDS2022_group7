Jeff Sessions says lowest percentage of Americans are working in 40 years
","In his Republican National Convention speech in Cleveland, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., tied his signature issue -- curbing illegal immigration -- to the national employment picture. ""The fact is, we don’t have enough jobs for the people who are here,"" Sessions said. ""Doesn’t this help to explain why our wages have fallen and why we have the lowest percentage of Americans actually holding a job in 40 years? Our duty as elected officials is to get our people jobs first."" We wondered whether he was right that ""we have the lowest percentage of Americans actually holding a job in 40 years."" Taken literally, the correct economic statistic to use for answering this question is the employment-to-population ratio, or EPOP for short. This divides the number of employed Americans by the total civilian noninstitutional population at least 16 years of age. By this measurement, Sessions isn’t correct. Here’s a chart of the statistic going back to 1948, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics:  As you can see, the statistic was higher than its current rate through much of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. However, the chart shows a few other things worth noting. First, it indicates that since the end of the Great Recession, the employment-to-population ratio has been climbing, slowly but fairly steadily. After bottoming out at 58.2 percent in 2010 and 2011, the trend line has zigzagged upward. It currently stands at 59.6 percent, or 1.4 percentage points above its low point about five years ago. Second, Sessions has exaggerated the length of time since the previous low point. It was last as low as 58.2 percent in August 1983, which was 33 years ago. And the last time it was as low as its current level -- 59.6 percent -- in August 1984, or about 32 years ago. Both are shorter periods than the 40 years Sessions cited. We expect that Sessions was instead referring to a different statistic -- the labor force participation rate -- since that is a common talking point for Republicans. This takes the number of people either working or trying to work and divides it by the total civilian noninstitutional population age 16 and up. Currently, this number is 62.7 percent. It was last that low in February 1978, which is a bit over 38 years -- close to the 40 years Sessions referred to. Here’s the chart for that statistic:  Economists say this measurement captures important aspects of the job market. When the civilian labor force participation rate is low, it’s a concern, because it means there are fewer working Americans to support non-working Americans. But it’s worth adding some context as well. As we’ve noted before, a notable factor in the decline of the labor-force participation rate is the aging of the Baby Boom generation. As more adults begin moving into retirement age, the percentage of Americans who work is bound to decline. When we last looked at this question in 2013, Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, told us he had estimated that the labor-force participation rate would have fallen in recent years on the basis of aging alone. Still, the recession undoubtedly exacerbated that decline. In a weak job market, some people who might otherwise want a job may return to school, become full-time parents or retire early. Our ruling Sessions said, ""We have the lowest percentage of Americans actually holding a job in 40 years."" Sessions has worded his statement inartfully. If you use the correct statistic for the way he phrased it, the length of time is somewhat exaggerated and it ignores a recent improvement over the past five years or so. But if you can look past his looseness with economic terminology, Sessions has a point. Using a related statistic, he’s on target, and the larger issue he’s addressing -- declining rates of work in the population -- is something economists worry about, though much of it has to do with the graying of America. We rate his statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7a0bfd8a-22a2-4990-a333-bd531b0196e1",[<zip object at 0x0000028097173D40>],/factchecks/2016/jul/19/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-says-lowest-percentage-americans-are/

No, Cleveland police are not 'standing down' during RNC
","Attorney, author and motivational speaker Mike Cernovich announced a big ""scoop"" on his blog the week before the Republican National Convention. Cernovich, a California lawyer and ruckus-starter who backs Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, quoted ""anonymous sources"" as saying police in Cleveland were taking a hands-off approach at the huge event amid expected protests. ""Although the radical left has days of protests planned and has a history of protests, the Cleveland police has issued a stand down order to officers, I can exclusively report,"" Cernovich wrote. The same day, he tweeted:  On his blog, Cernovich elaborated that this was akin to ""when thugs from the left attacked Trump supporters at his San Jose rally,"" referring to an accusation that the California city’s police failed to protect pro-Trump activists, for fear of their own safety, during a scrappy demonstration last month. His message reverberated across social media, reaching, for example, the Nevada Tea Party:  But this was news to us, so we checked with our hometown source to learn if it was true: Cleveland police. Department spokeswoman Jennifer Ciaccia was blunt in an email: ""It is totally untrue."" Steve Loomis, the head of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association, said, ""Wildly false report!  No such order exists!"" As of 5 p.m. Monday, the first day of the convention, at least one image of a protester being arrested surfaced on Instagram. The protester, activist and journalist Kathy Wray Coleman, had just finished speaking when she was handcuffed by police, allegedly for an outstanding warrant from University Heights.    This doesn’t look like a police ""stand-down"" to us.

Faso was paid for his work on pipeline project
","Zephyr Teachout came out swinging against Republican John Faso after winning the 19th Congressional District’s Democratic primary. During a speech to supporters in Kingston on primary night, Teachout focused on Faso’s role in a controversial natural gas pipeline project. ""I stood with you against fossil fuel lobbyists, and together we protected our water and our land against fracking,"" Teachout said. ""And John Faso took money from fossil fuel companies as they tried to take your land by eminent domain for a fracked gas pipeline."" High-volume hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, emerged as a huge issue in upstate New York, particularly in the Southern Tier where the 19th Congressional District stretches. Was Teachout right about Faso taking money from fossil fuel companies that planned to use eminent domain? Faso’s background John Faso left his post as Assembly minority leader to run for state comptroller in 2002. He lost that election. He unsuccessfully ran for governor as the Republican nominee in 2006. After his failed comptroller bid, Faso worked for the Albany lobbying and consultant firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. In 2014 he left to start his own firm. He worked as a public affairs consultant for the Constitution Pipeline project until 2015. That project was called off earlier this year. The pipeline would have run through parts of the congressional district Faso now seeks to represent. The Constitution Pipeline Co. paid Faso for his work on behalf of the Constitution Pipeline project. The project The proposed pipeline would have transported natural gas from Pennsylvania - which allows fracking - through New York State - which has banned fracking. The pipeline would have transported gas extracted from fracking. So that part of Teachout’s statement checks out. The company that proposed the project pointed to the estimated economic benefits for local communities. Aside from the tax revenue, municipalities would have had the option to tap into the pipeline to supply natural gas to local residents.  Environmental advocates argued against the pipeline by warning about its potential impact on the state’s infrastructure and environment. They were also concerned for the safety of residents who would have lived near the pipeline. The pipeline had to be approved by the state and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Homeowners would have received compensation if the pipeline crossed their land. If they had not come to an agreement with the company, the resident’s land could have possibly been used anyway through eminent domain with compensation set by a court. The title of the property would still belong to the owner. The state has blocked the pipeline, but the company has appealed the decision. Faso’s role Faso’s campaign says he worked with the company as a public outreach consultant for three years from 2012 to 2015. In that role, he was a liaison to communities that would have been affected by the Constitution Pipeline project. Part of his role was to speak at public meetings about the project. Faso did not lobby lawmakers and regulators on behalf of the project. He only handled relations between the company and the public. No one would have lost land had the project gone forward. The company would have paid residents to use their land, but the title would have remained in their name. A call to the Constitution Pipeline company was not returned. Our ruling Zephyr Teachout claimed that John Faso ""took"" money from fossil fuel companies while they were trying to use eminent domain to build a pipeline on the properties of residents in the 19th Congressional District. He was paid for his work with the company, but landowners would still hold the title to their property if the company used it for the pipeline.

The curious connection between illicit cigarette sales and ISIS
","Are loosies a terrorist revenue stream? State Rep. Rick Saccone thinks so. During a session ahead of a vote on the state budget’s revenue package last week, Saccone, a Republican from Allegheny County, objected to a proposed $1-per-pack cigarette tax increase Wednesday. The new tax, which Governor Wolf signed into law later that day, raises the state’s levy to $2.60 per pack. Saccone viewed this as earning revenue off the backs of the poor, but also he was wary that price hikes might encourage smuggling rings that send money to violent extremists. ""We as a legislature are not only ready to trample on the poor, who disproportionately bear the burden of that tax,"" he told the body, ""we’re prepared to disregard the ugly consequence that driving the price too high nurtures illegal tobacco sales, which have been connected to funding terrorism against us. I’ll say that again, folks: Illegal tobacco sales, price driven too high, has been connected to at least several cases of funding terrorism against us in multi-year investigations over the last decade and a half."" Saccone wasn’t the only representative to raise such concerns. ""Interstate 81 is a smuggler’s alley. Now Pennsylvania will be a stop on Smuggler’s Alley,"" State Rep. Russ Diamond, a Republican from Lebanon County, said earlier in his remarks. ""And what kind of folks are in the cigarette smuggling business and what else do they do with their money? Are they also involved in other illegal activities? Are they involved in human trafficking? Are they funding Hezbollah or ISIS? We don’t know."" Later, in an interview with PolitiFact PA, Saccone pointed to a noteworthy 2015 State Department report, ""The Global Illicit Trade in Tobacco: A Threat to National Security."" ""Internationally, it fuels transnational crime, corruption, and terrorism,"" the report’s authors wrote. ""The illicit trade in tobacco products remains a lucrative revenue stream for many criminal actors and illicit networks."" Is it fair to consider price hikes drivers? David Merriman, a University of Chicago researcher who studies how consumers react to cigarette taxes, said in an email, ""There is high quality scientific evidence that relatively high cigarette taxes/prices are associated with increased illicit sales."" Saccone said the while many details may be classified, the links from reported probes are clear. ""We know that these terrorist organizations are branching out and they’re using multiple activities to fund their operations, especially in foreign countries,"" he said. ""I’m not saying the sale of cigarettes is the only source… but we know we can tie, according to these government reports and some of these operations, at least some of cigarette smuggling to the funding of terrorism."" Many of the examples in the State Department report, and many of the examples we found through broader research, were not domestic. One-eyed Algerian jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar, also known as the ""Marlboro Man,"" has entered the realm of legend not only for his prowess as a cigarette smuggler across Northern Africa, but also because U.S. intelligence has yet to confirm whether he’s actually dead or not. In 2004, an anti-terrorism law passed that prohibits importing missiles made specifically to blow up planes. The first person convicted under this law was Yi Qing Chen, a top smuggler in a Chinese crime ring that was busted in two connected probes: Operation Smoking Dragon and Operation Royal Charm, the latter being a FBI-staged yacht wedding where the lucky couple were actually undercover agents, and the suspects were invited guests. Chen, who was the arrested in Operation Smoking Dragon, had smuggled counterfeit money, military-grade weapons, methamphetamines, cigarettes and missiles, among other items. It’s not extraordinary to say that internationally, organized crime rings have developed far-reaching black market networks, illicit cigarettes being one of the industries. But how common is the case Saccone described— a black market growing thanks to the higher cigarette prices found in a particular state, and that market funnelling money to violent extremists? According to Understanding the U.S. Illicit Tobacco Market: Characteristics, Policy Context, and Lessons from International Experiences, 226-page National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study, not that common: ""Overall, given the total number of terrorism-related tobacco investigations in the United States (keeping in mind that smuggling cases are likely to receive priority if they can be linked to terrorism), as well as the dollar amounts involved in those cases, the link between the U.S. illicit tobacco market and terrorism appears to be minor."" From the 2002 and 2003 fiscal years, the report states, out of nearly 300 tobacco cases at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), only eight were ""linked to terrorism."" As the report notes, the underground market evades a good deal of statistical reporting. And while many investigations may look at both terrorist affiliations and illicit tobacco, both charges don’t always stick. Take the Knoxville man who pleaded guilty to cigarette smuggling in 2010. The FBI began investigating him after wiretapping conversations in which he seemed like an Al Qaeda recruiter. According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, the terror charge fell to the wayside after a lie-detector test backed his explanation: that on the phone calls, he was merely kidding. We reached out to ATF for cases that had led to convictions on both counts. ATF pointed to the 25 indictments resulting from Operation Smokescreen, which focused on an interstate cigarette smuggling ring. This group of illegal tobacco traders in North Carolina and Michigan operated primarily in the late ’90s, led to multiple arrests and convictions for cigarette smuggling and assisting Hezbollah. (One of the men, according to the Village Voice, donated $3,500 to the combatant group.) Arrests were made from 2000 to 2002. We found another example. Reportedly, a cigarette smuggler helped the Lackawanna Six, a group of Yemeni-American friends who were Al-Qaeda trainees, finance their trip to training camp in Afghanistan. Some of the men allegedly had smuggled cigarettes themselves. They were arrested in 2002, the magic number in both investigations -- which means 15 years is not out of the realm of possibility. These are the most high-profile examples of domestic cigarette smuggling connected to terrorism financing post-2001. We weren’t able to find more recent cases. ""[T]here is also no systematic evidence of sustained links between the global illicit tobacco trade and terrorism,"" according to the report. 
  Our ruling  Rep. Saccone said in a house session, ""Illegal tobacco sales, price driven too high, has been connected to at least several cases of funding terrorism against us in multi-year investigations over the last decade and a half."" Most of the trouble with this statement are its implications: American cigarette smuggling does not have strong presence in terrorism financing. Saccone himself admitted that he had heard of no such incidence in Philadelphia, where a cigarette tax bumped prices up in 2014. But, there have been cases, as he mentioned. In our research and from our correspondence with ATF, we were only able to find two groups that had financed terrorist activities through illicit tobacco sale, the Lackawanna Six and an interstate North Carolina-Michigan smuggling ring, both leading to multiple convictions. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973CCB00>],/factchecks/2016/jul/18/rick-saccone/curious-connection-between-illicit-cigarette-sales/

Priebus wrongly says no Bush attended 2012 RNC
","Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus is confident the Cleveland RNC will be a success, even without a Bush in attendance. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. and George H.W. Bush all declined to participate or attend the 2016 nominating convention. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd offered the decision of the Bush family to spurn the 2016 convention as evidence that this year’s event will be a little different. ""You’re not showcasing the best parts of your party,"" Todd said to Priebus, adding ""it is unusual not to have a Bush at the convention."" Priebus responded: ""It didn’t happen four years ago"" at the 2012 RNC in Tampa. Priebus added after some back-and-forth that that ""there was no President Bush"" at the RNC in 2008. Claims about the pre-eminence of the Bush family in Republican politics have come up before. We previously rated True a claim that Republicans haven’t won an election without a Bush or Nixon since 1928. In this case we wondered if Priebus was right that the Bush family eschewed the RNC in some form in 2012 and 2008. He wasn’t. The 2012 convention It’s been nearly eight years since a Bush has held national elected office, but the family has maintained a role at the nominating convention. Since 1980, every Republican convention has seen a Bush speak — often as the vice presidential or presidential nominee. That includes the 2012 convention in Tampa, which saw the nomination of Mitt Romney. Jeb Bush addressed delegates at the convention, as this video confirms. He touted his love for his brother, criticized President Barack Obama’s record and discussed children and education. ""If we want to continue to be the greatest nation on the planet, we must give our kids what we promised them — an equal opportunity,"" he said. ""That starts in the classroom. It starts in our communities. It starts where you live and it starts with nominating Mitt Romney the next president of the United States."" 2000, 2004 and 2008 Priebus also contended in his interview with Todd that there was no ""President Bush"" at the 2008 RNC in St. Paul, Minn. That’s not entirely correct, either. President George W. Bush addressed convention delegates live from the White House. Bush told convention delegates that he remained in Washington to oversee recovery efforts related to Hurricane Gustav. Bush, however, praised GOP nominee Arizona Sen. John McCain. ""He is ready to lead this nation,"" Bush said. ""From the day of his commissioning John McCain was a respected Naval officer who made decisions on which the lives of others depended."" First Lady Laura Bush spoke live from the convention, which also included appearances by former President George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush, video from the event shows. George W. Bush, the 2004 GOP nominee, of course spoke at the New York City 2004 convention as well, as did Laura Bush. Same for 2000 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992 and 1996 The list goes on. Former president George H.W. Bush spoke at the 1996 convention in San Diego, Calif., which eventually nominated former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. George H.W. Bush spoke in Houston, Texas, for the 1992 convention, as part of his failed re-election campaign.The same goes for 1988, when he was named the Republican nominee for the first time. In 1984, George H. W. Bush was selected as the vice-presidential nominee (Ronald Reagan was nominated for president). The same thing happened in 1980, and Bush spoke on both occasions. The earliest convention we could find without a Bush speaking was in 1976, where Gerald Ford was selected as the Republican nominee. To recap, that’s at least 40 years and nine conventions where a Bush had a speaking role. And members of the Bush family definitely spoke at both the 2012 and 2008 conventions. Our ruling Priebus said it’s not a big deal a Bush isn’t attending the 2016 convention, because a Bush didn’t speak in 2012 and ""there was no President Bush"" at the 2008 convention. He’s wrong. Jeb Bush addressed delegates at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa. In 2008, George W. Bush addressed delegates via a live video feed, but former President George H.W. Bush and former first ladies Laura and Barbara Bush all attended. A Bush has spoken at every RNC since at least 1980, we found.

GOP chair wrongly claims 'facts' show children do better with straight parents
","Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus defended the 2016 Republican Party platform ahead of its convention in a July 17 interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd. While the platform isn’t yet in its final form, many observers have said the document so far lands to the right on social issues. Todd asked Priebus about the platform’s position on same-sex marriage. He referenced one draft that says ""the data, the facts lead to an inescapable conclusion that every child deserves a married mom and dad"" — based on claims that children raised in a traditional household are healthier and less likely to engage in crime and substance abuse. ""It’s implying somehow that children of same-sex couples are more likely to be addicts, to engage in crime,"" Todd said. ""Do you mean to have it imply that?"" Priebus replied that it’s possible for children of same-sex parents and single parents to have successful lives, but the best scenario is for children to grow up in a traditional opposite-sex household. ""The best scenario for kids is a loving mom and dad,"" Priebus said. ""However, it doesn't mean at all that single parents or same-sex parents, that any parent in America can't love a child, can't raise a child, and that child can't be successful and loved. It doesn't mean that. It just means what the facts say."" Do ""the facts say"" that ""the best scenario for kids is a loving mom and dad"" as opposed to same-sex parents? We’ve rated two similar claims False in the past, and not much has changed since we last looked into it in 2014. If anything, the scholarly consensus that children can fare just as well in same-sex households has strengthened. ""The consensus is overwhelming that those children do very well in those (same-sex parent) families, and there’s no harm or bad consequence that occurs because of those parents not being opposite sex,"" said Ellen Perrin, a professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine who has researched this question. What the research shows Researchers at Columbia Law School reviewed scholarly works about the well-being of children living with gay or lesbian parents spanning the past three decades. The researchers found 78 relevant articles, and of those, 74 concluded that children of same-sex parents fare no worse than children of opposite-sex parents. Six of these articles were published in the last three years. The studies examine topics such as adolescent well-being, child physical and emotional health, family functioning and the effect of homophobic stigmatization. ""Taken together, this research forms an overwhelming scholarly consensus, based on over three decades of peer-reviewed research, that having a gay or lesbian parent does not harm children,"" the Columbia researchers wrote. That leaves four articles that argue children face more risks with opposite-sex parents than they do with same-sex parents. However, the Columbia researchers say these studies are problematic because only a minority of the child subjects grew up with same-sex parents. Most subjects of these four studies grew up with opposite-sex parents but one of the parents eventually came out as gay or lesbian, often causing family breakup or turmoil. Some of this research conflates family composition and structure with family stability and history, said Gary Gates, an expert in LGBT demography at the University of California Los Angeles. Social science research suggests marriage — and not necessarily the gender makeup of that marriage — is associated with stability. ""In other words, studies that compare children in long-term intact families with same-sex couple parents show that they generally do as well as kids in long-term intact families with different-sex parents,"" Gates said. Gates co-authored an overview of contemporary research about LGBT parents. The report found that LGBT parents and their children are doing ""quite well,"" but research into the subject face problems like getting a large and diverse sample size. And there is little research into subcategories, like sibling dynamics among children with same-sex parent families or domestic violence. Perrin added that there is much more research into lesbian female parents than there is into gay male parents, but that imbalance is starting to even out, especially in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of gay marriage and more male gay couples are having children. In any case, evidence supporting Priebus’s claim is limited and problematic. ""There’s no scholarly data that suggests this is a problem,"" Perrin said. We did not hear back from Priebus. Our ruling Priebus said, ""What the facts say"" is ... ""the best scenario for kids is a loving mom and dad,""  as opposed to having same-sex parents. The limited pieces of research that appear to support Priebus’ claim have been called into question. And overall, scholarly research shows that what matters to children is the quality and stability of the parenting, rather than the parents’ particular sex, gender or sexual orientation.

Frank Guinta says the first ship to fly the American Flag in battle was built in NH
","Along with hamburgers and hot dogs, the residents of the Live Free or Die state were served up an interesting tidbit about New Hampshire’s history this Fourth of July by Congressman Frank Guinta. In a patriotic holiday email, the 1st Congressional District Republican emphasized New Hampshire’s role in the Revolutionary War. ""The colonies, with a lot of help from Granite State shipbuilders, who built the first ship that sailed into battle under a new American flag, won the Revolutionary War, created what is now the world's oldest constitutional democracy, and charted a course to freedom and prosperity,"" he wrote. There’s a lot to be proud of in there. But we were intrigued by the piece that we’d never heard before: New Hampshire shipbuilders made the ship that debuted a new American flag in battle. To show our American spirit, PolitiFact N.H. turned to the history books to get to the bottom of this claim. Detailing the claim Guinta’s communications director, Brendan Thomas, said it was the USS Raleigh – built at the site of the current-day Portsmouth Naval Shipyard – that first sailed into battle flying a new variant of the American flag. Thomas noted that the state celebrates this information in its online history of the state seal, which features the Raleigh. Without further explanation, NH.gov says that the Raleigh was ""the first to carry the American flag into sea battle."" The ship launched in 1776, at a time when the country had no official flag, and sailed until 1778, after Congress defined the first variant of today’s Stars and Stripes. Thomas couldn’t say exactly which variant it was that the Raleigh premiered, except that it was ""not necessarily the Stars and Stripes"" and ""may have been a Union Jack surrounded by stars and stripes."" That design – a Union Jack in the upper left with the rest filled out by alternating red and white stripes – is considered to be the first American flag, although unofficially, according to Marc Leepson’s 2006 book, Flag: An American Biography. It went by many names, including the Continental Colors and the Grand Union Flag. The Continental Colors The Raleigh wasn’t the first to fly the Continental Colors, according to national historical records. That flag was first flown Dec. 3, 1775, on the USS Alfred by Navy Lieutenant John Paul Jones, according to a history by the Federal Citizen Information Center. Guinta was talking about the first ship that sailed into battle under a new flag, however, not just the flag being hoisted in the harbor, so Jones’s story doesn’t fit the bill. Still, an armada led by Commodore Esek Hopkins – including the Alfred, Columbus, Cabot and Andrew Doria – marked the first overseas victory for an American flag-flying ship, again before the Raleigh launched, according to Leepson’s book. That armada set sail Jan. 4, 1776, flying the Continental Colors, and captured forts Montagu and Nassau on the eastern end of New Providence in the British-owned Bahamas on March 17, 1776. The Raleigh first launched two months later on May 21, 1776, according to the U.S. Navy. So before the Raleigh ever took to the sea, the Continental Colors were already successful in a naval battle. The Stars and Stripes If the Raleigh didn’t premier the Continental Colors, it could have been the first to go into battle flying an early version of the Stars and Stripes. The Continental Colors, according to Leepson’s book, remained the colonies’ unofficial flag until June 14, 1777. That’s when the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Act of 1777, setting the stage for the first variant of the Stars and Stripes. According to Leepson’s book, the first ship flying the Stars and Stripes that was victorious over a foreign force was the USS Providence on Jan. 27, 1778. It captured the British Fort Nassau, seized ammunition and freed more than two dozen American prisoners. There’s a small window for Guinta’s claim to be true, if the Raleigh had sailed into battle – one that didn’t merit Leepson’s distinction of the first victory – between June of 1777 and the following January. The Raleigh’s history The Raleigh did sail across the Atlantic Ocean alongside the Alfred during that time, getting into a few scuffles with British ships along the way, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. But there’s no record of what flags the ships were flying. The only mention of the Raleigh’s flag was on a subsequent voyage that ended in the ship’s capture on Sept. 27, 1778. A midshipman on the Raleigh ""struck the Continental colors"" to end a battle in Maine’s Penobscot Bay, meaning he lowered the ship’s flag in an indication of surrender, according to the U.S. Navy’s history. Notably, it was the Continental Colors – not the Stars and Stripes – that the Raleigh was flying before it was taken and adopted into the British fleet. And that’s after the USS Providence’s victory in the Bahamas in January. Historians’ take PolitiFact N.H. asked U.S. Navy Commander Chris Rentfrow, a professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, for his take on the claim. He wrote in an email that he’s not aware of any evidence supporting the USS Raleigh being the first to fly the American flag. He said the honor of first flying the Continental Colors goes to the Alfred. ""Raleigh certainly would have flown this flag (the Continental Colors), as she was a contemporary of Hopkins' Alfred,"" Rentfrow wrote. ""The ‘Stars and Stripes,’ as you probably know, came about in 1777. Did Raleigh fly it? Probably. She was in service until captured by the British in 1778. I'm not aware that she was ‘first’ to fly it. We teach our students that the first foreign acknowledgement of the Stars and Stripes was when John Paul Jones' ship Ranger was saluted by the French in 1778."" Portsmouth shipbuilders were responsible for many prominent early vessels – including the Ranger and the Raleigh – ""thanks in large part to the lobbying and persistence of John Langdon,"" a famed New Hampshire governor and founder, said state archivist Brian Burford. He referenced the writing of New Hampshire maritime historian Richard Winslow, who wrote in 1988 a history of Portsmouth shipbuilding between 1775 and 1815, but was unable to confirm the claim Guinta made. The French salute of the Stars and Stripes aboard the Ranger, however, may be something of a consolation prize for Granite Staters, because it, too, was built in Portsmouth. Neither Burford, the state archivist, nor Malia Ebel, a reference librarian and archivist for the New Hampshire Historical Society, could give a certain answer about Guinta’s claim. Ebel said it’s possible that the Raleigh flew an early variant of the Stars and Stripes, but ""there’s sort of a dearth of information about this particular flag at this point."" ""He’s not necessarily wrong. We just can’t confirm what he said,"" Ebel said. The strongest evidence in support of the claim comes from the entry on the state’s website about the state seal, which offers only a vague, passing reference: ""The Raleigh has a checkered career of adversities, while becoming the first to carry the American flag into sea battle."" The website cites as its source a 1981 history written by Leon Anderson, a deceased former Monitor reporter and columnist who became a state legislative historian. Ebel said no more detailed information could be found in the manual that Anderson wrote. ""Even more unfortunately,"" she said, ""it doesn’t have a citation, so we don’t know where it came from."" Our ruling Guinta said ""Granite State shipbuilders . . .  built the first ship that sailed into battle under a new American flag."" Although the USS Raleigh sailed fewer than two years before it was captured, its service spanned two versions of the American flag. The Raleigh definitely flew an earlier variant of the American Flag, called the Continental Colors, but it wasn’t the first to do so. Experts said it likely flew the other variant, an early version of the Stars and Stripes, but there’s no evidence that it was the first to do so in battle. The gist of Guinta’s claim is true: New Hampshire shipbuilders were critical to the success of the fledgling American Navy. He could have easily pointed to the story of the Portsmouth-built Ranger carrying the first American flag that was ever saluted by a foreign nation. But there’s scant evidence to support the idea that the Raleigh was the first to sail into battle flying any variant of the American flag.

"['Global News Service', 'Economy', 'Trade', 'Joe Biden']","
Touting trade, Joe Biden says 95 percent of world's consumers are outside U.S.
","International trade has become a big issue in the 2016 presidential race, and now the sitting vice president, Joe Biden, has devoted a speech to it as well. Speaking on July 13 in San Diego, Biden reminded his audience that the United States needs to -- and has been -- cracking down on unfair practices by its trading partners. However, Biden also made a case for the benefits of foreign trade -- an argument that the two presidential candidates, and especially Republican Donald Trump, have not often made this campaign season. At one point in his speech, Biden cited the sheer number of customers outside U.S. borders. ""We need to sell to customers abroad. 95 percent of the world’s customers are over there. They’re beyond our shores,  95 percent of the world’s customers,"" he said. This is a commonly cited figure by advocates of expanding international trade, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And it’s rooted in legitimate statistics. But it glosses over some important context. Where the number comes from The 95 percent figure is drawn directly from global population figures. According to the World Bank, the United States has a population of 321.4 million, compared to 7.3 billion for the world as a whole. So the United States’ population represents about 4.4 percent of the world’s population, leaving 95.6 percent of people outside the United States’ borders. That’s very close to the figure Biden offered. Why the statistic doesn’t tell the whole story However, for the purposes of buying American products -- which was the point of Biden’s remark -- not all residents of the world are equal. The vast majority of people across the world are quite poor and will not generally be in the market for American products. Determining how many ""customers"" there might be for American products is tricky. But one estimate published by the World Bank broke down the world’s population into rich (incomes typical of Italy and above), middle class (incomes between Brazil and Italy), and poor (incomes below that of Brazil). The study included affluent residents of poor countries in its count of ""rich"" and ""middle class"" people. That report estimated that in 2000, about 10.5 percent of the world’s population was rich and another 7.6 percent was middle class. By contrast, 82 percent were poor. Here’s the full chart:  Of course, some of that 82 percent might be able to afford the occasional U.S. product, whether it’s a bottle of Coke, some bread made from U.S. grain, or a summer blockbuster movie. That uncertainty about the definition of ""poor"" and whether even very poor people can afford some U.S. products some of the time make us reluctant to suggest an alternate, more accurate figure. Still, even a narrower World Bank calculation -- based on defining ""extreme poverty"" as $1.90 in income per day adjusted for purchasing power by country -- came up with 12.73 percent of the world’s population living in ""extreme poverty"" in 2013. That’s not a lot of money to spend on imported products. And raising the cutoff for the definition of ""extreme poverty"" would produce larger percentages of people in that category. Pluses and minuses of using the 95 percent figure The vice president’s office acknowledged this critique and told PolitiFact that it likes to use the term ""potential customers,"" arguing that beneficial trade agreements can help turn non-consumers of U.S. products into consumers of U.S. products, especially over the long term as trading relationships deepen and incomes rise. And even under the current status quo, some experts cautioned against dismissing the 95 percent figure. "" 'Customers' is about population, not income, and while I'd agree that a lot of them won't be very big customers -- the 10 percent or so of the planet's population who live on less than $1.90 a day aren't lining up to buy Boeing 777s -- many of the world's very poorest people do buy food, and the United States is a very big agricultural exporter, including to developing countries,"" Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. ""So, they may not be the biggest customers, but they will be customers nonetheless."" Our ruling Biden said, ""95 percent of the world’s customers are … beyond our shores."" He’s right if you count the number of people across the globe who live outside the borders of the United States. However, since many members of that 95 percent are quite poor, framing the question as Biden did gives an overstated sense of how much that 95 percent will be consuming U.S. exports in the near future.

Drew Brees says women's soccer, cheerleading pose concussion risks second only to football
","Drew Brees, the New Orleans Saints quarterback headed into his 16th NFL season, insists he doesn’t fret about concussions. But the Austin native, who led the Westlake High School Chaparrals to a state football championship in 1996, stirred our curiosity in his June 2016 interview with Kirk Bohls of the Austin American-Statesman when he said: ""Do you know what the second sport with the most concussions is? Women’s soccer. But do you see anyone telling their daughters not to play soccer? And the third most dangerous sport? Cheerleading. You understand the risk with every sport you play."" Our attempts to draw Brees’ backup information failed. But we took him to be saying women’s soccer and cheerleading rank second and third, respectively, in the incidence of concussions. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, we confirmed that football consistently poses the greatest concussion risks. Women's or girls soccer, which has surged in popularity since the 1980s, often places a distant second by this metric, we found, with the chances of a concussion from cheerleading much lower. Women's soccer As we looked into the soccer portion of Brees' claim, experts pointed out a 2014 report, ""Sports-related Concussions in Youth,"" sponsored by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with backing from the National Football League, the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health. The report, collating several studies, said: ""Soccer, lacrosse, and basketball are associated with the highest rates of reported concussions for U.S. female athletes at the high school and college levels."" A report chart shows that according to four studies of concussions in sports, football consistently placed first with six to 11.2 concussions per 10,000 ""athletic exposures,"" a term meaning the number of practices and competitions in which an individual actively participates (i.e., in which he or she is exposed to the possibility of athletic injury). Significantly, two of the cited studies showed women’s soccer with the second-highest concussion rate, 3.6 or 3.5 per 10,000 athletic exposures while the sport was close to No. 2 in the other studies. Per one study, men’s lacrosse had higher concussion rates and in the other, men’s hockey and men’s and women’s lacrosse had higher rates. The chart:                 SOURCE: Chart in report, ""Sports-related Concussions in Youth,"" National Academies Press, 2014 In a 2015 report, Dawn Comstock, a professor at the Colorado School of Public Health, and others synthesized nearly 50 studies to pinpoint the causes of concussions among American youth soccer players. According to a summary, the authors found that contact with another player was the most common cause with heading the ball the reason for 25 percent of concussions among girls. We reached out to Comstock for more perspective. By phone, she told us that a general factor to acknowledge is the likelihood of female athletes more likely revealing concussion symptoms because females are more likely than males to discuss health-related issues. ""We honestly don’t know if girl soccer players are sustaining more concussions than boy ice hockey and lacrosse players or if they’re just more likely to be diagnosed because they’re more likely to report their symptoms,"" Comstock said. Cheerleading The 2014 national report says of cheerleading: ""Concussions and other closed-head injuries account for 4 to 6 percent of all cheerleading injuries,"" a conclusion attributed to a ""policy statement"" from the American Academy of Pediatrics, ""Cheerleading injuries: Epidemiology and recommendations for prevention."" But the 2012 statement says concussion rates in cheerleading, 0.6 per 10,000 athletic exposures, have been relatively low compared with other  girls’ high school sports such as soccer (3.6), basketball (1.6-2.1), lacrosse (2.0), softball (0.7-1.1), and field hockey (1.0). Troubling note: From 1998 to 2008, the academy says, concussion rates in cheerleading increased by 26 percent a year, greater than any of the other girls sports studied. ""Concussion rates increase with age and competitive level,"" the statement says, ""likely because of the increasing difficulty of stunts."" The 26 percent figure traces to a regional 2011 study of concussions among high school boys and girls in a dozen sports in 25 Fairfax County, Virginia schools from 1997-98 through 2007-08. In that study, football and girls soccer posed far greater concussion risks. By a wide margin, football ranked first in total concussions with 1,407 or 53 percent of all the tallied concussions. Considerably behind in second place was boys’ lacrosse, which accounted for 244 concussions, 9 percent of the total--with girls’ soccer landing third with 195 concussions, 7 percent of the total. Football also had the highest concussion rate, the study says, with 6.0 concussions for every 10,000 athletic exposures. Among the studied girls sports, the concussion rate for girls soccer, 3.5/10,000 AEs, far outpaced the 0.6 rate for cheerleading--with the latter having the lowest rate of the girls sports including basketball, lacrosse, field hockey and softball. By phone, the study’s lead author, Andrew Lincoln, director of the MedStar Sports Medicine Research Center, told us that while cheerleading can be dangerous, its concussion rate is low. Lincoln pointed us to the North Carolina-based National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury which issued a 2015 report indicating that from fall 1982 through spring 2014, female cheerleading ranked only behind football, in U.S. high schools, for its number of ""direct catastrophic events,"" meaning severe injuries such as fractured vertebra to incidents resulting in paralysis or even death. Worse, once the number of participants in each sport is factored in, cheerleading ranked No. 1 for its rate of such events. Among college sports, the report said, football had the highest number of direct catastrophic events, followed by female cheerleading and baseball. We heard more about cheerleading risks from Chris Nowinski of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine. By email, Nowinski pointed out a May 2014 analysis on FiveThirtyEight.com that quoted Comstock saying: ""Cheerleading is not nearly as dangerous a sport as some of the previous research painted it to be."" Comstock’s focus was on concussions. Among a set of high school athletes tracked across 20 sports from 2008 through 2010, Comstock said, cheerleading had the 10th-highest concussion rate. An accompanying chart indicates 1.4 concussions per 10,000 AEs for cheerleading. In contrast, football had a 6.4 rate, per the chart, girls soccer had a 3.4 rate--and five boys sports plus girls lacrosse, field hockey, basketball and softball each had higher concussion rates than cheerleading. A wrinkle: Cheerleading was the only sport in the study with a higher risk of concussion in practice (1.4 per 10,000 AEs) than in competition (1.2 per 10,000)--a result Comstock attributed to cheerleading not widely being recognized as a sport, hence subject to practices in parking lots and on other sketchy surfaces. Comstock, asked for the latest data, told us that across 22 high school sports in 2014-15, football games by far accounted for the highest concussion rates. For every 10,000 players in a given Friday night’s games, she said, 31 sustained a concussion. In second place came girls soccer, she said, with about 21 of every 10,000 players on a given game night sustaining concussions. Far less frequent were concussions among participants in cheerleading competitions, Comstock said, at a rate of 1.8 for every 10,000 AEs. The professor also pointed us to a 2015 study she helped author stating that from 2009-10 through 2013-14, concussions were nationally the most common cheerleading injury even though concussion rates were significantly lower than in other sports. Our ruling Brees said: ""Do you know what the second sport with the most concussions is? Women’s soccer… And the third most dangerous sport? Cheerleading."" Football by far poses the greatest concussion risks, studies show, with women’s/girls soccer often placing a distant second. Cheerleading poses risks too, more so in practices, yet concussion chances are relatively slight compared to numerous sports. We rate this claim Half True.

"['Florida', 'Guns', 'Jim Waldman']","
Florida Senate candidate never actually received an A from the NRA
","In a duel for state Senate, two Democrats are battling over bad grades. Jim Waldman, a former four-term House member from Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, sees a bad grade from the National Rifle Association as a selling point. But Parkland lawyer Gary Farmer, his well-funded primary challenger for the newly redrawn District 34 seat, calls it a false advertisement. (Rep. Gwyndolen Clarke-Reed is also in the race.) Farmer’s campaign sent out emails and fliers claiming Waldman received an A grade from the NRA. You can see how this might be a problem for a Democrat in a heavily Democratic district like Fort Lauderdale. Waldman says it's not just a problem — it's wrong. He accused Farmer of being the liar, holding up his D from the NRA in 2010 and his voting record on gun legislation in the Florida House. ""Unfortunately, a political committee led by Gary Farmer is spreading lies about my record on guns,"" Waldman wrote in an email to his campaign subscribers. ""They’re spending tens of thousands of dollars mailing a FALSE claim to voters that I received an ‘A’ from the NRA."" He continued: ""Check the report card. Their claim is an absolute lie."" With both camps taking aim, PolitiFact Florida stepped into the ring. Throwing punches This fight started in early July, when Farmer’s campaign sent a mailer to residents of District 34 that said Waldman received an A from the NRA in 2010. In addition to fliers, Farmer also sent an email that claimed Waldman received an A rating for six years. This email included a screenshot from the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, which gives grades to politicians based on their support for Second Amendment rights. It also cited Project Vote Smart, a website that aggregates candidate information.  Farmer spokesman Jay Shannon said the NRA screenshot was captured July 1. Farmer’s camp also showed us another screenshot from Project Vote Smart showing Waldman with an A in 2010 (and an F in 2008). 
 PolitiFact was able to confirm the Vote Smart screenshot through the Wayback Machine, which archives web pages from the Internet. Shortly after the Farmer campaign took these screenshots, the campaign claims the grade changed from an A to a D on the NRA’s subscriber-only website. After the NRA changed its grade, Waldman spokeswoman Ashley Walker called Project Vote Smart to report an error on their site, and it also changed the grade from an A to a D on July 11. Project Vote Smart aggregates information from other organizations, so it makes sense it would change the grade if the NRA’s website reflected something different. But why did the NRA’s grade change in the first place? Farmer’s email suggests it was an inside job, claiming friends of Waldman in the NRA changed it on his behalf. But he has no proof to back this up, and the NRA tells a different story. Marion Hammer, the former president of the NRA and the executive director of the Unified Sportsmen of Florida, said Waldman never received an A from the NRA. Hammer said the NRA noticed the 2010 grade was listed as an A sometime this year, and changed it back to a D. ""Anyone who knows anything about Jim Waldman should know he would never get an A from (the) NRA and should be suspicious enough to check it out before using it,"" she said. Waldman has typically voted not to expand gun rights during his tenure in the House, with a few exceptions. In 2014, Waldman voted yes on two bills supported by the NRA. One bill, dubbed the ""Pop-Tart"" bill, relaxed Florida’s zero-tolerance policy in schools by prohibiting administrators from disciplining children for playing with simulated weapons. The bill passed 97-17, with 25 Democrats crossing party lines to vote for it. The other bill Waldman supported was the 2014 ""warning shot"" bill, partly inspired by Marissa Alexander, who was convicted in 2012 of three counts of deadly assault after firing a shot in the direction of her estranged husband and two of his children. She was sentenced to 20 years. Farmer described this bill as expanding Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law, but some law enforcement agencies said it actually made the law more difficult to enforce. This bill passed in the House 92-24, with 18 Democrats in favor. Hammer emphasized that the NRA changed the grade to correct the record, adding the NRA would never change grades as favors to candidates, no matter if they are aligned with the organization’s views or not. The real proof, she said, is in the magazines that the NRA Political Victory Fund sends out during election time (which can’t be hacked). According to the NRA’s 2006-12 Florida report cards, these are Waldman’s grades: 2012 D 2010 D 2008 F 2006 N/A (Waldman did not respond to an NRA questionnaire) Waldman hasn’t returned the questionnaire for 2016, either, and will probably receive a D again for 2016, Hammer said. We never got a clear explanation as to why the grade was posted incorrectly in the first place. Hammer said she was not going to investigate the issue further, calling it a waste of ""effort and energy in order to settle a dispute between two anti-gun Democrats."" Our ruling Waldman said Farmer’s claim that he ""received an A from the NRA"" is ""an absolute lie."" Screenshots show the grade for Waldman was once listed as an A, but spokespersons for the NRA said that information was wrongly listed (and they don't know why). The NRA made it clear that Waldman would never would receive an A, has only received a D or F in previous races, and did not change the grade for his benefit. Waldman’s claim is accurate. So we rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84c66d52-2a74-4911-9c33-7a6834ffe5e1",[<zip object at 0x0000028097690FC0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/15/jim-waldman/state-senate-candidate-never-actually-received-rat/
"['Taxes', 'New York', 'Andrew Cuomo']","
New tax rates will be the lowest in 70 years
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo thinks you can win money by making a bet with someone on New York State’s tax rates. Ask people about what the state has done with the rates, and ""everybody’s going to say, ‘raise taxes,’ because it is inconceivable that a government actually lowers taxes,"" Cuomo said. At public appearances recently, Cuomo touted what he called the lowest tax rate for the middle class in 70 years. ""Wager anyone you know and say, ‘Did New York State raise taxes or lower taxes?’ "" Cuomo said. ""New York State has lowered taxes for everyone in the state and every income level in the state."" Taxes are always a top issue for voters. So does the governor’s claim check out? Are middle-class state residents taxed at the lowest rate in seven decades? Who’s in the middle? No official state definition exists for the ""middle class."" But in the scope of today’s tax brackets, the middle class are those making between about $40,000 to $300,000 a year. Who’s included in the middle class has changed over time with the rate of inflation. A salary today of $80,000 is equivalent to a $9,000 salary in 1953. The tax brackets used today are not the same as those used in past decades. In 1946, anyone making more than $9,000 was taxed at a 3.5 percent rate. The next year the rate increased to 4.2 percent. In 1948, the rate jumped to 6.3 percent, and that’s the year the Cuomo administration bases its claim. The Department of Tax and Finance says most - if not all - earners in the middle class in 1948 would have paid the top rate. That year the top rate applied to people making about $9,000. That fits what the state has defined as middle class in today’s dollars, and the Department of Tax and Finance says that’s how the middle class would have been defined in that year. How low? Since 1948, the lowest top tax rate fell to between 6.45 and 6.65 percent for people in the same comparable income bracket. That was in 2014, and remains at that level. That’s higher than the now-scheduled rate for 2025 as part of this year’s resolution. Anyone making between $40,000 and $150,000 will see their income tax rate drop to 5.5 percent by that year. The tax rate will drop to 6 percent for those making between $150,000 and $300,000. But there are caveats. The rates do not factor in tax exemptions or deductions, as pointed out by E.J. McMahon from the Empire Center for Public Policy. The center researches and analyzes the state’s economy, including the tax law. To some extent, the tax rates for 2025 and 1948 are like apples to oranges, McMahon said. ""It’s much like saying the 2016 Ford Focus has the best headroom since the 1946 Ford Tudor — the two tax codes and the household situations to which they apply are that different,"" McMahon said. He wrote recently the new rates will be the largest tax cut since the mid-1990s, when lawmakers passed the Taxpayer Relief Act. At the time, the legislation dropped taxes to the lowest rates since 1954. The new tax rates, once fully phased in, will be even lower, according to the Department of Taxation and Finance data. An analysis from the Fiscal Policy Institute confirms Cuomo’s claim holds true - but like McMahon, the institute points out the income range that defines the middle class looks different today than it did 70 years ago. The 1958 exception The Department of Taxation and Finance, in a different report, reveals another interesting historical nugget. Employers were not required by law to withhold tax until 1959. According to the document, because this would have required two years of taxes to be paid in just one year, taxes were ‘canceled’ for 1958 - meaning the tax rate for that year was zero. Our ruling Governor Andrew M. Cuomo claimed new tax rates passed by lawmakers during this year’s state budget process are the lowest in the state in 70 years. Data from the Department of Taxation and Finance backs up his claim. Because of an unusual set of circumstances, there was no income tax rate in 1958 as the state implemented a new system. The first year rates will appear lower than the 1948 rates will be in 2019. We rate this claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C40AA40>],/factchecks/2016/jul/15/andrew-cuomo/new-tax-rates-will-be-lowest-70-years/

Donald Trump mischaracterizes FBI director comment about Hillary Clinton's email practices
","Republican nominee Donald Trump seized on testimony from the head of the FBI to slam Democrat Hillary Clinton’s email practices while she was secretary of state. The practices were detailed by FBI Director James Comey in a July 5 news conference and an appearance two days later before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The FBI declined to recommend prosecution in Clinton’s case. Comey concluded that Clinton was wrong when she repeatedly said that classified emails didn't end up on her personal system and he characterized her handling of very sensitive information as ""extremely careless."" Trump told the crowd at a July 11 campaign rally in Virginia Beach, Va., that Clinton's conduct as ""willful, intentional, and unlawful."" ""Just look at what the FBI director said about her — her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country,"" Trump said. Comey was tough on Clinton, saying at one point that any reasonable person in Clinton's position ""should have known that an unclassified system was no place"" for some of the conversations she was having. But we didn't recall him saying her conduct was ""a disgrace"" or an ""embarrassment."" So we decided to check it out. The Trump campaign doesn't regularly respond to PolitiFact's requests for information. But in this case, the Trump campaign posted the speech (as prepared but without his extemporaneous remarks) with annotations. The speech transcript specifically indicates, via the dash, that Trump was explaining the remarks of the FBI director, not just giving his own opinion. Trump's delivery on video makes it sound that way, too, and that's what caught our attention.  The campaign said that the source for the ""disgrace and embarrassment"" line came from the Washington Post's transcript of Comey's July 5 news conference. We checked. Neither the words ""disgrace"" nor ""embarrassment"" are contained in the transcript. We checked Congressional Quarterly's transcript. Same result. We wondered if Comey might have used the words during the hours he spent before the House committee two days later. He did not. We read his public comments again, looking for words that mean the same thing as a disgrace or an embarrassment. We didn’t find them. Instead, Comey used words that focused on her conduct as showing a lack of attention. ""I think she was extremely careless. I think she was negligent. That, I could establish. What we can't establish is that she acted with the necessary criminal intent,"" was about as harsh as Comey got. He declined to say whether Clinton lied to the public. He did suggest that Clinton may have been less sophisticated about email than most people assumed. ""She didn't have a computer in her office at the State Department, for example,"" Comey said. We wondered if anybody used the words ""disgrace"" or ""embarrassment"" during the hearing. They did not. Our ruling Trump said, ""Just look at what the FBI director said about her (Hillary Clinton) — her misconduct  is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country."" The Trump campaign indicated Comey said it during his news conference. He didn't. He said her actions were careless, but he didn’t call them a disgrace or an embarrassment or the equivalent. It's possible that Trump was trying to convey two different thoughts, urging people to look up the FBI director's comments and the ""disgrace and embarrassment"" comment was supposed to be his own characterization. But that's not how it comes across, both when spoken and in the transcript. With that in mind, we rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b1a6a5e7-b27c-496b-a3cd-73f65def2f05",[<zip object at 0x0000028097739A40>],/factchecks/2016/jul/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-mischaract-fbi-director-comment-about/

Is paid family leave more popular than college basketball in North Carolina?
","Like many in North Carolina, we’re excited for the start of college basketball season four months from now. But in the meantime, we decided to take a break from more serious fact checks about the economy and HB2 to take a look at a political claim talking about – you guessed it – college basketball. The liberal advocacy group MomsRising was talking a big game on Twitter recently, pushing for paid family leave policies. They said the idea that businesses should pay workers when they have to miss work for major family events – the birth of a child, taking care of an ill relative, etc. – is more popular than the unofficial religion of the Tar Heel state. ""In North Carolina, paid family leave is more popular than college basketball,"" the group declared, alongside a photo from a UNC-Duke game. That’s a high bar to clear in a state that has sent a team to five of the last 12 men’s college basketball national championship games. So we wondered if it’s true, or the political equivalent of claiming Christian Laettner is a beloved figure in Kentucky. ""There’s nothing more North Carolina than basketball,"" said Beth Messersmith, the N.C. campaign director for MomsRising who came up with the basketball analogy. ""If you can be more popular than basketball in North Carolina, then you know you’re onto something."" Support for college basketball First things first. Just how popular is college basketball in North Carolina? Some alumni of UNC, Duke, Wake Forest and N.C. State may be surprised to learn that not all North Carolinians are crazy for college hoops. According to a poll taken just before last season by Public Policy Polling, 52 percent of North Carolinians consider themselves college basketball fans. In another PPP poll commissioned in early July by MomsRising and other groups that mostly focused on paid leave – the same poll their Twitter claim referenced – college basketball received 53 percent support. Yet even just two years prior, in 2013, 59 percent of North Carolina respondents told PPP they were college basketball fans. Other polls have documented the sport’s declining popularity nationwide. Gallup, for instance, found that while the number of fans didn’t drop between 2001 and 2012, the number of people saying they were definitely not fans (as opposed to on the fence) has grown. And according to the Harris Poll, college basketball was perhaps at its height in 1989, when 10 percent of Americans said it was their favorite sport. In 2015, that number was 4 percent. Time Magazine analyzed the sport’s declining popularity last year and attributed it to a number of factors, including low scoring, conference realignment that ended some popular rivalries, and a schedule that forces it to compete for attention with both college and professional football. Support for paid leave Let’s now take a break to watch some of our favorite college basketball moments, then get back to the subject at hand: paid leave policies. According to one United Nations study of 170 countries, only the U.S. and the tiny Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea don’t require paid family leave. PolitiFact has previously checked several people claiming the U.S. is lagging behind the rest of the world in its paid leave policies; it was particularly popular with Bernie Sanders during his run for the Democratic presidential nomination. It could be expensive. PolitiFact’s ""Obameter,"" which tracks promises made by the president, noted that he has failed in his promise to spend $1.5 billion to start paid family and medical leave in the United States. In North Carolina, the poll from Public Policy Polling that MomsRising commissioned found 49 percent of people strongly favor paid family leave and another 19 percent somewhat favor it, for a total of 68 percent support. To jog your memory, college basketball has recently been polling about 15 percentage points lower than that. We don’t know the partisan breakdown of this poll, but in national polls, paid leave typically has bipartisan support – although moreso among liberals – and among politicians, it’s far more popular among Democrats than Republicans. Because of that, it’s worth noting that the poll in question was paid for by a liberal group pushing for more paid leave policies, and that Public Policy Polling is itself a liberal-leaning organization. So take these numbers with a grain of salt. But unfortunately, there has been little to no other statewide polling on the topic. Public Policy Polling – which does polls for private clients as well as for public distribution – has never before asked about paid family leave in a public poll. Similarly, we weren’t able to find any other statewide polling on the subject (although if you know of any, please let us know). But nationally, the polling does mirror what PPP found in North Carolina. In 2015, an AP-GfK poll found two-thirds of Americans supported paid family leave – about the same as the recent North Carolina poll, but lacking the political biases, and an AP-NORC poll two months ago found 75 percent support among people age 40 and older. A New York Times-CBS poll, in 2015, found 80 percent support for paid family leave nationally. Our ruling MomsRising said that ""paid family leave is more popular than college basketball"" in North Carolina. There is little polling on this topic at the state level, but what there is does line up with national polling. Since data is sparse but does support the claim, we rate it Mostly True.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0963b149-97d8-405c-b3e4-2bc010444fab",[<zip object at 0x00000280978A2100>],/factchecks/2016/jul/15/moms-rising/paid-family-leave-more-popular-college-basketball-/

Trump claims a photo shows the Bidens playing golf with a Ukrainian company ‘boss.’ But it doesn’t
","President Donald Trump is doubling down on a photo he says shows Joe Biden and his son posing with a Ukrainian gas executive as evidence Biden knows more than he has let on. ""The Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable,"" he tweeted. ""Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter."" The photo, which was first aired by Fox News on Sept. 30, shows Joe and Hunter Biden playing golf in the Hamptons in 2014. According to Trump, one of the men is the ""company boss"" of Burisma, the energy company where Hunter served as a board member while his father was vice president. Trump tweeted a doctored Nickelback music video Oct. 2 that includes the image juxtaposed with an interview in which Joe Biden says he had never talked to his son about his business dealings abroad. That video was quickly removed from both Twitter and YouTube due to a potential copyright infringement for the Nickelback music. But now Trump is re-upping the claim amid an ongoing impeachment inquiry against him for his own dealings with Ukraine. We reached out to the White House for more information about the source of Trump’s claim, but they did not comment on the record. Trump’s tweet is misleading on two fronts. • The photo shows the Bidens with another American board member of Burisma. • Biden hasn’t said whether or not he’s spoken with Burisma officials. Trump claimed that the photo of the Bidens shows them posing ""with the company boss"" of Burisma. Our research shows otherwise. In a previous story, we found that the man on the far left of the frame is Devon Archer. In 2008, Hunter Biden joined with Archer — a former senior adviser for the presidential campaign of John Kerry in 2004 — in a string of investment and consulting firms.  The Wall Street Journal reported in May 2014 that the two had joined Burisma as board members. That role is different from ""boss"" or ""executive,"" as Trump has claimed in separate tweets about the photo of Archer. Board members are not typically involved in day-to-day operations of a company. While Joe Biden was vice president, firms run by his son and Archer ""pursued business with international entities that had a stake in American foreign policy decisions, sometimes in countries where connections implied political influence and protection,"" the New York Times reported in May. The fourth man in the photo that Trump tweeted is Ralph Pascucci, founder of Netrex Capital Markets LLC, a New York investment banking firm. He is also a principal of Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, N.Y., where the Bidens spent a week in August 2014. (Screenshots from Twitter and Netrex)  We reached out to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign for more details, but they did not comment on the record. Taras Burdeinyi is the current CEO of Burisma and Mykola Zlochevsky is the founder and owner. In 2014, Alan Apter was the chairman of the board of directors and reportedly brought on Biden and Archer. In his tweet, Trump claimed that Joe Biden said he ""never spoke to the Ukrainian company"" where his son served as a paid board member. But that mischaracterizes what the Democratic presidential candidate actually said. In his Nickelback video, Trump showed a clip of Biden saying he had ""never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,"" contrasting that with the photograph of the golf group. That’s different than claiming he had never spoken to Burisma. RELATED STORY: Trump’s Ukraine call, a whistleblower and the Bidens: What we know, what we don’t Biden knew his son worked for the Ukrainian energy company. Beyond that, there’s little we know. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker magazine in July 2019 that he discussed Burisma with his father one time in December 2015. The Biden campaign says the discussion was not substantive. Trump claimed Joe Biden ""said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company"" where his son, Hunter, served as a board member. He also claimed a photo of the Bidens shows them posing with ""the company boss"" of Burisma. The photo that Trump is referencing doesn’t show a Ukrainian executive of the company. It shows Devon Archer, a former board member and Hunter Biden’s longtime business partner. Also, Biden never said he had never spoken to Burisma — he said he’d never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. We could find no evidence that Biden ever made the former claim. Trump’s statement is not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BFCF00>],/factchecks/2019/oct/08/donald-trump/trump-claims-photo-shows-bidens-playing-golf-ukrai/

Trump campaign says Minneapolis wants to charge $530,000 for rally. That’s correct.
","President Donald Trump’s campaign has threatened to sue the city of Minneapolis over the security costs related to a campaign rally. The Trump campaign said in a statement to the press three days before the rally that the mayor of Minneapolis, Democrat Jacob Frey, had conjured a ""phony and outlandish bill for security"" for the Oct. 10 Target Center rally. ""Frey’s city government preemptively informed the Target Center that it would be responsible for $530,000 in security and other costs related to the event,"" the campaign wrote. ""The Target Center attempted to pass the costs on to the Trump campaign under threat of withholding the use of the arena."" The statement said that the $530,000 is more than 26 times the estimated security costs for a 2009 health care rally held by President Barack Obama at the Target Center.  Minnesota has voted for Democrats for president for decades, but Trump has his eye on it because he narrowly lost to Hillary Clinton by about 1.5 percentage points. Minneapolis is a liberal bastion in a blue state. Trump tweeted a response targeting Frey and U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minneapolis Democrat whom he has attacked before. ""The lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!"" The lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again! https://t.co/ibTqvSbsbn   Frey responded on Twitter: ""Yawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors."" Yawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors. https://t.co/v1cXvoD9uR PolitiFact reached out to multiple city and police department officials as well as the Target Center and its manager, AEG Facilities, and did not receive any responses to our questions.  However, we did obtain a letter from AEG that cited an estimated $530,000 cost. Hugh Lombardi, AEG Facilities’ general manager, sent a letter to the Trump campaign’s director of advance, Bobby Peede, on Oct. 7. The letter states: ""The City of Minneapolis has presented a preliminary estimate of additional security and related costs associated with the October 10, 2019 Event at Target Center. These estimated additional expenses total $530,000."" The letter states it is the licensee’s responsibility ""to coordinate through the Secret Service and pay for any law enforcement services necessary for the event."" The letter states that if these arrangements are not confirmed by 8 a.m. Oct. 8, then the agreement will be terminated ""for breach of the Event Security provision.""  The campaign wrote in a letter to AEG that the campaign and AEG are not required to pay for security and threatened to sue. (We have not seen a copy of the agreement.) Casper Hill, a city spokesman, told PolitiFact that the public safety costs are expected to be around $400,000 and there are an additional $130,000 costs for lane closure fees and traffic control, among other things. The city examined the costs for other major recent events to determine the costs, including the Super Bowl in 2018, which was roughly $6 million, and $1.5 million for the Final Four men’s college basketball tournament earlier this year.  Minneapolis City Attorney Susan Segal told the Star Tribune that ""it’s not fair"" for residents to shoulder the costs. Segal told the Star Tribune that the city has been having conversations with organizations including the Twins, the Vikings and the Minnesota Ballpark Authority about sharing costs of events. Those discussions started before the Super Bowl in 2018, she said.  Minneapolis’ estimate, however, appears far higher than what it cost other cities to host Trump rallies. The Star Tribune reported that Trump’s rally in Rochester in 2018 cost the city government $76,138 while a rally in Duluth cost the city more than $69,000. A national investigation by the Center for Public Integrity found that among local governments that invoiced the Trump campaign, the amounts ranged between $8,000 to $82,000 for public safety costs related to rallies. The highest bill was from the city of El Paso for about $470,000.  On the day of the 2009 Obama rally, the Minneapolis police chief estimated the department’s costs to top $20,000 including for 50 officers on overtime at the 20,500-seat Target Center arena, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported. We tried to confirm if that was the actual cost with police officials but did not get a response. It isn’t unusual for local law enforcement agencies to be asked to swallow security costs, and Trump’s is not the only campaign to do so. The Center for Public Integrity found that Obama’s campaign didn’t always pay for security. Some 2020 Democratic presidential candidates didn't respond to the Center when asked about security bills while others said they will pay or had paid certain bills. There is no specific requirement within the provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act or Federal Election Commission regulations for congressional or presidential campaign committees to pay for expenses incurred by a state or local government for campaign events, said Myles Martin, an FEC spokesman.  That means that campaigns can choose to reimburse governments for security costs, but they are not required. A Secret Service spokesman told PolitiFact that it is not funded to pay police overtime and doesn’t have a mechanism to do so. ""This is a blank spot in campaign finance laws and campaigns often take advantage of it, as the Trump campaign is in Minneapolis this week,"" said Carleton College political science professor Steven Schier. ""It's a low priority for Congress because it does not affect legislators' campaigns in a significant way."" There is, however, a mechanism for local law enforcement to seek reimbursement for protecting Trump’s residences in Florida, New York and New Jersey.  The Trump campaign said that the Minneapolis ""city government preemptively informed the Target Center that it would be responsible for $530,000 in security and other costs"" related to a Trump rally, ""more than 26 times the estimated security costs for a 2009 Target Center health care rally held by President Barack Obama."" A letter from AEG to the Trump campaign cites the $530,000 estimated costs. An article in the St. Paul Pioneer Press paraphrased the Minneapolis police chief at the time stating that the costs would be $20,000 for an Obama rally. We rate this claim True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C00EB00>],/factchecks/2019/oct/08/donald-trump/trump-campaign-says-minneapolis-wants-charge-53000/

Dunnavant doesn't prove claim Rodman favors abortion over adoption
","State Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R- Henrico is denouncing her challenger, Democrat Debra Rodman, as a ""liberal activist"" who has shown a ""lack of judgement"" during her two years in the House of Delegates. Dunnavant made the charges in a Sept. 30 mailer that criticizes Rodman on six issues. One particularly caught our attention. She said Rodman ""opposes adoption as an alternative to abortion in unplanned pregnancies."" We fact-checked her statement. Dunnavant’s mailer cites an unsuccessful 2018 bill Rodman co-sponsored that would have changed state mandates for family life education in public schools. It would have abolished what many Democrats said were biased standards calling for ""teaching the social, psychological and health gains to be realized by teenagers’ abstaining from sexual activity before marriage."" The bill also would have removed the requirement to teach ""the benefits of adoption as a positive choice in the event of an unwanted pregnancy."" In place of the mandates was a requirement that students get teaching ""that is medically accurate.""  The bill died in a partisan 12-10 vote in the House Education Committee on Feb. 5, 2018. Rodman voted in the minority with Democrats for the measure. Marshall Moreau, Dunnavant’s campaign manager, says Rodman’s support of the bill justifies the mailer claim. ""The only inference to be drawn is that Rodman is opposed to adoption as an alternative to abortion in the event of unplanned pregnancies,"" he wrote in an email. Dunnavant saidin the email, ""For Delegate Rodman to say she doesn't oppose adoption but doesn’t want to teach about it, is like saying ‘I want you to get out of the burning building but I’m not going to tell you where the fire escape is.’"" The bill Rodman backed was silent about adoption. Rodman and other Democrats say the bill wouldn’t have barred instruction about adoption; it would have required that if taught, it be in a neutral, factual way when discussing pregnancy, Rodman says her position has been contorted by Dunnavant. ""I believe in a woman’s right to choose,"" Rodman said in an email. ""Adoption is a wonderful choice women can and should make if it’s right for them. Politicians should not interfere in this personal choice."" Our ruling Dunnavant says Rodman ""opposes adoption as an alternative to abortion in event of unplanned pregnancies.""  She cites Rodman’s support of a bill that would have changed state mandates for family life courses in schools to ensure what Democrats said would be neutral and scientific teaching. It wouldn’t have ended instruction about adoption; it would have erased a requirement for teaching its ""benefits"" as a ""positive choice in the event of an unwanted pregnancy.""  Dunnavant wrenches that position on teaching to the sensational claim that Rodman supports abortion over adoption. Rodman says she backs choice on adoption and abortion. Dunnavant’s statement goes well beyond that, and she fails to credibly back it up. We rate Dunnavant’s statement False. Correction: An earlier version of this fact check gave the wrong date the family life education bill died in the House Education Committee.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D98700>],/factchecks/2019/oct/08/siobhan-dunnavant/dunnavant-falsely-claims-rodman-favors-abortion-ov/

Adam Schiff’s false claim that ‘we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower’
","Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in September that the House Intelligence Committee had not communicated with the whistleblower before the complaint about President Donald Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was filed. But recent reporting from the New York Times revealed that Schiff, the committee chairman, had indeed learned about the outlines of the whistleblower’s concerns days in advance.  Seeking guidance, the whistleblower turned to a House Intelligence Committee aide, who advised the whistleblower to get a lawyer and file a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, per committee procedures. The aide shared some of that information with Schiff. As the Washington Post’s Fact Checker first noted, this revelation flies in the face of Schiff’s public comments during the month of September, when he dodged questions about whether he or his committee had talked to the whistleblower and, in one case, denied that they had. On Sept. 17, more than a week before the whistleblower’s complaint was made public, MSNBC’s Sam Stein asked Schiff if he had heard from the whistleblower and if he wanted to. ""We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,"" Schiff said. ""We would like to. But I’m sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national Intelligence just as to how he is to communicate with Congress, and so the risk for the whistleblower is retaliation."" RELATED: What the whistleblower law says about sharing complaints with Congress The New York Times report, which quoted Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland acknowledging that ""the whistle-blower contacted the committee for guidance,"" shows that this statement was inaccurate. While it was not publicly known that Schiff’s committee had communicated with the whistleblower ahead of the complaint’s filing, Schiff knew the truth. When given the chance to say that the whistleblower had reached out to a committee aide, he did not. The New York Times reported that the committee aide received only a vague outline of the whistleblower’s concerns. Without revealing the whistleblower’s identity, the aide then told Schiff ""some of what the officer conveyed,"" the report said. Other outlets reported similar details. Previously, Schiff had given the impression that his committee never spoke to the whistleblower. Before Schiff’s MSNBC interview — in which he flatly stated, ""We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower"" — Schiff also evaded a question from CNN’s Anderson Cooper about whether he’d been contacted by the whistleblower or the whistleblower’s legal representation. ""I don’t want to get into any particulars,"" Schiff said during the Sept. 16 interview. ""I want to make sure that there’s nothing that I do that jeopardizes the whistleblower in any way."" Schiff has since clarified his remarks. He told the Daily Beast that until recently, he did not know for certain whether the complaint detailing the Trump-Zelensky call was submitted by the same whistleblower who contacted his staff.  He also said he thought the questions asking if the committee had heard from the whistleblower were focused on whether the whistleblower had testified privately in Congress. ""I was really thinking along the lines of wanting to get him to come in to testify,""  Schiff told the Daily Beast. ""I regret that I wasn't much more clear."" In a statement to PolitiFact, a spokesperson for the House Intelligence Committee said Schiff’s comments on MSNBC were ""intended to answer the question of whether the committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not."" ""Nonetheless, he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear,"" the spokesperson said.  Mark Zaid, the whistleblower’s counsel, declined to comment on the whistleblower’s outreach to committee staff but stressed that the whistleblower wrote the complaint ""entirely on their own."" We addressed the false claim that Schiff helped write the complaint in a separate fact-check. Schiff said, ""We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower."" The New York Times and other news organizations later reported that the whistleblower sought guidance from a House Intelligence Committee staffer before formally lodging the complaint.

There’s no evidence Schiff helped write the whistleblower complaint
","Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff knew more about the makings of a whistleblower complaint against President Donald Trump than he let on, according to reporting from the New York Times. But Republicans, including Trump, who have seized on the Times reporting have erred in claiming the reporting suggests Schiff helped write the complaint itself. The Oct. 2 story said Schiff — the head of the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Trump — had learned about the whistleblower complaint before it was officially filed. The newspaper reported that the CIA officer who filed the complaint had approached a committee aide for advice on how to proceed with concerns over Trump’s July phone call with the president of Ukraine. The article explained how Schiff, D-Calif., knew to press for the release of the whistleblower complaint, which the Trump administration had previously tried to keep from Congress.  The same day that the Times published its report, several right-leaning outlets jumped on the story, claiming it showed the whistleblower ""colluded"" with House Democrats. During a press conference, Trump claimed Schiff ""probably helped write"" the complaint and called it a hoax.  One Facebook post published the same day took it a step further, alleging Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., worked with lawyers to ""devise the complaint."" Another one says, ""Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff were participants with attorneys and are complicit in EDITING AND COMPOSING THE ‘WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT’ BEFORE IT WAS FILED."" Those posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Schiff ""learned about the outlines"" of the whistleblower complaint from the House Intelligence Committee aide who consulted with the CIA officer, the Times reported. The Times did not report that Schiff helped write, or devised the complaint. The Times reporting, which relied on anonymous sources and has been corroborated by the Washington Post, shows that the whistleblower approached one of Schiff’s aides with only a vague accusation against Trump. The aide told the CIA officer to find a lawyer and then told Schiff some of what the whistleblower told them. The aide did not share the officer’s identity with Schiff. The whistleblower’s primary concern centered on the phone call Trump had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25.  RELATED STORY: Timeline: The Trump impeachment inquiry During that call, a summary of which was released by the White House Sept. 25, Trump asked Zelensky to consider reviving an investigation linked to Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that Joe Biden’s son had worked for as a board member while his father was vice president. That request came after Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. The whistleblower reached out to the House Intelligence Committee aide sometime before they filed the official complaint to the inspector general of the intelligence community Aug. 12. Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump on Sept. 24, and Schiff is leading that inquiry. The Washington Post article said it is not uncommon for the House Intelligence Committee to receive informal inquiries from whistleblowers before a formal complaint is filed, according to ""current and former committee staffers."" And the officer took their concerns to the committee only after they had a colleague relay them to the CIA’s top lawyer, which resulted in the CIA alerting the White House. That spooked the whistleblower into taking their concerns directly to the House, the New York Times reported. Schiff did receive some information about the whistleblower complaint before it was formally presented to Congress. But both the House Intelligence Committee and a lawyer representing the whistleblower told us the complaint was drafted independently of Schiff’s input, and we could find no evidence to the contrary. At the same time, Trump and Republicans have produced no evidence to suggest Schiff had helped draft or shape the complaint. We asked the House Intelligence Committee what Schiff learned from the aide about the whistleblower complaint. A spokesman declined to comment on the particulars of that interaction, but he denied that Schiff had any contact with the whistleblower directly. ""As Chairman Schiff has made clear, he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, has had no communication with them or their attorney, and did not view the whistleblower’s complaint until the day prior to the hearing with the (Department of National Intelligence) when the (Office of the Director of National Intelligence) finally provided it to the Committee,"" the committee spokesman said in an email. RELATED STORY: PolitiFact's Trump-Ukraine-Biden coverage in one place We also reached out to Mark Zaid, the attorney representing the CIA officer.

""In fact, none of the legal team saw the complaint until it was publicly released by Congress,"" Zaid said in an email. ""To be unequivocally clear, no member or congressional staff had any input into or reviewed the complaint before it was submitted to the intelligence community inspector general. Nor has the whistleblower or the legal team met with or even discussed this complaint with congressman Schiff."" Several Facebook posts claimed that Schiff helped write the whistleblower complaint against Trump. We still don’t know exactly what information Schiff received about the whistleblower’s concerns. But there is no evidence to suggest that Schiff knew who the whistleblower was, much less that he helped them draft this complaint. The Facebook posts go beyond what has been reported.

Monica Lewinsky didn’t tweet she would engage in oral sex with Trump to convince GOP to impeach
","Amid the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, a screenshot of a salacious fake tweet attributed to Monica Lewinsky is circulating on Facebook. The fabricated tweet makes it appear that Lewinsky, a central figure in the 1999 impeachment of President Bill Clinton for obstruction of justice and lying under oath, made a sexually suggestive comment involving Trump, oral sex and her interest in seeing Trump impeached. Clinton’s impeachment charge stemmed from a sexual harassment case, in which Lewinsky, then a White House intern, became famously intertwined following an independent council’s investigation into sexual encounters between Lewinsky and Clinton.  The viral image in question displays Lewinsky’s real Twitter profile picture and handle. It makes it look like she authored a tweet time-stamped at 6:06 p.m. on Oct. 3, with 1,610 retweets and over 18,000 likes, that read: ""I’m willing to take one for (sic) team and give Trump a b****** in the oval office. Apparently, that’s the only thing that can convince Republicans to impeach."" The screenshot was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The fake tweet appears to have been created by Instagram user @electorotting — the handle appears in the upper right hand corner of the tweet’s image.

For a viral tweet that has supposedly garnered thousands of retweets and likes, only one similarly-worded tweet from a user who isn’t Lewinsky showed up on the platform.

Are half of those arrested for DWIs on I-35 unauthorized immigrants?
","During a panel on the border crisis hosted by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, a Republican from Central Texas, answered questions alongside Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Williams said he is frustrated when he hears people characterize the situation at the border as a ""homemade crisis"" or a ""made-up crisis."" ""We’re doing everything we can do to help these folks, but at the same time, we’ve got to get back to defending our borders and the rule of law,"" Williams said at the August event. ""I had a meeting with law enforcement in my district and they said, here’s a fact for you — we’re all familiar with Interstate 35 — they said 50% of the DUIs on Interstate 35 are from illegals. Ninety percent of the 50% have absolutely no identification. So you give them a ticket, you can’t put them in jail because the jails are full here ... so you send them on their way."" There are a lot of problems with Williams’ claim. First of all, he appears to be conflating DUIs and DWIs. He referenced DUIs, an offense reserved for minors who are found to be operating a motor vehicle with any detectable amount of alcohol in their systems, but then went on to discuss placing offenders in jail. When minors in Texas are apprehended by law enforcement, they are taken to a juvenile processing office and then, if they are not released to a parent or guardian, to a juvenile detention facility. Also, his claim that individuals pulled over for DWIs are sent ""on their way"" with a ticket because jails in Texas are full is inaccurate. Jails across the state are at varying levels of occupancy and have different practices in place to handle capacity issues. Williams also did not specify which parts of the freeway he was considering and he did not offer a timeframe for his claim. After speaking with officials at five law enforcement agencies in Texas and reviewing different records related to arrests and immigration status, it is clear that there is no evidence to support Williams’ claim. None of the agencies we contacted could provide data to directly inform Williams’ statement. The information they could share revealed that a small percentage of all arrests for people driving while intoxicated are individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. No official figures on this claim are maintained by law enforcement Interstate 35 is a roughly 1,600-mile freeway that stretches from Laredo at the Texas-Mexico border to Minnesota. The road runs through Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Iowa. About 504 miles of the freeway are in Texas. Williams represents the 25th Congressional District, which includes multiple non-connected stretches of the interstate. In Austin, his district includes more than 3 miles near downtown. It also includes about 55 miles of Interstate 35 West from Abbott to Burleson and about 9 miles of Interstate 35 East outside of Milford. John Etue, chief of staff to Williams, said that the numbers came from law enforcement officers within the 25th Congressional District ""regarding their personal experiences while performing their duties within their areas of operation."" ""These are not official Texas or DPS stats,"" he said. Etue declined a request to provide information about the officers who provided the information, including the agency where they work. I-35 is part of the state highway system and is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation. Various law enforcement agencies enforce traffic laws on these roadways, including the state’s Department of Public Safety, which houses the State Highway Patrol. Local law enforcement officers also enforce traffic laws on portions of the highways that are within their jurisdiction. We first turned to the Texas Department of Public Safety for its figures on drunken driving arrests on I-35, but a spokesperson said: ""The data you’re requesting is not something the department tracks."" Williams said he spoke with officers in the 25th Congressional District, so we turned to four law enforcement agencies with coverage areas that overlap with the portion of I-35 that runs through the district — the Austin Police Department, the Travis County sheriff’s office, the Hill County sheriff’s office and the Hillsboro Police Department. In Texas, local officers are allowed — but not required — to ask about the immigration status of any individual they detain, including during traffic stops. Local jails also are required to comply with requests from federal immigration authorities to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement places detainers on people who have been arrested on criminal charges and ""for whom ICE possesses probable cause to believe that they are removable from the United States."" When a detainer is placed on an individual, local law enforcement must hold the individual for up to 48 hours, giving ICE agents time to respond and take custody of the individual. None of the entities we contacted were able to provide the exact information we requested, due to discrepancies in how information is recorded and maintained across agencies. Open records policies also limit what information can be released about ICE detainers. Only one agency was able to provide any information about whether individuals arrested for DWIs had identification. Other data highlights problem with Williams’ claim The Austin Police Department provided figures about all arrests for driving while intoxicated on I-35, but could not provide information about immigration status. The department has made 3,904 DWI arrests on I-35 from January 2014 through the end of August this year, according to records provided by the department. The Travis County sheriff’s office tracks people booked into the county jail with DWI arrests who had been flagged by federal immigration authorities, but they do not filter the information by the location of the arrest. The jail houses individuals arrested across the county by many different law enforcement agencies. From Aug. 1, 2018, to Aug. 31 of this year, there were 6,182 bookings into the county jail on new DWI arrests. Of those arrests, 7.4% of those individuals had an ICE detainer. Also, in Travis County, the court tasked with handling DWI cases had information about DWI arrests and the percentage of people arrested who were from a different country, but court officials were not able to zero in on people here illegally or the location of the arrest. They also could not provide information on whether an individual had identification or not. Of all the DWI cases that went before the court in fiscal year 2018, about 20% involved people who were not U.S. citizens. It’s unclear what percentage of that group were people who were in the country illegally. Travis County Attorney David Escamilla, whose office prosecutes misdemeanors like DWIs, said he was not familiar with the figures cited by Williams. ""I’ve never seen that type of metric and I find it highly improbable,"" Escamilla said. The Hillsboro Police Department was able to provide information about DWI arrests within its jurisdiction and the number of people arrested who were in the country illegally at the time of the arrest, but they could not limit the arrests by location. From 2011 through 2019, the department made 180 DWI arrests. Of those, three people had ICE detainers. Of those three people, one did not have identification. Finally, Capt. Justin Motherspau at the Hill County sheriff’s office said the details in Williams’ claim are ""not something that we even have the ability to track."" Our ruling Williams said, ""50% of the DUIs on Interstate 35 are from illegals. Ninety percent of the 50% have absolutely no identification."" There is no evidence to support Williams’ claim, which an aide said was based on a meeting he had with law enforcement officers in his district. The aide did not identify the officers or the agency where they worked. Data shows that small percentages of those charged with DWI in jurisdictions along I-35 within the 25th Congressional District lack legal immigration status. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

Durbin mostly on target with claim about police support for expanding background checks
","In remarks during a visit to a Chicago hospital, Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin said President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are standing in the way of efforts on Capitol Hill to address gun violence despite widespread public support. Trump and McConnell, he contended, have stonewalled efforts to expand background check requirements via bipartisan legislation that cleared the Democrat-controlled House more than 200 days ago. Current federal law requires background checks for sales by licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers; the House bill would require background checks for all firearm purchases. ""Background checks just make sense,"" Durbin said. ""Turns out that 90% of policemen are for it, 90% of gun owners are for it, the overwhelming majority of members of the National Rifle Association are for it. And yet this president and the leader of the Senate refuse to act."" PolitiFact has previously checked claims about broad support for expanded background checks among the general public, along with statements that line up with what Durbin said about gun owners and members of the National Rifle Association widely backing them as well. But his claim about support among law enforcement wasn’t one we’d heard before, so we decided to check it out. A spokesperson for Durbin’s office pointed us to results from a survey published in 2017 by Pew Research Center, a generally reliable source for data. Experts we contacted told us they were not aware of any more recent surveys on the topic. That survey — conducted for Pew by the National Police Research Platform, a consortium of researchers headquartered at the University of Illinois at Chicago — found 88% of police support ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks."" The margin of error for the question was plus or minus two percentage points, according to a Pew spokesperson. As the survey’s detailed methodology section lays out, interviews were completed online during the summer of 2016 by nearly 8,000 officers from 54 police and sheriff’s departments across the country. Experts, including at Pew, explained there’s one caveat worth keeping in mind, though. The survey left out more rural, small-town police forces throughout the country: It provides a nationally representative sample of officers working in departments that employ at least 100 full-time sworn officers, but smaller departments were not included. ""While 88% appears to be a good estimate for this sampling frame, it may exclude a fraction of the nation’s officers who disproportionately hold more conservative views on gun control issues,"" said polling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis. However, Smith noted, a substantial majority of police nationwide likely work for departments of the size that were included. Indeed, 63% of all sworn officers work in departments of more than 100 officers, according to Pew. So the result still speaks for the majority. To gain some insight into that position, we asked local law enforcement leaders why police are likely to support expanding background checks. ""Most of them want to protect the Constitution,"" said Frank Kaminski, police chief of Park Ridge, Ill. and a former president of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police. ""But they also see the violence in the streets every day and realize that we have to take common sense measures to reduce it."" ""When we talk about violence, we talk about violence not only to citizens but also to officers,"" he added. While speaking about legislation that would expand background checks to all gun sales, Durbin said 90% of police back such a policy. He was referencing a 2017 survey by Pew Research Center, which asked police at departments that employ 100 or more officers whether they support requiring background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows. Eighty-eight percent responded that they did. However, it’s important to note that survey left out officers at smaller, more rural jurisdictions who may not share the same views, and we could not find any other recent polls that addressed the question. We rate Durbin’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE — The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Sen. Scott Fitzgerald misfires with claim on gun background checks and Second Amendment
","Editor's Note: This item was updated to clarify that firearms dealers are required to fill out and reatain ATF Form 4473 for all types of gun purchases. Gun control is a contentious topic in Wisconsin’s divided government, with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers planning to force the issue by calling the Republican-controlled Legislature into a special session. The debate here and elsewhere typically centers on two types of legislation, both of which have been implemented in many other states: Red flag laws — These allow judges to temporarily remove firearms from people acting dangerously. Universal background checks — These measures require background checks for sales by private parties, in addition to gun dealers, which are already required by federal law. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald was asked to weigh in on the topic in a Sept. 22, 2019, appearance on WISN-TV’s ""UpFront."" He said he didn’t see any momentum for red flag laws, then pivoted, unprompted, to the other gun control flashpoint. ""Universal background checks, too,"" said the Juneau Republican, who recently announced he is running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. ""I mean, any time you’re going to ask somebody to submit the serial numbers to their guns to a state or federal official, it’s going to violate the Second Amendment."" This raises some questions worth examining. People can disagree on whether universal background checks are a good idea (polling shows most Wisconsinites think so), but we should at least be able to agree on what they are. So, do background checks really involve submitting serial numbers to the government? And would that violate the Second Amendment? How background checks work Fitzgerald’s office did not reply to our requests for evidence of his claim and more details on his position. But his response in the TV interview suggests universal background checks are tantamount to a gun registry — where the government keeps a record of which guns each person owns. It’s a common argument from opponents of universal background checks, who see it as a step toward confiscation. But it’s an over-simplification of a nuanced issue. There’s no, well, universal version of universal background checks, but the basic concept is that private sellers are subject to the same general requirements as licensed gun dealers, including background checks on the would-be purchaser and keeping records of the sale. Wisconsin is one of 29 states that currently do not require background checks or record-keeping on private gun sales. At the federal level, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales as it does those involving licensed firearm dealers. Some states — including California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington — require all private sales be conducted through firearm dealers, who then retain sales records, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization. They call that the ""most comprehensive policy option."" Other states give private sellers the option of going through law enforcement directly for the background check. The record-keeping requirements vary, with some states leaving that to the individual selling the gun and others requiring transfers be reported to local law enforcement. RELATED: Can you buy a gun in Wisconsin after a felony or restraining order? In Wisconsin, any universal background check would have to be integrated with the current system for gun dealer sales, which splits background check responsibilities based on the type of gun. The state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales, while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems, run by the FBI. What information is submitted to the government Fitzgerald says he objects to universal background checks because of the new requirements they would place on private gun sales, so let’s examine how those could look. If Wisconsin implemented a comprehensive universal background check system, routing all sales through dealers, the flow of information to authorities would be the same as it is now for dealer sales. For long gun sales, dealers fill out ATF form 4473 — which includes the gun make and serial number — and submit it to the FBI’s criminal background system. The FBI conducts the background check but is required by federal law to destroy identifying information on the purchaser and gun within 24 hours. The dealer is then required to keep a copy of the 4473 form for at least 20 years. After that point, or if the dealer goes out of business, the form is turned over to the ATF. But federal law forbids the ATF from storing these records in a searchable format or otherwise using them ""to establish any system for the registration of firearms."" The records are retained using decades-old microfilm technology, making gun tracing a painstaking, manual process. For handguns, Wisconsin dealers still fill out and retain the form 4473, but background checks are done by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. State law requires dealers to submit the name, date of birth, gender, Social Security number and other identifying information to the Wisconsin DOJ. But the agency does not receive or store serial numbers or any other firearm information, said spokeswoman Gillian Drummond. So under a comprehensive system, serial numbers would — eventually — make it to a government agency. But it is typically decades before that happens, and the agency is then prohibited from turning those into a database. If Wisconsin opted for a less comprehensive system, less information would go to the government. For example, if the state DOJ were tasked with all background checks for private sales and private sellers were required to maintain their own records (as in Illinois), no serial numbers would be submitted to any government entity for any private gun sales. Would a gun registry violate the Second Amendment? All of this brings us to the last element of Fitzgerald’s claim — that submitting serial numbers to government officials violates the Second Amendment. Courts have said that isn’t true. Six states and the District of Columbia already require registration of some or all firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center. ""These state laws have been in place for decades and have not been overturned on the grounds that they violate an individual’s Second Amendment rights,"" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. ""Nothing in any Supreme Court ruling to date would suggest that a government requirement that gun owners provide serial numbers for the guns they purchase or own to government officials violates the Second Amendment."" For example, a challenge to the Washington, D.C. registration requirement in 2015 was largely upheld by a federal appeals court. The ruling stripped away some elements of the law but left untouched the basic requirement that guns be registered. Our ruling Fitzgerald says universal background checks would involve asking people to submit their guns’ serial numbers to the government, which would violate the Second Amendment. The serial numbers that are submitted for background checks don’t end up in government hands for years or decades. And then the federal agency is barred from fashioning them into a database. What’s more, there is no evidence such a requirement would violate the Second Amendment, since several states have gun registries that have not been struck down by the courts — and a similar provision was upheld by federal courts in a Washington, D.C. case. We define Mostly False as ""a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000002809726ACC0>],/factchecks/2019/oct/04/scott-fitzgerald/wisconsin-lawmaker-takes-aim-and-misses-claim-gun-/

Jefferson didn’t say 'freedom is lost gradually from uninterested, uninformed, uninvolved people'
","Did Thomas Jefferson say that freedom is lost gradually from ""uninterested, uninformed and uninvolved people""? That’s what one viral Facebook post claims.

Officials at the University of Virginia Press, which works in conjunction with Founders Online, told PolitiFact that they see no evidence it was said by Jefferson.  ""It is very unlikely that this is a verbatim quotation from anything Jefferson ever wrote himself. The style and phrasing is uncharacteristic, and as you can verify from a search in Founders Online he very rarely used the words ‘uninterested’ or ‘uninvolved,’"" David Sewell, managing editor of Digital Initiatives at the organization, wrote in an email.

No, Freddy Krueger wasn’t based on a real serial killer, despite social media rumor
","This is the stuff nightmares are made of. As Halloween approaches, a viral Facebook post claims the infamous ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" film franchise serial killer Freddy Krueger was based on a real murderer. The post displays a photograph of a headstone that reads ""Frederick Kruger 1838-1910,"" with a lengthy caption that reads:  ""DID YOU KNOW...That the Horror Film Character Freddy Kruger was based on a real life serial killer who lived in Rockville, Wisconsin in the 1800s. According to court county records of the time, Mr. Kruger was known to have killed at least twenty children within a three mile radius of where he lived. He reportedly murdered most of the children using only a Gardening claw.""  It goes onto claim that ""Kruger"" lived in an abandoned factory and was eventually caught after starting a fire in the facility where he ""burned over 70% of his body."" After dying in his sleep at the age of 72, the post says, unexpected deaths occurred to teens and children while they were sleeping, thus later providing inspiration for the notorious Krueger horror character. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Sorry, but we have to lay this spooky tale to rest. Krueger was not based on a real person – the story is entirely made up.

Happy October everyone!)."" Meanwhile, horror film director and Krueger creator, the late Wes Craven, revealed in a 2014 interview with Vulture that he got the idea for the movie from a creepy news story he read in the Los Angeles Times: ""I’d read an article in the L.A. Times about a family who had escaped the Killing Fields in Cambodia and managed to get to the U.S. Things were fine, and then suddenly the young son was having very disturbing nightmares. He told his parents he was afraid that if he slept, the thing chasing him would get him, so he tried to stay awake for days at a time. When he finally fell asleep, his parents thought this crisis was over. Then they heard screams in the middle of the night. By the time they got to him, he was dead. He died in the middle of a nightmare. Here was a youngster having a vision of a horror that everyone older was denying. That became the central line of Nightmare on Elm Street."" A scary tale that Freddy Krueger was based on a real serial killer is recirculating on social media. This story is fabricated.

US middle class no longer leads the world? Biden’s claim mostly on target
","Standing before thousands of Iowa voters, former Vice President Joe Biden recounted lessons from his salesman father about the dignity of work. ""He used to say, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community,"" Biden said Sept. 21 at the Steak Fry in hosted by Polk County Democrats in Des Moines. ""He would always end by saying it’s about being able to look your child in the eye and saying, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.’"" That’s changed, according to Biden. ""Well, today a majority of the middle class can’t look their children in the eye. They don’t believe that they can say ‘it’s going to be okay.’ They don’t believe that their child will do as well as they did,"" he said in a speech. ""We have never ever had that happen in America. We’re no longer the wealthiest middle class in the world."" Biden’s remark about the middle class caught our ear at the Democratic event, so we decided to look into it. Because there is no universally recognized definition of ""middle class,"" there are various ways to measure the data based on wealth and income.  Biden’s claim tracks back to a 2014 article in the New York Times headlined ""The American Middle Class Is No Longer the World’s Richest.""  It’s important to note that while Biden used the word ""wealthiest"" in his Iowa comment, the article — and most of the economic literature — has focused on income. Income refers to money earned in a period of time, such as a year, while wealth refers to the accumulation of past income and assets. So they’re not exactly the same thing, but we’ll take a look at the studies on income as the best available approximation. LIS, a group that maintains the Luxembourg Income Study Database, worked together with the New York Times’ Upshot team to examine data for household income from around the world. The article’s analysis used median income through 2010 as an indicator of the economic status of the middle class. The new champion of middle class wealth, the article predicted, was Canada. The New York Times wrote that median income in Canada pulled into a tie with median United States income in 2010 and that Canada had most likely surpassed it since then. Median incomes in Western Europe still trailed the United States, but the gap had narrowed. The New York Times attributed the findings to a few factors: U.S. educational attainment rose more slowly than elsewhere in the industrialized world, U.S. companies distributed less profits to workers, and Americans received meager raises. The data showed that when examining the 50th percentile of income, the United States was strongly ahead of other nations in 1980. But by 2010, Canada and Norway caught up to the United States. Other groups have worked on this middle-class comparison, with similar findings of a U.S. retreat. The Pew Research Center, for example, compared the United States with 11 Western European countries based on the median (after-tax) household income of each country. In 2013, the national median disposable income for a three-person household in the United States was $52,195, behind Luxembourg ($65,293) and Norway ($57,031). (The income numbers were adjusted for differences in the cost of living across countries, using 2011 prices.) In 1991, the United State and Luxembourg were considered equally on top. (The difference of a few hundred dollars is not statistically significant.) However, comparing the median income in Luxembourg and the United States may not be an ideal comparison, because their economies and populations are so vastly different (600,000 Luxembourgians versus 327 million Americans).  Another source on this question is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a consortium of about three dozen member countries that share internationally comparable data. According to 2016 data used by the OECD, the United States had the fourth-largest median income among OECD countries behind Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland. Aside from wealth, economists also use size as a way to examine a country’s middle class. OECD’s analysis on the middle class found that the share of people in the U.S. middle-income class — just over 50% — is much smaller than in most OECD countries. OECD defined middle class as 75-200 percent of median income. OECD also found that the U.S. middle-income class has grown smaller with each successive decade. Janet C. Gornick, a professor at the CUNY Graduate Center and director of the US Office of LIS, said that the middle class has hollowed out in several industrialized countries including the United States since the 1980s. The share of the middle class — defined as non-elderly households with income between half and twice the median income — shrunk by about 2 percentage points between 1985 and 2013 in the United States. ""Our middle class is getting lonely because a lot of people have exited that middle,"" Gornick said. ""In recent decades, some have exited the middle by moving up, and some have exited the middle because they moved down."" When the middle class hollows out, the public can lose investments in public institutions and infrastructure such as schools, subways and even the electrical grid. The affluent can afford to send their children to private schools, hire private drivers or even use generators during power outages. ""If the middle class becomes very small — even if it’s comfortable — as there are fewer of them it is very threatening to the function of democracy,"" Gornick said. Biden said, ""We’re no longer the wealthiest middle class in the world."" A 2014 article in the New York Times, using solid data through 2010, found that Canadian median income tied the United States in 2010 and was likely to surpass it. Other data from Pew Research Center backs up the idea that the U.S. middle class now trails Norway and Luxembourg, when it used to at least be equally on top with the latter small country.  Biden was imprecise in describing this as a change based on wealth, when the metrics were based on income. With that caveat, we rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DF97C0>],/factchecks/2019/oct/04/joe-biden/us-middle-class-no-longer-leads-world-bidens-claim/

Fact-checking Charlie Kirk’s misleading tweet about Democrats, Ukraine
","Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk floated a trio of misleading claims on Twitter in an effort to link Democrats to misconduct in Ukraine. ""Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival's campaign manager, 3 Democrat senators asked Ukraine to investigate Trump, and the DNC solicited Ukraine's help to dig up dirt on Trump, and the media was silent about all of it,"" Kirk wrote in the Sept 29 tweet.    This is your daily reminder that:Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival's campaign manager3 Democrat senators asked Ukraine to investigate TrumpAnd the DNC solicited Ukraine's help to dig up dirt on TrumpAnd the media was silent about all of it🤔 House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump after discovering he had urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential challenger in the 2020 presidential election. Kirk, Trump and other conservatives have tried pinning allegations of wrongdoing back on Democrats. During a Sept. 25 press conference, Trump charged that Democratic senators ""have actually done what they’re accusing me of doing, which I didn’t do."" But what are the facts about these claims?  We decided to break Kirk’s tweet down and see how each of his three claims stacked up to the facts. Put simply, all three are oversimplified and misleading. This claim is unproven. We found no evidence that former President Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager.  In a statement to PolitiFact, a spokesperson for Kirk pointed to opinion pieces in the Washington Post, Fox News and The Hill. According to one such article by The Hill’s John Solomon, investigators from Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) met with U.S. officials in January 2016 to discuss coordinating their anti-corruption efforts. Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian embassy official, told Solomon that Obama’s Justice Department asked the NABU officials during that meeting to revive a closed 2014 investigation of payments to Manafort by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin who fled Ukraine in 2014 amid protests. But Telizhenko — who worked at the embassy for less than a year, per the Washington Post — also said he could not remember if Manafort was specifically mentioned at the meeting. Solomon also quoted Telizhenko and another Ukrainian official drawing a link between the January 2016 meeting and the release months later of a ledger showing off-the-books payments from Yanukovych’s political party to Manafort.  Serhiy Leshchenko, the member of Ukraine's parliament and investigative journalist who revealed the existence of the ledger in a press conference, wrote in a recent Washington Post op-ed that he was not working with the intent of helping Democrats. ""This was Leshchenko coming forward,"" said Steven Pifer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton. ""Nothing I have seen suggests that he did so at the request of the Obama White House."" John Herbst, director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council and the former ambassador to Ukraine under President George W. Bush, said the release of the ledger was not unusual: ""When the ledger came out, as someone who’s been watching Ukraine very closely for the last five years, that seemed to be an absolutely normal development given Ukraine’s own politics."" Ukrainians were already attentive to Manafort because of his connections to Yanukovych, Herbst said. They became more interested once Manafort became part of the Trump campaign. ""I am a bit skeptical about the notion that you had Ukrainians meeting with the Justice Department to plot strategy on this thing,"" Herbst said. ""I can’t flatly tell you it’s wrong."" Whatever was said, it’s also important to note that the alleged discussion happened in January 2016, while Trump didn’t hire Manafort to work on his campaign until March 2016. Manafort was named campaign chairman in May 2016. Solomon did not respond to a request for comment but defended his work on Twitter. A spokesman for Obama declined to comment. This claim distorts what happened. In May 2018, Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Bob Menendez of New Jersey wrote a letter to Yuriy Lutsenko, prosecutor general of Ukraine, urging him to cooperate with former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation on Russian election interference. Citing an article from the New York Times, the senators noted that Ukraine had reportedly stopped four investigations related to the Mueller probe for fear that the country’s cooperation could have jeopardized its ability to secure financial and military aid from the United States. ""If these reports are true, we strongly encourage you to reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation,"" they wrote. The senators also asked if the Trump administration had encouraged Ukrainian officials to impede Mueller’s investigations in Ukraine. But they never asked Ukraine to investigate Trump, as Kirk falsely claimed. The senators clarified their intentions in a recent press release. ""This wasn’t about asking for an investigation, but to follow up on the New York Times report that the Ukraine prosecutor was ending his own ongoing investigations and not cooperating with queries from Mueller concerning Manafort,"" Leahy spokesman David Carle told PolitiFact. This claim is misleading. It has its origins in a 2017 Politico report, which we’ve looked at before. According to the report, a Ukrainian-American consultant for the Democratic National Committee looked for compromising information about Manafort and revealed some findings to officials at the Ukrainian embassy and the DNC. But Kirk’s claim overstates the report’s findings. There’s no evidence that the DNC was working directly with Ukraine’s government. The consultant, Alexandra Chalupa, told Politico that she had taken it upon herself to research Manafort’s connections to Yanukovych, the ousted former Ukrainian president. As Trump’s campaign surged, she started researching Trump’s ties to Russia, as well. Chalupa shared some rumors and findings with officials from the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, the report said. The day after Trump hired Manafort, she told the DNC’s communications team about Manafort, Trump and their ties to Russia. Hacked emails also show her telling a DNC official a few months later that she had more information on Manafort. The Politico report also said the DNC encouraged Chalupa to ask Ukrainian embassy staff if former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Yanukovych’s successor, would be willing to take a question from a reporter on Manafort’s hire and ties to Yanukovych. But a former DNC staffer told Politico the DNC was ""not directing or driving her work."" Chalupa took issue with the Politico article in a Facebook post. She told CNN she was not an opposition researcher and that the DNC never asked her to seek dirt from Ukraine. Multiple DNC and Clinton campaign officials also denied working with the Ukraine government. Kenneth Vogel, one of the reporters behind the Politico story, clarified on Twitter that the ""DNC consultant was not repping DNC"" in her communications with Ukrainians. Adrienne Watson, spokeswoman for the DNC, told PolitiFact that Chalupa was a part-time consultant hired to help the DNC ""engage in outreach to American ethnic communities."" ""The DNC’s contract with Chalupa permitted her to have other clients and/or engage in activities not on behalf of the DNC, which she presumably did,"" Watson said. Kirk said, ""Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival's campaign manager, 3 Democrat senators asked Ukraine to investigate Trump, and the DNC solicited Ukraine's help to dig up dirt on Trump, and the media was silent about all of it."" Kirk’s three claims are all rooted in events or incidents that did transpire, but they oversimplify what happened in such a way that they give a misleading impression.

No, Red Bull doesn’t contain bull semen
","Red Bull gives you wings, according to the energy drink company’s marketing team, but there’s little mention of bull sperm.  Still, an August 2016 Facebook post being shared again claims that Red Bull does contain such an ingredient. The post features a picture of a Red Bull can, a picture of a milky substance in a vial, and this text: ""Q: Do energy drinks have bull sperm in it? Answer: Yes. A study done by longhorn cattle company tested some of the top energy drink brands (Red Bull, Monster, etc) and found that they do in fact contain bull sperm.""  This post, which has been shared more than 7,200 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Red Bull did not respond to emails we sent asking about the post.  But according to its website, the Red Bull energy drink contains caffeine, sugar, B-group vitamins and taurine, which it describes as ""an amino acid naturally occurring in the human body and present in the daily diet."" A Q&A section on the website says that the drink is ""suitable for vegetarians"" because it uses only non-animal ingredients. It also addresses whether taurine is made from ""bull’s testicles."" It’s not. Rather, the company says, it’s produced synthetically by pharmaceutical companies without animal products. Taurine is also found in food like scallops, fish and poultry, and most infant formulas, according to the company.  In fact, taurine is in many animal tissues as well as plants. According to the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes database of medical terminology, taurine derives its name from the Latin word ""taurus"" for bull. It was first isolated from ox bile in 1827 by German scientists Friedrich Tiedemann and Leopold Gmelin.  Scientists have debunked the notion that energy drinks like Red Bull are made with taurine derived from animals. In July 2018, Joe Schwarcz, director of McGill University’s Office for Science and Society, wrote that while scientists originally isolated taurine from bull semen, it’s now produced synthetically. ""This compound is an ‘aminosulfonic acid’ that is widely distributed in the human body and plays a role in cardiovascular function, development of the nervous system and formation of bile acids,"" he says in the post. . Schwarcz warns that excessive consumption of energy drinks should be avoided, ""but not because of a concern that taurine is isolated from bull semen.""  We rate this Facebook post False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096890A80>],/factchecks/2019/oct/03/viral-image/no-red-bull-doesnt-contain-bull-semen/

Florida Democrats spin about Trump's Medicare budget ahead of Villages visit
","President Donald Trump set his sights on a central Florida retirement community to lay out his vision on Medicare, even as House Democrats pursued an impeachment inquiry. As his visit to The Villages neared, Florida Democrats attacked Trump’s record on Medicare, suggesting he wants to weaken the health care program for the elderly. A Sept. 30 tweet from the state party about Trump's ""toxic record"" included a graphic that says ""$575 billion cut from Medicare in Trump’s proposed 2020 budget.""  FACT: @realDonaldTrump is toxic for Florida. This week, in honor of Trump's visit, we will be sharing important facts from #TrumpsToxicRecord 👎 #flapol pic.twitter.com/gtp5wt9fI2 That statement is misleading. That is a projected reduction of future spending over a decade for the health care program for the elderly. And it’s worth noting that President Barack Obama called for trimming Medicare spending, too. The first thing to know about Trump’s 2020 budget proposal is that it is just an expression of Trump’s priorities and ideas. The changes proposed by Trump to slow down the growth in spending will only occur if Congress passes a law. Medicare spending rises just about every year in Trump's budget proposal. Medicare is projected to grow by about $10 trillion over a decade. The Medicare cost reduction under Trump’s budget is expected to be roughly $600 billion over the next 10 years, when compared to current spending levels, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s analysis in May. The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget largely agrees, saying Trump’s  budget proposal reduces Medicare spending by $515 billion or $575 billion.  About 85% of the savings comes from reductions in what Medicare pays to providers. ""Those cuts would primarily reduce what Medicare pays providers, and I would not expect them to have negative effects on Medicare beneficiaries,"" Matt Fiedler, an economics fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, previously told PolitiFact. ""The budget’s Medicare proposals are also, in my view, largely sensible policy."" Not all of the proposed cuts land on providers, however.  Changes in Medicare’s Part D prescription drug insurance program might be the clearest example of Medicare cuts in the Trump budget that affect ordinary Americans. While one proposal would cap out-of-pocket costs for people with the very highest drug costs, another would expose people below that cost level to higher fees. At the end of the day, the Trump budget reduces payments for people who rely on prescription drugs by $50 billion. The idea of reducing the growth of Medicare isn’t new — and many of Trump’s ideas build upon ideas originally proposed in President Obama's budgets. Obama’s last budget proposed trimming Medicare spending by $420 billion over 10 years. (Republicans accused Obama and Democrats of cutting Medicare many times, a claim we never rated better than Half True.) The Florida Democratic Party tweeted ""$575 billion cut from Medicare in Trump’s proposed 2020 budget."" There is some truth to the attack.  But the Democrats omit that the figure pertains to an amount of reduced spending over a decade. Also, it is a proposed reduction relative to projected future spending. Medicare spending will still rise overall.  We rate this statement Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C65B00>],/factchecks/2019/oct/03/florida-democratic-party/trump-visit-florida-state-democrats-mislead-about-/

No, Donald Trump could not seek a third term if an impeachment trial failed
","Singer and model Kaya Jones falsely claimed that if President Donald Trump is impeached but not removed from office, he could have the chance to serve an extra term in the White House.   ""Did you know that if the impeachment reaches the house and passes to the senate and isn’t passed the first term is nullified and Trump can run two more terms,"" Jones, a former band member of the Pussycat Dolls, wrote in an Oct. 1 tweet. In a follow-up tweet, Jones, who describes herself on Twitter as being associated with Trump’s campaign advisory board, directed her followers to a thread on Quora, a question-and-answer website, about whether the results of a presidential election can be nullified. That’s not how impeachment works, however.  The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution prohibits presidents from being elected to office more than twice. The amendment reads: ""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once."" The basics of the impeachment process are spelled out in the Constitution. The House has ""the sole power of impeachment"" while the Senate reserves ""the sole power to try all impeachments."" When a president is tried in the Senate, the Constitution says ""the Chief Justice shall preside"" and a two-thirds vote is required to convict and remove the president from office. The specific contours of the impeachment process have taken shape over time, as we noted in our in-depth analysis of what an impeachment inquiry against Trump could look like. But the Constitution says nothing about a president’s term being ""nullified"" by a failed attempt at removal. If it did, then we might have seen former President Bill Clinton — who was impeached in the House but acquitted by the Senate — float the idea of running for a third term. ""That’s ridiculous,"" said Louis Seidman, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown Law, of Jones’s claim. ""There’s no truth to that whatsoever."" Frank O. Bowman III, professor at the University of Missouri School of Law and the author of a book on impeachment, added that it was ""absolute rubbish.""  ""Under the 22nd Amendment, presidents get two terms, period (with a special exception if someone accedes to the office during the term of another president, but serves less than two years of that term),"" Bowman wrote in an email to PolitiFact. ""Not the case for Trump."" Jones did not respond to a request for comment. Jones said ""if the impeachment reaches the house and passes to the senate and isn’t passed the first term is nullified and Trump can run two more terms."" The Constitution explicitly prohibits presidents from getting elected to more than two terms.

Security guards are armed at Israeli schools, not teachers
","As communities across the country grapple with school shootings, a widely-shared Facebook post suggests the United States should use Israel as a role model.  ""School shooting Israel 1974,"" the Aug. 13 post says. ""They began training teachers with guns. There have been only two school shootings in 44 years, and both shooters were killed by teachers. Have we learned anything yet, America?"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post is both wrong about arming teachers, and wrong about how shooters were killed. Let’s break down the Facebook post’s claims.  In 1974, more than 20 students were killed when Palestinian guerillas held students hostage in a school in Ma’alot, Israel. The Palestinians were killed ""in a bloody gun battle"" after Israeli soldiers raided the school building.  But, as the Associated Press reported in 2012, Israel didn’t mandate armed guards at the entrances to all schools until 1995, more than two decades after the Ma’alot attack and two years after a Palestinian militant injured students and a principal in a knifing attack at a school. That same article, which challenges a statement by NRA chief Wayne LaPierre that’s similar to the one in this Facebook post, notes that, in 2012, Israeli authorities could only recall two school shootings in the past four decades.  In 2008, eight people, most of them teens, were killed when a Palestinian assailant attacked them at a nighttime study session at a Jewish religious seminary in Jerusalem. But that assailant was killed by an off-duty soldier who happened to be in the area, according to the AP — not a teacher.  Searching this list kept by the Israel Ministory of Foreign Affairs of ""Palestinian terror and incitement"" since September 2000, another shooting happened in 2002 when three yeshiva high school students were killed at their Orthodox school by a Palestinian gunman before he was shot dead by a security guard — not a teacher.  That’s because, by policy, teachers are not armed in Israeli schools, the Washington Post reported in February 2018.  ""Professionals deal with security,"" the Post quotes Amos Shavit, a spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Education, as saying. ""Not the teachers.""  The newspaper notes that while school shootings are virtually unheard of in Israeli schools, that’s in large part because of the country’s efforts to combat terrorism, not the school shooters the United States has become familiar with.  Shavit said the guards stationed at schools are under the authority of police, according to the Post, and in large cities law enforcement carry out security patrols around educational institutions during the school day.  Israeli security experts also say gun violence is rare there because privately held guns are so rare, the Post story says. It quotes Simon Perry, a criminologist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, saying there is little opportunity for someone to carry out a gun attack inside a school. Though most people in Israel go into the military and receive some weapons training, he said, ""it is very, very hard to obtain a weapon in Israel.""
