This viral photo of ice melting in a cup misrepresents icebergs and sea level rise
","Widespread, historic melting across Greenland’s ice sheet this summer has caused alarm. The Washington Post reported that Greenland has lost more than 250 billion tons of ice — enough to fill more than 90 million Olympic-size swimming pools.   On July 31, the Post reported that the recent heat wave caused ""one of the biggest melt events ever observed on the fragile ice sheet.""  But an image posted to Facebook that same day casts doubt on how icebergs affect sea level rise.  The post, which had been shared more than 4,700 times by Aug. 9, shows two photos. The first photo is of a measuring cup filled with water and ice. An arrow pointing to the ice says ""ice berg"" and an arrow pointing to the water says ""ocean."" The second photo is similar except there is no ice. An arrow pointing to where the ice was says ""ice berg melts,"" an arrow pointing to the water says ""ocean"" and a third arrow pointing to the line on the measuring cup where the water stops. It’s the same line as in the first photo and the arrow says ""ocean level remains the same."" ""A little science lesson for the #IDIOTS at the global warming conference,"" the post’s author wrote. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That’s because the image misrepresents how icebergs affect sea level rise.  An iceberg is a chunk of ice that broke off from a glacier, ice shelf, or a larger iceberg. They float in the ocean (or lake) and unlike sea ice that freezes and melts in the ocean, icebergs are composed of freshwater because they formed on land.  When an iceberg melts, it doesn’t raise sea levels, said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the National Snow & Ice Data Center. But, he said, that’s because the iceberg already raised sea levels when it moved from the land into the ocean.  A better illustration of how icebergs affect sea level, said William Colgan a senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, would be to suspend an ice cube on popsicle sticks above the water. When it drops into the water or melts into the water, the water level will rise.  ""Here they’re starting with icebergs in the water,"" Colgan said. ""But the moment the iceberg crosses land into water, it’s raising sea level.""  And if you were to then warm the water in the cup and measure it closely enough, Colgan said, the water level would rise. That’s because warm water expands; according to NASA, ""sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms.""  Colgan likened the Facebook post to the same evidence offered by people who think the world is flat. The experiments are conducted in such a way that they support their assumptions while discounting information that contradicts them, he said.  Our ruling The Facebook post claims to show what happens when icebergs melt in water but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Melting ice in water — like the ice featured in the Facebook post — doesn’t cause water levels to rise. That’s because icebergs form on land and then displace water when they break off into the ocean, causing sea levels to rise.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C239200>],/factchecks/2019/aug/12/viral-image/viral-photo-ice-melting-cup-misrepresents-icebergs/

Epstein not dead? Conspiracy theories abound
","Questions swirl around the circumstances of financier Jeffrey Epstein’s death. The New York City chief medical examiner has yet to release a final ruling on how the 66-year-old died. U.S. Attorney General William Barr said he is ""appalled"" by the ""failure to adequately secure"" Epstein. But in the eyes of some on Facebook, Epstein is still very much alive.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Whether Epstein was on a suicide watch is a major point of controversy. But regarding whether he still lives, there are a number of people in official positions who have confirmed that Epstein is dead. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons announced his death. The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner issued a statement Aug. 11, saying, ""Today, a medical examiner performed the autopsy of Jeffrey Epstein."" Needless to say, autopsies are only performed on the dead. U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Aug. 10, ""I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody. "" One of Epstein’s lawyers Marc Fernich blamed prosecutors, the press and the Manhattan Correctional Center, where Epstein was held. ""Jailers who appear to have recklessly put Mr. Epstein in harm’s way, heedlessly placing his life at risk and failing to protect him,"" Fernich said Aug. 10. Federal prosecutors have said their investigation of those suspected of assisting Epstein will continue despite his death. Those details notwithstanding, the conspiracy theorists are undaunted. Investigators are looking at many aspects of Epstein’s death, especially how closely he was monitored. Barr said Aug. 12, ""We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation."" Whatever the investigation finds, it would not change the fact that Epstein is dead.  Bloggers and Facebookers are saying that Epstein is still alive. U.S. corrections officials announced his death. The New York City medical examiner performed an autopsy. The U.S. Attorney General, federal prosecutors and an Epstein lawyer have said he is dead. To think otherwise requires that scores of officials with direct observation of Epstein’s death are either fooled or complicit.

Did counties hosting a Trump rally in 2016 see a 226% spike in hate crimes?
","  At a time of increasing tension over President Donald Trump’s rhetoric on undocumented immigrants and people of color, several Democrats have charged that Trump’s language is encouraging hate crimes. To make their case, Democrats cite a startling statistic. ""In 2016, counties hosting a Trump rally saw a 226% spike in hate crimes,"" reads a post on Facebook from the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders.    A tweet from Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., makes the same claim. Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally saw a 226% increase in hate crimes.Assaults increase when cities host Trump rallies.Your rhetoric is directly and indirectly inciting hate, Mr. President. https://t.co/axJDI3uOJU   A reader saw the Sanders post on social media and sent it to us, asking whether it was accurate.  We found that the statistic comes from an academic paper. But the Sanders post makes the increase seem dramatic and causal. The findings are actually much more nuanced.   The post cites the Washington Post as its source, and we tracked that down to a post on one of the newspaper’s blogs, the Monkey Cage.  On March 22, the blog published a post titled, ""Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally saw a 226% increase in hate crimes."" The post summarized a paper written by three academics: Ayal Feinberg, an assistant professor of political science at Texas A&M University-Commerce; Regina Branton, a professor of political science at the University of North Texas; and Valerie Martinez-Ebers, a professor of political science at the University of North Texas. (Sanders’ campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) The authors told PolitiFact that the paper is currently under peer review for publication in an academic publication. The authors presented it in 2019 at meetings of both the Southern Political Science Association and the Western Political Science Association. Here’s how the authors summarized their work in the Post: Using the Anti-Defamation League’s Hate, Extremism, Anti-Semitism, Terrorism map data (HEAT map), we examined whether there was a correlation between the counties that hosted one of Trump’s 275 presidential campaign rallies in 2016 and increased incidents of hate crimes in subsequent months. To test this, we aggregated hate-crime incident data and Trump rally data to the county level and then used statistical tools to estimate a rally’s impact. We included controls for factors such as the county’s crime rates, its number of active hate groups, its minority populations, its percentage with college educations, its location in the country and the month when the rallies occurred. We found that counties that had hosted a 2016 Trump campaign rally saw a 226% increase in reported hate crimes over comparable counties that did not host such a rally. In their posts, Sanders (and Omar) referenced the headline in the Monkey Cage blog post almost verbatim. But there’s a discrepancy between the headline’s phrasing and what the researchers’ academic paper looked at. The phrasing used by Sanders implies that hate crimes spiked in one jurisdiction, jumping from one level before the rally to a rate three times higher afterward. That’s not the case. As the study summary says, the 226% difference compares Trump-rally counties to non-Trump rally counties with similar demographics. So a more accurate phrasing might be: ""Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally had 226% more hate crimes than counties that did not."" There are other nuances that aren’t captured by the statistic Sanders posted, experts told PolitiFact. In an interview, Feinberg, one of the coauthors of the study cited in the Post article, noted a few general challenges facing the field of hate-crime studies. First, he said, there are limitations in ""how extremist incidents, events motivated by hate, and hate crimes lack a cohesive definition"" under the law. What constitutes a hate crime in one state may not in another. Also, some of the data is self-reported, making it hard to tell how many hate crimes in a given jurisdiction are unreported. In addition, Feinberg said, ""not all police departments investigate hate crimes or perceive incidents motivated by prejudice"" with the same degree of aggressiveness.  Feinberg said that these caveats are always top of mind for hate-crimes researchers.  He added that a 2018 research project he collaborated on did not find that the inclusion of far-right parties in governing coalitions in Europe had an effect on reported anti-Semitic incidents. So when starting work on the Trump paper, he came in to the research with an open mind.  Before undertaking the study, he said, ""I was not sure that Trump rhetoric would have any impact on reported extremist events, hate incidents, anti-Semitism, or hate crimes."" Meanwhile, Brian Levin, Kevin Grisham, and John Reitzel, three of the contributors to a California State University-San Bernardino study of hate crime trends in recent years, told PolitiFact that it’s hard to know whether other factors could have played a role in boosting hate crimes in the counties with a Trump rally. ""It is hard to untangle all these relationships without some interviews and in-depth qualitative data,"" Grisham said. ""I think the data is fascinating and may be the first step in a larger and more in-depth project. But, we cannot say with absolute certainty that hate follows the rallies."" For instance, Grisham said, it could be that the rallies may be a contributing cause rather than a dominant one. ""Anyone using that data should be aware of the complexity of extremist actions and their connections to rhetoric. Like anything with human beings, nothing is black and white."" Another potential problem: A 226% difference sounds massive, but in many locales, that may mean only a small numerical difference, especially the types of low-population counties that tended to host Trump rallies. The difference between one hate crime and three is 200%, but with numbers like that, a small difference in the reporting of crimes or police investigations could cloud the question of whether Trump’s rallies had an effect. There is ""statistical noise"" when raw numbers are small, Reitzel said. Focusing on percentage changes, ""even where the numbers are true, can still distort interpretation,"" he said. Overall, the study is ""certainly interesting and suggestive,"" Levin said. ""But I would have preferred to see a comparison that’s apples to apples."" Sanders’ post said, ""In 2016, counties hosting a Trump rally saw a 226% spike in hate crimes."" This is from an academic study. However, it’s worth noting some caveats -- that the data can be subject to ""statistical noise"" and jurisdictional differences in hate crime definitions and police aggressiveness, and that cause and effect are hard to pinpoint. Perhaps most important is that Sanders’ wording implies that the 226% jump stems from comparing hate crimes before and after a Trump rally within the same county, when in fact it’s a comparison from Trump rally counties to similar counties that did not host a Trump rally. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F94500>],/factchecks/2019/aug/12/bernie-sanders/did-counties-hosting-trump-rally-2016-see-226-spik/

No, Biden did not ‘leak’ the names of SEAL Team 6 members to al-Qaida
","Osama bin Laden, infamous al-Qaida leader and 9/11 organizer, died in May 2011 after a military operation was carried out by an elite unit of U.S. Navy SEALs.  But did then-Vice President Joe Biden really reveal the names of the members and families of the SEAL team to al-Qaida? That’s what a viral Facebook post circulating online claims. It reads in full: ""Never forget it was Biden who leaked the names of SEAL Team 6 family’s (sic) to Al Qaeda and cannot be trusted!""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is not accurate. There is no evidence to suggest that Biden disclosed the names of the SEALs or their family members to the terrorist organization. The claim appears to have originated shortly after Biden announced his 2020 bid for president in late April 2019. It appears to be rooted in a May 3 address he gave about the military operation that led to bin Laden’s death. The operation played out in the early hours of May 2, 2011, at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.  Nine hours behind in Washington D.C., it was still May 1. President Obama confirmed that bin Laden had been killed in a televised address to the country that evening and said no Americans were harmed in the raid. In the address, Obama said ""a small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability,"" but didn’t mention the Navy SEALs. Shortly after Obama’s announcement, multiple media outlets identified the involvement of the SEALs in the operation, but not by naming the individuals who were a part of that team. It was after that, on May 3, that Biden gave a speech at an event for the Atlantic Council and praised the SEALs for the operation. He did not, however, say the specific unit or call out any members by name.  ""Let me briefly acknowledge tonight’s distinguished honorees,"" Biden said before praising U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis: ""Admiral Jim Stavridis is the real deal; he could tell you more about and understands the incredible, the phenomenal, the just almost unbelievable capacity of his Navy SEALs and what they did last Sunday.""  He later continued, ""Folks, I’d be remiss also if I didn’t say an extra word about the incredible events, extraordinary events this past Sunday. As vice president of the United States, as an American, I was in absolute awe – awe – of the capacity and dedication of the entire team, both the intelligence community, the CIA, the SEALs; it just was extraordinary."" Biden’s remarks were later criticized, as was the entire administration for openly crediting the SEALs, after a helicopter carrying 30 American military members, including some from Team 6, were killed on August 6, 2011, when the aircraft was shot down by the Taliban in Afghanistan. But an investigation into the attack did not find evidence that the helicopter was targeted as part of a pre-calculated ambush.  ""We do not believe the mission was compromised,"" Garry Reid, principal deputy assistance secretary for special operations and low-intensity conflict, told Congress in 2014. ""There was no external coordination so there’s no possibility of information going up the chain and somehow going out to the Taliban."" A Facebook post claims that Joe Biden leaked the names of elite SEAL Team 6 members to al-Qaida. There is no evidence to suggest that Biden disclosed information to the terrorist organization. Though he made remarks praising the Navy SEALs as a group in an address two days after the raid that killed bin Laden, Biden’s speech came after it was already public knowledge that the group and the CIA were part of the operation.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A6CA40>],/factchecks/2019/aug/12/facebook-posts/no-biden-did-not-leak-names-seal-team-6-members-al/

No, an El Paso Fox News affiliate didn’t report on a shooting before it happened
","In the wake of mass shootings at a Walmart in El Paso and outside a bar in Dayton, Ohio, conspiracy theories are wrongly claiming that they were ""false flag"" operations. An Aug. 5 Facebook post even promises proof but the evidence on offer falls apart pretty quickly.  ""BOOM,"" the post begins. ""FOX REPORTER REPORTS NEXT SHOOTING 23 MINUTES BEFORE IT HAPPENED."" A long missive follows, but the gist is this: A video clip linked in the post ""proves the deep state is doing the shootings"" because a Fox News affiliate in El Paso announced another shooting that was supposed to happen at another WalMart before it happened. The post describes the actions of one of the TV station’s anchors and then launches into a massive conspiracy theory: ""She checks her Twitter and re-checks it, looks a little confused, and then says ‘that hasent (sic) happened yet. … Folks, this proves Twitter is in on the shootings, Fox News is in on the shootings, Wal Mart (sic) is in on the shootings ... NO WAY FOX HAD THE REPORT AHEAD OF TIME WITHOUT BEING DIRECTLY INVOLVED, BUSTED BUSTED BUSTED.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  What actually happened in that news anchors were reading tweets from different time zones and were momentarily confused.  Here's how it unfolded: On Aug. 3, at about 12:26 p.m. Mountain Daylight Time — El Paso’s time zone — KFOX news anchors interrupted programming to report on an active shooting at a Walmart near Cielo Vista Mall in El Paso. This is the shooting that led to the deaths of at least 22 people. Later that day, around 2:35 p.m. Mountain Daylight Time, Erika Castillo, one of the station’s anchors, said that ""an incident, as it was told to us, happened in the Walmart in Horizon (City)"" in El Paso County.  ""I’m not sure what time this tweet went out, however,"" she said, looking down at something on the desk before her. ""Okay, here it is, at 3 p.m. Well that’s, that hasn’t happened yet, so okay today is the 3rd—"" Another anchor interrupts her and says, ""This is 35 minutes ago."" The video that was posted on Facebook cuts off around then, but the full video shows that Castillo continued: ""So this just came out. Horizon Police Department said they just responded to a subject with a gun call at the Walmart in Horizon, and they were able to locate the individual and found he was open carrying and checked out okay and then the door was reopened."" We reached out to KFOX about the Facebook post but didn’t hear back. However, Castillo wasn’t describing a shooting that hadn’t happened yet. At 2 p.m. in both Horizon City and El Paso’s time zone of Mountain Daylight Time, the Horizon City Police Department tweeted: ""About an hour ago, HCPD responded to a subject with a gun call at our local Wal-Mart. The HCPD were able to locate the individual with and found he was open carrying and checked okay. The store has since reopened.""  If someone read the police department’s tweet from a city in a different time zone — say, Austin, Texas, which is on Central Time — the tweet’s timestamp would read as ""3 p.m."" That’s because the Twitter timestamp changes according to the time zone of the person viewing the tweet on Twitter.  Castillo explained in response to the video that the information she was reading from was a screen shot of a tweet that was made in a different time zone. ""I was looking at and trying to decipher an image grab of a tweet that had been made in east coast time,"" she said. ""El Paso is the only major city in Texas that sits on Mountain time.

Cuomo's claim on property taxes omits mandates
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s push for a property tax cap in 2011 and his successful efforts to make it permanent have pleased fiscal watchdogs. At least one study shows that it has saved property taxpayers more than $25 billion.  But we were skeptical about his recent claim that the state has ""nothing to do"" with property taxes. Cuomo made the remarks during an interview with a Long Island radio station.  ""Property taxes are the killer tax in the state of New York,"" Cuomo told host Jay Oliver on 103.9 FM. Cuomo said it’s been a problem since Franklin D. Roosevelt was governor, which was from 1929 to 1932. ""It has nothing to do with the state. I may be a little defensive for a second because it's early and I'm a little defensive. FDR used to rail about the property tax. Because people think the state has something to do with the property tax and they used to complain about high taxes and FDR got very defensive and he said, 'I've got nothing to do with the property taxes, it's all local taxes and school taxes,' which is true. So I don’t control the property tax."" Cuomo has invoked Roosevelt’s thoughts on property taxes during several speeches, and on this topic, the two governors sound a similar note. In his 1932 annual message to the state legislature, Roosevelt talked about complaints from the public about property taxes: ""After three long years during which I have tried in every part of the State to make people understand that real estate taxes have absolutely nothing to do with State Government, the public is at last coming to realize that the increase in real estate taxes is due wholly to the increase in the cost of local and not State Government.""  Property taxes are collected by local governments and school districts as a way to pay for local programs, and local officials have control over big budget items such as contracts that set employee salaries. But that’s not all property taxes fund. Federal and state governments also mandate some programs, meaning they require school districts and counties to do certain things, but in some cases do not provide the financial support for these programs to be carried out.  A 2017 Cornell University survey of local governments, done in partnership with local government advocacy groups, found that the primary sources of fiscal stress for these governments came from state influence on their finances and service delivery. According to the Cornell survey, ""the top three contributors to fiscal stress that local governments identified were stagnant state aid, state mandates, and the property tax cap."" Cornell researchers cited another study, which found that New York state ""decentralizes more expenditure and service responsibility onto local governments than any other state, except Nevada.""  These underfunded or unfunded mandates, as they are known, are a topic of such concern for local governments and school districts that every year, local officials lobby the governor and state lawmakers for relief.  Medicaid is perhaps the most talked-about underfunded mandate in New York state. Though the state manages the Medicaid program, it shifts part of the cost of the program onto counties. The New York Association of Counties, which advocates on behalf of counties, calculates that in New York, counties spend more on state Medicaid costs than other counties across the country combined, not including voluntary payments counties make to support their public hospitals and nursing homes.  In 2015, the state capped the local Medicaid share, saving local governments more than $3 billion per year. ""Even with the freeze, Medicaid remains one of the largest expenses faced by local governments in New York—and one they have little or no means to control,"" wrote Bill Hammond, director of health policy at the Empire Center for Public Policy, which is fiscally conservative.  ""New York’s local share is still an aberration nationally;"" the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission wrote in 2018. ""New York requires more local contributions to finance Medicaid services than all other states in the nation combined."" In addition to Medicaid, counties must share the cost of programs such as child welfare, indigent criminal defense, probation and preschool special education. In January, the New York Association of Counties estimated that up to 80 percent of a county’s total budget can be used to pay for state and federal mandates.   When we approached Cuomo’s press office about the governor’s claim, staff there connected us with Jim Malatras, a former director of state operations in the Cuomo administration who is now the president of Empire State College, part of the State University of New York. Malatras worked on the property tax cap as a member of the administration and studied the effects of the cap as president of the Rockefeller Institute of Government.  The governor ""does not, by law, get to set what the property tax is,"" Malatras said.   Cuomo has helped property taxpayers by being ""very aggressive"" in managing local costs, Malatras said. He pointed to the establishment of a less generous pension tier, capping of the local share of Medicaid, and the property tax cap. The STAR program, which began under a previous governor, provides state funds to offset local school taxes. He also said that local governments and school districts have other sources of revenue in addition to property taxes.  ""The state doesn’t have anything to do with property tax levies,"" Malatras said. Local governments engage in many activities that they have complete control over, such as economic development programs, and the wages they pay their employees, he said. Some mandates that local governments complain about are in the state constitution, or were established by the U.S. Supreme Court. Local government officials also complain about labor rules, but the state has to follow those rules too, Malatras said. As for complaints that the cap limits governments’ flexibility, as noted in the Cornell study, Malatras said that with enough support from governing bodies or voters, local governments and school districts can override the cap.  In the past, the Cuomo administration has acknowledged the financial burden the state places on local governments and has taken steps to address it. Earlier this year, Cuomo took credit for reducing property taxes.   Cuomo started a Mandate Relief Council, and in January 2012, Cuomo’s office announced the council’s first meeting, and described why it was necessary: ""The State depends on its local governments and school districts to deliver essential services to its residents and often prescribes how these services should be provided. These requirements are woven throughout State laws and regulations limiting flexibility and increasing costs. The Council was created to find, review, and reform these mandates.""  According to the ""local government"" section of Cuomo’s 2020 executive budget briefing book, the budget ""continues Governor Cuomo’s commitment and track record of reducing property taxes."" Cuomo said the state has ""nothing to do"" with property taxes. It is true that local governments and school districts set property tax rates and collect property taxes. But when local officials set the amount that must be raised from property taxes, they must collect enough money to cover the cost of programs the state and federal governments have said they must provide, even in cases, like Medicaid, when they do not have control over the program’s administration. Local governments have other ways to raise revenue, but the property tax is one of their primary sources.  We rate Cuomo’s statement Half True.   ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A48F740>],/factchecks/2019/aug/10/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-claim-property-taxes-omits-mandates/

""The Trump administration cut funding allocated to the Department of Homeland Security to combat white nationalism,"" South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg wrote Aug. 5 in a Medium post. ""We must do more than simply reinstate that funding — we must dedicate $1 billion to ensure that law enforcement across all agencies and all levels have sufficient resources to counter the growing tide of white nationalist violence."" Buttigieg was referring to an Obama era grant program called Countering Violent Extremism. One group founded by former white supremacists and neo-Nazis, Life After Hate, was slated to receive money under the grant but the offer was rescinded under Trump, Buttigieg said.  But there is more to the broader story than what Buttigieg described. ""The picture is more nuanced than, ‘The Obama administration was going after white supremacists and the Trump administration stopped it,’"" Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program, previously told PolitiFact. ""Neither went after white supremacists."" We previously rated a similar claim by Sen. Cory Booker Mostly False. Buttigieg’s wording isn’t as problematic as was Booker's, which referenced the wrong department and used stronger language, but it is still imprecise. The Countering Violent Extremism program was launched during the Obama administration to work with local leaders to deter U.S. residents from joining violent extremist groups. In the final days of Obama’s tenure, the Homeland Security department announced 31 groups would be awarded a total of $10 million in grants.  Once Trump took office, his administration froze the grants. Then, in June 2017, Homeland Security released a list of 26 grant recipients. Some of the awardees named under Obama had dropped out, citing fears of anti-Muslim bias under Trump.  But Buttigieg’s campaign zeroed in on one group whose $400,000 grant was rescinded: Life After Hate. (Read about another rescinded grant to the University of North Carolina that we covered in a different fact-check. UNC’s application said it would target extremist messaging including by jihadists but it also mentioned that it had expertise in white supremacists.) In its application, Life After Hate didn’t single out white nationalists — though the group works to help people who want to leave racism or violent extremism behind.  The application stated the group would work with others to engage online with ""supporters and sympathizers of far-right extremism and jihadism."" Far-right extremism isn’t the same as white nationalism, although some people use the terms interchangeably. ""We used the term ‘violent far-right extremism,’ which would include the more euphemistic ‘white nationalism,’"" Life After Hate’s spokesman told us. Here’s what we know about why their application was rescinded under Trump. Homeland Security spokespersons said applicants were rejected because they didn’t meet new criteria like working with law enforcement — not because of their interest in combating white supremacy.  Trump faced criticism that the grant program was too focused on Muslims. (Nearly all of the accepted projects were centered around working with Muslims or immigrants.) But the Obama administration faced the same critique, including from the liberal Brennan Center. Buttigieg said the Trump administration ""cut"" funding for Countering Violent Extremism, but there’s more to that, too. It was a two-year grant program that expired in July 2019. The administration did not seek to renew it. Brian Jackson, a researcher at the RAND Corporation who co-wrote a 2019 report for Homeland Security on terrorism prevention, said reupping the grant program would require action by both the administration and Congress. In a House committee hearing on white supremacy in June, a homeland security assistant secretary seemed to leave open the door to potential future funding.  ""We are evaluating and assessing future requests for funding associated with that,"" said the DHS official, Elizabeth Neumann, about Countering Violent Extremism grants. The Buttigieg campaign cited articles about reductions in staff and funding in the office that housed Countering Violent Extremism compared to the Obama administration. The program was located within the Office of Community Partnerships in the Obama administration. That office is now the Office of Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention, which aims to address all forms of domestic and international terrorism.  George Selim, the former director of the Office for Community Partnerships, has said his office once had a budget of $21 million and 16 staff. Selim, who now works for the Anti-Defamation League, said the office has since been cut to a nearly $3 million budget based off a DHS 2020 budget justification document. Congress has not yet finished appropriations bills for 2020, so we don’t yet know what the office’s budget will be. Finally, the Buttigieg campaign also pointed to an April article in the Daily Beast that reported that the department disbanded a group of intelligence analysts who were focused on domestic terrorism. A DHS official told the Daily Beast that the same people were working on the same issues as part of a restructuring. The Trump administration defended its strategy on terrorism, as released in October 2018. It states that the country faces threats from domestic terrorists motivated by various ideologies including ""racially motivated extremism.""  Buttigieg said, ""The Trump Administration cut funding allocated to the Department of Homeland Security to combat white nationalism."" He points to the $10 million Countering Violent Extremism grant program, which was launched under Obama and not renewed under President Trump. It was meant to last for two years. When it expired in July 2019, Trump did not renew it. That’s not exactly the same as a ""cut."" However, a group that was slated to get a grant under Obama, Life After Hate, had its grant rescinded under the Trump administration while the program was going on. The group was one of the only ones with expertise on white nationalism. Overall, most of the grant proposals were focused on Muslims or immigrants, and not white nationalists.  Buttigieg left out part of the story.  We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D8BB80>],/factchecks/2019/aug/09/pete-buttigieg/fact-checking-whether-trump-cut-money-combat-white/

Fact-checking Bernie Sanders’ abortion position
","An old Facebook post about abortion gained new traction as Sen. Bernie Sanders took the debate stage last month.  ""So Bernie and Hillary want to make the cut off date for abortions up to 36 weeks,"" the 2016 post says. ""That’s right! They say a baby at that point feels no pain and has no rights to life. If anyone was wondering what a baby looks like at 36 weeks, here’s a picture of my baby boy born at 36 weeks. Share this post, get the word out!"" This post, which has been shared more than 20,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We’re going to focus on Sanders for this check since he is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, not former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. But Snopes looked into this claim in 2016 when Clinton was running for president and determined it was false for both Democrats.  As it is still being shared three years later in virtually identical language, we went looking for evidence to substantiate the claim, but we found none. We emailed Sanders’ campaign to ask about the Facebook post but did not hear back.  Sanders doesn’t mention abortion limits on his campaign website. Listed among his ""issues"" is the ""fight for women’s rights,"" and there he makes two points about abortion:  ""Fully fund Planned Parenthood, Title X, and other initiatives that protect women’s health, access to contraception, and the availability of a safe and legal abortion.""  ""Oppose all efforts to undermine or overturn Roe v. Wade, and appoint federal judges who will uphold women’s most fundamental rights."" He echoed the latter position during the first Democratic presidential debate in June. As a senator, he has framed abortion as health care. And he’s supported abortions since before the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe vs. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide. In 1972, the Bennington Banner newspaper reported that Sanders, then the Vermont candidate for governor, said the abortion issue should only be of concern between a woman and her doctor, not the government. More recently, he has criticized states that have restricted abortion but, BuzzFeed reported in May, he ""did not delve into more specifics about what he would do to fight the laws if elected."" ""The consequences will be absolutely disastrous and threaten the very lives of women,"" BuzzFeed quoted him as saying on the campaign trail. ""It is not an exaggeration to say that banning legal, medically assisted abortion — and forcing women back into the arms of quacks — will quite literally kill women.""    In 2018, Sanders voted against a bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks and in 2016, PBS NewsHour reported in February, he wouldn’t give a specific answer when asked whether he would place any limits on abortions but ""repeatedly said he was ‘very strongly pro-choice’ and believed the decision was between a woman and her doctor.""  It came up that year when, during a Fox News town hall as Sanders and Clinton vied for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bret Baier asked Sanders if he could ""name a single circumstance at any point in a pregnancy in which you would be okay with abortion being illegal."" ""It’s not a question of me being okay,"" Sanders said. ""I happen to believe that it is wrong for the government to be telling a woman what to do with her own body."" Baier said: ""I guess the genesis of the question is that there are some Democrats who say after five months, with the exception of the life of the mother or the health of the baby, that perhaps that’s something to look at. You’re saying no."" Sanders said: ""I am very strongly pro-choice. That is a decision to be made by the woman, her physician, and her family. That’s my view."" Now, Sanders among other Democratic presidential candidates have cosponsored a bill that would codify Roe vs. Wade. New York did this in January when it enacted the Reproductive Health Act, a law that permits abortions within 24 weeks or later if the fetus isn’t viable or the mother’s health or life are threatened.   ""As president, he would use every available executive, judicial, and legislative tool to (protect the constitutional rights of women),"" a campaign spokesman for Sanders told BuzzFeed in a statement in May, ""including by appointing federal judges who will protect Roe, by fighting unconstitutional bans and restrictions, and by building a movement that speaks out for the vast majority of Americans who believe Roe should remain law of the land."" When asked during a Fox News town hall in April whether a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy up to the moment of birth, he said he thinks that happens ""very rarely"" and struck a familiar note: ""the decision over abortion belongs to a woman and her physician.""  Searching for ""Bernie Sanders"" and ""36 weeks"" and ""abortion"" in the Nexis news archive, we found one result: a May 2019 story in the Toronto Star about Rich Coleman, a member of Canada’s legislative assembly. The article discusses Coleman’s comments on abortion at a March for Life rally.  ""It wasn’t Coleman’s first March for Life rally nor his first public foray into women’s reproductive health,"" the story says. ""On his Facebook account last August, Coleman shared a post — viewed by the Star Vancouver before he deleted it several days later — falsely alleging that former U.S. Democrat leadership candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders wanted to allow abortions up to 36 weeks (8.5 months) of pregnancy because they believe fetuses have ‘no rights to life.’ On Aug. 31, he removed it admitting it was an ‘anti-abortion fake news story.’"" Our ruling The Facebook post said Bernie Sanders wants ""to make the cut off date for abortions up to 36 weeks"" because he says ""a baby at that point feels no pain and has no rights to life.""   The record shows that while Sanders has refused to support specific abortion restrictions, he has not called to extend the cut off date for abortions to 36 weeks because ""a baby at that point feels no pain and has no rights to life.""  For nearly five decades, when asked about specific abortion policy, Sanders has repeatedly stated in response that the decision to abort should be between a woman and her doctor, not the government.  We rate this Facebook post as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097194600>],/factchecks/2019/aug/09/viral-image/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-abortion-position/

Donald Trump says Democrats distorted his visit at Dayton hospital. Here's what they actually said
","When guns and politics meet, nothing escapes scrutiny.  After President Donald Trump went to the Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton to visit shooting survivors, hospital staff and first responders, Trump tweeted his dismay over Democrats ""misrepresenting"" his time there. ""Just left Dayton, Ohio, where I met with the Victims & families, Law Enforcement, Medical Staff & First Responders. It was a warm & wonderful visit. Tremendous enthusiasm & even Love. Then I saw failed Presidential Candidate (0%) Sherrod Brown & Mayor Whaley totally misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital. Their news conference after I left for El Paso was a fraud. It bore no resemblance to what took place with those incredible people that I was so lucky to meet and spend time with."" Just left Dayton, Ohio, where I met with the Victims & families, Law Enforcement, Medical Staff & First Responders. It was a warm & wonderful visit. Tremendous enthusiasm & even Love. Then I saw failed Presidential Candidate (0%) Sherrod Brown & Mayor Whaley totally..... Trump was referring to a news conference by U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley. Did they misrepresent what happened? For this fact-check, we go to the tape. Trump went straight from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to the hospital where he spent about two hours. No media was allowed. The White House provided video and photos. They show many smiles and handshakes as Trump met with people. We love you Dayton, Ohio! pic.twitter.com/IaCZAdyuzL Afterward, the hospital’s CEO told reporters the visit was meaningful and at times emotional. Controversy preceded Trump’s visit. At a vigil after the shooting that killed nine people, Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine was shouted down by the crowd. The day before Trump came to Dayton, Mayor Whaley told reporters she was disappointed in Trump’s response to the shooting and wouldn’t discourage protestors who objected to his visit. Whaley and Brown greeted Trump at the Air Force base and accompanied him at the hospital. After he left, they took questions at Dayton City Hall. They spent the bulk of their time talking about gun policy. They said they asked Trump to support universal background checks, fund Medicaid mental health services and ban assault weapons. Brown downplayed the value of Trump giving awards to the police who stopped the killer. Brown suggested what he cast as a more substantive step. ""The most important thing you can do for these police officers is take these assault weapons off the streets so they don't have to go up against those assault weapons, and they need to take down a shooter,"" Brown said. Brown criticized Trump for using rhetoric that he said divides Americans and invites racial discord. And both of them said they expected little action to come from Trump to regulate firearms. Brown and Whaley said very little about Trump’s time with patients and others. By our count, they spoke about 1,800 words in the 14 minutes they spent with reporters. Out of that, they offered about 60 words describing the time Trump spent with citizens. Those words did not run afoul of Trump’s version of events. ""I think the victims and the first responders were grateful that the president of the United States came today,"" Whaley said. ""He was received as well as you can expect by the patients,"" Brown said. ""They are hurting. He was comforting, he and Melania did the right things. It's his job, in part, to comfort people. I'm glad he did it."" Viewers of the video can judge the tone of their remarks. Immediately after the news conference, the Associated Press reported, ""Ohio Democratic officials say they were gratified by President Donald Trump’s visit to the Dayton, the scene of a weekend mass shooting, and said Trump was treated respectfully, despite the fact some didn’t agree with his past rhetoric or policies."" The White House declined to comment. Trump said the remarks from Democrats Brown and Whaley misrepresented his visit with survivors, medical staff and first responders of the shooting in Dayton. He called their presentation ""a fraud."" Brown and Whaley said very little about Trump’s meeting, but what they said leaned toward the positive. Brown called Trump ""comforting,"" and said he was glad Trump had come. Whaley said people were grateful that the president had visited. That might amount only to measured praise of Trump’s time at the hospital, but it doesn’t come close to being a fraud or misrepresenting the mood.

"['Immigration', 'PunditFact', 'Nicolle Wallace']","
Donald Trump didn't talk about exterminating Latinos
","Several Democratic presidential candidates have declared a link between President Donald Trump’s rhetoric on immigrants and the recent mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. But while Trump has spoken often of an ""invasion"" at the border, he has not been ""talking about exterminating Latinos,"" as MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace falsely claimed Aug. 5. Wallace was responding to a remark from guest and columnist Raul Reyes, who said Trump’s use of the words ""invasion"" and ""infestation"" could make some people wish for an extermination. ""With an infestation, the natural conclusion is to attempt an extermination,"" Reyes said. As a point of comparison, Wallace noted how President George W. Bush (for whom she served as communications director) catered to Latino voters and President Barack Obama tried to take on immigration reform with input from Latino leaders.  ""You now have a president, as you said, talking about exterminating Latinos,"" she continued. The next day, Wallace apologized for the remark on Twitter, saying she ""misspoke."" (MSNBC declined to comment.)   I misspoke about Trump calling for an extermination of Latinos. My mistake was unintentional and I’m sorry. Trump’s constant assault on people of color and his use of the word “invasion” to describe the flow of immigrants is intentional and constant. But Sarah Matthews, deputy press secretary for the Trump campaign, told us ""many more will hear what she said on air than her apology."" Here’s the bottom line: Trump has frequently charged immigrants with invading the United States, but he’s never spoken of ""exterminating Latinos."" Trump has never used any version of the word ""exterminate"" to describe Latinos, Hispanics or immigrants in or en route to the United States.  We checked Google and Nexis and found no examples. A search of the president’s Twitter account also turned up no results.  We also looked at the interactive transcript website Factba.se, which tracks Trump’s public statements and tweets. According to Factba.se’s database, Trump has only ever mentioned extermination in reference to the Holocaust or ISIS’s attacks on Christians or Americans. While Trump hasn’t called for ""exterminating Latinos,"" he has made frequent use of the words ""invasion"" and ""infestation"" to decry the flow of immigrants across the southern border.  A CNN montage shows several times dating back to November when Trump has referred to an invasion at the border in public statements. During a May rally in Panama City, Fla., Trump lamented, ""How do you stop these people? You can’t."" When a rallygoer shouted, ""Shoot them,"" Trump pointed to the crowd, shook his head, chuckled and said, ""That’s only in the Panhandle can you get away with that statement.""  Trump has also used the word ""invade"" or a variant of it in at least 10 tweets since the launch of his 2016 presidential campaign. Plus, his campaign has posted more than 2,000 ads on Facebook since January that include the word ""invasion,"" according to the New York Times.  We’ve fact-checked a few of Trump’s invasion-related claims. Similarly, Trump has used variations of the word ""infest"" in at least eight tweets dating back to the start of his 2016 campaign, usually in reference to an alleged gang presence he’s said is plaguing sanctuary cities where undocumented immigrants cannot be prosecuted or deported.  More examples of the president talking about an invasion or an infestation can be found on Factba.se. Trump also came under critics’ fire for using the word ""animals"" when talking about immigrants and MS-13 gang members, and for saying, in reference to the 2017 violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, ""you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides."" Democrats on the campaign trail and other critics of the president have said his rhetoric is echoed in an online post possibly linked to the El Paso shooter. According to the Washington Post, the manifesto sounds alarm about a so-called Hispanic invasion but says the shooter’s beliefs predated anything Trump has said. Wallace said Trump is ""talking about exterminating Latinos."" Trump has frequently labeled the flow of immigrants an ""invasion"" and railed against ""infested"" areas of the country. But he hasn’t said anything about ""exterminating Latinos."" The context of the interview was about words and their meanings. If Wallace wanted to hold Trump accountable for what he’s said, then we have an obligation to do the same for her.

Fact-checking John Cornyn's ad on Royce West and abortion
","U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, released the first attack advertisement of his reelection campaign in July, targeting one of his potential Democratic opponents: state Sen. Royce West of Dallas. West is one of several Democrats who have announced their candidacies for Cornyn’s seat. MJ Hegar, an Air Force veteran from Round Rock, and Amanda Edwards, a Houston City Council member, also are running. In Cornyn’s commercial, titled ""Their Side,"" a narrator describes West’s position on several issues, including abortion. ""Who is Royce West?"" the narrator says. ""West is a liberal politician who stood with Wendy Davis to support painful late-term abortions."" There’s no question that West supported former-state Sen. Wendy Davis in her filibuster of a bill restricting abortion during the 2013 legislative session. Cornyn’s campaign pointed us to the record vote on the legislation and to questions and comments West made to media outlets about the filibuster. But there’s more to this claim than meets the eye. The legislation in question was about broader issues than the cutoff for legal abortions. In addition to banning abortions from occurring past 20 weeks post-fertilization, the bill proposed strict restrictions on facilities that offered abortion services that many Democratic lawmakers worried would force clinics across the state to close. Let’s start at the beginning. Davis filibuster relied on other Democratic support On the last day of a specially called legislative session in 2013, Davis rose to speak at 11:18 a.m. and announced her intention to filibuster an abortion-related bill being promoted by Republican lawmakers in the chamber. The chamber needed to vote on the bill before a midnight deadline. The legislation banned abortion procedures after 20 weeks of pregnancy and instituted a series of requirements for physicians and clinics where the procedure was performed. It required abortion clinics to meet the same hospital-like standards that exist for ambulatory surgical centers and required doctors performing the procedure to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of an abortion clinic. Opponents of the bill, including Davis, said the legislation could prompt most of the state’s more than 40 abortion clinics to close their doors. Davis spoke for more than 11 hours on the bill, becoming a political celebrity in the process. Republican lawmakers raised points of order, accusing Davis of violating state law in her attempt to talk the bill to death, and caused members of the public who had gathered in the gallery to watch the proceedings to erupt into shouts, sending the chamber into chaos. Democratic lawmakers raised procedural questions to run out the clock as leaders in the chamber attempted to administer a vote on the bill. Video footage from the chamber and from different news outlets shows West involved in many private conversations with Senate leadership and other Democrats over the course of the filibuster. When the clock struck midnight, West asked the lieutenant governor to adjourn the session before voting on the bill.  ""What time does the session end? Midnight"" West said from the floor. ""We can’t take a vote after midnight — there’s no session."" A Texas Observer account of the evening includes a photo of West captioned: ""In a hurried vote on SB 5, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst checks his watch while Sen. Royce West waves his cell phone to show it’s past midnight."" The bill was not passed during the first special session, but then-Gov. Rick Perry immediately called another special session and the bill was refiled — called House Bill 2 — and adopted. West voted against the legislation. West told the Associated Press that, while Democrats did not have enough votes to kill the bill in the chamber, they would pursue legal action. ""We do not have the numbers to stop it,"" West said. ""As soon as it’s signed by the governor, it will be challenged … we believe the whole bill is unconstitutional."" The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that the bill’s restrictions on clinics placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. By that time, just 19 abortion clinics in the state were still operational. The ban on abortion procedures after 20 weeks was not affected by the ruling and is still in place. What is a late-term abortion? Cornyn’s advertisement discusses West’s stance on abortion, in particular his alleged support of ""painful late-term abortions."" But there are a few problems with that characterization. Cornyn’s campaign pointed to a Washington Post article that stated: ""‘Late-term’ abortions are generally understood to take place during or after the 21st to 24th week of gestation, which is late in the second trimester."" The article went on to say that there is no precise medical or legal definition for the phrase, a point echoed by Kate Connors, a spokeswoman for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in an email. Connors pointed to a fact sheet from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that states abortions that occur after 21-weeks post-fertilization account for slightly more than 1 percent of all abortions that take place in the United States. They said many of these procedures occur when a fetus is found to have anomalies ""incompatible with life,"" where ""death is likely before or shortly after birth.""  Connors pointed to a different fact-sheet exploring the potential for a fetus to experience pain.  ""A human fetus does not have the capacity to experience pain until after viability,"" the sheet reads. ""Rigorous scientific studies have found that the connections necessary to transmit signals from peripheral sensory nerves to the brain, as well as the brain structures necessary to process those signals, do not develop until at least 24 weeks of gestation."" In its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, the U.S. Supreme Court held that states could enact restrictions on abortion procedures after ""fetal viability"" — anywhere from 24 to 28 weeks post-fertilization. Do Davis and West support late-term abortions?  Davis went on to run for governor in 2014 (she lost to Republican Greg Abbott), and throughout her campaign she faced questions about her filibuster and inaccurate characterizations of her stance on abortion. In October of 2013, Texas Right to Life aired a radio advertisement that said ""Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion."" We rated that claim False. Bo Delp, the spokesman for her campaign at the time, told PolitiFact that Davis ""opposes late-term abortions except when the life or health of the mother is endangered."" This supports a comment that Matt Angle, an adviser to Davis, made to the American-Statesman around the same time. He said her filibuster was not ""about the 20-week ban"" included in the legislation. ""She was thrust into a fight over whether or not Texas women would have access to health care or not, and the leadership in the Senate insisted upon adding to that severe restrictions to basic health care,"" Angle said. ""She’s against late-term abortion except in cases of rape, incest, the life and health of the mother or when there are profound and serious non-reversible problems with the fetus."" West’s campaign did not return return multiple requests for comment over a two-week period about his stance on ""late-term abortion"" and his role in Davis’ filibuster. Our Ruling An advertisement from Cornyn’s campaign said that West, one of his Democratic challengers, stood with Wendy Davis ""to support painful late-term abortions."" It’s true that West supported Davis in her effort to kill a bill that would ban abortions at 20 weeks post-fertilization, but the legislation did much more than that. Opponents worried that it would close abortion clinics, which offer other health care services to women. Davis has said she opposes late-term abortions and officials with her team said she filibustered the legislation because it would force clinics to close — which it did.

No, CNN didn’t report that the same man died in Afghanistan and Uvalde
","Attempts to discredit tragic events like mass shootings can come in many different forms.

Sometimes, these posts target actual victims, like they did in the wake of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Other times, they drag in people who have nothing to do with the event.

We conducted a reverse-image search that showed the photo on Wikitubia, a Wikipedia-type page for YouTubers, that identifies the person as Jordan.

No evidence that masks caused COVID-19 deaths
","We’ve heard repeatedly from health officials that wearing a mask slows the spread of COVID-19 and helps protect people from the virus. But a Facebook post shared a claim that suggests the opposite. ""Study Finds ‘Positive Correlation’ Between Higher Mask Usage And COVID-19 Deaths,"" reads what looks like an image of a headline shared in a May 17 post. That headline originally came from The National Pulse, a conservative media site, that published a story about a study on masking in Europe.  ""Beyond finding no benefit to mask mandate compliance in curtailing the spread of COVID-19, the paper found a ‘moderate positive correlation’ between the use of masks and COVID-19 deaths,"" the Pulse wrote. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The study cited by the Pulse was titled, ""Correlation Between Mask Compliance and COVID-19 Outcomes in Europe."" It appeared in the Cureus Journal of Medical Science, an open-access medical journal that promotes post-publication peer review, a process that critics say is unusually speedy compared with other scientific journals.  Author Beny Spira, a professor in the department of microbiology at the University of Sāo Paulo in Brazil, examined data from 35 European countries on morbidity, mortality, and mask usage during a six-month period from October 2020 to March 2021. Mask usage was measured by the ""percent of the population reporting always wearing a mask when leaving home."" The data shown in Spira’s study showed that in countries where reported mask usage was higher — such as Hungary, where the study said that 77% of the population wore masks — there was a higher rate of cases and deaths compared to countries that had lower mask usage.    COVID-19 deaths, he wrote, seemed to rise in Western Europe even though masking was in place. Spira wrote that this seemed to suggest ""that the universal use of masks may have had harmful unintended consequences.""  In an email interview, Spira told PolitiFact that ""there were more deaths in countries that masked more."" But the study stopped short of saying the masks caused deaths, as the post suggests. ""I cannot say that masks caused more deaths as no causation could be inferred from observational studies"" Spira said. ""Having said that, the correlation was relatively strong, therefore one might conclude that something fishy was going on with masks."" Emily Smith, epidemiologist at George Washington University, said the logic behind the finding is flawed. Masking protocols were put into place because of the high risk of the virus at the time, she said. ""I think we can just use common sense to say that when cases are rising, people are more likely to do protective things,"" Smith said. ""You're more likely to wear a mask when you  go out and your city or your country might also have made recommendations or requirements to do those things.""  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other national public health agencies globally such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control recommends masks as one line of defense against spread of COVID-19. They recommend masking especially when transmission rates are high, because of the way the virus is transmitted. Any mask provides more protection than no mask, but how protective a face-covering is varies by its type, make and fit, said the CDC. Respirator masks, like N95 or KN95 masks, provide the highest level of protection.  ""Because the virus is transmitted predominantly by inhaling respiratory droplets from infected persons, universal mask use can help reduce transmission,"" the CDC stated in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published in March 2021. The report, based on data from March to December 2020, stated that mask mandates ""were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 cases and death growth rates within 20 days of implementation.""  The risk of transmission while wearing a mask depends also on the masking practices of others in the room — so going into a meeting or restaurant where others are unmasked or wearing only cloth masks increases the odds of getting infected.  A Facebook post said there’s a ""‘positive correlation’ between higher mask usage and COVID-19 deaths."" The post was referencing a study that reviewed data from 35 European countries and found that in places where mask usage was higher, COVID-19 deaths were also higher. But the study’s author said there was no cause-and-effect found.   Critics of the study said masking protocols were issued in response to high rates of transmission. So it would be expected that deaths would occur while masking would be in place.  Public health officials recommend masking as one way to help reduce transmission.. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C01900>],/factchecks/2022/may/27/facebook-posts/no-evidence-masks-caused-covid-19-deaths/

Private rescue total in campaign ad overshoots on number of Americans
","The chaotic last days of the U.S. war in Afghanistan that ended Aug. 30, 2021, created a need that active and veteran military members felt compelled to address: people who needed help leaving the country but had difficulty doing so. Some of those in Afghanistan were Americans, while plenty more were Afghans who helped the United States in its war with the Taliban.  Iowa state Sen. Zach Nunn, a U.S. Air Force aircrew intelligence officer who flew 700 combat hours over Afghanistan and also a cybersecurity expert in the Obama Administration’s National Security Council staff, was among those responding, co-founding an organization called Task Force Argo. It’s an experience that Nunn, of Altoona and seeking the Republican nomination for Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District seat, is letting people know. ""Zack Nunn saved over 2,000 Americans abandoned in Afghanistan by leading private rescue missions,"" a video ad for Nunn states. Our research shows the ad overshoots how many Americans he personally led out of Afghanistan but that some Americans in Afghanistan still are being helped by Nunn and Task Force Argo. ""I would be skeptical of the overall number and skeptical of that number of Americans,"" said Joe Saboe, founder of the volunteer group Team America. Saboe said Team America, one of the largest private groups evacuating people from Afghanistan, flew out around 150 Americans as U.S. troops left Afghanistan.  ""It strikes me as high,"" Saboe told PolitiFact. ""More to the point, though, very few politicians were actually helpful during that time, and that goes for both parties,"" he said about the federal government’s response to refugees trying to get out of Afghanistan as the Taliban won the war in August 201, and the need for groups like Task Force Argo and Team America to step in and help. Groups like Task Force Argo, a nationwide collection of volunteer veterans and private citizens, have brought out of the country or has helped with logistics for Afghan nationals at risk living under Taliban rule for helping the United States during its war with the Taliban. Americans are its first priority, the group states. Nunn said in one of two PolitiFact interviews that his group has tracked since Aug. 31 ""upwards of 2,000 Americans"" and reported that to the State Department. ""We still stay in contact with a weekly call with the State Department to help evacuate those individuals. And we have roughly 5,000-plus Afghan and American citizens in safe houses still in the country,"" Nunn said.  Americans staying there often are doing so because they have family members who are not U.S. citizens and are having difficulty getting permission to leave, Nunn and others said. A Philadelphia Enquirer report Oct. 21, 2021, had the Task Force Ago numbers at 61 Americans among the 2,160 moved from Afghanistan when that story was published. A little more than 500 people have been moved out since then. The Task Force Argo website reported May 25 that it has evacuated 2,663 people from Afghanistan but does not state how many were Americans. Even if all of the 500 additional people since Oct. 21 were Americans — and they are not — that would amount to 561 total. Task Force Argo’s first flight on Aug. 30, 2021, brought 400 Afghans out of Afghanistan. On Sept. 24, 2021, the group announced it had collaborated with a group called Save Our Allies to bring ""550 American citizens, lawful permanent residents who have green cards to work in the United States, special immigrant visa holders, Afghans-at-risk, and their families from Afghanistan to a refugee processing center in the Middle East."" The release did not state how many were Americans.  An Oct. 8, 2021, news release reported that Task Force Argo evacuated 11 U.S. citizens, eight green card holders, and 85 immediate family members. Two days later, a news release from Task Force Argo and a group called Task Force Sunflower said the two collaborated to evacuate three U.S. citizens, 12 U.S. green card holders and 79 of their immediate family members from Afghanistan.  Team America, Save Our Allies, Task Force Sunflower and Task Force Argo are among as many as 180 private groups working privately but collaborating with the U.S. State Department and Defense Department to help bring Americans and Afghans out of Afghanistan. Save Our Allies, for example, has reported bringing more than 12,000 Afghans out of the country. It reported it had paid the costs of bringing 55 American citizens and lawful permanent residents out in December. Other efforts since Aug. 31, 2021, included Project Dynamo and Human First Coalition using a private charter flight to bring more than 100 U.S. citizens and green card holders and nine special immigrant visa holders to the United States in late September, a news release said. Project Dynamo and Human First Coalition said the Taliban helped them have a safe takeoff from Kabul. The State Department press office told PolitiFact Iowa in a series of email exchanges that it cannot confirm how many Americans these non-government organizations have brought out of Afghanistan. The department evaluates requests for privately arranged flights on a case-by-case basis but could not confirm how many passengers on these flights are eligible to be relocated or settled in the United States, the press office wrote. The State Department vets people the private groups bring to the United States for admission but lacks enough personnel to confirm how any passengers registered on a plane manifest are eligible for relocation in this country, the press office said. The State Department has supported directly travel out of Afghanistan for 683 U.S. citizens and 559 lawful permanent residents from Aug. 31, 2021, to May 23, 2022, with no deadline for ending these efforts, the press office reported. Before Aug. 31, U.S. military and the State Department evacuated and relocated 120,000 people, including 10,000 U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and Afghan interpreters with special immigrant visas. Nunn said in the PolitiFact Iowa interviews he was involved with rescue missions via third party countries that helped remove Americans and Afghans  from Afghanistan last year. He has not been there this year. He works on evacuation logistics remotely, he said. He said he was confident that he had a hand in saving more than 2,000 Americans because of his involvement in last year’s flights, his continued communication and logistical work to assist those who need help getting out of the country, and his collaboration with the national consortium assisting the State Department.  ""The real conversation in my opinion needs to be far more about the fact that we left Americans behind,"" Nunn said. ""There still are Americans there right now, and there are people in America helping these folks out of their own pocket, their own time. We would like to have some level of help on this and be able to save the people who served with us for two decades."" A U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee minority report in February suggested that 9,000 Americans were left in Afghanistan when the Taliban took over. The State Department disputes that number, saying fewer than 200 Americans still were there and choosing to stay. U.S. consortium members have weekly conference calls with government officials in continuing moves to help people leave Afghanistan, involved members told PolitiFact in interviews and emails. This private effort has been referred to as a ""digital Dunkirk,"" a reference to the citizens who rushed to Dunkirk in their personal boats to rescue 338,000 British and French soldiers during Germany’s 1940 World War II siege of that French beach town. High-tech evacuation communications and logistics involving safe houses in Afghanistan and assistance from countries like Qatar once people leave Afghanistan are designed to keep Taliban leaders from finding and punishing those trying to leave. Saboe’s Team America eventually merged with another group #AfghanEvac. Shawn Van Diver, #AfghanEvac’s founder and an early leader pulling together the national consortium, said it’s unlikely that 2,000 Americans have needed to be rescued from Afghanistan since U.S. troops left. Americans who want to leave the country now may fly out of a commercial airport, he said. Van Diver said Task Force Argo has been a sincere, valuable partner. He said in a PolitiFact Iowa interview that Nunn and Task Force Argo cofounder Jesse Jensen, an Army Ranger Regiment captain and Republican candidate for Congress from Washington state, have been helpful bucking many in their party by supporting an Afghan Adjustment Act. The act, supported by President Biden, would give Afghan immigrants permanent legal residency and a pathway to U.S. citizenship. ""I think it’s clear that these guys care about Afghans,"" Van Diver said. ""Argo has a lot of handlers that talk to a lot of Afghans, and has been doing their best to provide that much needed support. And, you know, they’ve really stepped up."" A political ad for Nunn’s 3rd Congressional District primary race in Iowa says Nunn ""saved over 2,000 Americans abandoned in Afghanistan by leading private rescue missions."" Nunn, Argo Task Force co-founder Jesse Jensen and others are key members of several American groups working privately but in collaboration with the U.S. government to bring Americans and endangered people out of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan since U.S. troops left that country.  But saying the count is more than 2,000 Americans when most of those coming out are not American gives a different impression of what Nunn is doing than exists. In a May 18 interview on Shenandoah, Iowa’s KMA radio, Nunn, himself, qualified the claim: ""We flew multiple flights over and carried out over 2,500 Americans and allies after the U.S. flag fell in Kabul."" Nunn is doing humanitarian work but the number in the ad is an exaggeration and ignores important details. We rate the statement to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097890980>],/factchecks/2022/may/27/zach-nunn/private-rescue-total-campaign-ad-overshoots-number/

FBI data shows more deaths by ‘hands, fists, feet’ than rifles. But there’s more to know
","Amid the gun control debate, a data-laden graphic shared on Facebook posits this: rifles are nothing compared with human brawn. ""More people die from hands, fists, feet, than rifles. Guess we should ban limbs now…,"" reads the May 25 post. Underneath, a graphic titled ""Number of murder victims in the Unites States in 2020 by weapon used"" shows rifle deaths at 455 and deaths from ""personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.)"" as 662. The post includes a link to a website called Statista. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) FBI data from 2020 does show that more people died from injuries sustained from other people’s fists, feet and hands than from rifles. But there’s more you should know about that data before you use it to draw conclusions. Statista researchers pulled data from the FBI’s Crime Data explorer, which does show that of the 17,813 homicides reported in 2020, 662 of them were committed with ""personal weapons"" — which the site indeed describes as hands, fists, feet, etc. — and 455 homicides were committed with rifles. So strictly going by the numbers, the post’s claim is accurate, but there are important caveats. The FBI’s numbers also show that of all the homicides reported, 13,663 were committed with firearms of any kind, or about 77%. Only about 4% of homicides overall were from hands, fists and feet. And 4,863 of those gun homicides were committed with firearms of a ""type not stated,"" meaning law enforcement agencies didn't specify in their data reporting which type of gun was used. Enough rifles could be among those to push that total higher than personal weapons — even 5% would do it — though there’s no way to know for certain. The FBI’s data is based on voluntary reporting. Not every law enforcement agency files an expanded homicide report. These statistics are based on reports from 15,875 of 18,623 law agencies, meaning the number of homicides is likely higher. The Centers for Disease Control, for instance, lists 19,384 gun homicides in the U.S. in 2020, based on U.S. death certificate information provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. The FBI statistics show that handguns were used in most of the gun homicides, with 8,029. That’s likely because ""violent crime is typically higher in urban areas than rural ones, and handguns are better suited for urban living,"" said Adam Lankford, a criminology and criminal justice professor at the University of Alabama. Lankford and a colleague did a study in 2020 that found that semiautomatic rifles or assault weapons are increasingly being used in mass shootings.  ""It makes sense that handguns would be used more often than long guns in muggings, gang violence, robberies, or any other form of violence where the perpetrator may try to hide his firearm before and after the crime,"" Lankford said. ""Public mass shooters are less concerned about hiding their firearms because they typically don't expect to escape."" AR-15 or AR-15-style rifles have been used in many high-profile mass shootings, including at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, a country music concert in Las Vegas in 2017 and the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. Such weapons were also used in the two most recent mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York. Salvador Ramos, the Uvalde gunman who police say killed 19 elementary school students and two teachers on May 24, used an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle in the attack, one of two rifles he purchased days earlier after his 18th birthday, The Associated Press reported. Payton Gendron, the 18-year-old charged with fatally shooting 10 people in a racially motivated attack at a Buffalo supermarket on May 14, also used an AR-15-style rifle, The Associated Press reported. A Facebook post claimed that more people were killed by hands, fists and feet in 2020 than by rifles.  FBI data does confirm that statistic. But the data source is limited, and the stat alone doesn’t tell the full story of the role firearms of all kinds play in homicides.  We rate this Mostly True.

Wilson’s claim on Zeldin budget votes not fully accurate
","Republican gubernatorial candidate Harry Wilson aims to discredit one of the leading candidates in the GOP primary, Rep. Lee Zeldin, with claims that Zeldin supported the economic plans put forth over the years by then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.  Wilson, a businessman from Westchester County, claims in an ad that ""Lee Zeldin was Andrew Cuomo’s favorite Republican."" The ad goes on to say Zeldin ""voted for Cuomo’s Billion Dollar Tax hike and every Cuomo budget.""  Primaries for statewide offices are set for June 28. Former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino and former Trump administration aide Andrew Giuliani are also running in the Republican primary for governor.  Zeldin, a Long Island congressman, was elected to the state Senate in 2010 and served two terms. We checked his voting record on every state budget during that time. Each budget was passed in multiple bills, addressing revenue, aid to localities, and debt service among other parts, and lawmakers vote on each of them.  Zeldin voted in favor of all of the budget bills during his years in the state Senate. Many of these bills passed with overwhelming support in the Senate, sometimes without any senator voting against them. During this period, Republicans controlled the Senate, at times with support from the Independent Democratic Caucus, and they negotiated with the Assembly’s Democratic leadership and the Cuomo administration.   We asked Wilson’s campaign about his claim that Zeldin voted in favor of a ""billion-dollar tax hike."" Campaign spokesperson Alex Wilkes said that in 2011, Zeldin supported the state budget's $1.9 billion tax increase, (revenue was set to increase by that much, though supporters of the tax reform package would say that rates actually went down) and in 2013 Zeldin voted for the state budget that included an extension of a tax targeting high earners. The tax was set to expire in 2014, but the budget vote in March 2013 extended it until 2017.  Some observers, like E.J. McMahon, a close watcher of state finances and a fiscal conservative, called the extension in 2013 a tax increase. The tax on high earners was supposed to end, but Cuomo and the Legislature kept it in place, resulting in a 29% increase for high earners, McMahon said. He reached that figure by calculating what they would have paid had the tax targeting high earners expired and what they paid under the rate established by the plan passed by the lawmakers. Following the tax reform in late 2011, tax receipts were projected to increase by $1.9 billion. According to the Cuomo administration, the budget for the 2013 fiscal year (April 1, 2012, through March 31, 2013,) raised more tax revenue, though it also created savings for the middle class. An April 2012 report from the Cuomo administration projected a $2 billion increase in tax receipts from what was collected in fiscal year 2012 and what it expected to collect in fiscal year 2013. An expected gross increase of $1.9 billion was attributed to ""tax reform."" This reform package lowered rates slightly for the highest earners, but did not bring them down to what they would have been had the higher rates been allowed to expire. The report also projected a $250 million decrease in tax revenue from an MTA payroll tax relief plan for small businesses and a decrease of $135 million from tax credits and other initiatives. Though the tax reforms were a revenue-raiser for the state, the budget division wrote: ""The tax reform measures are intended to enhance fairness in the tax system and are expected to provide $900 million in savings for middle class New Yorkers and small business.""  When asked about Wilson’s claim, Zeldin spokesperson Katie Vincentz pointed to the downstate payroll tax break, and a middle-income tax cut, both agreed to as part of the 2011 tax package, and said all of the budgets contained conservative wins.  Vincentz also said the budgets shouldn't be called Cuomo budgets, because they were negotiated with and voted on by the Legislature and that members of the Senate majority changed Cuomo’s budget proposals.  Wilson claims Zeldin ""voted for Cuomo’s Billion Dollar Tax hike and every Cuomo budget.""  While in the state Senate, Zeldin did vote for a final version of every budget that Cuomo proposed. But calling it ""Cuomo’s budget"" erases the role the state Legislature played in negotiating and making changes to Cuomo’s proposals.  The changes to the tax rates were intended to bring in more revenue, though many in the state experienced a tax cut. The highest earners paid a lower rate than they had been paying, but more than they would have paid if the rate had been allowed to expire.  The claim is partially accurate because the tax revenue was projected to increase, but it leaves out important details and takes some things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809782C680>],/factchecks/2022/may/27/harry-wilson/wilsons-claim-zeldin-budget-votes-not-fully-accura/

Fact-checking claim that plastics can help combat climate change
","Plastics can help fight climate change? The perplexing statement was recently made on Facebook by America’s Plastic Makers, a U.S. plastics producer that says its mission is to end plastic waste with modern materials. ""Studies show #plastic can help combat climate change,"" the post says. ""Researchers found using plastic in packaging and consumer products can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to many alternative materials.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) America’s Plastic Makers is run by the American Chemistry Council, an industry trade association for U.S. chemical companies, and is one of the leading producers of plastic in the U.S. The group’s post links to a page on its website that says decades of analysis shows plastics are strong and lightweight, thus requiring less material than steel, paper, aluminum and glass. The group says that replacing plastics with these materials, in many cases, would ""significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions."" But this oversimplifies a complex issue about plastic packaging's benefits versus its negative impacts on the marine environment and human health. Many studies have found that plastic significantly contributes to climate change because of the high carbon dioxide emissions that occur at every stage of its life.  Plastics are made from raw materials like natural gas, oil or plants, which are refined into ethane and propane before being treated with heat, turning them into ethylene and propylene.  These materials combine to create different polymers, which look like powdered laundry detergent. That’s melted down, cooled and eventually molded to make products like water bottles, food packaging, auto parts, medical devices and more. This process — which includes the extraction and transportation of oil and gas, as well as the steps to refine the plastic — emits millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide every year. In its report, America’s Plastic Makers uses various life-cycle studies — a methodology for assessing environmental impacts associated with the different stages of a product, process or service — from 2011, 2016 and 2018. Those studies suggest that plastic can perform the functions of paper or glass, but with less material and less weight, leading to less production energy and greenhouse gases. The benefits of lightweight material are legitimate, but plastics still have negatives. Primarily, American consumers use so much plastic that it still has a large negative impact on the environment.  A May 2019 report called ""Plastic & Climate: The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet,"" by the Center for International Environmental Law, found that the manufacture of plastics is particularly greenhouse-gas intensive. In 2015, emissions from manufacturing ethylene were 184.3 to 213 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, about as much as what 45 million vehicles emit during one year. Then there’s the repeated disposal of plastic packaging, via landfill, incineration or recycling. Incineration has the largest climate impact. U.S. emissions from plastics incineration in 2015 were 5.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.  Because plastics are so common and so easily disposed of, it’s not especially realistic to compare their environmental impact to other materials.  ""This topic is indeed more complicated than the (American Plastic Makers) report suggests,"" said Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University. ""I’m reminded of the common question, ‘Paper or plastic?’ The right answer is whatever you already have, so long as you reuse it."" Finally, researchers have found that plastics have a large negative impact on the earth’s oceans. The ocean acts like a huge sink for global pollution, with tons of plastic dumped in waters around the world every year. Hundreds of thousands of marine animals get entangled in plastic waste each year and ingest and suffocate on plastic products they mistake for food. Studies evaluating how plastics impact marine environment and human health acknowledge that the material is cheap, strong and durable, and offers benefits to humanity, but say that waste management practices and human behavior have created a real problem. Plastics do not biodegrade but they do eventually break down under sunlight and fragment into small particles, called microplastics. One 2012 report published in Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology said that 267 species in the marine environment are known to have been harmed by plastic entanglement or ingestion. Scientists suspect that ocean pollution is an important but insufficiently understood component of global pollution that poses serious threats to human health and well-being. Matthew Kastner, director of media relations for the Chemistry Council’s plastics division, acknowledged the danger of ocean pollution but also said the press has made exaggerated claims about plastics and greenhouse gas emissions. ""This is a short social media post intended to help correct the record,"" Kastner told PolitiFact. ""We 100% agree that plastics do not belong in the ocean or anywhere in the environment."" All this presents a complicated choice in terms of deciding what to choose for packaging, researchers say. ""What is clear is that we need to reduce plastics production while ensuring that any alternatives do not contribute more to climate change, and this is where recycling comes in,"" a 2020 analysis by the Imperial College of London says. ""The emissions reductions from eliminating the need for new plastic outweigh the slightly higher emissions that come from processing wastes to recover plastics."" America’s Plastic Makers claimed on Facebook that plastic can help combat climate change. It’s true that some studies have found that plastic packaging is less environmentally damaging than alternatives like glass and paper, but this doesn’t negate plastics' negative impact on human health and marine environment.  Instead of assessing which packaging to use, researchers said the focus should be on ramping up recycling and reuse practices. The topic is more complicated than the post suggests.

Florida uses semitrucks as patrol vehicles, but they’re marked
","Florida is a state where the strange can become ordinary, and the ordinary can become strange. Such is the case of tractor-trailers being used as patrol vehicles. A Facebook post by Cracked.com, a website focused on humor, said that Florida Highway Patrol, or FHP, used multiple semitrucks to monitor and report traffic violations.  ""Florida Highway Patrol has a semi-truck as a patrol vehicle and occasionally makes traffic stops,"" a May 17 Facebook post read. ""The FHP uses a fleet of three such ‘hidden in plain sight’ trucks to snitch on bad drivers or even pull them over themselves.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that Cracked.com was mostly accurate in its characterization of FHP’s patrol fleet. But more context is needed.  The FHP does, in fact, have three semitrucks in its patrol fleet. The trucks are large, at around 53 feet long with 18 wheels, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.  The agency deploys both tractor-trailers (the truck and the portion being hauled) and the semitruck (the portion containing the engine) on the roads. The semitrucks arrived on the scene in 2014 as part of an FHP campaign to inform drivers about the risk of ""aggressive driving"" around large vehicles.

ICE está en Uvalde, Texas, apoyando las investigaciones después del tiroteo, no deportando personas
","Después de que una persona armada mató a 19 estudiantes y dos maestras en una escuela primaria en Uvalde, Texas, publicaciones en redes sociales afirmaron que la presencia de autoridades de inmigracion en la escena del crimen significaba que algunos padres podrían ser deportados si se acercaban a la escuela.  Un tuit comentó: ""ICE está en la escena de un tiroteo que se llevó a cabo en una escuela mayoritariamente Hispana entonces los padres indocumentados tienen que temer el ser deportados antes de verificar si sus hijos están vivos"".

Shingles-monkeypox claim misleads with false flu-COVID-19 theory
","Influenza cases went down dramatically after COVID-19 first began its rampage across the U.S. in 2020. Now some social media users are predicting a similar scenario happening again, this time with shingles and monkeypox. ""You know how with COVID the flu suddenly disappeared, when in reality COVID tests were picking up the flu and saying that it was COVID? They’re going to do the same thing with monkeypox and shingles,"" one woman said in a Facebook video on May 21. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.) The narrator in the Facebook video is wrong on several counts. First, as PolitiFact has reported before, COVID-19 tests did not pick up flu cases and count them as coronavirus cases. The initial COVID-19 testing protocol from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was specifically designed to only find SARS-CoV-2, not influenza or any other virus. In July 2021, the CDC alerted labs that it was withdrawing its emergency use authorization request for the protocol because newer diagnostic tests, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, had been developed that could detect both COVID-19 and influenza. Authorities preferred those tests because they would save time and resources heading into flu season. That prompted false claims on social media that the test couldn’t differentiate between the viruses, so the CDC issued a clarification soon after, noting that the test ""does not confuse influenza with SARS-CoV-2."" It did seem as if influenza disappeared during the pandemic, as the post alleges. But there’s a good reason for that. The CDC said COVID-19 prevention measures, such as lockdowns, mask wearing, social distancing and increased hand-washing, as well as a record number of flu vaccines explain the decrease. Flu cases dropped dramatically in the 2020-21 flu season. Only 0.2% of tests from U.S. laboratories were positive; that figure ranged between 26.2% and 30.3% in the three seasons before the pandemic, the CDC said. Influenza cases climbed again recently, however, as COVID-19 mitigation efforts decreased. According to the CDC’s preliminary estimates for the 2021-22 flu season (Oct. 21 to May 14) there were 6.7 million to 11 million influenza illnesses and between 4,200 and 13,000 deaths. That is still down from the 2019-20 estimate of 35 million illnesses and 20,000 deaths. The CDC provides estimates, not exact numbers, because states are not required to report influenza cases. The poster’s claim that shingles will now be passed off as monkeypox cases is becoming a common theme on social media, with some falsely saying it’s a cover for COVID-19 vaccine side effects, but it has no basis in truth. To help make her case, the woman in the Facebook video shows another social media post that points out that the same photo was used in different articles depicting monkeypox and shingles. However, PolitiFact reported that the photo, which depicts a shingles rash, was mistakenly used by an Indian health website in an article about monkeypox and has since been removed. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same one that causes chickenpox. That virus stays inactive in your body after you’ve had chickenpox, and can become active many years later as shingles. It’s more commonly found in people over 50, but anyone can get shingles.  About a million people get shingles each year and 1 in 3 Americans will get it in their lifetime, the CDC said. Research has shown an increased risk for shingles, especially among older people, who have had COVID-19. Shingles cannot be spread to another person, but patients can spread chickenpox to others through contact with fluid from blisters. The monkeypox spread in Europe and North America is unusual because the disease is rarely found outside of Western and Central Africa, where it is endemic. The zoonotic disease is spread by close personal contact with an infected person, through contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets or contaminated clothing and bedding. While both shingles and monkeypox result in a skin rash with fluid-filled blisters, the distribution of the rash is different, said Dr. Esther Freeman, director of Global Health Dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and a member of the monkeypox task force at the American Academy of Dermatology. ""(It's) usually just on one side of the body, while monkeypox would be on both sides of the body and would be more generalized on the skin in different parts of the body at the same time,"" Freeman said. ""Monkeypox generally becomes pustular, which means the fluid filled blisters become white a little later in the disease course."" 
Diagnosis and testing of the two diseases are also different. For monkeypox, a state laboratory would test a sample of a suspected case to confirm it’s an orthopoxvirus, the genus of viruses to which monkeypox belongs. If so, the sample would be sent to the CDC to confirm if it’s monkeypox. That two-step process is because of the U.S. smallpox preparedness plan, said Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology and a captain in the U.S. Public Health Service. It wasn't set up specifically for monkeypox, but is helpful to allow the CDC to get the sequencing data it needs so it can be shared globally, she said.  In many cases of shingles, doctors can often diagnose the disease simply with a visual exam. But there are simple, fast laboratory tests for shingles, either a PCR or direct fluorescent antibody test, involving a swab of a skin lesion that can be done, Freeman said. A Facebook video claimed that authorities are going to pass off shingles cases as monkeypox cases, and that they did that with the flu and COVID-19. But that’s not what happened with the flu and COVID-19. Flu cases did drop during the pandemic, but not because cases were mistaken or passed off as COVID-19. Mitigation measures during the pandemic and a record number of flu vaccines distributed explain the drop, the CDC said. Shingles and monkeybox both have blistering skin rashes, but they look different. Testing for each virus is different, with monkeypox testing being a two-part process that requires confirmation from the CDC, something shingles tests do not. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A394900>],/factchecks/2022/may/26/facebook-posts/shingles-monkeypox-claim-misleads-false-flu-covid-/

Research: Armed campus police do not prevent school shootings
","Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has blamed others for politicizing the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, to advance discussions about gun access. To Cruz, the answer is simpler.  ""We know from past experiences that the most effective tool for keeping kids safe is armed law enforcement on the campus,"" Cruz said in Washington on May 24, just hours after the shooting, before many details were known.  Ted Cruz proposes armed cops in elementary schools to deter school shootings pic.twitter.com/sJ8B6cf9Xd ""Inevitably when there’s a murder of this kind, you see politicians try to politicize it, you see Democrats and a lot of folks in the media whose immediate solution is to try to restrict the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. That doesn’t work. It’s not effective. It doesn’t prevent crime."" Is it true that we know from ""past experiences that the most effective tool for keeping kids safe is armed law enforcement on the campus""? No. Whether it’s anecdotal evidence or broad-based research, there is little to support Cruz’s claim. Let’s start with what happened in Uvalde, Texas.  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz arrives at a news conference in Uvalde, Texas, on May 25, 2022. (AP) Officials have offered various and conflicting reports at what happened at Robb Elementary School. On May 25, Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety Steven McCraw said that before 18-year-old Salvador Ramos entered the school and shot and killed at least 19 children and two teachers, he was confronted by a district school resource officer, a common title for armed police officers who work on school grounds. ""There was a brave consolidated independent school district resource officer that approached (Ramos), engaged him and, at that time, gunfire was not exchanged,"" McCraw said. ""The subject was able to make it into the school."" Other media accounts offer some different details about the number of officers and the level of confrontation. And then on May 26, Texas law enforcement officials said Ramos was able to enter the school unobstructed and that a school resource officer was not on scene.  ""He walked in unobstructed initially,"" said Victor Escalon, regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety. Law enforcement officers ultimately shot and killed Ramos, McCraw said, but not before at least 21 people were killed and 17 additional people were injured.  Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, left, speaks during a roundtable discussion hosted by Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott to address safety and security at Texas schools in the wake of the shooting at Santa Fe, in Austin, Texas, May 24, 2018. (AP) In 2018, in Texas, Cruz responded to another school shooting, this one at Santa Fe High School, in Santa Fe, Texas. In that case, the shooter was confronted by two police officers who were stationed at the school, according to a local sheriff. The officers, one of whom was shot during the attack, ""hemmed the gunman into one classroom and saved lives by drawing his attention and fire,"" the sheriff said. About 30 minutes after the shooting started, the 17-year-old suspect surrendered to law enforcement. A total of 10 people were killed and 13 were wounded. Multiple explosive devices were also found at or near the school, officials said.  The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom that focuses on gun issues, found that in Santa Fe and in three other prominent shootings in 2018 — Kentucky’s Marshall County High School in January; Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February; Maryland’s Great Mills High School in March — ""attackers stormed campuses despite the presence of armed guards."" In each case, guards failed to stop the shooter from killing. Broader research provides not much support for Cruz’s claim that armed law enforcement officers on school grounds are the ""most effective tool"" for keeping kids safe from mass shootings. A 2021 study conducted by researchers from University at Albany and RAND examined data from U.S. schools between 2014 to 2018 to evaluate the impact of school resource officers. It found that school resource officers ""do effectively reduce some forms of violence in schools, but do not prevent school shootings or gun-related incidents."" In addition, that study found that school resource officers appear to protect students from ""a non-trivial number of physical attacks and fights within schools,"" which could have long-term academic and psychological benefits for students. But schools with resource officers also report more suspensions, expulsions, police referrals and student arrests — and those harsher disciplinary punishments disproportionately fall on Black students, male students and students with disabilities. Another 2021 JAMA Network study conducted by researchers at Hamline University and Metropolitan State University in Minnesota examined a total of 133 school shootings and attempted school shootings from 1980 to 2019.  It was limited by the availability of public data and the inability to measure deterred shootings, among other factors, but researchers found that, controlling for other factors such as location, school type and region, the data showed ""armed guards were not associated with significant reduction in rates of injuries"" during school mass shootings. Further, when researchers controlled for location and school characteristic factors, ""the rate of deaths was 2.83 times greater (emphasis added) in schools with an armed guard present."" Pete Blair, the executive director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University, said armed individuals can play a role in stopping school shootings in progress but cautioned against any claim that it’s ""the most effective tool"" or that it prevents school shootings.  In Illinois in 2018, for instance, officials credited an officer with avoiding a potential school shooting involving a student at the school. The shooter’s mother said she thought her son was trying to get the police to kill him. Only the shooter was injured. Blair said the ALERRT Center is part of a group that works with the FBI to release annual active shooter data. The FBI defines an active shooter as ""one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area."" That data shows that from 2000 until 2021, there have been 434 active shooter incidents, Blair said. This includes shooter incidents in schools and elsewhere. ""The most common resolution is for the attacker to flee,"" Blair said, which happened in about 25% of all cases. In about the same number of cases, the shooting stopped when a responding on-duty police officer, armed security or off-duty officer shot the attacker, he said. Blair said the data isn’t specific enough to break down whether police officers who used force to stop an attack were already stationed there at the time — as a school resource officer likely would be — or were called in specifically to respond to the incident. Dewey Cornell, a professor of education at the University of Virginia who studies school safety, bullying and student threat assessment, said he has seen research that suggests school resource officers ""can be valuable in building relationships with students and working with threat assessment teams, but not as armed guards protecting the campus from a shooter."" ""I know of no scientific evidence that having armed law enforcement on campus by itself keeps kids safe at school,"" he said. ""We have prevented school shootings by identifying threats and working with troubled students before they make an attack."" PolitiFact found no studies or research that conclusively showed that the presence of armed officers deterred people from targeting schools. ""From a theoretical point of view, it makes sense. Trying to prove it empirically can be difficult,"" Blair said. ""I can’t point to any specific cases and say, here’s this specific case where this person said, they looking at this and they chose not to because there was an armed security guard there.’"" The 2021 JAMA Network study said data suggested ""no association between having an armed officer and deterrence of violence"" in mass shootings from 1980 to 2019.  ""Prior research suggests that many school shooters are actively suicidal, intending to die in the act, so an armed officer may be an incentive rather than a deterrent,"" the study said. Steve Guest, a spokesperson for Cruz, pointed to a 2019 Vox article that referenced 2005 research that suggested increased police presence leads to fewer people committing crimes. The article and research wasn’t looking at school shootings specifically. The spokesperson also referenced a 2018 report that found for 238 middle and high schools in West Virginia, the presence of resource officers ""increases the number of reported incidents related to drug crime as well as the number of out-of-school suspensions for drug crime, but decreases violent crime and disorder when multiple years are considered."" Again, the report wasn’t looking at school shootings specifically. It did say that school resource officers are more likely to work with law enforcement to create a written plan for ""how to deal with shootings."" Cruz said, ""We know from past experiences that the most effective tool for keeping kids safe is armed law enforcement on the campus."" A 2021 JAMA Network study said data found ""no association between having an armed officer and deterrence of violence"" in mass shootings from 1980 to 2019. A 2021 study by the University at Albany and RAND said school resource officers ""do not prevent school shootings or gun-related incidents."" We rate this claim False. ​UPDATE: This story was updated on May 26 at 3:30 p.m. ET to include new details from Texas law enforcement officials about how and when the Uvalde shooter was confronted.

Wis. Gov. Evers didn’t cause slowdown of state crime labs
","Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, is taking heat from Republicans who hope to unseat him this fall over the efficiency of the state crime lab. Now, the Wisconsin Republican Party is hitting Gov. Tony Evers on the same topic. In a May 2, 2022 email newsletter, the party criticied Evers for delays in the processing time of evidence, declaring:  ""On Evers’ watch…the efficiency of the state crime lab has plummeted."" Is the Wisconsin GOP right?  Has efficiency fallen dramatically at the crime lab? And, if so, is Evers to blame? We asked the Wisconsin GOP for backup for the claim, but it did not respond.  But the email included a link to an April 14, 2022 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article, which noted the crime lab took longer to process DNA in 2021 under Kaul, despite having smaller caseloads. So, we will start there. Before we do, we’ll note that we rated True this claim from Republican Eric Toney, who hopes to take on Kaul this fall: The crime lab ""is testing significantly less items than former AG Brad Schimel and is still taking longer to test many categories of key items in comparison to Schimel, including DNA."" This claim from the Republicans is much more general, and pins the blame on Evers – not Kaul. Since Evers and Kaul were elected at the same time, we can use the same baseline totals from our earlier factcheck here: When looking at overall cases, we found that in 2018, Schimel’s last year, the crime lab took 12,680 cases. In 2021, under Kaul that total was 9,297 cases – a more than 30% drop. We also found that in the 10 categories measured, turnaround took more time in six of them under Kaul than under Schimel.  But that means turnaround times are down in the other four, so it’s more of a mixed bag than the GOP claims.  Let’s look at a few specific categories: The median processing time for DNA samples in 2021 was 115 days, up from 79 days in 2020 and 65 days in 2019, according to the crime labs’ annual report.   Meanwhile, controlled substance samples took 61 days to process on average, up from 44 days in 2020 and 33 days in 2019. And toxicology cases took 48 days on average, up from 39 days in 2020 and 36 days in 2019.  Yet other types of cases had a faster processing time, such as firearms cases. On average, those took 157 days in 2021, compared to 247 days in 2020 and 258 days in 2019.  So, the way the claim was stated – ""efficiency has plummeted"" – is not entirely backed up by the evidence. That may be true in some areas, but not others. But what about Evers’ role? To be clear, the Department of Justice and its crime labs are not run by Evers. They’re overseen by Kaul, an elected official in his own right.  ""Governor Evers’ oversight into the crime lab is only so far as introducing a budget,"" said Gillian Drummond, a Department of Justice spokesperson.  In the 2021-23 budget, the most recent, the department asked for funding for four additional analysts for the crime lab to work on toxicology cases. Evers included those positions in his version of the budget, but recommended less money for them than the department requested, according to state documents.  In the end, the Legislature only approved funding for laboratory equipment, and not the additional employees. That’s where things stood in the budget Evers signed in August 2021.  Drummond noted processing times over the last several years were affected by COVID-19. In Milwaukee, for example, given the space in the lab, shifts had to be set up to maintain a safe distance. Then, the courts reopened, meaning analysts were called out to testify more frequently.  ""We’ve suffered the ebb and flow of all of the impacts the criminal justice system has endured,"" Drummond said.  But, as we noted in the earlier fact check, those factors did not prevent the lab from improving in other areas. For our purposes here, it all just underlines the fact Evers does not oversee the crime lab, so putting all the blame on him for declines in efficiency is misplaced. The state Republican Party claimed that on ""Evers’ watch…the efficiency of the state crime lab has plummeted."" Though the number of cases referred to the labs has dropped since 2018, the average amount of processing time for some areas, such as DNA samples, toxicology and controlled substances has increased. But in other areas, such as firearms, the lab decreased the average processing time. So it’s really more of a mixed bag. The party also misses the mark in that Evers has a very  limited role over operation of the lab. Indeed, Evers included money in the most recent budget to add several positions, but it was nixed by the Republican-controlled Legislature.   We rate this claim as Mostly False, which means the statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important facts that would give a different impression. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097388A80>],/factchecks/2022/may/26/republican-party-wisconsin/wis-gov-evers-didnt-cause-slowdown-state-crime-lab/

Joe Biden said mass shootings tripled when the assault weapon ban ended. They did
","There was no mistaking President Joe Biden’s plea for some sort of concrete response to the slaying of 19 elementary school children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas. ""I spent my career as a senator and as vice president working to pass common sense gun laws,"" Biden said in a May 24 prime time national address. ""We can’t and won’t prevent every tragedy. But we know they work and have a positive impact. When we passed the assault weapons ban, mass shootings went down. When the law expired, mass shootings tripled."" Biden was thinking back to sweeping gun legislation passed in 1994. Among other changes, it banned certain kinds of weapons, and the large-capacity magazines that allow people to fire more bullets before reloading. There are numbers that back Biden up. A 2019 study out of New York University’s School of Medicine found that mass shooting deaths involving assault weapons fell slightly in the decade of the federal assault weapon ban, and then rose dramatically in the decade that followed. That’s the time frame for Biden’s statement. While other researchers said the decline during the ban was too small to draw firm conclusions about the ban’s impact, there is no debate that the pace and deadliness of mass shootings rose after the ban ended. Beyond assault weapons, more recent work points to the threat posed by large-capacity magazines, which the 1994 law also restricted. The 1994 law barred the ""manufacture, transfer, and possession"" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding more than 10 rounds. People who already owned such weaponry could keep it. When the ban took effect, there were roughly 1.5 million assault weapons in private hands. An estimated 25 million weapons were equipped with large-capacity magazines. The ban expired in 2004. In a 2004 study commissioned by the U.S. Justice Department, researcher Christopher Koper wrote, ""The ban’s exemption of millions of pre-ban assault weapons and large capacity magazines ensured that the effects of the law would occur only gradually."" The point was the 1994 law was hardly an on-off switch for these firearms and magazines. As long as that hardware remained in circulation, people who wanted to use these weapons in a mass shooting would have some opportunity to acquire them. In a 2019 study from New York University’s School of Medicine, a group led by epidemiologist Charles DiMaggio homed in on mass shooting deaths. Researchers define mass shootings in different ways. DiMaggio’s group looked at incidents in which at least four people died. In raw numbers, they found that mass shooting deaths fell during the years of the ban, and rose afterwards. DiMaggio shared his data. Deaths more than tripled in the decade after the ban ended. The decline of 15 deaths between the decade before the ban and the decade during it is modest, but there is a clear and dramatic rise after the ban expired.  The death toll from mass shootings went from an average of 4.8 per year during the ban years to an average of  23.8 per year in the decade afterwards. Many factors drive gun deaths. To help account for those, DiMaggio’s team put mass shooting deaths in terms of the total number of firearm homicides. Viewed that way, they found that between 1994 and 2004, the yearly rate fell by 9 people per 10,000 firearm homicides.  DiMaggio’s study concluded that mass shooting deaths were 70% less likely during the ban.  His isn’t the only study to find that fewer people died in mass shootings when the ban was in effect. In a 2019 article, Louis Klarevas, a Columbia University researcher, and his co-authors found that shootings in which six or more people died were less common and less deadly in the years during the ban. The debate over the value of a ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines often includes Christopher Koper at George Mason University. Koper wrote the 2004 study that gave both sides in the gun control debate supporting material. Recently, Koper has spent more time assessing the role of large-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.  In a 2020 article, Koper wrote that more than the semiautomatic weapons themselves, the latest data ties larger magazines to a rising death toll. The most striking trend, he said, is less about the modest fall in deaths under the ban, and more about the dramatic rise that came when the ban ended. Much of that stems from the firepower that comes from large-capacity magazines. ""Considering that mass shootings with high capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place,"" Koper wrote. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health studied state laws that limit magazine size. Their work linked those laws to a nearly 50% reduction in the rate of fatal mass shootings. On the key policy question of whether the ban drove the decline, DiMaggio urged caution. ""It is pretty much impossible to prove cause and effect,"" he told us when his study came out in 2019. Gun violence researcher Andrew Morral at RAND Corporation, a consulting nonprofit research group, said he and his colleagues don’t see strong evidence that the ban drove down deaths.  On the other hand, ""we also don’t believe there is strong evidence that they were not the cause of any such reductions,"" Morral said. Morral said many studies show that limits on weapons and large-capacity magazines are associated with fewer and less deadly mass shootings. And in the absence of stronger data either way, ""logical considerations"" should guide lawmakers. ""The absence of strong scientific evidence is not a good rationale for taking no action,"" Morral said. Biden said that after passage of ""the assault weapons ban, mass shootings went down. When the law expired, mass shootings tripled."" We last looked at a claim like this in 2019, when Bill Clinton said that after the ban on some types of assault weapons passed, ""there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths."" Biden didn’t go that far, and as such, is a bit more accurate.  A key study backs Biden up. But the reality is millions of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines remained in circulation during the ban, and that makes it hard to tease out the law’s impact.  We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096ECCB00>],/factchecks/2022/may/25/joe-biden/joe-biden-said-mass-shootings-tripled-when-assault/

A recent report put Texas last among states and DC in mental health care access
","During a press conference in Uvalde County, Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said the state needed to focus on mental health and not restricting gun ownership to prevent future mass shootings like the one that happened at Robb Elementary School.  He was jeered by former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who blamed Abbott for the slaying.  ""This is on you,"" said O’Rourke, who is running for governor.  Abbott said Ramos didn’t appear to have a history of mental health problems, but speaking to reporters outside after he was escorted from the building, O’Rourke criticized the state’s mental health care access.  Texas, O’Rourke said, is ""50th in the nation in mental health care access.""  We’ve fact-checked something similar before, back in 2010 when a lieutenant governor candidate said Texas was last in mental health care spending. Back then, the numbers were  close; data published on the Kaiser Family Foundation’s website for fiscal year 2016 put Texas second to last, per capita. That indicator is no longer on the foundation’s site, but it also wasn’t the source that O’Rourke was citing. Gina Hinojosa, an O’Rourke campaign spokesperson, directed us to an annual report on the ""State of Mental Health in America"" by Mental Health America, a nonprofit that advocates for people with mental illness. The report includes a ranking on access to care, which indicates how much access to care exists within a state. This measure considers access to insurance, access to treatment, quality and cost of insurance, access to special education, and mental health workforce availability. In the group’s 2022 report, Texas ranked 51st out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.   ""In Texas, the bottom-ranked state, nearly three-quarters of youth with major depression did not receive mental health treatment,"" Mental Health America tweeted in October 2021, when the report was published.  Mental Health America did acknowledge its report had limitations — including that the report relies on survey data that could be incomplete and was completed in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. We reached out to other groups that might also measure mental health care access but found no such rankings elsewhere.  The Kaiser Family Foundation has never tried to rank states on this measure, said spokesperson Craig Palosky, but it does compile state-by-state data related to mental health.  Looking at adults reporting an unmet need for mental health treatment in the past year during 2019-20, Texas fared relatively well among the top 10 states with the lowest percentage of such adults. Kaiser notes that the sources for this data were analyses of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s restricted online data analysis system, National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2019 and 2020, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive.  O’Rourke said Texas is ""50th in the nation in mental health care access.""  Mental Health America, a nonprofit advocating for people with mental illness, ranked Texas 51st for mental health care access, behind every other state and Washington, D.C. There are some limitations in the data, which Mental Health America acknowledges. We rate that claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A47B440>],/factchecks/2022/may/25/beto-orourke/recent-report-put-texas-last-among-states-and-dc-m/

ICE is not carrying out immigration enforcement in Uvalde after school shooting
","After a gunman killed at least 19 students and two teachers in an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, social media posts claimed that the presence of immigration authorities on scene meant some parents could face deportation if they showed up to the school. One tweet claimed: ""ICE is on the scene of a shooting that took place in a heavily Hispanic school so undocumented parents have to consider arrest deportation before they go check to see if their kids are alive."" The May 24 tweet amassed thousands of likes and retweets within hours. PolitiFact Texas decided to fact-check whether U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were present in Uvalde and whether the tweet was correct about parents being at risk of deportation as they went looking for their children. An ICE spokesperson told PolitiFact that it is not carrying out immigration enforcement in Uvalde. A branch of ICE is there to support the investigations. A May 25 statement from the Department of Homeland Security said Uvalde is a ""protected area,"" which means those agencies do not conduct immigration enforcement there during the emergency event. Examples of protected areas are evacuation routes, sites for sheltering or distributing emergency supplies, or registration sites for disaster-related assistance or reunification of families. DHS also said these agencies will provide emergency assistance regardless of a person’s immigration status. ""To the fullest extent possible, ICE and (Customs and Border Protection) will not conduct immigration enforcement activities there so that individuals, regardless of immigration status, can seek assistance, reunify with family and loved ones, and otherwise address the tragedy that occurred,"" DHS said. CBP’s Border Patrol agents responded to the shooting and provided medical aid, DHS tweeted May 24.  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on May 25 also said that Border Patrol agents and other agencies' officers converged on the classroom to confront the shooter, and that a Border Patrol officer killed the gunman. A tweet claimed that ICE is in Uvalde, Texas, ""so undocumented parents have to consider arrest deportation before they go check to see if their kids are alive."" A branch of ICE is on scene to support the investigation as needed. However, ICE officers who carry out immigration enforcement are not on scene to deport people. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C01E40>],/factchecks/2022/may/25/tweets/ice-not-carrying-out-immigration-enforcement-uvald/
