Gov. John Kasich's boast of rapid problem solving undersells previous administration's work
","
Gov. John Kasich wanted to make a splash.

The swashbuckling Ohio governor wanted to show Ohio’s business community he was serious about his vow to speed up the permitting process at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

Kasich found just such an opportunity when an air pollution permit for an Eastern Ohio energy company, Mingo Junction Energy Center (MJEC), was granted during his first week in office.

At a news conference on his fifth day in office, the Republican governor described the air permit as having ""languished"" under the previous administration and was incredulous that EPA officials had ""held the darn thing up for over 20 months.""

Kasich implied that EPA paper-pushers had been negligent. ""It’s just bureaucracy. It’s a lack of commitment and a lack of vision.""

Kasich praised his new EPA director, Scott Nally, for acting quickly to get the permit issued. ""This is a fact — it was over 20 months they couldn’t get an agreement, he did it in 48 hours,"" Kasich boasted.

PolitiFact Ohio found that claim startling — and just the kind of thing to assess.

We contacted Chris Abbruzzese, the EPA’s director of communications, who said the governor’s characterization was accurate because no agreement had been reached under former Gov. Ted Strickland and in a ""48-hour window"" Nally had managed to work out a deal. He did note that the Strickland administration spent 19 months on the permit, rather than 20, as the governor said.

Abbruzzese said Nally asked Bob Hodanbosi, chief of the Division of Air Pollution Control, top permit writer Mike Hopkins and other staffers to tackle 27 technical issues that remained on the permit request. They whittled that down to just a pair of issues by the close of the business day on Jan 12.

During an hour-long call on the morning of Jan 13, Nally, Hodanbosi, Hopkins and the company’s lawyer Ken Komoroski were able to sort out those last two issues. All that was left that night was for staff attorneys for each side to ""trade documents and get the final language in place,"" according to Abbruzzese.

Next, we looked at what was accomplished on the project under Strickland. An internal memo from Hodanbosi to Nally on Jan. 12  told us that a draft permit was issued in November 2010 following more than 35 weekly conference calls and meetings with the company. The discussions and joint development of the permit by EPA staff and the company concerned exactly how to allow the company to burn coke-oven gas from a steel-making process instead of ""flaring it off"" into the atmosphere.

After receiving comments from the company during the 30-day draft period that lasted until mid-December 2010, the EPA ""revised the final permit twice to try and address their concerns and was ready to issue the final permit"" during Strickland’s last week in office, Hodanbosi wrote.

But the company balked at some of the language in the permit, so it wasn’t issued while Strickland was in office. ""The company responded on Jan. 7, 2011, that they did not want the permit issued as written,"" reads the memo.

Chris Korleski, who preceded Nally as head of the state EPA under Strickland,  said the project was ""almost finished"" and required only a few tweaks.

""The vast bulk of a tremendous amount of work was done already when I left,"" Korleski. The former director said that Kasich had unfairly portrayed his team as indifferent bureaucrats.

""This was not a poster child for anything wrong that Ohio EPA did,"" Korleski said. ""The staff bent over backwards to the point of rushing two sets of orders allowing them to keep operating in the absence of the permit.""

He added: ""They got it worked out on a phone call in an hour? That tells me the issues weren’t terribly complex or terribly difficult.""

Bob Smith, a Maryland attorney and partner with Venable LLP who has three decades of experience working on air pollution permits including some for steel plants and co-generation facilities, had a similar view.

Speaking in general terms, Smith said typically you are ""very close"" to issuing the final permit once the draft permit has been issued, particularly when there aren't any comments (as was the case here) from the public or outside parties to consider.

Smith said having the permit applicant request changes of a draft permit is pretty standard.
""Those kinds of requests are not at all uncommon,"" he said. ""It can take agency personnel a bit of time to digest them,"" he said. He said normally it would take a few weeks or a month to wrap up the process.

Any changes during a final 48-hour period would be ""last-minute fine-tuning to make sure the permit was appropriately clear,"" he said. ""It's a process that only happens at the end of a very long process. A longer time period (than 48 hours) would have been required to deal with the bigger issues.""

So to sum up, there is a sliver of truth to what Kasich said, as more than 19 months had elapsed with no final agreement in place. And the finishing touches to the permit were clearly put on the project by staff being pushed by Nally in the two-day time frame.  

But, given the work that was done during those 19 months, and that the company was the roadblock to the permit being completed while Strickland was still governor, Kasich’s complaint of a ""lack of commitment"" from staffers as the reason for the project taking so long doesn’t ring true.

And, Kasich’s contention at the news conference that ""they couldn’t get an agreement"" for 20 months that Nally got in 48 hours is an oversimplification, particularly since a draft permit was issued in mid-November, and state officials were ready to issue a final permit while Strickland was still in office.

Those are critical facts that would give the listener a different impression of the governor’s statement. That’s why we rate Kasich’s claim to be Barely True.","[('\nGov.

"['Education', 'Wisconsin', 'Rebecca Kleefisch']","
Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch says that U.S. students rank 25th of 29 developing countries in science and math
","
In January 2011, GE Foundation, the philanthropic organization of General Electric Co., gave Milwaukee Public Schools the largest donation it ever received: $20.4 million to improve science and math education.

Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch was among officials who attended an event announcing the five-year gift. She made this comment:

""We know that right now United States students are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math.""

Many leaders have long lamented the science and math performance of U.S. students compared with that of students in other countries.

But we wondered about Kleefisch’s 25th out of 29 comment. It was picked up in a news report by WTMJ-TV and repeated in a blog post on Jan. 26, 2011 on Kleefisch’s website, RebeccaForReal.com.

Kleefisch’s aide, Jeanne Tarantino, said the Republican lieutenant governor based her comment on talking points provided by GE, including one that was similar to what Kleefisch said: ""U.S. students rank 25th out of the 29 developed nations for preparedness in math and science.""

We could see how Kleefisch might have misspoken by saying ""developing"" rather than ""developed"" countries; the U.S. certainly would be in the developed category.

But even at that, does the U.S. really rank near the bottom in science and math?

GE told us the source of its talking points was a U.S. Department of Education summary of the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA, as it is known, is a ranking of 15-year-olds based on international tests. The 2009 results were released in December 2010, about a month before the grant was announced.

Contrary to Kleefisch’s statement, PISA does not do a science-math combination ranking; they do not do a ranking of 29 countries (developed or otherwise); and they do not rank the U.S. 25th in science or math.

We confirmed those points with Holly Xie, author of the Education Department summary.

PISA assesses science and math separately and it does so with two sets of rankings. One is for 34 industrialized countries and the other is for 65 entities -- 60 countries plus five other educational systems.

So how does the U.S. rank?

According to the Education Department summary: 
 So, in science, the U.S. ranked in the top half of industrialized countries and even higher in the larger group. 
In the larger group of 65, Shanghai-China ranked first and the U.S. tied for 24th.

So, in math, the U.S. ranked in the lower half of industrialized countries and much better in the larger group.

Let’s review.

Kleefisch said U.S. students ""are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math."" We assume she meant ""developed"" rather than ""developing"" countries. But her point was that U.S. students ranked near the bottom in science and math.

The test results cited, however, do not include a science-math combination ranking. What they show is the U.S. ranks in the top half of industrialized countries in science; in math, it’s in the lower half, but not near the bottom. 
Indeed, after we requested additional information from GE, the company told us Feb. 4, 2011, that it erred in saying the U.S. ranks 25th of 29 countries in science and math. 
We rate Kleefisch’s statement False.","[('\nRebeccaForReal.com, GE Foundation to support MPS, Jan. 26, 2011\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, MPS awarded $20 million grant, Jan. 19, 2011\n\nWTMJ-TV, GE Foundation gives $20 million grant to MPS, Jan. 19, 2011\n\nOnMilwaukee.com, GE Foundation gives MPS $20.4 million, Jan. 19, 2011\n\nGeneral Electric Co. news release, Jan. 19, 2011\n\nJSOnline.com, International test results reignite ‘how do we compare’ game, Dec. 8, 2010\n\nU.S. Department of Education, Highlights from PISA 2009, December 2010\n\nE-mail interview, U.S. Department of Education project officer/statistician Holly Xie, Feb. 3, 2011\n\nE-mail interview, General Electric Co. spokesman Frank Mantero, Feb. 3, 2011', 'http://www.rebeccaforreal.com/')]",/factchecks/2011/feb/06/rebecca-kleefisch/wisconsin-lt-gov-rebecca-kleefisch-says-us-student/
"['Environment', 'Texas', 'Michael Sullivan']","
Michael Sullivan says Texas Forest Service planted 6,000 trees in Dallas-Fort Worth area before Super Bowl for unknown reason at unknown cost
","
Super Bowls often have off-the-field twists.

On Feb. 3, conservative activist Michael Quinn Sullivan of Austin arched his brow about preparations for Super Bowl XLV, set for Sunday in Cowboys Stadium, writing in a Twitter post: ""Your Texas Forest Service planted 6,000 trees in (Dallas/Fort Worth) area in advance of Super Bowl. Cost? Unknown. Why? Same. ""

Asked to elaborate, Sullivan replied via Twitter that he’d learned of the trees from a Capitol newsletter, Texas Insider. Its Feb. 3 edition includes an item stating the forest service plans to help the bowl go smoothly by mobilizing an incident management team. It closes: ""In addition, the agency prepared for the coming deluge of tourists by planting more than 6,000 trees in Arlington and surrounding cities.""

Really?

By e-mail, a service spokeswoman, April Saginor, told us the agency put $50,000 toward planting trees in a dozen North Texas host cities, which we later identified as Addison, Arlington, Dallas, Denton, Farmers Branch, Fort Worth, Frisco, Grapevine, Irving, Lewisville, Plano and Richardson. The idea, Saginor said, was to partner with the NFL, the Texas Trees Foundation and other agencies ""to lessen environmental impacts of hosting the Super Bowl and improve the environment and quality of life in the area.""

A service press release quotes Jack Groh, director of the NFL’s environmental program, saying his agency has been facilitating environmental projects for Super Bowl host cities for 17 years. ""This was the most extensive urban forestry project ever in the history"" of such Super Bowl projects, Groh said. ""This had more of a reach and more of an impact than we’ve ever had.""

In interviews, Groh and Janette Monear, executive director of the Dallas-rooted trees foundation, told us more than 6,500 trees were planted this past year in public spaces and near schools. Monear said the forest service’s $50,000 grant, consisting of federal aid, was matched by private donations gathered by the foundation.

Groh told  us the trees ""actually do something for the local climate, whether it’s reducing pollution"" by absorbing carbon dioxide ""or lowering the temperature a little bit with shade.""

Given how quickly we were able to track down such details, we wondered if the tree project was ""unknown"" to denizens of the host cities.

Democratic activist Phillip Martin of Austin, who poked at Sullivan’s Twitter message the night it launched, guided us to a Jan. 13 Fort Worth Star-Telegram news article previewing an Arlington luncheon, emceed by Cowboys’ great Drew Pearson, celebrating the plantings.

And on Jan. 21, our online search showed, the Dallas Morning News published a news article quoting Groh and Arlington Mayor Richard Cluck, who said: ""There are so many advantages to having the Super Bowl in your town ... and one of the big ones is the environmental program. There’s nothing more important to me, and it should be to you, to grow our tree population.""

The Dallas newspaper said in a Jan. 28 news article that the tree plantings are expected to touch off other planting programs. The story says the foundation ""already has a deal with the city of Richardson to plant 50,000 trees, and this spring, the group will launch an initiative to put 3 million trees in North Texas soil.""

The story quotes Monear as saying: ""It’s a legacy project. This growth is going to benefit the region for many years.""

So, 6,000 trees planted, as Sullivan says? That’s about right.

At an unknown cost? For an unknown purpose? Not so, times two. Besides, ""your Forest Service,"" as Sullivan puts it, didn’t plant the trees by its lonesome. Moreover, half the expenses were covered by private donations.

Gorman says illegal immigrants cost Rhode Island $400 million annually
","
There's been a lot of debate over the cost of illegal immigration, both nationally and to individual states. Terry Gorman, president of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, believes he knows the price tag for Rhode Island. And it’s big. 
During an appearance on the Jan. 6 Helen Glover Show on WHJJ radio, Gorman stated that ""illegal aliens cost the state of Rhode Island $400 million a year.""

We wondered if Gorman's number was accurate.

In an interview with PolitiFact, he broke the costs down into four categories: Incarceration, education, Medicaid and hospital care. We’ll examine each individually.

INCARCERATION

This is the easiest category to deal with because there’s reliable data. It’s also the only one where Gorman is even close.

Gorman used three numbers to conclude that Rhode Island pays $7.2 million a year to keep illegal immigrants in prison. He said there were about 200 illegal immigrants incarcerated, at an annual cost of $43,000 per prisoner.

He multiplied those two numbers and then subtracted $1.2 million -- the amount he said the federal government pays the state to help cover the cost of their imprisonment. (The actual total is $7.4 million.)

We confirmed that annual cost (now $43,252) and the latest federal payment ($1 million) but discovered that the 200 number was a bit high. In 2010, the average quarterly count was 168, not all of whom turned out to be here illegally.

Gorman's total: $7.2 million. Our total: $6.2 million. That’s as close as he got.

In the other categories, Gorman's numbers quickly fell apart.

EDUCATION

Gorman says it costs the state $239 million a year to educate illegal immigrant children and children of illegal immigrants.

To determine whether that number is accurate, you have to know how many illegal immigrant children there are and what the per-pupil cost of educating them is.

That’s not as easy as it sounds, because finding reliable data is difficult.

First, let’s consider the number of children.

Gorman says the Census Bureau estimated that in 2004 there were 8,740 illegal immigrant children and children of illegal immigrants in Rhode Island.

No it didn't.

The Census Bureau told us there was no such count of illegal immigrant children in 2004, or any other year. ""That's not something we collect,"" said spokesman Thomas Edwards.

The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey does estimate the number of foreign-born children age 5 to 17. In 2009, that number was about 7,070.

Using data from the survey, we calculated that about 4,700 of those were not naturalized U.S. citizens. That’s more than 4,000 fewer than Gorman’s number.

And that number includes foreign-born children whose parents are in the country legally, such as youngsters whose parents were granted asylum.

So we looked for other ways to determine how many of those 4,700 children were here illegally.

The Census Bureau estimated that in 2009 there were 133,458 foreign-born people in Rhode Island in 2009. The bureau doesn’t count how many of those are here illegally.

So we contacted the Department of Homeland Security, which offers estimates of the number of ""unauthorized immigrants"" in the United States. But DHS spokesman Michael Hoefer told us ""we only provide estimates for the larger states due to uncertainty in the precision for smaller states.""

Looking for some way to zero in on Rhode Island, we looked at DHS data for two of those larger states, which, like Rhode Island, are both urban and in the Northeast: New York and New Jersey.

The DHS estimated in 2009 that 3.3 percent of the population of those states was in the U.S. illegally. Applying the same rate to Rhode Island's population -- a big assumption -- would give us about 35,000 unauthorized immigrants.

Then, just last week, the Pew Hispanic Center issued a report estimating that there were roughly 30,000 illegal immigrants in Rhode Island in 2010.

The key question: what percentage of those are school-age children?

Let’s go back to the Census Bureau estimate of 133,458 foreign born people in Rhode Island. If 30,000 (the Pew number) or 35,000 (the DHS number) are illegal immigrants, that’s about 22 to 26 percent.

Apply those percentages to the total number of foreign-born children in Rhode Island age 5 to 17 years -- which, remember, the Census pegged at 7,070 --  and you get 1,589 to 1,854 school age children.

That's about one fifth of Gorman's 8,740 figure.

OK. So now that we have a more accurate number of children, how much does it cost to educate them?

Gorman says the price is $23,000 per child. Plus, he reasoned, 20 percent of those students would need special education, including English instruction. For those students, he adds another $22,000.

But the Rhode Island Department of Education told us the statewide average per-pupil cost for 2009, the latest for which complete data are available, is $14,186 per student -- which includes special education, English instruction and other special programs like career and technical education.

So Gorman’s per-pupil cost is off by nearly $9,000. Even if we accept his special education cost estimate and assumed that every child needs extra English language instruction, the total would be no higher than $40 million to $47 million.

That’s not even close to $239 million.

MEDICAID COSTS

Gorman asserts that 35 percent of the money spent on Medicaid and RIteCare -- programs that provide health care to low-income people -- goes to illegal immigrants or the children of illegal immigrants. His estimate of that cost: $125 million.

He said he based his claim on a 2005 Providence Journal story that talked about how much of the RIteCare budget goes to ""undocumented clients.""

But we were unable to find any such story in our database.

And David Burnett, associate director of the state’s Office of Health and Human Services, said the only undocumented people covered by Medicaid are 350 pregnant women currently covered by the RIteCare program through a special plan funded by the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). That's a tiny fraction -- less than three-tenths of a percent -- of the state's 121,000 RIteCare enrollees.

Not even close to 35 percent.

According to Burnett, the state’s Medicaid budget is $1.7 billion; RiteCare makes up $602 million of that total. Two thirds of that is federal money, according to Linda Katz, co-founder of The Poverty Institute. So Rhode Island's share of RIteCare is about $201 million.

And 0.289 percent of $201 million is $579,926, which brings the state's RIteCare cost for pregnant illegal immigrants down to under $600,000.

What about children of illegal immigrants who were born here? Those children are citizens and the state does not track them in a separate category. As a result, those costs are unknown.

Gorman's estimate: $125 million. Our estimate: less than $600,000, plus the unknown cost of those U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants.

FREE HOSPITAL CARE

Finally, we looked at Gorman's estimate that half the money the state gives local hospitals to cover the costs of uncompensated care is spent treating illegal immigrants. (Hospitals are required to treat people regardless of their ability to pay.)

He says the hospitals get $139 million a year. Half of that would be $69.5 million.

The last state payment to the hospitals was actually $127 million, according to Michael Souza, vice president for finance at the Hospital Association of Rhode Island.

But the state only paid out $60 million; the rest was federal money.

How much of that uncompensated care goes to illegal immigrants?

Nobody knows.

Gorman says his source is a hospital translator who appeared on a public access cable show in 2010. He declined to name the source but said, ""We stand by our figures.""

The hospital association says hospitals don't even collect that data.

""Patients are not required to provide SSN or even green card numbers if they have them,"" said Gail Leach Carvelli, media relations for Lifespan, a consortium of five Rhode Island hospitals. ""It’s entirely optional. So to even try to put a percentage around it would be misleading.""

So Gorman says uncompensated care for illegal immigrants costs the state $70 million a year. But the state is paying out only $60 million for all uncompensated care.

Even if he is correct that half the money goes to illegal immigrants -- and at this point, needless to say, we have our doubts -- that's $30 million, not $70 million.

IN SUMMARY . . .

We recognize that illegal immigrants impose a cost to the state, and there are costs that Gorman did not include, such as the added burden on law enforcement.

At the same time, he ignores mitigating factors, such as the taxes -- particularly sales taxes -- that even illegal immigrants pay to the state.

The $400 million figure he repeatedly cites sounds authoritative. But three of his four categories are based on numbers that are outdated, grossly inflated or have no documentation.

Thus, the inflammatory assertion that illegal immigrants drain the state of $400 million a year -- $400 for every man, woman and child in Rhode Island -- is ridiculously high.

And because inflammatory, ridiculous assertions qualify for our worst rating, we rule Pants On Fire!","[('\n920WHJJ.com, ""Helen Glover Show 1-6-10 8am,"" accessed Jan. 19, 2011\n\nFairUS.org, ""The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers,"" Federation for American Immigration Reform, July 2010, accessed Jan. 19, 2011\n\nPolitiFact.com, ""Vern Buchanan says illegal immigration costs Florida taxpayers $4 billion a year,"" Dec. 6, 2010\n\nInterviews and e-mail, Terry Gorman, president of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, Jan. 19, 25 and 26, 2011\n\nInterview and e-mail, Ellen Evans Alexander, assistant director for administration, Rhode Island Department of Corrections, Jan. 25 and Feb. 3, 2011\n\nInterview, Thomas Edwards, spokesman, U.S. Census Bureau, Jan. 20, 2011', 'http://a1135.g.akamai.net/f/1135/18227/1h/cchannel.download.akamai.com/18227/podcast/PROVIDENCE-RI/WHJJ-AM/helen%201-6-10%208am.mp3?CPROG=PCAST&MARKET=PROVIDENCE-RI&NG_FORMAT=&SITE_ID=1160&STATION_ID=WHJJ-AM&PCAST_AUTHOR=Helen_Glover_Show&PCAST_CAT=Talk&PCAST_TITLE=Helen_Glover_Show'), ('\nCensus.gov, ""Place of birth by age in the United States: Rhode Island,"" U.S. Census Bureau, accessed Jan.20, 2011', 'No link'), ('\nCensus.gov, ""Rhode Island data on citizenship status by sex and age,"" U.S. Census Bureau, accessed Jan. 20, 2011\n\nE-mail, Michael Hoefer, spokesman, Department of Homeland Security, Jan. 21, 2011\n\nDHS.gov, ""Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: January 2009,"" Department of Homeland Security, January 2010, accessed Jan. 20, 2011\n\nPewHispanic.org, ""Unauthorized Immigrant Population: National and State Trends, 2010,"" Feb. 1, 2011, accessed Feb. 3, 2011\n\nWww.Infoworks.RIDE.URI.edu, ""English Language Learners - Access for ELLs,"" accessed Jan. 26, 2011\n\nInterview and e-mails, Elliot Krieger, spokesman, Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Jan. 20 and 21, 2011\n\nInfoWorks.RIDE.URI.edu, ""Equity and Adequacy of Resources: Per-pupil Expenditures,"" Infoworks, accessed Jan. 21, 2011\n\nInterview and e-mail, David Burnett, associate director, Rhode Island Office of Health and Human Services, Jan. 21, 2011\n\nInterview and e-mail, Fred Sneesby, spokesman, Rhode Island Office of Health and Human Services, Feb. 1, 2011\n\nInterview, Linda Katz, The Poverty Institute, Jan. 21 and Feb. 1, 2011\n\nPolitiFact.com, ""Palumbo says R.I. gives undocumented pregnant women free health insurance and hundreds of dollars for food and other expenses,"" Sept. 19, 2010\n\nInterview, Michael Souza, vice president for finance, Hospital Association of Rhode Island, Jan. 24, 2011\n\nE-mail, Gail Leach Carvelli, media relations manager, Lifespan, Jan. 28, 2011', 'http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&-state=dt&-context=dt&-ds_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_&-CONTEXT=dt&-mt_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G2000_B06001&-tree_id=309&-redoLog=true&-_caller=geoselect&-geo_id=04000US44&-geo_id=NBSP&-search_results=01000US&-format=&-_lang=en&-SubjectID=18599050')]",/factchecks/2011/feb/06/terry-gorman/gorman-says-illegal-immigrants-cost-rhode-island-4/
"['Ohio', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'State Budget', 'William G. Batchelder']","
Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder doubles the trouble the state has for inmates returning to prison
","
Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder shares the burden with fellow Republican and Gov. John Kasich of filling Ohio’s massive budget hole. And like Kasich, Batchelder believes the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction is a prime target for savings.

Specifically, both have talked up reforming sentencing laws to keep more non-violent criminals out of state prisons, which costs millions and unnecessarily adds to an already overcrowded prison system. Ohio’s prisons are currently at 133 percent capacity.

Democratic former Gov. Ted Strickland also supported sentencing reform. But Strickland lacked the political muscle to push it through the Republican-controlled Ohio Senate, which didn’t openly support giving some criminals a pass from prison.

Republicans in the Senate now like the idea, so says Batchelder, who predicts reform will ""pass both houses very early in the session.""
     
He made the statement during a Jan. 4 interview on WCPN 90.3 FM’s ""Sound of Ideas"" radio program. He also said reducing the number of ex-cons who return to prison is critical to any reform effort.

""I think it’s important also from the stand point of getting (prisoners) back into society, so we are not always faced constantly with recidivism, which is a big problem in the penitentiary today – in the 70 to 80 percent range.""

Reducing the recidivism rate has long been a goal of ODRC, so PolitiFact Ohio set out to check Batchelder’s claim, which suggests the prisons system is doing a lousy job of rehabilitating criminals.

ODRC tracks the number of released prisoners who return to prison within one, two and three years after incarceration. The latest data available shows that among the 27,482 prisoners released in calendar year 2006, 36.44 percent returned within 3 years for parole and other technical violations or for committing new crimes.

The 2006 three-year recidivism rate is down from a 16-year high of 39.01 percent in 2001.

The 2007 recidivism rate will be available in a few months, says ODRC communications chief Carlo LoParo.

Batchelder didn’t cite the source of the recidivism rate when he spoke on the radio program. His spokesman, Mike Dittoe, said the line is supported by the February 2011 prison study by the Council of State Governments Justice Center called ""Justice Reinvestment in Ohio: Policy Framework to Reduce Corrections Spending and Reinvest in Strategies that Can Reduce Crime.""

That report contains a line, Dittoe says, that reads ""One study found that over a period of three years after their release from prison … 70 percent of the individuals placed in the high-risk group were re-arrested.""  

Dittoe said this re-affirms Batchelder’s claim. The line in the study, he says is footnoted to two earlier studies: ""Creation and Validation of the Ohio Risk Assessment System: Final Report"" and ""Understanding the Risk Principle: How and Why Correctional Interventions Can Harm Low-Risk Offenders.""

But there’s a problem with that line. It is specifically referring to inmates identified as being at ""high risk"" for recidivism. And when we looked at the report we found another rate listed in the previous sentence: 10 percent for inmates deemed as ""low risk.""  

So, where does this put Batchelder’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter?
  
Batchelder and the ODRC may be in agreement that lowering recidivism is important. And as speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, what Batchelder thinks will go a long way toward setting the agenda in the lower chamber of the General Assembly.

But his claim that recidivism ""is a big problem in the penitentiary today – in the 70 to 80 percent range"" isn’t even close. And to cite as support a misapplied figure from a report that didn’t exist when he made the statement is ridiculous.

That’s why we rate his statement as Pants on Fire.","[('\nInterview with Carlo LoParo, chief of communications, Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, Feb. 1, 2011\n\nWCPN 90.3 FM, the ""Sound of Ideas,"" interview with William G.

Texas Sen. Leticia Van de Putte says 10 nuns in Indiana were barred from voting in 2008 primary
","
Battling a proposal requiring Texas voters to present photo IDs at the polls, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte suggested that Indiana’s photo-ID law had disenfranchised 10 elderly nuns. 
In remarks on the Senate floor, Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, said Jan. 25: ""In South Bend, Indiana, 10 retired nuns were barred from voting in the 2008 Indiana Democratic primary. Some of them were in their 80s and 90s. ... These nuns were not able to (vote) because they did not have an ID."" 
The Texas legislation soon cleared the Senate. Still, to quote Van de Putte, we wondered: ""What happened to these nuns?"" 
Responding to Van de Putte’s claim was Jerry Bonnet, chief legal counsel for the Indiana secretary of state, who was on the Senate floor to give testimony about Indiana’s experience with its law requiring that voters at the polls have a photo ID that was issued by the state or federal government. ""It’s my understanding ... the nuns did have passports; they did have a form of ID that was acceptable,"" Bonnet said. ""But they refused to present that. They were eligible for other exceptions under the law, absentee voting exceptions, and it was really a media event because the media had been brought to the scene before. And they also refused to vote provisionally."" 
Under Indiana’s law, upheld in state and federal courts since taking effect in 2005, a voter without an acceptable photo ID may cast a provisional ballot that will be counted if the person presents authorities with acceptable identification within 10 days. According to the Indiana secretary of state’s website, an Indiana driver license, state photo ID, military ID or U.S. passport is usually sufficient. 
The law also allows some voters — including those at least 65 years old — to cast absentee ballots by mail. A photo ID is not required in those instances. 
Answering our request for information on the nuns, Van de Putte spokeswoman Sarah Gomez pointed us to two May 2008 news articles, including one by The Associated Press, which reported that nuns from Saint Mary’s Convent in South Bend ""were turned away from a polling place by a fellow nun because they didn’t have state or federal identification bearing a photograph."" They had been told they would need such an ID to vote, the article says, but ""the nuns, all in their 80s or 90s, didn’t get one but came to the precinct anyway."" Some showed up with outdated passports, according to the story. 
During the Senate hearing, Van de Putte balked at Bonnet’s suggestion that the dust-up was a media event: ""You’re saying that this was orchestrated by these devious nuns to actually (provoke) Indiana law and really, they intended to mess you up purposefully?"" 
""Yes,"" Bonnet said. 
Bonnet later told us that he’d learned from media reports that some of the nuns toted passports to the polling place. However, he wrote in a Jan. 27 letter to Van de Putte that the nuns ""may not have had valid photo IDs."" 
May not or did not? In a Feb. 3 e-mail to us, Bonnet said his ""understanding"" was that some of the nuns ""presented themselves for in-person voting"" without any acceptable ID. 
Bonnet also noted other ways that any of the nuns could have voted without showing a photo ID, including by casting a provisional ballot at the polling place and signing a document at the county election office within 10 days swearing that she was indigent. Indigency is one exception to Indiana’s photo-ID requirement. 
Bonnet also said the nuns were entitled to receive a free state-issued photo ID. Graig Lubsen, deputy communications director for the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, told us that on election day Hoosiers can go to one of the agency’s offices to obtain a temporary version of the ID that can be used at the polls. 
At the time of the 2008 primary, Indiana residents seeking the state IDs were required to show four different documents, including at least one ""primary"" document such as a birth certificate or a passport, plus proof of a Social Security number and Indiana residency. 
Asked why the nuns had not cast provisional ballots, Bonnet cited the AP story, which quotes Sister Julie McGuire, a poll worker, saying that it would be impossible to get the nuns to a state motor vehicle office within the 10-day deadline. ""You have to remember that some of these ladies don't walk well,"" McGuire was quoted as saying. ""They're in wheelchairs or on walkers or electric carts."" 
The day after the May 6 primary, McGuire told the South Bend Tribune: ""They wanted to vote. It was heartbreaking for all of us."" 
The Tribune story said a request to interview some of the nuns was turned down. 
Bonnet told us that the state did not initially investigate the incident because no complaint was filed. However, he said it reappeared in a lawsuit filed in state court in June 2008 challenging Indiana’s voter ID law, which was upheld last year by the Indiana Supreme Court. 
In their suit, the League of Women Voters of Indiana said the photo ID law had prevented ""an indeterminate number of citizens … from casting a vote that counts."" The incident involving the Saint Mary’s nuns was among the examples. In its June 30 opinion, the Indiana Supreme Court stated that none of the allegations made by the league ""creates any basis for a declaration that the state may not require any voters to identify themselves at the polls using photo ID. Some of these allegations, if substantiated, may entitle specific voters to more tailored relief, but none has been sought in the plaintiffs' complaint."" 
Next, we reached Amy Smessaert, a spokeswoman for the convent, who told us in an e-mail that 10 nuns in their 80s and 90s tried to vote in the May 2008 primary. She said none had ""a valid government-issued picture ID."" 
The nuns knew about the ID law, Smessaert said, but ""a few didn’t understand that their ID did not meet the requirements."" She said one nun had an expired passport that was not accepted. Smessaert said she doesn’t know what kinds of ID the other nuns brought because the convent didn’t keep a record of that. More than 100 retired nuns were eligible to vote, she said, and many had done so earlier by absentee mail-in ballot. 
Smessaert said that while ""the option to vote by provisional ballot was available"" to the sisters who lacked acceptable ID, none chose to do so. She said she didn’t know why. ""The sisters are U.S. citizens and have the right to vote,"" she said. ""The manner in which each sister votes is a personal decision."" 
""This situation was in no way a publicity stunt nor was there anything devious about it,"" she said. 
Smessaert said that several of the nuns who were unable to vote have since died and that the others couldn’t be interviewed because of health reasons. 
So, were the nuns barred from voting, as Van de Putte says? 
According to media reports and a spokeswoman for Saint Mary’s convent, the elderly nuns were barred from casting a regular ballot because they lacked proper identification. But they were not barred from voting in another way, such as casting provisional ballots — though their votes wouldn’t have counted unless the sisters took additional steps to meet state qualifications.

Sen. Ron Wyden says Americans spend more than 6 billion hours and $160 billion to comply with federal tax laws
","
Everyone tries to quantify pain, whatever its form or cause. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health use a scale of zero to 10, with zero meaning pain free and seven through 10 reflecting ""severe"" to ""disabling"" pain.

We’re not immune from it either here at PolitiFact, where we rate statements on a six-step scale from blissfully True to a full-out, Pants on Fire ridiculous lie.

So it’s not surprising that politicians try it as well, especially on complicated topics like tax reform. Putting things in an easy-to-understand - and stark - manner is often the difference between building support and quietly fading away.

Which is why Sen. Ron Wyden said this on Jan. 24, 2011: ""Americans spend 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax law. It costs us $163 billion to comply with our tax laws annually.""

That’s a lot of time and money -- and pain. It’s also something people of all walks of life can relate to since just about everybody fills out a tax form and almost everybody dislikes it.

But is it true?

Wyden hopes so since it’s a key element in promoting his plan for simplifying the tax code. To push his plan Wyden is building a case that would appear easy to win - the tax code is too complicated, to bulky and dense, and hard for even smart people to negotiate by themselves.

There’s plenty of data to support the idea.

According to the Internal Revenue Service itself, the tax code today is 3.8 million words compared to 1.4 million in 2001.

You want pain? Here’s some more.

The code now comprises 25 volumes and takes up nine feet of shelf space, the IRS reports. It’s also a full-employment plan. Two companies publish newsletters daily that report on new developments in the field of taxation; the print editions often run 50 pages to 100 pages.

Had enough?

There’s plenty more, including proof of what Wyden says - it’s complicated. ""Ninety-percent of taxpayers rely on preparers or tax software packages"" to do their returns, the IRS says. The agency also suggests that those bold souls who venture out alone might want to reconsider: ""The IRS (help line) received 110 million calls in each of the last two fiscal years. That is a staggering number, and not surprisingly, the IRS was unable to answer more than 25 percent of them.""

So it’s complicated. But Wyden’s comment is a whole new order of hardship since 6.1 billion hours translates to 695,870 years. That’s a lot of time, averaging 44 hours for every completed tax return.

It’s huge but it’s also correct.

The 2010 report from the National Taxpayer Advocate, the official - and independent - ombudsman for the IRS crunched the numbers for the 2008 tax year, which is the most recent year for which data is available.

""U.S. taxpayers and businesses spend about 6.1 billion hours a year complying with the filing requirements of the Internal Revenue code and that figure does not include the millions of additional hours that taxpayers must spend when they are required to respond to IRS notices or audits,"" the NTA reported.

It also agreed with the cost. The Advocate’s office ""estimates that the costs of complying with the individual and corporate income tax requirements for 2008 amounted to $163 billion – or a staggering 11 percent of aggregate income tax receipts.""

That’s good enough for us. As Tax Day approaches, we rate this claim True.

Glenn Beck on al-Qaida links to Muslim Brotherhood
","As Americans watch the Egyptian uprising from afar, politicians and pundits have speculated about whether the Muslim Brotherhood, an opposition group, will gain power.

On his radio show on Jan. 31, Glenn Beck said listeners should know that conspirators of the 9/11 attacks were part of the group.

""So the Muslim Brotherhood, they're nothing to worry about,"" Beck began sarcastically.

""Abdullah Azzam and Muhammad Qutb, they taught in Saudi Arabia,"" Beck said. ""…Their star student? Osama bin Laden.""

""Then, from the Egyptian Brotherhood, you have (Ayman) al-Zawahiri,"" a prominent leader of al-Qaida, he said.

""And another star pupil that has come out of the Muslim Brotherhood? Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,"" Beck said, referring to the al-Qaida leader described in the 9/11 Commission Report as ""the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks.""

The Muslim Brotherhood, the largest opposition movement in Egypt, seeks to establish an Islamic state governed by sharia or Islamic law. It's true that many al-Qaida members, and 9/11 conspirators specifically, can trace their roots through the Muslim Brotherhood at one time. But the two groups are now bitter rivals. While the Muslim Brotherhood has evolved into a group that says it seeks a gradual and peaceful path to power, al-Qaida has pursued a violent holy war. The Muslim Brotherhood has repeatedly denounced al-Qaida, and vice versa.

In an article titled ""Don't Fear Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood,"" Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution wrote that ""The Egyptian Brotherhood renounced violence years ago, but its relative moderation has made it the target of extreme vilification by more radical Islamists. Al Qaida’s leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri, started their political lives affiliated with the Brotherhood but both have denounced it for decades as too soft and a cat’s paw of Mubarak and America.""

Dan Byman, an expert on the groups at the Brookings Institution, said they have some common goals such as support for a political identity with Islam. But some of the more militant members of the Muslim Brotherhood have moved on to join al-Qaida, believing that the Muslim Brotherhood isn't doing enough, Byman said.

The biggest question, Byman said, is whether the Muslim Brotherhood is a barrier to the violent extremism of al-Qaida or whether it is simply a farm team.

Byman believes it's probably a little bit of both.

Beck is technically correct that many al-Qaida terrorists were once members of the Muslim Brotherhood, said Evan Kohlmann, a terrorism expert who consults for the Department of Justice, ""Unfortunately, this analogy is a bit like saying that the Boy Scouts are a paramilitary organization because a certain percentage of them later go on to enlist in the U.S. military.""

""Here's the deal on the Brotherhood: they aren't exactly in sync with U.S. foreign policy interests, and they do admittedly continue to work with armed groups that have violent aims, like Hamas in Gaza for instance,"" Kohlman told us via e-mail. ""Nonetheless, there is no doubt that the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood is an avowed enemy of Osama Bin Laden, and vice versa.  The Brotherhood repeatedly makes that point clear on its own website -- and  for its part, al-Qaida has issued numerous audio and video recordings from its senior leadership (including Bin Laden and Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri) accusing the Brotherhood of adopting reviled democratic methods and of 'collaboration with the nation's enemies.'""


Now, the specifics on the al-Qaida members.

Osama Bin Laden -- According to the book Through Our Enemies' Eyes: Osama bin Laden Radical Islam and the Future of America by Michael Scheuer, bin Laden was heavily influenced by two Muslim Brotherhood leaders  -- Abdullah Azzam and Muhammad Qutb -- when he was a student at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in the late 1970s. Scheuer writes that bin Laden's ""faith was made more assertive"" by these scholars. Star pupil? Undetermined, but we'll allow Beck some hyperbole.

Ayman al-Zawahiri -- Although many biographies and news articles claim Dr. al-Zawahiri -- often described now as the number two in al-Qaida -- was briefly a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in his early teens, that's a matter of some debate.

When Germany's Der Spiegel reported in a July 2, 2007, story ""Charting the Rise of the Muslim Brotherhood,"" that al- Zawahiri ""is now considered the textbook example of a member of the Muslim Brotherhood turned terrorist,"" the Muslim Brotherhood protested. The group issued a public rejection of the claim that al-Zawahiri has ever been affiliated with it. Dr. Mohamed Morsy, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood Executive Bureau, said al-Zawahiri had never been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and has never conformed to the group's ideology.

""The Muslim Brotherhood's ideology shuns violence and the movement has never practiced it,"" Morsy said. ""On the contrary we have been always adopting peaceful means for change.""

Kohlmann, a terrorism analyst with New York-based security consultancy Flashpoint Global Partners who monitors jihadist websites, pointed to comments al-Zawahiri made in an open online question-and-answer session hosted by several al-Qaida-affiliated websites in 2008.

According to al-Zawahiri, ""the freedom which the Brotherhood and other groups enjoy these days is only due to the military activities... But, instead of thanking the mujihadeen -- or at least not speaking ill of  them--they have presented themselves as a mutually-agreeable alternative  to America and its agents, to insult and to defame the mujahideen...They should make an effort to improve the image of their organization after all the miserable situations in which they have become entangled -- much as pledging allegiance to Hosni Mubarak and their silence while their brothers entered Kabul and Baghdad on the backs of Christian tanks.""

Al-Zawahiri also repeatedly and pointedly criticized the Muslim Brotherhood in his book, The Bitter Harvest.

And in addition to the Muslim Brotherhood roundly denying that al-Zawahiri was ever a member, al-Zawahiri himself has ""vigorously and indignantly contested allegations that he was ever affiliated with the Brotherhood in Egypt,"" Kohlmann said. ""So the idea that Zawahiri has anything to do with the Brotherhood is pretty much a total canard.""

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- For him, we refer to the 9/11 Commission Report, page 145, which states, ""Raised in a religious family, KSM claims to have joined the Muslim Brotherhood at age 16 and to have become enamored of violent jihad at youth camps in the desert.""

So Beck is right that many 9/11 conspirators have come out of, or once ascribed to the teachings of, the Muslim Brotherhood -- including Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed for sure, while the case for al-Zawahiri is less clear. But Beck's comments ignore the sharply different approaches of the two groups. Each has disavowed the other, and each has charted a different path to power (at least publicly).

""The real question -- what the Brotherhood is -- is very much an open question,"" Byman said. ""In Egypt, in a way, we don't know. It's hard to know what part of its rhetoric to believe.""

But by failing to even mention the divide between the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida, Beck has left out key context in his history lesson, and so we rate his statement Half True.","[('Council on Foreign Relations, ""Egypt\'s Muslim Brotherhood,"" by Jayshree Bajoria, Feb. 3, 2011\n\nBrookings Institution, ""Don\'t Fear Egypt\'s Muslim Brotherhood,"" by Bruce Riedel, Jan. 28, 2011\n\nIkhwanweb, the Muslim Brotherhood\'s Official English website, ""Islam can not always be blamed,"" by Marwan Bishara, Jan. 19, 2010\n\nSpiegel Online, ""Charting the Rise of the Muslim Brotherhood,"" July 3, 2007\n\nIkhwanweb, ""Ayman Al-Zawahiri No MB Member: Leader,"" July 6, 2007\n\nThe 9/11 Commission Report\n\nThe Weekly Standard, ""The Muslim Brotherhood is No Friend,"" by Thomas Joscelyn, Jan. 28, 2011\n\nThe NEFA Foundation, Statement Quoting Muslim Brotherhood Executive Bureau Member Mahmud Ghozlan Criticizing Bin Laden Tape, Released on Dec. 30, 2007\n\nHuffington Post, ""The Muslim Brotherhood Bogeyman,"" by Scott Atran, Feb. 3, 2011\n\nThe Washington Post, ""Egyptian Opposition Group Changes Course; Muslim Brotherhood Now Pushing for Reform,"" by Daniel Williams, June 5, 2005\n\nInterview with Dan Byman of the the Brookings Institution, Feb. 3, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Evan Kohlmann, a terrorism analyst with New York-based security consultancy Flashpoint Global Partners, Feb. 3, 2011', 'http://www.cfr.org/africa/egypts-muslim-brotherhood/p23991')]",/factchecks/2011/feb/04/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-al-qaeda-links-muslim-brotherhood/

Rand Paul says Israel's per capita income ""is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world.""
","
House Republicans have released a plan to cut the budget, but Rand Paul says they need to cut even more.

House GOP leaders proposed cuts of $58 billion per year. Paul, a Republican senator from Kentucky and a tea party favorite, has a plan that cuts $500 billion.

Paul's plan includes cutting all foreign aid, including about $3 billion in annual aid to Israel. Cutting aid to Israel has got some of his fellow conservatives unhappy, but Paul isn't backing down.

""I'm not singling out Israel. I'm a supporter of Israel,"" Paul said. ""I want to be known as a friend of Israel, but you can't give money you don't have. We can't just borrow from our kids' future and give it to countries, even if they are our friends.""

Paul added that, ""They're an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world. Should we be giving free money or welfare to a rich nation? I don't think so.""

Paul added that Israel has defense capabilities already that are ahead of the country's potential enemies.

Paul's phrasing suggested some uncertainty about Israel's wealth, so we decided to check it out.

We discovered that there are several ways to calculate per capita income by country. The two major indicators we consulted showed that Israel was safely in the top 25 percent.

The World Bank calculates per capita income two ways. One accounts for purchasing power and one doesn't. Purchasing power means that the measurement takes into account how goods are priced in a particular country. The World Bank statistics covered about 160 countries and territories.

If you consider purchasing power, in 2009 Israel was No. 25 on the list of countries, with per capita income of $27,110. No. 1 was Luxembourg with $59,550. The United States was No. 5 with $45,640.

If you don't consider purchasing power, Israel is No. 23, at $25,790. On this measure, Norway is No. 1 at $84,640, and the United States is No. 8 at $46,360.

Either way, Israel makes the top 40, which puts it in the top 25 percent of the World Bank listings.

Seeking the broadest possible measure, though, we looked for a more widespread account of how many countries there are in the world. The United Nations, for example, says it has 192 members. Other sources note that the independence of some countries is contested, so the number can shift depending on world events to anywhere between 191 and 196 countries. So even by the larger number of countries, Israel would still be in the top 25 percent.

We find Paul's statement True.","[(""\nABC News, Rand Paul Says Republicans 'Aren't Maybe Brave Enough' to Tackle Deficit, Feb. 4, 2011\n\nThe World Bank, GNI per capita, PPP (current international $), accessed Feb. 4, 2011\n\nThe World Bank, GNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$), accessed Feb. 4, 2011\n\nThe United Nations, UN at a glance, accessed Feb. 4, 2011\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Members and partners, accessed Feb. 4, 2011\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Committee on the Budget, Fact Sheet: The Fiscal Year 2011 Discretionary Spending Allocation to the Appropriations Committee, Feb. 3, 2011\n\nRand Paul Senate website, Senator Paul Introduces $500 Billion in Spending Cuts, Jan. 25, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0"", 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rand-paul-republicans-arent-brave-tackle-deficit/story?id=12837636&page=1')]",/factchecks/2011/feb/04/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-israels-capita-income-greater-proba/

The DCCC says Rep. Robert Hurt supports a 40 percent cut in education spending
","
Fifth district Republican Robert Hurt has been in Congress only a month, but Democrats are already trying to ensure he leaves after just two years.

The DCCC has launched radio ads against Hurt and 24 other Republican representatives around the nation, part of a ""Drive to 25"" aimed at putting House Democrats back into the majority.

The ads are similar for each of the 25 districts. The Virginia one says: ""Did you know Congressman Robert Hurt has a plan to cut education and research by 40 percent that will cost hundreds-of-thousands of jobs and make America less competitive?  Tell Hurt to choose jobs.""

Forty percent sounded like quite a cut in education spending. In the spirit of learning, we set out to check the math.

Jesse Ferguson, a DCCC spokesman, said the ad is based on a proposal by the Republican Study Committee, a large group of House Republicans. Hurt is a member of the RSC.

The bill in question is the Spending Reduction Act of 2011, introduced last month by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the RSC’s chairman. The act aims to cut federal spending by $2.5 trillion over the next decade.

The RSC wants to do this by reducing ""non-security discretionary spending"" to 2006 levels and holding it there for the next decade.

The federal budget is divided into ""non-discretionary"" and ""discretionary"" spending. ""Non-discretionary"" refers to spending required by law to fund entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps. The amount set aside for these programs is not reviewed annually; instead, Congress periodically reviews eligibility requirements for people receiving the benefits.

Discretionary spending is the money Congress controls through annual appropriations. It is used pay for an array of things including the military, education, transportation and FBI investigations.

Ferguson said the 40 percent figure is based on a report by the Center for Budget Policy Priorities. James Horney, director of federal fiscal policy for the left-leaning CBPP, wrote on the think tank’s blog that returning to 2006 funding levels would mean a 42 percent spending reduction by 2021, if 2010 spending levels were allowed to increased each year to account for inflation. Horney told us his source for the information was the Congressional Budget Office.

In the CBO’s latest report on the U.S. budget and fiscal outlook, the non-partisan budget authority said it projects non-defense discretionary spending will be $545 billion in fiscal year 2011. If non-defense spending grows at the projected rate of inflation, the CBO says the federal government would spend $682 billion for that category in 2021.

The RSC wants a cut to 2006 levels, when non-defense discretionary spending was $409 billion. That is indeed a 40 percent reduction from the projected 2021 spending level, but a 19.5 percent reduction from the 2010 spending levels.

Jim Bradshaw a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Education provided us with the spending on all elementary and secondary education programs during the past few year.

In 2006 the department’s budget for those categories was $39.8 billion. The department has requested a $50.8 billion K-12 budget for the 2011 fiscal year. The figures include both mandatory and discretionary spending.

Going from the requested 2011 level to the 2006 level would be a 21.7 percent cut.

But Brian Straessle, communications director at the RSC, said the proposed reductions would not mandate a specific level of cuts for education. He said the bill would simply require that all discretionary spending fall to 2006 levels without specifying which departments would see reductions.

In other words, the DCCC ad assumes a 40 percent cut to federal education spending, when that may not be the case at all.

""The bill leaves Congressional discretion to decide the reduced appropriation funds from certain agencies and programs,"" Straessle said. ""It doesn’t specifically say that the Department of Labor or Education has to go back.""

In short, he concluded, Congress could decide to make a small cut to education and offset it with larger cuts in other departments, so long as the total amount of discretionary spending fell by the required amount.

Here’s another pin that deflated the Democrats’ claim: Federal dollars account for only about 8 percent of the money that ends up in Virginia’s schools. Uncle Sam sends just $1 billion a year to help them.

The remaining $11.8 billion spent on public education this school year will be roughly shared by the state and local governments.

So if Congress cut 40 percent from the federal education budget, it would mean a $400 million cut to education funding in Virginia. That would translate to a 3.4 percent overall loss  in Virginia school funds in the worst case scenario.

OK class, let’s review.

The DCCC said Robert Hurt supports a 40 percent ""cut in education,"" based on proposals by the Republican Study Committee. While there is no question Hurt and the group want to quickly implement serious spending reductions, the 40 percent figure actually refers to a reduction of hypothetical spending in 2021 to 2006 levels, not an immediate 40 percent cut.

Furthermore, only eight percent of Virginia’s public education funds come from Washington. So even if all federal money suddenly vanished, the state would not see anywhere near a 40 percent reduction in education spending as the DCCC claims.

The radio attack ad ridiculously overstates the possible impacts of federal spending cuts on Virginia’s education budget.

Because of this major exaggeration we rate the claim Pants on Fire.","[('\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee, DCCC launches ""Drive to 25"" ad and grassroots campaign in targeted districts, Jan. 31, 2011.\n\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, House GOP group would decimate key services, accessed Feb. 1, 2011.\n\nVirginia General Assembly, House Bill 1500, accessed Feb. 1, 2011.\n\nRepublican Study Committee, Spending Reduction Act of 2011, accessed Feb. 1, 2011.\n\nU.S. Department of Education, FY 2011 budget summary, accessed Feb. 1, 2011.\n\nU.S. Department of Education, Historical Education Department budget by major program, accessed Feb. 1, 2011.\n\nU.S. Department of Education, Fiscal Year 2011 Congressional action, accessed Feb. 1, 2011.\n\nInterview with Susan Hogge, legislative fiscal analyst, House of Delegates Appropriations Committee, Feb. 1, 2011.\n\nInterview with Jim Bradshaw, spokesman, United States Department of Education, Feb. 1, 2011.\n\nInterview with Brian Straessle, communications director, Republican Study Committee, Feb. 1, 2011.\n\nInterview with Jesse Ferguson, spokesman, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Feb. 1 ,2011.\n\nInterview with James Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Feb. 2, 2011.\n\nCongressional Budget Office, The budget and economic outlook: Fiscal years 2011 to 2021, accessed Feb. 2, 2011.\n\nRepublican Study Committee, Membership list, accessed Feb. 2, 2011.', 'https://dccc.org/blog/entry/dccc_launches_drive_to_25_ad_grassroots_campaign_in_targeted_districts/')]",/factchecks/2011/feb/04/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-rep-robert-hurt-supports-40-percent-cut-/

Egypt got more foreign aid than anyone besides Israel, says New York Times columnist Ross Douthat
","Hosni Mubarak may have ruled Egypt with an iron fist since 1981, but he's been an important ally for the United States in the fight against terrorism -- or so the thinking goes.

New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, though, questioned whether Mubarak has been as helpful as some believe. Mubarak, after all, led a regime that tortured political dissidents.

""By visiting imprisonment, torture and exile upon Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak foreclosed any possibility of an Islamic revolution in his own country. But he also helped radicalize and internationalize his country's Islamists, pushing men like Ayman Al-Zawahiri — Osama bin Laden's chief lieutenant, and arguably the real brains behind Al Qaeda — out of Egyptian politics and into the global jihad,"" Douthat wrote. Douthat credited the book The Looming Tower, by Lawrence Wright, for documenting that history.

""At the same time, Mubarak's relationship with Washington has offered constant vindication for the jihadi worldview,"" Douthat wrote. ""Under his rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. For many young Egyptians, restless amid political and economic stagnation, it's been a short leap from hating their dictator to hating his patrons in the United States.""

Douthat concluded his column by noting that a different government in Egypt might not necessarily be a good thing. ""The long-term consequences of a more populist and nationalistic Egypt might be better for the United States than the stasis of the Mubarak era, and the terrorism that it helped inspire. But then again they might be worse. There are devils behind every door,"" he wrote.

We were interested in Douthat's statement about aid to Egypt.

He is correct based on the most recent statistics. If you don't count Afghanistan ($8.9 billion) and Iraq ($7.5 billion) because of the ongoing U.S. military operations, then Israel ($2.4 billion) is indeed the top recipient, followed by Egypt ($1.5 billion).

That's followed by Russia ($1.3 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), Tanzania ($1.1 billion), Ethiopia ($1 billion), Pakistan ($963 million), Colombia ($888 million), Jordan ($833 million), and Mozambique ($799 million). We found these ratings in the U.S. Census 2011 Statistical Abstract, which compiled 2008 military and economic aid.

Foreign aid includes things such as money for economic development, agriculture or children's health. In Egypt's case, most of the money in recent years has gone to military aid, particularly heavy equipment such as tanks, helicopters and fighter planes. We should note that Egypt will likely slip a place when the official 2010 figures are released, according to a report in the Boston Globe. Haiti is expected to receive more aid, because of the earthquake that occurred there in 2010. The Globe also reported that much of the aid the U.S. sends to Egypt comes back to the United States when Egypt purchases weapons from U.S. defense manufacturers.

Still, Douthat wrote that Egypt has received more money than any country besides Israel ""under his rule."" That would mean the 30 years since Mubarak came to power in late 1981. We turned to the same source the Statistical Abstract used, the U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants data as collected in the ""Greenbook."" The Greenbook, which is compiled by the U.S. Agency for International Development, provides ""a complete historical record of United States' (U.S.) foreign aid to the rest of the world by reporting all loans and grants authorized by the U.S. Government for each fiscal year,"" according to its site.

We obtained aid data by country, calculated in inflation-adjusted 2009 U.S. dollars, from 1982 to 2009. This time, Israel ($117.6 billion) was number one, followed by Egypt ($83.7 billion) at number two. Rounding out the top 10 were Iraq ($54.4 billion), Afghanistan ($35.2 billion), Russia ($18.1 billion), Pakistan ($18 billion), Turkey ($16.7 billion), Jordan ($11.2 billion), Sudan ($10.3 billion), and Colombia ($10.3 billion).

For our ruling, we wanted to know if Douthat was correct that under Mubarak's rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. Douthat is right. We rate his statement True.","[('U.S. Census Bureau, The 2011 Statistical Abstract, Foreign Commerce & Aid: Foreign Aid, U.S. Foreign Economic and Military Aid by Major Recipient Country\n\nThe New York Times, The Devil We Know, op-ed by Ross Douthat, Jan. 31, 2011\n\nU.S. AID, U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants\n\nU.S. AID, U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants, U.S. Total Economic and Military Assistance to the World, FY1982-FY2009, Feb. 3, 2011\n\nThe Boston Globe, Critics question billions in aid routed back to US contractors, Feb. 3, 2011\n\nThe New York Times, Allying ourselves with the next Egypt, op-ed by Sen.

Adam Putnam says Citrus Department doesn't use state taxpayer dollars
","
At an Associated Press meeting Jan. 19, 2011, about the state's upcoming legislative session, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services Adam Putnam was asked about an idea floated by Gov. Rick Scott to merge two state departments: Citrus and Agriculture.

Putnam wasn't sweet on the idea.

""All the money the Department of Citrus has is paid for by the citrus growers,"" Putnam said. ""You don't save dollars by eliminating the Department of Citrus.""

Government departments usually are funded, at least in part, with taxpayer dollars. So we wondered, is that not the case with the Department of Citrus? Is the entire department's budget paid for by the growers?

Putnam spokesman Sterling Ivey explained via e-mail on Feb. 1: ""Although it's a state agency, the FDOC is unique in that its operations are not funded through the state's general tax revenue fund. Florida's citrus industry pays its own way in the form of an excise tax placed on each box of citrus that moves through commercial channels.""

The department is well-known in the citrus-growing areas of Central Florida, but less so in other parts of the state. So Ivey sent us some background from the department's website.

It was established in 1935 by legislative approval of the Florida Citrus Code. It's not affiliated with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The 12-member Florida Citrus Commission, appointed by the governor, sets the annual tax rate that growers pay. The department regulates every aspect of the industry, including research, production, fertilizing, maturity standards, harvesting, licensing, transportation, labeling, packing and processing.

Ivey also sent us a link to the department's 2010-11 budget.

We contacted Comptroller Debra Funkhouser, who has been with the department for 16 years, and she broke down the budget. The total is about $58 million this year. About 85 percent comes from the box tax, 9 percent from the federal government, and the remainder from interest and carryover dollars, she said in an interview Feb. 2. That breakdown does not fluctuate much, and the department has been funded that way for decades, Funkhouser said.

Approximately 57 employees work for the department now, and none of its expenses -- including overhead and salaries – are paid from state tax dollars, Funkhouser said. She did confirm that the department has received only $10 million from state general revenues in its 76-year history, a one-time occurrence after crops were devastated by hurricanes in 2004-05.

The box tax is assessed to growers, collected by the processors and remitted to the citrus department, she said. The tax for oranges, for example, is currently 25 cents for a 90-pound box.

Does that mean the box tax is passed on to customers buying citrus?

""I would have to say there is a correlation, just like the cost of farmers' fertilizer, just like the cost of harvesting that fruit. It's not a direct association,"" she said.

An article in the Lakeland Ledger on Jan. 18, 2011, described a meeting about a month earlier between Ken Keck, the citrus department's executive director, and two officials from Scott's budget office. Keck said the officials discussed possible changes that included a merger with the Agriculture Department or another marketing agency, such as tourism, as well as privatization.

""Citrus officials argued any proposed Citrus Department reform would not advance Scott's stated agenda of cutting taxes for Florida businesses and residents because none of their taxes go to the department,"" the Ledger said. ""To the extent this is a general-revenue issue, this does zero for the state budget,"" Keck was quoted in the article. ""It's unclear whether the governor is aware of that.""

The article noted that the department ""contributes about $2 million annually to the state's general fund through a service charge levied on every state agency, (Florida Citrus Commissioner Jay) Clark said.""

We also looked at the ""sunset review""-- routinely done of state departments to determine whether they should be retained, modified or abolished. The Senate Committee on Agriculture was the primary sunset review committee for the 2008 review. The sunset review recommended keeping the citrus department as a free-standing department because a merger would make it inefficient at a time when the citrus industry was facing challenges, including recovering from hurricanes.

Putnam claimed: ""All the money the Department of Citrus has is paid for by the citrus growers. You don't save dollars by eliminating the Department of Citrus."" In fact, about 85 percent is paid for by the growers -- of the rest, about 9 percent comes from the federal government. So Putnam is correct that Florida won't save state taxpayer dollars by eliminating the department, but he's missing the context of the additional federal dollars. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[],/factchecks/2011/feb/04/adam-putnam/adam-putnam-says-citrus-department-doesnt-use-stat/

Jamie Radtke says the Federal Reserve is driving up commodity prices through its policy moves
","
Unless you’re a farmer, grain elevator operator or pay extremely close attention to certain food prices, you may not know that the prices of corn, wheat and other commodities have pushed higher in the past year.

Tea party activist and Republican Senate candidate Jamie Radtke drew attention to those increases on Jan. 27 when she spoke in Washington at a meeting of the U.S. Senate Tea Party Caucus.

Radtke, after addressing national budget deficits and the Federal Reserve’s current policy of purchasing U.S. Treasury bills in an effort to spur the American economy, turned her attention to commodities.

""We’re spending so much money that we can’t even borrow it fast enough -- the Federal Reserve has to print more money just to keep up!""

Radtke continued: ""The international financial markets know what it means when a nation monetizes its debt, even if Washington doesn’t. Commodity, food and energy prices have been climbing over the past 12 months: Corn prices have risen 69 percent; wheat prices have risen 44 percent; sugar prices have risen 15 percent; and gasoline is back at three dollars a gallon... and rising.""

Radtke’s statement offered a succotash of facts to check. Is she right about these sharp corn, wheat and sugar price increases? And are the spikes related to what she calls monetizing the debt?

First, a word about what it means to ""monetize the debt."" When governments run a budget deficit, they cover it by issuing bonds that are sold to investors. When a nation’s central bank purchases those bonds, it is essentially subsidizing the government’s debt issuance.

Opponents of the U.S. central bank’s latest Treasury purchases believe that this is now happening in the United States. And while the Fed is buying more Treasury bills than usual, the central bank has long-maintained holdings in U.S. government debt and has made regular bond purchases for decades.

Chuck Hansen, Radtke’s director of communications, said the information on commodity prices was based on futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Board of Trade. He said the campaign compared the closing prices on each commodity for the second week of January 2011 with the closing price for each in the second week of January 2010.

We went to the links mentioned by Hansen and did the math ourselves.

Our numbers didn’t quite match Radtke’s, but were in the same ballpark. We found a 75 percent increase in corn prices, a 52 percent spike in wheat prices and a 12 percent rise in sugar prices.

Now for the tougher questions. Why are these increases occurring? Is Radtke right to suggest they are related to actions by the Fed or the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar?

Christopher Hurt, an agricultural economist at Purdue University, offered a simple explanation why corn and wheat prices have surged since the summer of 2010. ""We had a really sharp reduction of global production,"" he said.

The problems got serious back in July and August, he explained, when droughts swept across Russia and other ex-Soviet countries. Russia is the world’s fourth-largest wheat exporter, while Ukraine is fifth and Kazakhstan sixth. The 2010 harvests in those nations were down 28.6 percent compared to 2009.  

Canada, the world’s second-largest wheat exporter, had the opposite problem. Heavy rains last spring prevented farmers from planting their full crop and Canada’s wheat yield fell 14 percent from 2009, Hurt said. And this winter’s devastating floods in Australia are occurring during the Southern Hemisphere’s prime growing season and reducing the quality of that nation’s crop, he said.

The problems with corn are also weather-related, experts said. Argentina, the world’s second-largest corn exporter, is facing a hot, dry summer (remember it is now summer in the Southern Hemisphere) that could drive yields down by 6 percent to 20 percent, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.

""The real story is yield losses around the world,"" said Roy Huckabay Jr., a long-time commodities trader at the Chicago Board of Trade. ""Starting with the spring of 2010 in Canada, then problems with drought in the U.S. wheat belt and now problems in Australia. World grain supplies are very tight right now.""

Ethanol production is also using up a portion of the corn supply. The United States, the world’s largest corn producer, will see 37 percent of the 2010 crop go towards ethanol production, compared with 6 percent of the 2000 crop.

We asked Huckabay if a weaker dollar, meaning one that is worth less compared to other global currencies, could drive prices higher. Some critics of the Fed, including Radtke, say its policies  are lowering the dollar’s value.

He said that was possible in certain commodities, especially oil, which is widely traded. But in something like corn, he said, the United States is the largest supplier and largest exporter. And since less than 10 percent of American corn is exported, he said, the dollar’s value plays little role in the price Americans pay for corn.

Our last call went to James Hamilton, an economist at the University of California, San Diego and an expert on monetary economic policy and the Federal Reserve. When it comes to understanding why commodity prices rise, he ""wouldn’t put [the dollar] at the top of the list, though the value of the dollar certainly plays a role.""

This week, Hamilton said, commodity prices were reacting to the protests in Egypt. During the summer and fall, Hamilton said, a key driver was higher demand from emerging industrialized nations like China and India.

Given the tight global food supply, Hurt said the 2011 planting season for the Northern Hemisphere will be crucial. If yields fail to exceed the levels of 2010, he said, the current high prices could persist at least through the summer of 2012, when that year’s harvest starts to arrive.

""If we have a normal year in 2011 we will have pretty high prices still, but not as high as they are right now, Hurt said.""

Let’s review.

Radtke is right about the basic facts: Corn, wheat and sugar prices have sharply increased in the past year, especially since last summer -- even though though her math did not match ours.

But Radtke goes off track when she attributes these higher prices to a Federal Reserve that helps the United States ""monetize its debt."" Economists and a commodity trader told us these price spikes are primarily being driven by drought, floods and rising global demand. And while the value of the dollar plays a role in these prices, Federal Reserve policy is just one factor in the greenback’s value.

Given this preponderance of evidence, we find her claim to be Barely True.","[('\nChicago Board of Trade, Corn, accessed Jan. 28, 2011.\n\nChicago Board of Trade, Wheat, accessed Jan. 28, 2011.\n\nNew York Board of Trade, Sugar #11, accessed Jan. 28, 2011.\n\nE-mail interview with Chuck Hansen, director of communications for Jamie Radtke, Jan. 31, 2011.\n\nInterview with Roy Huckabay, Jr., commodities trader at the Linn Group, Jan. 31, 2011.\n\nInterview with James Hamilton, professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, Jan. 31, 2011.\n\nInterview with Christopher Hurt, professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, Feb. 1, 2011.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, FOMC Statement for Jan. 26, 2011, accessed Feb. 1, 2011.', 'http://futures.tradingcharts.com/chart/CN/w')]",/factchecks/2011/feb/04/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-federal-reserve-driving-commodit/

Georgia lawmaker says white rural Democrats are a thing of the past
","
The Democratic Party dominated Southern politics from the post-Civil War era through Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal and decades beyond.

But the debate over civil rights issues, the scope of government and other matters ignited a transformation that has left much of the South in GOP control in recent years.

Some Georgia politicians, such as state Rep. Alan Powell of Hartwell, have abruptly switched teams, sensing the political winds have shifted. Powell bolted to the Republican Party just days after being re-elected in November to the Georgia House of Representatives as a veteran Democrat.

Powell told the Washington news publication Politico: ""Democrats have now become the party of the metro area and of blacks. That’s not to be derogatory. It’s just what it is.""

In an interview with PolitiFact Georgia, Powell said he was pointing to the metro areas throughout Georgia and not just the Atlanta metro area when he used that geographical designation.

True, Democrats no longer dominate as they did during Reconstruction and the Great Depression. But has it gotten as bad for the party of Tennessee’s Andrew Jackson and Texan Lyndon B. Johnson as Powell said?

Powell told PolitiFact Georgia that he saw the metro areas of Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Macon and Savannah as the only places where Democrats can win elections.

""Just about everywhere else Democrats have ceased to exist,"" he said. ""What you have now is a reversal of what you had 20 years ago.""

Charles S. Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia who specializes in elections, said Powell’s statement ""captures the truth in broad strokes.""

Bullock points out that of 20 Democratic state senators, 13 are African-Americans and six are from metro Atlanta. Sen. George Hooks of Americus is the only white state senator who still represents a rural district in Georgia.

Of the 63 Democrats in the state House of Representatives, five are whites from rural districts. They are Rep. Debbie Buckner of Junction City, Rep. Rick Crawford of Cedartown, Rep. Carol Fullerton of Albany, Rep. Sistie Hudson of Sparta and Rep. Barbara Massey Reece of Menlo.

This is a stark change from 1971, when there were no women in the state Legislature, two African-Americans and a handful of Republicans, Bullock said.

""The trend of the prototypical Georgia Legislature -- white, rural, male, Democrat -- is not extinct, but it’s on the endangered species list,"" Bullock said.

Democratic Party spokesman Eric Gray said he never thought about the fact that the state Senate has only one white Democratic senator from a rural district. Even so, he disputed to a mild degree the idea that Democrats can only compete in metro districts and disparaged even bringing up the notion that Democrats are the party of ""blacks.""

""We have Democrats, [sheriffs and county commissioners], throughout the state,"" Gray said. ""I will acknowledge many of our Democrats are clustered around the larger cities and I think that proves it’s not just Atlanta, but as far as his racial assertion, I’m not going to get into that. As a state we should get away from that. It’s past time to stop judging people by skin color.""

But Powell’s statement seems less a judgment of the electorate based on the color of their skin than on the content of their ballot boxes. Statistics show he has a point.

Of the 395,300 residents who voted in the Democratic primary in July, 235,800, or 59 percent, were African-Americans, according to an analysis by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of election data provided by the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office.

About 78,800 Democratic primary voters, or 20 percent, were whites from the metro areas referred to by Powell.

About 77,900 rural whites, or roughly 20 percent, voted in the Democratic primary. So the Democrats are not completely devoid of white voters outside metro areas, but as Bullock alluded, the situation for the party is grim.

That’s because the Democrats’ numbers are dwarfed by the Republican success in rural counties. There were 276,200 rural whites who voted in the Republican primary, more than 3 1/2 times the number of rural whites who voted in the Democratic primary.

Even more true than Powell’s assertion that the Democratic Party is the party of metro areas and blacks is that the Republican Party is the party of whites. Of 680,000 Republican primary voters in 2010, 666,800, or 98 percent, were white.

About 3,000 African-Americans voted in the Republican primary.

Emory University political science professor Merle Black said African-Americans and whites and metro residents and rural residents have different perspectives on many contentious issues, such as the scope of government services and taxes, so it makes sense that they would find themselves on the opposite side of the political aisle.

Black said this change has been a long time coming.

""What we’ve seen is a realignment from the top down,"" he said. ""It started in the presidential elections and the Senate and the House and now the state government.""

Rural white Democrats do exist. About 78,000 participated in the Georgia primary last year, and there are six in the Georgia Legislature. But when compared with the hundreds of thousands of rural Republican voters, rural white Democrats seem to have much in common with the panda and the gray wolf -- their range is restricted and their numbers are thin.

We conclude that Powell was correct in that the vast majority of Democratic voters are African-Americans or whites from metro areas. He did have to clarify his position by saying he meant to include major metro areas outside of Atlanta.

We rate his statement as Mostly True.","[('\nInterview with Charles S.

Paul Krugman says poorest 40 percent of Texans pay more in Texas than national average
","
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman sees Texas as a model for how things might be going wrong across the nation and in his latest blast, posted online Feb. 27, he pokes at the state’s reputedly low taxes.

Texas taxes ""are low, at least if you’re in the upper part of the income distribution,"" Krugman writes. He adds, parenthetically, that ""taxes on the bottom 40 percent of the population are actually above the national average.""

It’s undisputed that the two major Texas state and local taxes--sales and property--impose a greater burden on low-income Texans. According to the Texas State Comptroller’s latest study of tax incidence, issued last month, Texas households earning $29,223 or less are expected to spend 6 percent of their income in general sales taxes and 5.3 percent of their income on school property taxes in 2013. The report says households earning more than $29,223 are likely to spend on average no more than 3.4 percent of their income on each of the two taxes.

The left-leaning Austin-based Center on Public Policy Priorities wrote in 2009: ""Texas relies on the sales tax for more than half of all state tax revenue – a pattern typical of regressive tax systems. Since low- and moderate-income Texans tend to spend all of their income each year to support their families, the sales tax takes a much greater percentage of their income then it does from higher-income families, who can afford to save some of their income or spend it on services that are not subject to the sales tax.""

Yet do the state’s poorest residents also pay higher taxes than the national average?

By e-mail, Krugman told us he based his statement on an analysis released Nov. 18, 2009 by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research arm of Washington-based Citizens for Tax Justice, which says it advocates for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families.

The study says the 20 percent of Texas families earning less than $18,000 a year spend 12.2 percent of their income on state and local taxes, while the next-wealthiest 20 percent of families, earning $18,000 to $31,000, spend 10.2 percent of income on the taxes, which largely consist of sales and property taxes. Nationally, the poorest 20 percent and next-poorest 20 percent of families spend an average of 10.9 percent and 10 percent of income, respectively, on state and local taxes, the study says.

Conversely, the study says, the 60 percent of Texas families that earned $31,000 or more put less of their income into state and local taxes than the national average. Texas households in the top 20 percent of income, earning $89,000 or more, paid 5.8 percent of their income or less, while such households nationally paid 8.8 percent or less.

Texas is among 10 states with ""particularly regressive"" tax systems, the study says. One result is that low-income families ""pay almost six times as much of their earnings in taxes as do the wealthy"" and ""middle-income families in these states pay up to three-and-a-half times as high a share of their income as the wealthiest families.""

We reached Matt Gardner, the institute’s director. He said the study drew on data from the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. He said it was methodologically improved from earlier attempts by the institute to gauge who bears the brunt of state and local taxes. 
Next, we shared the methodological details that Gardner aired with Billy Hamilton, a former deputy state comptroller of Texas. Hamilton, who was involved in the state’s past studies of tax incidence, said: ""It sounds like what they did is very logical."" 
Gardner said Krugman’s comparison accurately tracks the study. We noticed that the difference between what the second-poorest 20 percent of Texas households pays and the national average looks small; the Texans paid only .2 percent more. Based on a $30,000 annual income, that’s $60 more. Though measurable, ""it’s not a huge difference,"" Gardner said.

Footnote: Krugman’s statement might not have applied to both subsets of lower-income Texans in the past. The institute’s previous studies, based on different methodologies and 1995 and 2002 tax payments, similarly showed the poorest 20 percent of Texans paying more than counterparts nationally. But the next-to-poorest 20 percent of Texans paid less of their incomes to state and local taxes than residents in the same income group nationally, Gardner said.

We rate Krugman’s statement True.","[('\nCenter for Public Policy Priorities, press release, ""New Report: Texas Taxes on Bottom 20 Percent of Income Earners Fifth Highest in the Nation,"" Nov. 18, 2009 (accessed March 1, 2011)\n\nE-mail (excerpted), response to PolitiFact Texas, Paul Krugman, oped columnist, The New York Times, Feb. 28, 2011\n\nInstitute on Taxation and Economic Policy, study, ""Who Pays?

Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell says four-year city council terms are norm for most cities like Austin
","
Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell, advocating changes in the city’s governing charter, says it doesn’t make sense for City Council members to have three-year terms. In his Feb. 25 State of the City address, Leffingwell said that four-year terms are ""the norm in most cities of our size.""

News to us.

Leffingwell, who hopes to seek voter approval of term changes in 2012, later told us the change would result in one council election every four years, sparing voters from facing two council elections every three years as they do now. Also, he said, ""if you ask politicians who are serving two-year terms, they find themselves in constant campaign mode. Campaigns are very exhausting and very costly.""

To back up the mayor’s claim, his office provided a spreadsheet listing 34 cities plus Austin and the length of each city’s council terms. Spokesman Matt Curtis said consultant Mark Littlefield looked at the nation’s 30 most populous cities drawing on city websites and U.S. Census 2007 population estimates.

According to the sheet, 29 of the cities have four-year council terms, five cities have two-year terms--and only Austin has three-year terms.

Four-year terms prevail in some of the country’s largest cities including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia; they’re also in place in San Diego, Denver, Oklahoma City and,  in Texas, El Paso. Four Texas cities--Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth--join Charlotte, N.C. in having two-year council terms, the mayor’s research says.

Wondering if the other listed cities are comparable to Austin, we compared their 2009 estimated populations as gauged by the U.S. Census Bureau. Austin’s estimated population that year was 786,386; the average population for the other cities was 30 percent greater, 1,019,849.

The 10 cities with populations closest to Austin’s size ranged from Boston, at 645,169, to Detroit, at 910,921. Among them, Boston, Charlotte and Fort Worth have two-year terms, and the other seven cities have four-year terms, according to our checks of city websites and interviews of respective city officials.

Twist: Leffingwell’s fact sheet shows Boston’s council members with four-year terms, but Ann Braga, the Boston council’s staff director, told us that’s true only for the mayor.

So, 70 percent of cities close in population to Austin are represented by council members elected to four-year terms.

Twin River’s spokeswoman says its slot machine payouts are “more than competitive” with nearby casinos
","
Earlier this month, Gov. Lincoln Chafee expressed the fear that trying to cull too much revenue from the state's slot parlors could send gamblers to other states, where the odds might be better.

""They are not going to play if they are going to keep losing,"" Chafee said. ""They'll go across the border, or go somewhere else where the odds, if you will, are more in their favor. … They know where they have a better chance of winning.""

In response, Patti Doyle, spokeswoman for Twin River, one of Rhode Island’s two slot parlors, said in a radio interview that her casino gives better odds.

""We know from the industry standards in the industry casino world, that we're all pretty much on the same level. You know, you wouldn't be able to continue to be in business if you weren't competitive with gaming venues that are nearby. And we are. We're more than competitive,"" she said on radio station WPRO (630-AM).

When we hear ""more than competitive,"" we think ""better.""

So we asked Doyle for the source of that comparison. While we awaited her response, we started our own research.

On its website, RILot.com, the Rhode Island Lottery publishes a monthly list of how much cash was put into Twin River’s 4,700 slot machines, how much cash was won, and how much that represents in percentage.

(It should be noted that neither Twin River, nor Newport Grand, the state’s other slot parlor, sets the payout percentages of their slot machines. They’re set by the director of the Rhode Island Lottery, Gerald S. Aubin.)

Statistics for Connecticut's two casinos -- Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun -- are on the website of the Connecticut Division of Special Revenue at CT.gov/DOSR.

At first glance, it looks like Rhode Island is less than competitive. During the period from January 2010 through January 2011, the highest monthly Twin River payout to gamblers was 91.529 percent, in December. The highest payout percentage at the Newport Grand, was lower: 91.171 percent in September.

In contrast, the payouts at Foxwoods are listed as higher for 11 of the last 12 months. And Mohegan Sun offered a bigger payout every month, going no lower than 91.80 percent last May and as high as 92.17 in August.

But George Papanier, CEO of Twin River, said the published percentages aren't comparable because states calculate the payout percentage differently.

The issue is the credits that players get, also known as ""free play."" Rhode Island calls it Bonus Play. Mohegan lists it as eBonus Credits. In the Foxwoods report it's called Free Play. The two states account for it differently, said Papanier. Officials at the Rhode Island Lottery told us the same thing.

As a result, the payout percentage for Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun is inflated, they said.

In order to calculate the ""Cash Won"" at each Connecticut casino the same way it is calculated in Rhode Island, you must take the ""handle "" (the amount played, including free play and winnings replayed), subtract the ""Win"" amount (how much the casino wins) and subtract the value of the Free Play or eBonus coupons redeemed at the slot machines.

By that formula, we discovered that, as Doyle said, Twin River’s payout percentage is better than Foxwoods’. In every month over the past year, Twin River had a higher payout percentage. The one-year averages: 91.366 percent for Twin River and 90.768 percent for Foxwoods.

The story is a little different for Mohegan Sun. It beat out Twin River in 7 of the past 12 months, but the Connecticut casino's 12-month average was a hair below Twin River's, at 91.359 percent.  

A few tenths -- or hundredths -- of a percent may not seem consequential, but to serious gamblers, any tilt in their advantage is attractive, maybe even enough to send them to one casino over another.

To double-check our numbers, we talked to Michael Janusko, chief financial examiner of Connecticut's Division of Special Revenue, who confirmed that our calculations were correct. The way Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun run their numbers, ""it does overstate the payout percentage a bit,"" he said.

Finally, Doyle sent us a copy of The Gaming Industry Observer's East Coast Slot Report that summarizes casino operations from Maine to Florida in January. Twin River ranked 13th out of 56 facilities in terms of money paid out to players,  ahead of Mohegan Sun (25th), Newport Grand (26th), and Foxwoods (35th).

Aubin, Rhode Island's Lottery director, said there is an important caveat to understand when considering payout. Those percentages are largely a function of the types of machines a casino has, not whether it is actually giving gamblers better odds.

All other things being equal, a facility that has lots of penny slots, for example, will have a lower overall payout percentage than a casino that has none because those machines have smaller payouts.

""I'm confident it would be the exact same payout throughout the country with the same game,"" he said.

To summarize: Looking at the casinos as a whole, the way Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun calculate their payout percentages may make them look like a better bet for gamblers. But if you include player rewards to make an apples-to-apples comparison, Doyle's statement that Twin River is ""more than competitive"" is true for Foxwoods. Whether it applies to Mohegan Sun depends on the month.

Jeff Merkley calls on Obama to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
","
  
Let’s take a moment to talk about SPR, since a lot of people in Washington -- including Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- are making it a topic of intense interest these days as gas prices soar.

SPR, for those not versed in Washington-speak, is short-hand for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is the nation’s insurance policy against disruptions in the oil market and today holds 727 million barrels of oil dumped in underground caverns in Louisiana and Texas. It was created in 1975 in response to the economic (and political) turmoil inflicted by the Arab oil embargo and is intended to be soften supply disruptions the economic chaos they cause.

There’s no dispute it’s a good idea.

""During oil supply disruptions, releasing oil from the SPR could greatly reduce damage to the U.S. economy, based on our analyses and expert opinions,"" the Government Accountability Office said in a 2006 report. ""Particularly when used in conjunction with reserves in other countries, the SPR can replace the oil lost in all but the most catastrophic oil disruption scenarios we considered, lasting from 3 months to 2 years.""

The discussion now focuses on two points: Should the reserve be used? If it is, what effect will it have on prices?

Merkley expressed no doubt on either. In a March 4 letter to President Barack Obama, Merkley urged the president to use the reserve now. He is convinced it would bring down prices. As an added benefit, he said, revenue raised from selling the oil could be used to jump-start the development of electric cars.

""This action would immediately lower gasoline prices, generating significant revenue to invest in your call for one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015,"" Merkley said. The letter was co-signed by Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Barbara Boxer of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and independent Bernard Sanders of Vermont.

Obama said he is considering the step but has made no promises.

At this news conference on March 11, he said: ""Should the situation demand it, we are prepared to tap the significant stockpile of oil that we have in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.""

But in response to a question he suggested that conditions haven’t reached the point yet where it should be used.

""If we see significant disruptions or shifts in the market that are so disconcerting to people that we think a Strategic Petroleum Reserve release might be appropriate, then we'll take that step,"" he said. ""And we're going to monitor very closely -- and obviously we have it teed up, so this isn’t a situation where it would take a big bureaucracy and several weeks for us to implement.  This is something that would take several days.""

That point might arrive.

With a potentially protracted civil war taking hold in Libya and rippling unrest across the Mideast, markets have gone crazy and the price of fuel has spiked. The possibility for disruption is real. Oil analysts, however, say for the time being any reduced flow from Libya can easily be covered by increases from other countries.

The market seems to be missing that point.

The price of gas in Portland has jumped to $3.60 a gallon now compared to $3.22 a month ago and $2.85 a year ago, according to AAA. Nationwide, it has jumped 40 cents a gallon in the last month and federal analysts predict the price could hit $4 a gallon by summer. Members of Congress, including Merkley, are demanding action to relieve the pressure on hard-hit constituents.

But ""immediately"" is a pretty precise term. To the average person filling his car it also suggests more certainty than might be possible. Like so many words uttered in Washington, it has multiple meanings.

But first, let’s look a some history.

The petroleum reserve has been used twice before: In 2001 after the United States attacked Iraq and in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina dismantled the Gulf region, which is the center of the country’s oil infrastructure.

And sure enough, when oil was released in 2005 prices fell 5.2 percent. In 2001 the drop was even more pronounced after 34 million barrels were released. Prices dropped 33 percent the next day and even six months later prices were 30 percent below the price before the war.

In December 1990 gas was $1.34 a gallon and rising, reflecting the market's nervousness about Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. By Jan. 28, 1991, the price had dropped to $1.17 a gallon after President George H.W. Bush ordered 17 million barrels released from the reserve in advance of the U.S. attack.

The pattern was repeated in 2005 when President George W. Bush ordered 11 million barrels released to replace supplies lost to Hurricane Katrina. The price of gallon of gas moved from $3.04 on Sept. 5, 2005, to $2.91 by Sept. 12 and $2.73 on Sept. 19, according to price records from the federal Energy Information Administration.

But here’s an important nuance: The most pronounced drop was in the commodity markets, not at the pump. And whether those savings are passed along the complicated route from reserve to gas station isn’t always so clear.

That’s the hang-up with Merkley’s suggestion that relief would be fast. It might; but it isn’t guaranteed.

Julie Edwards, his communications director, said that prices at the pump did fall in 2005 about a week after oil was released. By the slow-moving standards of oil production, she said, that should qualify as immediate.

Whether to use the SPR is fueling a vigorous debate whose outcome is unclear. But, if it is used it’s almost certain that prices will drop. Whether those lower prices drip all the way to the pump, however, is less clear. For those reasons, we rate this claim: Mostly True.

Glenn Hegar says Texas leads all other states--combined--in catfish consumption
","
It seemed a tad(pole) fishy when state Sen. Glenn Hegar, R-Katy, recently said Texans eat more catfish than residents of other states, by a whopping margin. His  Feb. 26 op-ed column in the Austin American-Statesman says: ""Texans love their catfish, batter-fried, blackened, or grilled. In fact, Texans eat more catfish than all the other states combined.""

Hungering for back-up for Hegar’s boast, we reached his chief of staff, Lisa Craven. She attributed it to--we kid not--the Catfish Institute, a Mississippi-based entity devoted to raising ""consumer awareness of the positive qualities of U.S. farm-raised catfish,"" according to information on its website. Catfish farming is big in Hegar’s district, and he’s proposed legislation requiring restaurants to disclose if they are serving catfish imported from other countries. 
In an interview, institute spokesman Jeff McCord told us the institute commissioned a 2005 catfish consumption study concluding that Texans consume more catfish than residents of four other southern states combined.

The study concluded the residents of Texas then consumed nearly 109 million pounds of catfish a year. That’s more than the residents of Alabama (30 million), Arkansas (18 million), Louisiana (28 million) and Mississippi (18 million) combined (94 million pounds).

But more than all the other 49 states? McCord said the institute did not look into that.

McCord said the study was conducted by Market Research Institute, a nationally recognized firm, in May and June 2005. ""The research focused on the states with the highest per-capita sales of U.S. farm-raised catfish,"" McCord said. ""In each state, the researchers contacted and obtained data from seafood purchasing agents for seafood stores, supermarkets, catfish restaurants and other restaurants and came up with the aggregate numbers.""

No denying it, 109 million pounds is a lot of fish. Yet Texas has a lot more people than those other catfish-crazy states. We wondered how much of the tasty ictalurids -- which happen to be the catfish native to North America -- the average Texan consumes.

So we divided the state estimates from the study by each state’s 2005 population as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Turns out that Texans consumed nearly 5 pounds per person, while residents of each of the other states averaged more than 6 pounds each.

We circled back to Craven, who said Hegar fact-checked his article with the Catfish Institute, whose spokesman, McCord, later called the Texas-most reference a ""minor overstatement."" 
Finally, we contacted David Harvey, an agricultural economist in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service, and asked him about state-by-state catfish consumption. No such information is available, Harvey said, speculating that’s because it would require fish processors here and abroad to say where they’re sending their fish and the processors don't want to share such details.

Not only do Texans not eat more catfish than the whole rest of the country, they ate less, per person, than residents in four other southern states as of 2005. Even by Texas bragging standards, Hegar’s statement smacks as a memorable fish tale. We rate it False.","[('\nE-mail (excerpted), response to PolitiFact Texas, Lisa Craven, chief of staff, Office of Sen.

Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald says half of state residents are “on some kind of government handout”
","
Addressing the Wisconsin Republican Party’s annual convention on May 21, 2011, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, reflected on the transformational 2010 elections. The GOP swept to power, taking from Democrats the governor’s office as well as control of the Senate and Assembly.

""That election needed to happen. Our country is facing challenges we simply can’t ignore,"" Fitzgerald told hundreds of convention-goers at a Wisconsin Dells resort.

""Our government is growing too fast, too big; it’s becoming too expensive. One out of every five people in Wisconsin are on Medicaid or Medicare. One out of every two are on some kind of government handout.""

One out of every two people in Wisconsin -- half the state’s residents -- receive a ""government handout?""

That’s a lot of Wisconsinites.

We asked Fitzgerald’s spokesman, Andrew Welhouse, for evidence to back up the statement. Welhouse initially said his boss’ claim ""looks wrong, but the larger conversation about entitlements and government spending is long overdue.""

That’s not much of a defense.

Welhouse did cite this passage from an April 2011 analysis of federal data done by USA Today:

""A record 18.3 percent of the nation's total personal income was a payment from the government for Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, unemployment benefits and other programs in 2010. Wages accounted for the lowest share of income — 51 percent — since the government began keeping track in 1929.""

That all may be true. But it’s off point.  

The article indicates what percentage of Americans’ overall income comes from the government. But it says nothing about what percentage of individual Wisconsinites -- or Americans, for that matter -- receive government assistance.

We told Welhouse we still wanted to know what Fitzgerald defined as government handouts. When he called back, he said Fitzgerald told him he had meant to say that one in six Wisconsin residents -- not one in two -- get government handouts.

Welhouse didn’t say what Fitzgerald considered as handouts, but he provided another USA Today article, from August 2010. Analyzing state data, the newspaper found that government anti-poverty programs such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance served a record one in six Americans.

The article makes no mention of Wisconsin, however.

We contacted state agencies to see how many Wisconsinites receive government assistance from the four major programs cited in the second article that Welhouse provided. Here’s what we found: 

Since Wisconsin has about 5.65 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that means roughly one in five state residents is on Medicaid alone.

If you added the recipients in all four programs, the total would represent 2.16 million people, or more than one in three Wisconsinites. That would still be far short of the one in two that Fitzgerald claimed at the convention.

But the true figure is lower than 2.16 million because some people receive assistance from more than one of the programs. Based on the available information, we could not determine an exact number – nor could Fitzgerald.


We also contacted experts at four private organizations in Wisconsin that track government programs. None said they were aware of any study that attempted to determine what percentage of Wisconsin residents receives government assistance or a ""government handout.""

All of this is setting aside the question of what constitutes a handout, which is a subjective term.

The article cited by Fitzgerald’s aide to support the 1-in-2 claim included Social Security and Medicare, both of which workers pay into through payroll taxes. Many people would not consider those programs handouts.

Here’s the bottom line:

Fitzgerald made a bold statement at the state GOP convention -- that one out of every two Wisconsin residents ""is on some kind of government handout.""

Morgan Griffith says EPA treats milk spills same way as oil spills
","
U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith is milking his opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency for every last drop.

The Republican stressed his contempt for the agency throughout a heated campaign last fall in which Griffith unseated Democrat Rick Boucher, a 14-term congressman from coal-rich Southwest Virginia. In his victory speech, Griffith vowed to go to Washington and ""fight to rein in the EPA."" Since taking office, he has fired out a barrage of anti-EPA statements.

In a February newsletter to constituents, Griffith claimed that new EPA rules treat milk spills the same way they treat oil spills. He titled the newsletter ""Crying over spilt milk.""

""What do spilt milk and oil have in common?"" he wrote. ""Quite a bit, according to the EPA. In fact, a new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow. The EPA’s reasoning is that milk contains ‘a percentage of animal fats, which is a non-petroleum oil.’ It appears spilt milk is just as threatening as an oil spill.""

With visions of dairy farmers delicately dabbing milk off the wings of ducks, we looked into the claim.

Beth Breeding, Griffith’s press secretary, said her boss’s information came from the EPA’s website. So we went there.

Right away, we found problems with Griffith’s claim. The website says milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon. So this is hardly a ""new ruling,"" as Griffith says. It has been in effect for 38 years.

The EPA site says ""since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of ‘oil’ from the Clean Water Act, which was authored by Congress.""

The website also notes the rule only applies to farms storing more than 1,320 gallons of oil or milk.

So what’s new? According to the EPA, the only thing that comes close is a rule change it announced on Jan. 15, 2009. It goes in effect at the end of this month.

The simple purpose of the change is to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. That’s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. Here’s what the regulation says:

""EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade ""A"" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance,"" or similar state laws.

Translated into plain English, the rule means milk storage will no longer have to meet the EPA’s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. In Virginia it is illegal to sell ""raw,"" or unpasteurized, milk, so the state’s dairy farmers should already be in compliance with the new standards.  

Raw milk is now legal for sale in 25 states, although 15 of those states only allow sales directly from a farm. So conceivably raw milk producers -- which are almost exclusively small operations, according to a group that advocates for raw milk -- might still need to comply with the SPCC rules. But this would affect only a very small fraction of total U.S. milk.

Baffled by how Griffith could have this claim so mixed up, we went back to his office for additional information. The second time around his press secretary pointed us to a Jan. 27 editorial in The Wall Street Journal that makes virtually the same claim. The editorial wrongly said new EPA rules will apply to dairy farms and cover milk storage. The amended rule only applies to petroleum products -- gasoline, fuel oil and the like -- that are stored in large quantities on dairy farms.  

Let’s review our findings.

Griffith claimed a ""new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply"" with strict regulations for spills and leaks. He said the rules were the same as those enforced on oil and natural gas companies.

In fact, these regulations have been in place for 38 years and are not new at all. The ""new ruling"" from the EPA, announced in 2009 and taking effect in a few weeks, actually excludes milk from the spill standards, giving dairy farmers fewer regulations to meet. That’s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims.

Sure, Griffith got some of his information from an inaccurate editorial in The Wall Street Journal. But a  congressman who is railing against a federal agency has the means to get his facts right.

Griffith is dishing udder cow chips. We rate his statement False.","[('\nRep. H.

Dan Patrick says Texas school districts, all told, are the world's fifth-largest employers
","
Framing his case for slimming school district staffs, GOP state Sen. Dan Patrick aired what the Texas Tribune called a ""staggering"" statistic--that the state’s school districts are the fifth largest employers in the world.

We paused too at Patrick’s statement, as paraphrased in a Feb. 25 Tribune news article.

Patrick’s chief of staff, Logan Spence, told us by e-mail that Patrick’s assessment tracks with a Jan. 18, 2011, press release from the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute, a conservative Austin-based think tank. The release says the Texas public school system is ""the fifth-largest employer in the world with 646,815 employees. It is behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc., China National Petroleum, State Grid Corp. of China and the United States Postal Service."" Its referenced study says: ""If the Texas public education system were a private company, it would be the fifth largest in the world by employee count.""

The study says it bases its school employee count on the Texas Education Agency’s 2008-09 pocket guide to school statistics and traces its 2008 counts for the world’s largest corporate employers to a July 2009 Fortune magazine look at the world’s largest private employers--all which we confirmed before obtaining more recent numbers from the magazine and the TEA.

And for national perspective, we looked at state-by-state public school employee counts for 2008-09 posted by the National Center for Education Statistics. That year, according to the center, Texas had 660,000 public school employees with California having the second-most, nearly 598,000.

TEA spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe passed along the state’s 2009-10 count of full-time district employees, 661,285; she said the agency doesn’t have comparisons to private employers.

In July 2010, Fortune magazine issued its latest breakdown of the world’s most profitable 500 companies. Wal-Mart was No. 1 among them in employees as of that date, with 2.1 million workers, followed by China National Petroleum, at more than 1.6 million workers, State Grid Corp., China’s primary power grid builder and operator, at 1.5 million, and the U.S. Postal Service, 667,605. The fifth-largest company was Sinopec, a Chinese refining and gas company, with 633,000 workers. China National Petroleum refers to itself as a ""state oil company"" and State Grid says on its website that it’s government owned. Fortune says on its methodology summary that entities qualify for consideration if they must publish financial data and report their figures to a government agency.

So Texas school districts together had more employees last year than all but four of the world’s for-profit enterprises.

Fair comparison? Ratcliffe suggested otherwise, noting that every school district operates independently. A more valid approach, she said, would be to compare school employees with airline employees, or workers in some other industry. We thought of similar analogies: employees of fast-food companies, say, or day-care workers or law enforcement officers.

Next, we ran Patrick’s statement by education experts and advocates.

Peggy Johnson, associate dean for teacher education at Texas Tech University’s College of Education, said school districts aren’t as monolithic as corporations. ""Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart, but in Texas you’ve got very independent school districts,"" Johnson said, ""so it’s not the same as everybody being employed by the same company.""

Catherine Clark, associate executive director for the Texas Association of School Boards, said in an e-mail that while it’s a ""little unusual to aggregate over 1,000 separately governed working units and compare them with Wal-Mart or an international energy company,"" it’s not surprising the Texas public education system employs so many people. The enterprise is ""large, far-flung and diverse,"" she said. ""Its success depends on people--teachers, administrators, and support staff who provide an appropriate education program and safe facilities for nearly 5 million students.""

Ken Zornes of the 22-year-old Texas Business Education Coalition, which describes itself as the voice of the state’s business community for educational gains, said: ""You can walk into almost any business and find some ways to be more efficient. I’m sure that’s true with all the employees in the (Texas) education system.""

When we followed up with Patrick, he called his statement fair. ""It’s a perfectly legitimate comparison,"" he said. ""The point is made: Our schools employ lots of people.""

Yep, and the math behind his statement looks solid. Still, we find it questionable whether any workforces in the public sector, where the goal is supposed to be public service, are directly comparable to those in private sector, where the goal is to make money. We rate Patrick’s statement Barely True.","[('\nE-mail, response to PolitiFact Texas, Catherine Clark, associate executive director, Texas Association of School Boards, March 2, 2011', 'https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/03022011_catherineclarkresponsepftexas.htm'), ('\nE-mail, response to PolitiFact Texas, Debbie Ratcliffe, communications director, Texas Education Agency, Feb. 25, 2011\n\nFortune, news article, ""Global 500, Our annual ranking of the world’s largest corporations,"" \xa02009 and July 26, 2010 and methodology summary/list of top-50 employers (received March 1, 2011)\n\nInterview, Peggy Johnson, associate dean for teacher education, Texas Tech University College of Education, Lubbock, Feb. 28, 2011', 'No link'), ('\nInterview, Dan Patrick, March 1, 2011', 'https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/02252011_txedagencyresponsepftexas.html%20'), ('\nInterview, Ken Zornes, executive director, Texas Business and Education Coalition, Austin, March 2, 2011\n\nTexas Conservative Coalition Research Institute, press release, ""TCCRI identifies more than $21 billion in budget cuts,"" and study, ""Blueprint for a Balanced Budget,""\nJan. 18, 2011 (accessed Feb. 28, 2011)\n\nTexas Education Agency, response to PolitiFact Texas, ""2009-2010 Staff Salaries and Full-Time Employee Counts -- Excluding Education Service Center Staff, Statewide Totals,"" and pocket edition, ""Texas Public School Statistics, 2008-09,"" received/accessed Feb. 25, 2011\n\nThe Texas Tribune, news post, ""Do Texas Schools Spend Too Much on Administration?""

Candidate says opponent using loophole to get tax deal
","
Political campaigns are often full of interesting claims, but this one had us chirping.

Larry Gause, candidate for chairman of Gwinnett County’s Board of Commissioners, recently sent out a flier and created a website full of claims against opponent Charlotte Nash.

The general theme is that Nash, Gwinnett’s administrator from 1995 to 2004, wants to be chair to ""feather"" the nest of herself and friends. He cites evidence such as Atlanta Journal-Constitution articles that reported a temporary arrangement to pay a retired police chief half of his $138,000 annual salary for a homeland security job that some county commissioners were unaware of.

Most of the claims were not new, but one piqued our interest. Gause accused Nash of using a ""loophole"" to get huge property tax breaks.

""How does she do it? She pretends to be a chicken farmer,"" Gause wrote.

Nash laughed off the accusation in a telephone interview, calling it ""typical campaign stuff.""

""It’s a part of the process,"" she added.

Gwinnett is Georgia’s second highest-populated county, and the chairman is the most politically powerful position. A special election for the position, previously held by Charles Bannister, who resigned under pressure, is scheduled for Tuesday.

Ethics are a big issue in Gwinnett County politics. One sitting county commissioner, Kevin Kenerly, was indicted last year on bribery charges. Bannister resigned his position last year amid the grand jury investigation that resulted in Kenerly’s indictment. Kenerly voluntarily suspended himself after the indictment. His term ended in December.

The race, which has received little attention, is heating up. Norcross resident Joe Newton has filed a complaint with the county’s Board of Assessors, charging Nash is receiving ""improper and unjustified tax credits"" and wants an investigation.

Nash owns two properties under scrutiny. Both are located in Dacula.

The larger property is more than 100 acres and has a market value of about $1.1 million, county tax records show. The records show Nash received about $14,000 in exemption savings last year and paid $1,862.74.

Gause said Nash is wrongly using a conservation use assessment exemption to get the tax break. The land was once a chicken farm, but it is now used to grow timber -- a legal exemption for the property, according to Gwinnett Tax Assessor Steven Pruitt, who has not endorsed a candidate in the race. The exemptions date back to 2005, county officials said.

Nash and her sister inherited the land after their mother died. They applied for the exemption, which gives tax breaks to individuals who use land for conservation purposes for at least 10 years. Land owners who develop the property must pay back twice the tax savings.

Pruitt said there are 1,046 properties with exemptions in Gwinnett. Pruitt said you can’t get an exemption if you have just one tree on the property or one horse. Properties larger than 2,000 acres cannot get an exemption. The exemptions must be approved by the county’s Board of Assessors.

We toured the site Thursday and saw scores of hardwood trees in the distance, ready for spring. Gause says Nash is not honoring the spirit of the assessment law -- arguing there’s little timber production going on there. Pruitt, however, said it could take 15 to 20 years before it is time to cut and sell the timber. Others we talked to agreed.

The other property is about 14 acres. It has a market value of $463,500, according to county records. Nash and her family received about $4,000 in exemptions for the property in 2010, records show. They paid about $2,800 in property taxes.

Pruitt said Nash has an agricultural exemption for that property because it is a farm. Gause told us Nash is playing loose with the exemption rules.

""I observed the property [twice],"" Gause wrote in an e-mail. ""There were no animals on the land. Not a horse, cow, pig or chicken. There were no crops growing. There was no farming equipment. I’ve worked on farms. I know what farms look like. Neither property is a farm.""

We also checked out that site Thursday and didn’t see any animals there. Pruitt said he has seen horses there and notes there is a barn.

""That’s how it qualifies [for an exemption],"" Pruitt said.

A short biography of Nash on a government website says she and her husband live ""on a chicken farm in the Harbins Community south of Dacula."" But that refers to a long-ago use of the property, Nash said. She said she has never claimed to be a chicken farmer, and her property tax exemptions have nothing to do with poultry.

So who’s right here? Nash says the land was once a chicken farm, but it is not anymore. Nash has an exemption for agricultural purposes for the smaller property -- where she is registered to vote -- and an exemption for timber purposes for the larger plot of land, the county assessor told us. The assessor’s office was unable by Thursday to share the original exemption paperwork with us.

Gause’s real point is whether Nash actually deserves the agricultural exemption. But he bases his argument on the claim that she ""pretends to be a chicken farmer."" We found no evidence of that.

We rate his statement as False.","[('\nLarry Gause for Chairman, ""Charlotte’s Documents""', 'http://www.larrygause.com/charlottes-documents.php'), ('\nE-mail from Larry Gause, March 9, 2011; telephone interview with Gause, March 9, 2011\n\nGeorgia Department of Revenue, Rules on Conservation Use Assessment for Agricultural or Timber Land', 'No link'), ('\nTelephone interview with Charlotte Nash, March 7, 2011\n\nTelephone interviews with Gwinnett County Tax Assessor Steven Pruitt, March 7, 8 and 10, 2011', 'https://etax.dor.ga.gov/ptd/cas/cuse/assmt.aspx#Requirements%20for%20Conservation%20Use%20Assessment%20for%20Agricultual%20or%20Timber%20Land')]",/factchecks/2011/mar/11/larry-gause/candidate-says-opponent-using-loophole-get-tax-dea/
"['Education', 'Florida', 'Thad Altman']","
During teacher bill debate, talk turns to student performance
","
A version of a controversial education bill that Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed in 2010 is being fast-tracked through the Florida Legislature in 2011, now that Crist is gone.

You could call SB 736 ""Son of SB 6.""

The bill, which would link raises for teachers to student performance and limit the length of teacher contracts to one year, passed the Senate, 26-12, three days into the annual legislative session. A companion bill is moving through the Florida House.

During floor debate prior to its passage on March 10, 2011, state Sen. Thad Altman, R-Rockledge, tried to offer an amendment that would give school districts flexibility in judging teachers who teach students who receive free or reduced lunch. The bill already offered leeway for judging English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and special-needs teachers.

Altman said he wanted to acknowledge the ""extra challenges"" that educators who teach students on free or reduced lunch have.

The idea, however, got a rise out of the lone Democratic supporter of the bill, Sen. Gary Siplin, D-Orlando.

""Are you saying just because a child is on free or reduced lunch, they need additional assistance?"" asked Siplin, who said that he -- like Gov. Rick Scott -- ""grew up in the projects"" and turned out all right.

Altman recoiled to say that wasn't his intent, and claimed that free and reduced lunch students are performing as well as their counterparts.

""Our poverty schools are performing just as well,"" Altman said.

Altman's amendment died by a voice vote, but since this debate will continue in the House, we thought it important to address his broader point. The question in this case: Are students receiving free and reduced lunch performing as well as students who don't?

The answer, on average, is no.

PolitiFact Florida researched student performance on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test for 2010 through data supplied by the Florida Department of Education.

FCAT exams are issued to students starting in the third grade. Exams measure student performance in writing, reading, math and science.

At every grade level, in every subject area tested, students receiving free or reduced lunch scored worse on average than those not receiving free or reduced lunch, according to FDOE statistics.

Here's an example. Students take the FCAT math exam each year starting in the third grade until they finish their sophomore year of high school. Fifth graders in 2010 scored a 336 on average. Those who received free or reduced lunch scored 323 on average, while those who did not scored 356. The same trend played out for every grade level.

We're attaching the summary reports for each test from 2010 so you can see for yourself. In each case, we sorted mean test results among all students, those who receive free or reduced lunch and those that do not.

View the reading results here.

View the math results here.

View the writing results here.

View the science results here.

The raw scores are a better apples-to-apples comparison of student performance than, say, a school's FCAT letter grade, because the letter grade adjusts for relative improvement and groups all students together. 
Altman said afterward that the point of his amendment was to be able to reward teachers who were helping poorer students compete and excel against their classmates. And he said that in his home of Brevard County there were examples of schools with high rates of students receiving free or reduced lunches who were performing as well as districts were students were better off. The current version of the bill, Altman said, draws no distinction for those high-performing teachers who are bucking the statewide trend. 
He said he hoped someone would carry forward a similar proposal when the debate moved to the House. 
Altman wanted to insert language in an education bill that would have given school districts more leeway to offer raises to teachers who instruct children receiving free or reduced lunch, saying it was important to acknowledge the ""extra challenges"" those teachers face. When pressed by Siplin if he was suggesting poor students aren't as smart as others, he said no -- that students receiving free or reduced lunch are performing as well as everyone else.

To be clear, we're only talking about test scores here, not capabilities or smarts.

Though in a roundabout way it may actually help his point, Altman made a general claim about student performance that contradicts the facts.  We rate it False. ",[],/factchecks/2011/mar/11/thad-altman/during-teacher-bill-debate-talk-turns-student-perf/

Tampa candidate Rose Ferlita says Bob Buckhorn wanted police to lock guns in their trunks
","
In a new television advertisement airing March 10, 2011, Tampa mayoral candidate Rose Ferlita's campaign claims Bob Buckhorn jeopardized police officers' lives by supporting a requirement that they keep their guns locked in the trunks of their cruisers.

This claim has come up in two previous political campaigns in Tampa, though this is the first time it has been attached to Buckhorn. Police and officials involved in the decision have twice said it is false.

Asked for the source of the statement, Ferlita campaign consultant Anthony Pedicini e-mailed PolitiFact Florida excerpts from several St. Petersburg Times and Tampa Tribune newspaper articles. They included a 1990 profile of Buckhorn that described his close relationship with then-Mayor Sandy Freedman, for whom he worked as a special assistant, and a 1996 article that quoted Freedman saying a political opponent’s claim about the guns-in-the-trunk issue was false. None of the news accounts mention Buckhorn in connection with the issue.

The first time the guns-in-the-trunk issue came up was February 1995, when Dick Greco raised it during his successful campaign to return to the mayor's office. Greco said at the time that police didn't like having to keep their shotguns locked in their trunks, but want them within easy reach in the passenger compartment.

The shotguns-in-the-trunk policy dated to the early 1990s, when Freedman was mayor. But city officials have said it was not the mayor's work. A safety committee made up of Tampa police officers and police management recommended that officers store shotguns in the trunks of their cruisers, then-city public safety administrator Bob Smith told the St. Petersburg Times in 1995.

""The placement of a shotgun in a police car has never been a political issue, and I don't think it should be,"" Smith said in the Feb. 11, 1995 article. ""The placement is based on safety and efficiency for the officer.""

Police cruisers had gotten smaller with each new model the city bought, and 1990s-era computers and bulky radio equipment were taking up much of the passenger area. The shotguns also couldn't obstruct either the driver- or passenger-side airbags, and officers didn't want them behind their heads, Smith said.  

That left little room but the trunk, Smith said.

The policy concerned only shotguns. Police still carried 9mm semiautomatic handguns.

In 1996, the issue came up again when Freedman and then-state Rep. Jim Davis faced off in a Democratic primary for a seat in Congress.

In a campaign mailing, Davis said putting the shotguns in the trunks of cruisers had endangered the lives of officers. Freedman was not named in the mailer, but a Davis aide confirmed at the time that the flier targeted her.

Then-Tampa police spokesman Steve Cole said in August 1996 that Davis incorrectly repeated a false rumor that blamed Freedman for making Tampa officers keep shotguns in their trunks.

""The mayor has nothing to do with the shotguns,"" Cole told the Times in the Aug. 29, 1996, article. ""There have always been rumors that Mayor Freedman ordered the shotguns in the trunk. . . . As far as (then) Chief (Bennie) Holder knows, that was never an order that was given. It was a rumor.""

Far from taking tools away from police, Cole said in 1996, it was Freedman who authorized the purchase of bulletproof vests and 9mm Glocks at the request of police officials, who said they were under-equipped with their .38-caliber revolvers.

Freedman said at the time she didn't even know about the shotgun-in-the-trunk policy until Greco raised it. She said on March 10 that neither she nor Buckhorn had anything to do with it.

""That’s an urban legend about the shotguns,"" said Freedman, who supports Buckhorn's bid for mayor. ""What happened is, we went to a different kind of car and they didn’t fit.""

Still, Freedman did make some decisions that upset officers. In 1988, she rescinded the policy that allowed officers to drive their cruisers home to save the city on expenses such as gas and insurance. In 1996, Greco made good on a campaign promise and reinstated the take-home cars.

Taking away officers' take-home cars -- like the shotguns in the trunk -- was an instance when Buckhorn took ""tools away from police"" while he was an aide to Freedman, Pedicini, Ferlita's campaign consultant, said on March 10. ""Those were all policies that he and Sandy worked on together.""

Pulling the plug on the take-home car program left officers frustrated, angry and bitter. But Freedman said the city faced a multimillion-dollar budget shortfall, and discontinuing the take-home car program saved money that she put into police raises and adding officers. And she said Buckhorn had nothing to do with her decision on the take-home cars.

""Was Bob the police chief and I missed it?"" she said. ""Bob was opposed to me taking the cars, but he wasn’t one of the principals making the decision.""

Ferlita’s ad says ""Buckhorn supported forcing police officers to keep their guns locked in the trunks of their cruisers."" Buckhorn worked for Freedman, yes, but the record shows that the shotgun-in-the-trunk policy came from police themselves, not from the mayor's office. Also, the policy in question concerned shotguns, not all guns. And officials have twice refuted this claim. As a result, we rate this statement False.","[('\nRose Ferlita campaign television commercial, air date of March 10, 2011', 'https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=1WpqWagYi63YdsrQPl8z1Boeyqrt6ceefZ6CC1L-R2S_vnCA4agGdoycHRYwt&hl=en'), ('\nInterview with former Tampa Mayor Sandy Freedman, March 10, 2011', 'No link'), ('\nInterview and e-mail correspondence with Ferlita campaign consultant Anthony Pedicini, March 10, 2011', 'https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=13i9Eg1bwaQZyD2fXKiOemdI3tFQScX0iuF0zJPDksEh8-h7yDXva7CCHTjwK&hl=en'), ('\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""Shotgun debate off mark, police say,"" Feb. 11, 1995; accessed from archives', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2011/mar/11/rose-ferlita/rose-ferlita-says-bob-buckhorn-wanted-police-lock/

Gov. John Kasich cites disparity between what private sector workers and city employees pay toward health benefits
","
Republicans in Ohio have offered a variety of arguments to justify their controversial effort to overhaul the state’s collective bargaining law, which for nearly 30 years has set the ground rules for public workers and their employers to reach labor agreements.

A new collective bargaining law, known as Senate Bill 5, is making is way through the state legislature with strong support from Republican Gov. John Kasich. The bill would scale back public workers’ rights at the bargaining table and has prompted unions to fight back with protests and promises to get even in the voting booth.

Kasich and Republicans say the current rules have resulted in costly labor pacts that cities and other local governments can no longer afford. As an example, Kasich pointed out the relatively low price public workers pay towards their employer-supported health care plans in a recent interview with Fox News.

""Our average private sector employee pays 23 percent for their health care,"" Kasich said. ""Our average city worker in Ohio pays 9 percent.""

Because that’s a pretty wide disparity, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor’s numbers.

We started with Kasich’s claim that private sector workers contribute 23 percent of their health care premiums. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols pointed us to a report from The Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a conservative think tank, titled ""The Grand Bargain is Dead.""

That study compared compensation paid to state workers and private sector employees and concluded that state workers’ pay is out of balance.

The state could cut into its projected $8 billion budget deficit if it could find ways to reduce their pay and benefits, the study noted. One suggestion it made: force government workers to pay the same health care premiums, out-of-pocket costs for carrying health insurance, as private sector workers.

""State government workers today pay roughly 17 percent of the premium costs for the health care coverage. The premium costs for private-sector workers in Ohio is 23 percent,"" the report said. More specifically, the report figures the average cost of family health insurance policies provided by Ohio firms is $11,425, with the employee paying $2,642.

The report cites a January 2010 e-mail with a U.S. Department of Labor economist as evidence for its claim. We contacted the economist, Miranda Moore, and she pointed us to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which has polled nearly 470,000 private firms in Ohio in 2008 and 2009 combined.

The numbers in the Buckeye Institute’s report were contained in the 2008 survey. The 2009 survey showed private sector workers in Ohio paid 31 percent of their premiums for a family policy. Moore said in an e-mail to us that the survey is a source the Employee Benefits Security Administration references often.

As for the premium percentage that city workers pay for health care, Kasich relied on a State Employment Relations Board report, Nichols said.

The 2010 Report on the Cost of Health Insurance in Ohio’s Public Sector aims to provide data that can be used during labor negotiations.

SERB surveyed every public employer in Ohio, including the state, cities, counties, school districts and state universities, about the costs of their medical premiums. Of 1,359 surveys sent out, SERB received 1,080 back, including nearly three quarters of the cities -- 184 out of 248.

SERB concluded that city workers in Ohio pay 8.1 percent of their health care coverage for single coverage and 8.3 percent for family coverage. Most of the plans include coverage for prescription drugs, but plans for dental and vision coverage typically are not included, the report said.

Kasich spokesman Scott Milburn said the governor used 9 percent instead of 8 percent to be on the safe side.

Kasich relied on government surveys for both parts of his statement, and the averages cited in those surveys match the numbers in his claim. We rate the statement True.","[('\nFox News, interview with Ohio Gov.

Michael Moore says 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined
","
Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore so admired the daily demonstrations against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker that he traveled from New York to Madison for one on March 5, 2011.

The liberal firebrand opened his speech by heaping praise on those fighting the Republican governor’s efforts to take collective bargaining powers from state and local government employees.

But he put more firepower into bashing the nation’s rich.

""Right now, this afternoon, just 400 Americans -- 400 -- have more wealth than half of all Americans combined,"" Moore avowed to tens of thousands of protesters.

""Let me say that again. And please, someone in the mainstream media, just repeat this fact once; we’re not greedy, we’ll be happy to hear it just once.

""Four hundred obscenely wealthy individuals, 400 little Mubaraks -- most of whom benefited in some way from the multi-trillion-dollar taxpayer bailout of 2008 -- now have more cash, stock and property than the assets of 155 million Americans combined.""

OK, we’ve repeated Moore’s declaration (including the reference to Hosni Mubarak, the former Egyptian president).

Now let’s see if what he asserts -- that 400 Americans ""have more wealth than half of all Americans combined"" -- is true.

Moore has made other staggering claims about the gap between the nation’s rich and poor. In Capitalism: A Love Story, his 2009 documentary, Moore said ""the richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined.""

He was awarded a Mostly True by our colleagues at PolitiFact National for that claim.

For his Madison speech, Moore posted a version of the text on his website. It included a link to back up his statement about the 400 wealthiest Americans. The link was to a blog post by Dave Johnson, a fellow at the Commonweal Institute, a California organization that says it promotes a progressive agenda.

Johnson wrote that in 2007, the combined net worth of the 400 wealthiest Americans, as measured by Forbes magazine, was $1.5 trillion; and the combined net worth of the poorer 50 percent of American households was $1.6 trillion.

Aside from using slightly different terminology than Moore did, Johnson’s numbers present two problems:

They’re four years old. And they indicate that the poorer 50 percent of American households had a higher net worth than the 400 richest Americans.

That’s the opposite of what Moore said in Madison.

We were referred to another item on Moore’s website that was posted two days after the Madison speech. It cites more recent figures, for 2009.

So, let’s start again.

In that item, Moore correctly quoted Forbes, which said in a September 2009 article that the net worth of the nation’s 400 wealthiest Americans was $1.27 trillion.

Forbes generates its list annually, using interviews, financial documents and other methods to tally their figures. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, with an estimated net worth of $50 billion, topped the 2009 list for the 16th consecutive year

The second part of Moore’s claim -- that the net worth of half of all Americans is less than that of the Forbes 400 -- is more complicated.

Moore cited a December 2010 Federal Reserve Board report that said the net worth for all U.S. households was $53.1 trillion in September 2009. That was the same month Forbes released its top 400 list.

That’s a starting point -- $53.1 trillion is the net worth for everybody.

Moore also cited a March 2010 ""working paper"" by Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University and Bard College. Wolff was a key source in Moore’s claim that was rated Mostly True by PolitiFact National.

Wolff’s paper said that as of July 2009, the three lowest quintiles of U.S. households -- in other words, the poorest 60 percent of U.S. households -- possessed 2.3 percent of the nation’s total net worth.

Moore then multiplied that 2.3 percent by the nation’s total net worth of $53.1 trillion and got $1.22 trillion.

In other words, he was saying the poorest 60 percent of U.S. households had $1.22 trillion in net worth, which is less than the $1.27 trillion in net worth for the Forbes’ 400 wealthiest Americans.

Of course, if the net worth of 60 percent of households is less than that of Forbes’ 400 wealthiest, the net worth of 50 percent of the households -- which is what Moore claimed -- would also be less.

We contacted Wolff, who said he had reviewed Moore’s calculations.

""As far as I can tell, they’re fine,"" he said.

Three economists -- Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics, Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Daniel Mitchell of the libertarian Cato Institute -- agreed.

We made one more check.

Since Moore’s statistics were for 2009, we sought figures for 2010.

The 2010 net worth of the Forbes 400 was $1.37 trillion, Forbes reported in September 2010. That same month, the total U.S. net worth was $54.9 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Board report cited by Moore.

Wolff hasn’t updated his 2009 figures. So we used his 2.3 percent figure again, multiplied by the 2010 total net worth of $54.9 trillion, and found that the net worth of the poorest 60 percent of U.S. households was $1.26 trillion in 2010.

That’s less than the 2010 net worth for the Forbes 400.

How could it be that 400 people have more wealth than half of the more than 100 million U.S. households?

Think of it this way. Many Americans make a good income, have some savings and investments, and own a nice home; they also have debt, for a mortgage, credit cards and other bills. Some people would still have a pretty healthy bottom line. But many -- including those who lost a job and their home in the recession -- have a negative net worth. So that drags down the total net worth for the poorer half of U.S. households that Moore cited.

We also want to add one cautionary note, from Mitchell of the Cato Institute, about Moore’s methodology: The Federal Reserve uses hard numbers to calculate the net worth of all households, but Forbes uses assumptions and interviews along with hard numbers in estimating the net worth of the Forbes 400.

There’s no way to know how the differences between the two affect the net worth numbers, but Moore used the data that are available and there’s no indication he ""cherry-picked"" figures for a desired result, Mitchell said.

With that caveat, our assessment indicates that as of 2009, the net worth of the nation’s 400 wealthiest individuals exceeds the net worth of half of all American households.

We rate Moore’s statement True.","[('\nAssociated Press, ""Michael Moore rallies Wis. pro-union protesters,"" March 5, 2011\n\nYouTube.com, video of Michael Moore speech, March 5, 2011\n\nAlterNet.org, Dave Johnson blog post, Feb. 14, 2011\n\nInterview and e-mail interview, Dave Johnson, March 7, 2011\n\nInterview and e-mail interview, Michael Moore spokesman Jonathan Schwartz, March 8 and 9, 2011\n\nInterview and e-mail interview, Brookings Institution economic studies senior fellow, Ron Haskins, March 9, 2011\n\nInterview and e-mail interview, New York University and Bard College economics professor Edward Wolff, March 9, 2011\n\nPolitiFact.com, ""Michael Moore movie says that top 1 percent owns more financial wealth than bottom 95 percent,"" Oct. 1, 2009\n\nMichaelMoore.com, ""The Forbes 400 vs everybody else,"" March 7, 2011\n\nForbes, ""The Forbes 400,"" Sept. 30, 2009\n\nBard College, ""Recent trends in household wealth in the United States"" by Edward Wolff, March 2010\n\nCNNMoney.com, ""Forbes 400: The super-rich get richer,""Sept. 22, 2010\n\nInterview, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis economic analyst Joe Mahon, March 9, 2011\n\nE-mail interview, University of California, Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, March 9, 2011\n\nE-mail interview, Paris School of Economics professor Thomas Piketty, March 10, 2011\n\nInterview, Cato Institute senior fellow Daniel Mitchell, March 10, 2011\n\nU.S. Census, number of U.S. households, 2000', 'http://hosted2.ap.org/APDefault/*/Article_2011-03-05-Wisconsin%20Budget%20Unions%20Protest/id-a3c8c14d8a2b49258a00f2912c45640f')]",/factchecks/2011/mar/10/michael-moore/michael-moore-says-400-americans-have-more-wealth-/

Mike Huckabee says single moms 'very poor, under-educated, can't get a job'
","
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a possible contender for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, caused a firestorm when he criticized movie star Natalie Portman.

Speaking to conservative radio host Michael Medved, Huckabee said, ""One of the things that is troubling is that people see a Natalie Portman or some other Hollywood starlet who boasts of, 'Hey look, we're having children, we're not married, but we're having these children, and they're doing just fine.’ But there aren't really a lot of single moms out there who are making millions of dollars every year for being in a movie.""
   
After the comment hit the wider airwaves, Huckabee posted the following comment on the website of HuckPac, his political action committee.
   
""In a recent media interview about my new book, A Simple Government, I discussed the first chapter, ‘The Most Important Form of Government Is a Father, Mother, and Children,’"" he wrote.  ""I was asked about Oscar-winner Natalie Portman's out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Natalie is an extraordinary actor, very deserving of her recent Oscar, and I am glad she will marry her baby's father. However, contrary to what the Hollywood media reported, I did not ‘slam’ or ‘attack’ Natalie Portman, nor did I criticize the hardworking single mothers in our country. My comments were about the statistical reality that most single moms are very poor, under-educated, can't get a job, and if it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death. That's the story that we're not seeing, and it's unfortunate that society often glorifies and glamorizes the idea of having children out of wedlock.""
   
A reader suggested we check into the ""statistical reality"" of single mothers. So we did.
   
The best statistics we found to analyze this issue come from a Census Bureau data set called ""America’s Families and Living Arrangements: 2010.""

One way of analyzing the question comes from a table of statistics detailing living arrangements for children under 18 years and the marital status of their parents. These statistics, released in November 2010, offer per-child data. Other tables look at the data from the point of view of the households, rather than the children. Either way, the statistics are broadly similar.
   
We’ll take Huckabee’s claims one by one.
   
""Most single moms are very poor.""

While only a minority of children in single-mother households officially live below the poverty level, the income picture still isn’t rosy.
   
All told, 43 percent of such children are officially in households below the poverty level, and an additional 28 percent are in households that earn less than twice the poverty level. Less than a third -- 30 percent -- live in households that earn more than that.
   
By contrast, only 13 percent children in dual-parent households (whether married or not) live in households that are at or below the poverty level. An additional 19 percent live in households that have less than twice the poverty level. A full 68 percent live in households with incomes double the poverty level or higher.
   
Looked at by household, slightly under 40 percent of single-mother households are officially below the poverty level.

There is no accepted definition of ""very poor,"" so the claim is hard to nail down. But children in single-mother households are more than twice as likely as those in dual-parent households to be part of families that earn less than twice the poverty level. So Huckabee has a point on this statistic.
   
Most single moms are ""under-educated.""

Like ""very poor,"" the term ""under-educated"" is somewhat subjective. But we’ll look at the educational patterns for single moms and dual-parent households.
   
Nineteen percent of children in single-mother households have a mom who failed to earn a high-school diploma, compared to 67 percent who graduated high school and/or attended some college, and 14 percent who have a college degree or higher. The comparable figures for children in dual-parent households is 8 percent with less than a high-school diploma, 47 percent with a high school degree and/or some college, and 45 percent with a college degree or higher.
   
So it’s true that children with single moms are more than twice as likely those of dual-parent households to be the child of a high-school dropout. On the other hand, a full 81 percent of children of single moms have a mom who graduated from high school. That’s lower than the 92 percent rate for dual-parent households, but it still seems a stretch to say that ""most"" single moms are ""under-educated.""
   
 Most single moms ""can't get a job.""
   
In single-mother households, 74 percent of moms are considered ""in the labor force,"" compared to 26 percent who are ""not in the labor force.""
   
Being ""in the labor"" force means that you are either working or are trying to. So we have to look to a separate statistic from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to see whether single moms are actually being employed, rather than merely trying.
   
The data shows that in 2009, about 66 percent of single moms were employed, with an unemployment rate of 13.6 percent. (The employment rate was higher and the unemployment rate was lower the previous year, before the worst of the recession hit.)
   
How does employment compare between single moms and married moms? According to calculations for PolitiFact by Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, the data show that single moms are actually likelier to work than married moms.
   
For mothers with the youngest child under age 6, nearly 68 percent are in the labor force -- that is, either working or looking for work. The comparable number for married moms living with their spouses is 62 percent. For those with the youngest child between 6 and 17 years of age, 79 percent of single moms were in the labor force, compared to 77 percent of married moms.
   
Burtless found that rates of actual employment are also very close between the two groups.
   
""The crucial thing he missed -- and that many Republicans don’t seem to understand -- is that a lot of those mothers do work,"" said Ron Haskins, who as a Republican congressional staffer helped write the 1996 welfare reform bill. ""The government has done a lot to basically force them to work. That was the essence of welfare reform.""
   
So, any way you look at it, a large majority of single moms are both part of the workforce and are successful at getting jobs. On this statistic, Huckabee is completely off base.
   
""If it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death.""

Among children with single mothers, 41 percent get food stamps and 59 percent don’t. By contrast, 11 percent in dual-parent households get food stamps and 89 percent do not.
   
Meanwhile, 10 percent of children in single-mother households get other kinds of cash assistance while 90 percent do not. For those in dual-parent households, 2 percent get cash assistance and 98 percent do not. (The statistics can vary depending on how you define cash assistance; we’re going by the Census Bureau’s definition.)

Looked at by household, 32 percent of single-mother households get food stamps, while 16 percent get cash assistance.
   
So while the rates of food stamp and public assistance use are certainly higher among single-mother households, they still represent a minority of single-mother households. It seems like a stretch for Huckabee to say that ""most"" kids of single-mother households would starve without public assistance.
   
""Single mothers are a highly disadvantaged group in many ways,"" said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""But they are not quite so badly off as Huckabee says. In fact, a large majority of them are managing to remain gainfully employed even in the depths of this terrible economy.""

What is meant by 'single mothers'?

Douglas J. Besharov, a University of Maryland public policy professor who was previously a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the numbers we found didn't surprise him much, though he did note that some people use the term ""single mother"" to mean ""mother who had a child while single."" To be extra cautious, we checked out this category separately.

The best number we could find to approximate that group was the ""never married"" statistic, which excludes mothers who became single as a result of being widowed, separated, divorced or abandoned by a spouse.

We found that the numbers are somewhat more dire for this subgroup than they are for single mothers as a whole, but not dramatically so. On education, 24 percent had less than a high-school diploma, compared to 19 percent for all single moms. Food stamp use was 50 percent, compared to 41 percent for all single moms, and 14 percent got public assistance, compared to 10 percent for all single moms. A full 70 percent of never-married single moms were in the work force, compared to 74 percent for all single moms.

The one factor that showed the biggest variation was poverty. More than half -- 51 percent -- of never-married single moms are officially at the poverty line, and an additional 26 percent are between 100 percent and 200 percent of the poverty level. That compares to 43 percent of all single moms officially below the poverty level and an additional 28 percent at less than twice the poverty level. But this was already the statistic where Huckabee was closest to being right.

Our conclusion

Even if the numbers for never-married moms had been dramatically different, we don't think it would justify Huckabee's comment, since the his wording didn’t distinguish among types of single moms. We should also note that Portman has said she plans to marry the baby’s father, so she would actually fit best into the ""living with both parents, not married to each other"" category, which we included in our ""dual-parent household"" category, not the ""single-mother"" category.

So where does this leave us? There’s a pretty strong case that Huckabee is right about poverty in single-mother households. But his claims about educational attainment and government assistance are exaggerated, and the majority of kids living with single moms put food on the table without public assistance. And one claim is flat-out wrong -- that single moms aren’t able to get jobs. Lots of single mothers do -- often in higher rates than married moms. On balance, we rate Huckabee’s statement Barely True.","[('\nMike Huckabee, ""The Most Important Form of Government Is A Father, Mother and Children"" (blog post at HuckPAC.com), March 04, 2011\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, America’s Families and Living Arrangements (Table C3 -- Living Arrangements of Children Under 18 Years and Marital Status of Parents, by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin and Selected Characteristics of the Child for All Children), 2010\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, ""Employment Characteristics of Families, 2009"" (news release), May 27, 2010\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, Employment Status of Women, by Marital Status and Presence and Age of Children, 2009\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement (POV26: Program Participation Status of Household - Poverty Status of People: 2009), released 2010\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement (POV03: People in Families with Related Children Under 18 by Family Structure, Age, and Sex, Iterated by Income-to-Poverty Ratio and Race: 2009), released 2010\n\nWall Street Journal, ""Mike Huckabee Calls Natalie Portman’s Pregnancy ‘Troubling,’"" March 4, 2011\n\nUSA Today, ""Huckabee: No \'attack\' on Natalie Portman,"" March 6, 2011\n\nUS Weekly, ""Mike Huckabee slams Natalie Portman for pregnancy,"" March 4, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, March 9, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Arloc Sherman, senior researcher with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, March 9, 2011\n\nInterview with Ron Haskins, co-director of the Brookings Center on Children and Families, March 10, 2011\n\nInterview with Douglas J.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum said Obama said ""any child"" born prematurely ""can be killed""
","
It may seem early to some voters, but a few Republicans candidates for the 2012 presidential race are already on the trail in Iowa, the first caucus state. One is Rick Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania.

Santorum recently spoke at a forum hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, emphasizing that conservatives need to remain committed to social values, even though many expect the economy to be the most pressing issue of the election cycle.

Opposition to abortion is particularly important, he said. ""Any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed,"" Santorum said, according to a column by Dana Milbank in the Washington Post.

That’s a strong charge, so we decided to check it out. We turned to video from the forum to get Santorum’s complete comments.

Part of his comments touched on the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, a federal law he sponsored in the Senate. ""It said that if a child was born out of a, quote, botched abortion, then that child is entitled to medical protection, entitled to treatment,"" Santorum said.

Several states decided to copy the law. Santorum noted that Barack Obama, then an Illinois state legislator, opposed the state version of the law in Illinois.

Obama ""stood up and said that he opposed this bill because it would impinge on a woman’s rights under Roe v. Wade, and said, in fact, that any child prior to nine months of gestation would be able to be killed, otherwise it would impinge on Roe v. Wade,"" Santorum said. (See Santorum’s comments on C-SPAN.)

""Any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed,"" Santorum said. ""Now who’s the extremist in the abortion debate?""

We researched Obama’s position on ""born alive"" legislation extensively during the presidential campaign. Obama favors abortion rights generally, and he opposed the state version of Illinois’ ""born alive"" measure as a state senator. But he never said that premature children, even those who survived an abortion, could be killed.

'Born Alive' in Illinois

When Obama was a state senator, abortion opponents proposed ""born alive"" legislation in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The proposals’ intent was to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion. The legislation, which included multiple bills, specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is ""born alive"" and ""shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law.""

The bills' supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books, deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect. (One of the bills' strongest supporters was a nurse who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms.) Abortion-rights proponents, on the other hand, said the legislation was a back-door attempt to stop legal abortions.

Illinois already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus — meaning able to survive outside of the mother's body — then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion. The new laws didn't distinguish between viable and nonviable, meaning that an infant of any age that survived an abortion should receive care.

Obama, along with other Democrats in the Illinois legislature, opposed the ""born alive"" laws every time they came up. Over the years, Obama offered several reasons he opposed the legislation.  

Back in 2001, legislative transcripts show that Obama questioned part of the ""born alive"" legislation package because he said it would be struck down by the courts for giving legal status to fetuses. In 2002, Obama discussed a different aspect of the legislation, which required a second doctor be present at abortions. Obama said he thought that legislation was intended to make abortion more difficult to obtain, not to provide better care for the ""born alive."" There is no record of his remarks in 2003 because the bill never made it out of committee, and the committee proceedings were not recorded.

The 'neutrality' clause debated

The federal legislation (the law Santorum sponsored in the Senate) became law in 2002. The federal legislation included a so-called ""neutrality clause,"" which said the law would not change the legal status or legal rights of anyone prior to being ""born alive."" Abortion rights advocates said the clause was necessary to make sure the bill would not affect current abortion laws.

Obama said as far back as 2004 that he would have supported the federal bill and that he would have supported the Illinois versions if they had included a similar neutrality clause. The laws the full Illinois Senate voted on in 2001 and 2002 did not have such a clause, but 2003 is a different story.

The National Right to Life Committee said during the 2008 campaign that the Illinois bill of 2003 did have a neutrality clause. The committee said Obama subsequently misrepresented the bill. Obama responded to that charge in an August 2008 interview.

""I hate to say that people are lying, but here's a situation where folks are lying,"" Obama said. ""I have said repeatedly that I would have been completely in, fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported, which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion.""

Back in 2008, we requested documentation from the Illinois State Archives about the 2003 bill and found that it did have a neutrality clause, as the National Right to Life Committee said. (The clause was added at the committee level, and those records are not available online. But we have posted the documents we received via fax from the State Archives here). But there is an important caveat to add here: We don't know what the discussion was at the 2003 committee meeting because the proceedings weren't recorded, but it seems likely that the federal neutrality clause was not considered sufficient at the state level, because the 2005 Illinois law that eventually passed included a more extensive neutrality clause than the federal legislation. To read more about the differences between the neutrality clauses, read our previous detailed fact-check here.

Obama’s comments

With Santorum reviving the issue of ""born alive"" legislation, we went back again to check the transcripts from the Illinois legislature. Obama did say he opposed the bill because it wouldn’t pass constitutional muster under Roe v. Wade. But he never said that ""any child prior to nine months of gestation would be able to be killed"" or that ""any child born prematurely …  can be killed,"" as Santorum said.

In fact, Obama said in 2001 that there were ""a number of members who are typically in favor of a woman’s right to choose an abortion (who) were actually sympathetic to some of the concerns"" raised by supporters of the legislation.

In 2002, Obama said that he thought Illinois already had laws sufficient to ensure that children that survived abortion received care. The proposed law would have required two doctors instead of one in the case of a live birth to ensure that care would be provided. ""If these are children who are being born alive, I, at least, have confidence that a doctor who is in the room is going to make sure that they’re looked after,"" Obama said then.

At no time did Obama say that children born prematurely can be legally killed.

We contacted Santorum’s political action committee, America’s Foundation, for comment. Spokeswoman Virginia Davis said that Obama’s votes against the state measure showed he supported killing children who were born alive.

""By his statements and votes, (fully documented by the lead advocate of this legislation in Illinois and at the federal level), and as verified by Factcheck.org, then-state Senator Barack Obama several times voiced opposition to, and voted against legislation that, protected a child scheduled to be aborted -- and was born alive -- from being killed,"" David said via e-mail.

We should note that the Factcheck.org report noted Obama’s positions on the Illinois measures but reiterated his support for the federal legislation. ""Whether opposing ‘born alive’ legislation is the same as supporting ‘infanticide,’ however, is entirely a matter of interpretation,"" the report noted.

 Our ruling

To reiterate what’s not in dispute: Obama opposed ""born alive"" legislation in Illinois and gave several reasons for opposing the proposals. But at no time did he make the argument that infants who survived botched abortions should be killed.

Santorum may feel that abortion is tantamount to infanticide, but that does not give him the license to put words in Obama's mouth that he never uttered. Santorum said, ""Any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed."" Obama didn’t say that. In fact, he said that abortion should be legal, but that children that are born should receive medical care. Obama never said that any child born prematurely can be killed or anything like that. Santorum crosses a line with his rhetoric in distinguishing the difference between his position and Obama’s. We rate Santorum’s statement Pants on Fire.","[('\nCSPAN, Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, March 7, 2011\n\nThe Washington Post, With Pawlenty\'s Iowa speech, a side of syrup, March 9, 2011\n\nSlate, Roemermentum in Iowa, March 8, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, ""Born alive"" votes fuel abortion fight, Oct. 9, 2008\n\nIllinois General Assembly, Regular Session Senate Transcript , March 30, 2001\n\nIllinois General Assembly, Regular Session Senate Transcript , April 4, 2002\n\nIllinois General Assembly, Born Alive Senate Bills , 2001\n\nIllinois General Assembly, Born Alive Senate Bills , 2002\n\nIllinois General Assembly, Born Alive Senate Bills , 2003\n\nU.S. Government Printing Office (federal law), Born Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002\n\nThomas, Born Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002\n\nCurrent Illinois state law regarding abortion\n\nIllinois General Assembly, Born Alive Act , passed 2005\n\nBarack Obama campaign Web site, federal versus state ""Born Alive"" factcheck , June 30, 2008\n\nBarack Obama campaign Web site, Born Alive legislation factsheet , Aug. 19, 2008\n\nBarack Obama campaign Web site, Reckless accusations of infanticide\n\nChicago Tribune, Obama\'s record on abortion hit , Aug. 20, 2002\n\nChicago Tribune, A big split over abortion, stem cells, Oct. 4, 2004, accessed via Nexis\n\nNational Right to Life Committee, White Paper on Barack Obama and born alive legislation , Aug. 28, 2008\n\nCBNNews.com, Obama gets heated on born alive protection act, Aug. 16, 2008\n\nThe Associated Press, Obama comments on late term abortions , July 4, 2008', 'http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/IowaF')]",/factchecks/2011/mar/10/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-said-obama-said-any-child-born-prema/

Gov. Rick Scott says for every 85 tourists, one job is created in the state
","
While snowstorms, blizzards and sub-zero wind chills have been the norm throughout the United States this winter, we're enjoying balmy breezes and temperatures above 70 degrees in the Sunshine State. At one point, in fact, Florida had the distinction of being the only U.S. state untouched by snow, according to the National Weather Service.

Hoping to appeal to a frost-fatigued nation, Florida Gov. Rick Scott kicked off the ""Share a Little Sunshine Tour"" at a March 1, 2011, event in Orlando. Joined by a group of ""Sunshine Ambassadors,"" Scott made stops in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Chicago, hoping to bring attention to the state with promotional events and Florida vacation prize give-aways.

""Tourism is an important economic engine for Florida and employs nearly one million residents,"" Scott wrote in a Feb. 28 press release touting the ""Share a Little Sunshine"" campaign.

""I am proud to lead VISIT FLORIDA’s Share a Little Sunshine campaign to bring more visitors to the Sunshine State,"" Scott wrote. ""We know that every 85 visitors create one Florida job, so I urge all Floridians to join with me in supporting this effort to increase jobs and grow the state’s economy.""

In a state reeling from an 11.9 percent unemployment rate, we wondered whether Scott’s claim about the rate of jobs created by tourists was true?

""It’s simple math,"" said Kathy Torian, spokeswoman for Visit Florida, the state’s tourism marketing agency.

In a March 7 phone interview, Torian said Scott’s figure was based on calculations using the number of tourists who visited Florida in 2010, divided by the number of Floridians employed in the leisure and hospitality industry.

In 2010, 82.6 million tourists visited Florida, according to figures compiled by Visit Florida, with roughly one million Floridians employed in the leisure and hospitality industry. (The actual number, according the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is 928,000 as of December 2010.) If we use the million-workers figure, the ratio is 82.6 tourists per job. If we use the BLS job count, it's 89 tourists per job.

We asked Torian how Visit Florida counts jobs and tourists, and found that both are estimates. Torian said the jobs count is pulled from the state Agency for Workforce Innovation and is seasonally adjusted. The employment categories used are air transportation; travel arrangement and reservation services; arts, entertainment and recreation; and accommodation and food services. Year-round residents and business travelers, not just tourists, contribute to those employment categories, too, of course. But we agree they are heavily tourist-dependent.

To count tourists, the agency uses a method developed in 1999 that tracks visitors at 14 airports and applies a ratio of air to non-air visitors (meaning drivers). Foreign visitors are tracked through various travel research businesses. You can see the methodology here. For estimates of hard-to-track items like tourists and tourism-related jobs, the methods appear reasonable.

Those figures may not exactly create an 85:1 ratio, but Torian said the governor was likely relying on previous numbers from 2007 when 84.5 million visitors made their way to the Sunshine State. The 85 tourists creating one job is a figure that has also been used in the past by Visit Florida executives such as this February 2011 press release. 
Scott said, ""We know that every 85 visitors create one Florida job."" While the number of tourists may have dropped off some since 2007, the proportion of tourism-driven jobs to tourists is still close to the ratio he touted. We rate this claim True.","[('\nPress release, ""Florida Governor Scott to Help ‘Share a Little Sunshine’,"" Feb. 28, 2011\n\nTelephone interview, Kathy Torian, spokeswoman, Visit Florida, March 7, 2011\n\nVisit Florida, ""Research: Calendar Year Visitors,"" viewed March 7, 2011\n\nSun-Sentinel, ""It\'s cold here, but at least we\'re only state without snow,"" Jan. 13, 2011\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Florida Unemployment Rate,"" December 2010\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Florida Economy at a Glance,"" December 2010', 'http://www.flgov.com/2011/02/28/florida-governor-scott-to-help-%E2%80%98share-a-little-sunshine%E2%80%99/')]",/factchecks/2011/mar/10/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-every-85-tourists-one-job-crea/
