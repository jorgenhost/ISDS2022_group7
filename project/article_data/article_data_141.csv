Rep. Sondy Pope says increases in education funding won’t catch up to previous levels for 12 years
","
Democrats in the state Legislature were unimpressed when Gov. Scott Walker announced that his second budget would modestly boost school aids he cut substantially in his first.

""At this pace, it will take nearly 12 years to return to the funding commitment the state made before Walker’s devastating cuts,"" state Rep. Sondy Pope, D-Cross Plains, said in a news release with state Sen. John Lehman, D-Racine. She made the same point in media interviews.

Pope, the ranking Democrat on the Assembly’s Education Committee and a state lawmaker since 2002, put it in terms a parent of a school-age child might appreciate:

""That means a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in his or her education as those that came before them until they are graduating from high school,"" her release said.

The proposed increase is not enough for schools to make ends meet, Pope told reporters as details were leaked in advance of Walker’s 2013-’15 budget proposal.

We won’t judge the impact of Walker’s moves here, but we were interested in whether Pope correctly described the math when talking about how long it would take to restore the aid cuts Walker made in the 2011-’13 budget cycle.

Let’s take a look.

State aid is the biggest source of funds for public school districts, which also rely on local property taxes.

Pope refers to ""equalized"" aids, the most common form of general state school aids. They are calculated through a formula designed to minimize the differences among school districts’ abilities to raise revenue. Some districts have more property tax wealth than others, as the Legislative Fiscal Bureau puts it. Hence the term ""equalized.""

Schools have seen significantly less equalized aid in recent years, even before Walker. His predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, cut equalized aid in his final budget, for 2009-’11, setting it back to a level not seen since 2005-’06. So Walker cut from an already diminished base.

Pope’s office showed us their math behind the ""nearly 12 years"" comment.

It’s based on comparing what Walker’s first budget allocated to the last two-year budget under Jim Doyle.

The difference is $944 million. Now Walker wants to add back about $129 million in equalized aid over two years. At that pace, it would appear it’s going to be at least 12 years to fill the hole.

But that’s not quite how Madison budget math works.

We asked two budget experts to look at this. David Loppnow at the Fiscal Bureau, the Legislature’s nonpartisan scorekeeper, calculated that it would be about nine years at that pace to get back to the pre-Walker aid levels.

Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, pegged it at between eight and nine years.

Part of the difference, we found, was that Pope spoke before Walker had released details of how he would structure the $129 million boost. Pope’s office made assumptions on how the money would be divided up between the two years, and was off in its guess.

The timing affects the calculation because the figure in year two of the budget is the base upon which the next year’s increase builds on.

Loppnow said it was understandable, for that reason, that Pope came up with a different number.

But the biggest reason for the numbers gap, we found, was that Pope’s method doesn’t account for Walker having added back some funds in year two of his first budget, somewhat alleviating the big aid cut in his first year.

And that information was available before Walker released details.

Our rating

Pope said it would take Walker ""nearly 12 years"" to make up for his previous cuts in general school aids, based on the pace he set in his proposed 2013-’15 budget.

The best number is about eight or nine years, we heard from two experts. That’s when, as Pope put it, a student will ""enjoy the same state investment in his or her education"" as a student in pre-Walker days.

So it’s more like middle school or freshman year of high school, not graduation.

We rate her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C487180>],/factchecks/2013/mar/03/sondy-pope/rep-sondy-pope-says-increases-education-funding-wo/

Chris Christie says number of private-sector jobs growing in New Jersey
","

When it comes to private-sector jobs, New Jersey’s numbers are just getting better and better, according to Gov. Chris Christie.

Job growth in New Jersey was just one of the topics Christie highlighted Tuesday when he presented a $32.9 billion budget for fiscal year 2013-2014 to the state Legislature.

""Since January 2010, New Jersey has added 103,000 new private sector jobs,"" Christie said. ""The last two years -- 2011 and 2012 -- have been the best two years of private sector job growth since 1999.""

Is the state finally seeing some sustained job growth since the official end of the recession more than three years ago? We determined that the governor’s numbers are generally correct, but his timeframe is off slightly.

Let’s look at official jobs numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The total number of private-sector jobs in New Jersey in February 2010 – the first full month the governor was in office – was 3,197,600. The number in December 2012 was 3,300,800. That’s a net gain of 103,200 jobs.

If we measure from January 2010 to December 2012, the net gain is 97,600 private-sector jobs.

""While the Governor may have slipped in saying we grew 103,200 private sector jobs since January 2010, he has always otherwise cited the state’s job growth since February 2010, his first full month in office,"" spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an e-mail. ""Aside from being the Governor’s first full month in office, February 2010 also is an important point in time because it marks the low point for private sector employment during the recession.""

Now let’s look at private-sector job growth during the past two years, since Christie said it’s the best it’s been since 1999.

If 2011 and 2012 gains are combined, the total number of private-sector jobs added in New Jersey is 79,500 jobs (33,400 in 2011 and 46,100 in 2012), according to data from the BLS and Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor with the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.

The combined total confirms that the two years are the best for private-sector job growth in New Jersey since 1999, when the state added 99,500 private-sector jobs.

Overall the news is upbeat, Seneca told us.

""This represents a strong and highly encouraging trend,"" Seneca said in an e-mail. ""There is still a distance to go to recover all the private sector jobs lost during the recession (248,000 jobs were lost from the state’s previous peak level in January 2008 to the trough level reached in February 2010).""

Seneca also noted that the nation’s private-sector job gains are quite a bit higher, but that has to do, in part, with ""strong job growth in several of the energy producing states,"" he said. 
The liberal New Jersey Policy Perspective noted Friday that the state still has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.

""New Jersey is still mired in the basement with the 4th highest unemployment rate in the nation. Worse, we’re one of only two states that saw its rate increase from 2011 (from 9.4 to 9.5),"" NPP president Gordon MacInnes said in a statement after the BLS on Friday released the 2012 annual average unemployment rates for each state. ""This should pour ice water on New Jersey’s leaders. The problem is not tax rates - the problem is jobs.""


Our ruling

Christie said during his budget address Tuesday that, ""Since January 2010, New Jersey has added 103,000 new private sector jobs. The last two years -- 2011 and 2012 -- have been the best two years of private sector job growth since 1999.""

The governor is right that New Jersey has gained 103,000 new private-sector jobs since 2010, but that’s counting from February 2010, his first full month in office. He cited job growth from January 2010.

Christie also is correct that 2011 and 2012 represent the best two years of private-sector job growth since 1999, according to BLS data and calculations from a Rutgers University economist.

We rate his claim Mostly True.

Leader of Alliance for Safe Communities says employers can get thousands of dollars in tax breaks and bond money to hire convicted felons
","
The Rhode Island General Assembly is considering legislation that would prohibit employers from asking job applicants if they have a criminal history. 
They could ask finalists if they have ever been in trouble with the law, but they could not deny a job because of an applicant’s criminal history, unless the crime was directly related to the type of job being sought.

The measure is designed to prevent discrimination against people who have paid their debt to society. Supporters say ex-convicts who have a good job are less likely to break the law again.

Carolyn Medeiros, executive director of the Alliance for Safe Communities, was on WHJJ's ""Helen Glover Show"" Feb. 18 to express opposition to the proposal, saying the offenders pose an extra risk to employers and the community and shouldn't get preference over job seekers who have kept out of trouble.

""We're bending over backwards here for a minority of people,"" she said. ""Think of the other things that are afforded to them, Helen. There's a tax credit of $2,400 to bond them that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon. There's a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. And there's federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses.

""I think we're doing plenty to help out this population,"" she said.  ""I think we need to worry about the law-abiding citizen's fight to get a job now, and that should be at the top of our priority list.""

Do employers really get thousands of dollars in tax breaks and bond money for hiring convicted felons? And does the government offer special small business grants for ex-cons?

We contacted Medeiros, who quickly referred us to various links on her website at ASC-RI.org. You can find them at the bottom of the ""Re-entry, 'Fast and Furious Nationwide'"" section of the site.

We’ll start with the third part of her statement -- ""there's federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses"" -- because it’s the simplest to judge.

The ""Federal small business grants for convicted felons"" section of her page has links to two websites. The first explicitly says, ""there are no grants set up to help felons start their own business"" and ""Felons are at a disadvantage when they apply for grants, but that doesn't preclude them from applying."" The second says exactly the same thing.

So Medeiros' owns sources contradict that part of her statement.

Second, let's look at her statement that ""There's a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon.""

Her web page has a link to an unsourced document on the Alliance website, which, she says, came from another source.

We tracked down what the document was talking about and found that employers do not, as Medeiros said, get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. Instead, employers can get a free bond -- the equivalent of an insurance policy worth $5,000 to $25,000 -- to cover the expenses of an ex-convict going rogue. The Federal Bonding Program is financed by the U.S. Department of Labor and administered by individual states.

Laura Hart, spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, said $5,000 is the typical value of the seldom-used bonds given out in Rhode Island ""and it is only to insure the employer against theft, not against any other kind of behavior.""

The employer must contact DLT after the ex-felon has been offered a job to arrange for the bond, and the potential employee must meet with DLT.

""All the bonding does is provide a different level of assurance to an employer to try to reconnect this particular population to the work force. Is anybody making money off this bond? The employer isn't,"" Hart said.

Finally, Medeiros’ claim that ""there's a tax credit of $2,400 to bond [former inmates] that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon"" is mostly correct.

She erred in characterizing it as a bond. It's a tax credit. Called the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, it is designed to encourage employers to hire people in a variety of categories, including veterans, food stamp and welfare recipients, and, most importantly for our purposes, ""an individual who has been convicted of a felony and has a hiring date that is not more than 1 year after the conviction or release from prison.""

The credit can only be taken for the first year the ex-felon is on the job. The amount of the credit is capped at $2,400.

Our ruling

Carolyn Medeiros of the Alliance for Safe Communities said, ""There's a tax credit of $2,400 to bond [former inmates] that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon. There's a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. And there's federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses.""

She was mostly correct about the tax credit (although it doesn't involve a bond). But she was wrong on the other two points.

Because her statement contains some element of truth but gets some critical facts wrong, we rate it Mostly False.

Is the average age of entry into sex trafficking between 12 and 14 years old?
","
Statistics about sex trafficking, especially about minors, are notoriously difficult to document. For example, this newspaper once tried to show whether Portland is the child sex trafficking hub thatelected officials and national media say it is, only to find that nobody really knew.

PolitiFact Oregon likes statistics and we like to know where they come from, especially when politicians use those statistics to shape public policy. Which is how we’ve come to Multnomah County Commissioner Diane McKeel, an east county resident who has made combating human trafficking, especially child sex trafficking, a priority.

McKeel told columnist Elizabeth Hovde, who writes for The Oregonian’s editorial page, that the average age of entry into the sex trade industry is 12 to 14. It’s not the first time McKeel has cited the statistic. In a 2010 guest column about at-risk girls, she also wrote that ""studies show the average age of entry into prostitution is 12 to 14 years old.""

A statistical average between 12 and 14? Wouldn’t that mean a large number under 12? Also, was she talking about the average age of entry for all trafficked prostitutes, including adults? Or just juveniles?

She clarified in an interview that, ""the issue for me is the commercial exploitation of children. The average age of entry is 12 to 14. This is about our children being bought and sold on the street.""

The analysis 
The commissioner’s office provided us with numerous links. Many of the sources go back to a 2001 University of Pennsylvaniastudy.

It’s big and fat and the number in question is on page 92, under the section ""ages of first  intercourse and entry into juvenile prostitution."" The age range of entry for boys ""was somewhat younger than that of the girls, i.e. 11-13 years vs. 12-14 years, respectively."" We emailed Dr. Richard Estes, the lead author, to learn more about sample size and methodology.

His response was not illuminating. ""Any numbers you come across, even mine, represent best estimates of the situation. Because of the secretive and hidden nature of the problem it simply is not possible to get an accurate ‘head count.’""

Another widely cited report comes from a Vancouver, Wash., based group called Shared Hope International. The2009 reportstates that ""research has shown that the average age of entry into prostitution and pornography is 12 to 14 years old in the United States.""

There’s no research citation, but there is a pie chart breaking down age of entry into prostitution, based on a Clark County, Nevada, survey of girls arrested for prostitution-related offenses. The 96 girls were ages 11 to 17. We did the math, and the average we got was 14.96, almost 15 years old. That’s young, but not 12 or 13.

Our email requesting clarification got no response from Shared Hope. We were stumped.

We scoured the Internet for more sources, reading abstracts and tracking down anyone who might have a clue. A criminology professor we queried wrote back saying that ""good estimates are hard to find, and good data are harder yet"" and wished us luck. He directed us to yet another paper, which we read, diligently.

We queried the U.S. Department of Justice. McKeel’s office provided links to testimony and a report tied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which state the average ages as 11 to 14, or 12. But a spokeswoman at the Bureau of Justice Statisticssaid those are not bureau numbers and that the bureau has no average age for entry into sex trafficking.

""The likelihood that it comes from a nationally representative study is very low,"" wrote Kara McCarthy in an email.

Eventually, we spoke with David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, and a respected researcher in the area. He, too, had nothing concrete but offered skepticism. The average age is higher if adults are included. Older teens simply may escape survey. ""There isn’t a lot of good research on this; they’re relatively small samples,"" he said.

But he did suggest another academic article, which led us to Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, a professor at the School of Social Work at Arizona State University.  

Is the average age of entry into prostitution and sex trafficking between 12 to 14 years old?

""That is statistically impossible,"" the professor said. ""If she were to say, minor trafficking often starts between the ages of 12 and 14 across the country, that is somewhat supported.""

Roe-Sepowitz said the statistic as it applies to girls is used by many, if not all, advocacy groups; the studies on which those statistics are based date back to the 1980s. Indeed, after we spoke with her, we found a 1985 study that reports the average age as 14.

Finally, we called Multnomah County Deputy Sheriff Keith Bickford. He manages the Human Trafficking Task Force. Was he aware of an average age? Short answer: No. ""You’ll hear 12, you’ll hear 14. I have yet to nail down an actual average from the people I talk to,"" he said, adding that he is reading more accounts involving younger children..

The ruling 
We’ve galloped across the country and found that definitions are fuzzy, statistics are murky and nobody knows for sure. We’ve learned that many organizations continue to repeat the statistic that the average age of entry into juvenile prostitution is between 12 and 14 years, despite the research being old and limited.

We found a professor who said there is some research backs up the claim, and another expert who warned that sample sizes are inadequate and research limited. One of the most widely cited sources told us that any numbers, even his, are estimates.

We conclude McKeel’s statement is partially accurate -- there are some studies -- but missing important detail. The studies speak only to juveniles, and the studies themselves are speculative. There is no nationally representative, comprehensive sample. We rate the statement Half True.

Barack Obama says ""the majority of the American people agree with me"" on spending cuts and tax increases to fix the budget
","
The sequester lives, and it’s the Republicans’ fault, President Barack Obama told Americans on Friday.

As blunt, broad spending cuts started their slow crawl across the federal government on March 1, 2013, the president said he just needed Republicans in Congress to ""catch up to their own party and the country.""

That means an approach to deficit reduction that ""asks something from everybody,"" he said, including raising tax revenue.

Saying he believes Congress ""can and must"" replace the sequester’s cuts with ""a more balanced approach,"" he added: 

""I don't think that's too much to ask. I don't think that is partisan. It's the kind of approach that I've proposed for two years. That's what I ran on last year. The majority of the American people agree with me and this approach, including, by the way, a majority of Republicans."" 

Is that true? Do most Americans, including most Republicans, prefer to raise taxes and cut spending to address the deficit?

Polls supporting the president

We searched for public opinion polls to see if they supported the president’s declaration.

The best evidence in Obama’s favor was a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center and USA Today as the sequester loomed. Researchers talked with 1,504 adults across the country from Feb. 13-18, 2013.

The survey found broad concern over the federal budget deficit — and support for a combination of spending cuts and tax increases.

To reduce the budget deficit, 19 percent said the president and Congress should focus only on spending cuts. Just 3 percent preferred only tax increases.

A strong majority — 76 percent — sought a combination of both.

What about ""a majority of Republicans""?

Here was the breakdown of support for a mixed approach by party:

Democrats: 90 percent

Republicans: 56 percent

Independents: 76 percent

So, yes, the poll shows that a majority of Republicans support both spending cuts and tax increases to reduce the deficit.

A November 2012 poll from CNN/ORC International of 1,023 adults was in line with the Pew Center’s results.  It asked, ""If you had to choose, would you rather see Congress and President Obama agree to a budget plan that …""

Only included cuts in government spending: 29 percent

Or a budget plan that includes a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on higher-income Americans: 67 percent

The party breakdown for the ""combination"" response?

Democrats: 87 percent

Republicans: 52 percent

Independents: 60 percent

Meanwhile, a Bloomberg News poll conducted Feb. 15-18 showed majority support for curbing the budget deficit ""through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on companies and high earners, as the White House has proposed, rather than focusing exclusively on spending reductions, as Republicans assert,"" according to Bloomberg’s article. (We didn’t see the actual poll.)

We also came across this Fox News poll, conducted by Republican and Democratic pollsters of 1,010 registered voters on Feb. 25-27.  

It asked, ""In January, the president and Congress reached a budget agreement that raised tax rates on wealthy Americans and postponed making cuts to government spending. This time,
would you prefer the budget deal reduces the deficit by focusing …""

Only on cutting government spending: 33 percent

Mostly on cutting spending, and a small number of tax increases: 19 percent

On an equal mix of spending cuts and tax increases: 36 percent

Only on adding further tax increases: 7 percent

Don't know: 5 percent

So, a majority of respondents, 55 percent, supported a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. The results we saw didn’t break out responses by party.

Polls that don’t address or undermine Obama’s claim

We asked House Speaker John Boehner’s office if there were other polls we should consider.

Press secretary Brendan Buck pointed us to an NBC/WSJ poll of 1,000 adults conducted Feb. 21-24.

They were asked whether they supported the sequester’s automatic cuts, more cuts, or fewer cuts. A majority, 53 percent, either favored more cuts or the sequester’s automatic cuts, which Buck interpreted as support for Republicans’ cuts-only approach.

But the poll didn’t ask respondents whether they wanted to see revenue as part of a deficit reduction plan. It focused on cuts only.

Meanwhile, 50 percent agreed with the statement: ""These spending cuts are too severe and will hurt our economy. The President and Congress need to find a way to reduce our deficit by working together to avoid this from happening.""

While 46 percent agreed with: ""Washington has become too partisan and the President and Congress cannot reach an agreement on reducing our deficit. Allowing these spending cuts to go into place may not be perfect, but it is time for dramatic measures to reduce the deficit.**

The poll results don’t directly support Obama’s claim. But they don’t undercut it, either.

Buck also mentioned a survey from Rasmussen Reports, a survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 24-25.

It asked, ""Should the long-term federal budget deficit be reduced by cutting spending, by raising taxes, or combination of tax hikes and spending cuts?""

Rasmussen’s respondents found cutting spending the most attractive approach, with 45 percent support. Just 6 percent, it said, supported raising taxes alone.

So, a plurality supported the Republican approach of cutting spending only, while a minority supported Obama’s solution.

It’s worth noting that some polling experts, such as the New York Times’ Nate Silver, have raised issues with Rasmussen’s methodology. Its ""robopoll"" strategy, which uses a digitally recorded voice to conduct interviews, showed a statistical bias toward Republicans in the 2010 and 2012 elections. Meanwhile, Pew’s work in 2012 was more favorable toward Obama than the pollster consensus (though Silver hasn’t raised issues with Pew, which he says he respects).

Buck also mentioned a survey from Republican polling firm Winston Group, but beyond the poll’s conservative phrasing, it had the same issue as the NBC/WSJ poll — it didn’t offer respondents the choice of a mixed approach to replacing the sequester. It asked registered voters only whether they preferred Republican spending cuts or Democratic revenue increases or sequester delay. They favored Republican spending cuts over Democratic revenue increases by 52 percent to 40 percent.

One other way the president doesn’t enjoy majority support: Just a plurality of Americans, rather than a majority, wanted Congress to pass legislation to avoid the sequester, according to Gallup.

Our ruling

Obama said of a balanced approach to deficit reduction that ""the majority of the American people agree with me and this approach, including, by the way, a majority of Republicans."" We found two polls that supported his statement in its entirety, several polls that supported at least the first half, and polls from Rasmussen and Republican pollster Winston Group presented more of a mixed picture. The majority of the polls we found support the president. We rate the president’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C13C940>],/factchecks/2013/mar/01/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-majority-american-people-agree-m/
"['History', 'Redistricting', 'Texas', 'Trey Martinez Fischer']","
Trey Martinez Fischer says Texas Legislature has never avoided violating Section 5 of Voting Rights Act
","
A section of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 must continue to apply to Texas, the chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus said, and a decades-long losing streak shows it.

State Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer spoke in advance of arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in an Alabama challenge to the act’s Section 5, which requires nearly every southern state and some other governmental entities to get federal approval before changing election practices. Covered jurisdictions, including Texas, must win ""preclearance"" from the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington before changes take effect.

Martinez Fischer, D-San Antonio, said at a Feb. 25, 2013, Capitol press conference that Congress made Texas subject to Section 5 starting in 1975 because the state had been printing English-only ballots, discriminating against Spanish speakers. (As we’ve noted, other triggers also figured into the decision.)

Subsequently, Martinez Fischer said, Texas ""was never able to preclear; it was always a fight. Texas always ends up on the losing side."" His comments were paraphrased in an Austin American-Statesman news article as his saying that since Texas was put under the section, the Texas Legislature has never gone through redistricting without violating it.

Never?

By telephone, Martinez Fischer told us that his focus has been on Texas House districts and that the caucus’ redistricting counsel, Jose Garza of San Antonio, has advised that every Texas House map as initially drawn by lawmakers had been found in violation of Section 5, which proscribes changes abridging or denying the right to vote on account of race or color or membership in a language minority group.

With help from lawyers versed in redistricting, including Steve Bickerstaff of Austin and Michael Li of Dallas, we confirmed numerous instances of the Justice Department objecting to--not preclearing--Texas redistricting plans.

For starters, we figured there were 16 major opportunities for Texas to redraw districts statewide from 1981 through 2011, nearly all of them touched off by an immediately preceding U.S. census. Bickerstaff noted there also was some redistricting action between 1975 and 1980; more on that below. For this fact check, though, we chose not to take into account the largely undisputed district maps for the State Board of Education; there has been little to no fight there.

There has been much tussling over Texas-drawn maps of U.S. House and Texas Senate and House districts.

Li, who has also been a Democratic fundraiser, guided us to Texas Legislative Council timelines outlining the litigation history of redistricting from the 1980s through 2012. Any Justice Department objections on the timelines, Li noted, would automatically tie to Section 5 since the section is the agency’s sole legal basis for judging preclearance, though he also reminded us that plans are sometimes precleared through a Washington, D.C., judicial panel.

Coincidentally, the timelines also were cited as sources for a chart sent our way by Martin Golando of Martinez Fischer’s office indicating eight instances of preclearance being denied over the decades.

Garza, the redistricting counsel, said by phone the key point is that ""there’s never been a decade in which the state came through clean when it comes to discrimination against minorities.""

That’s confirmed by the timelines.

Let’s get gritty. 
The timeline for the 1980s shows the Justice Department objecting to U.S. House districts as passed into law and not preclearing Texas House and Texas Senate plans drawn by the Legislative Redistricting Board, a five-person panel that can act if legislators fail to agree on those plans.

In the ‘90s,the department precleared the legislated U.S. House plan--though, Bickerstaff noted, a lawsuit charging that the plan unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered districts culminated in a federal court imposing a plan, in 1996, redrawing 13 of the then-30 districts. Court-drawn maps are not subject to preclearance, Li advised.

In November 1991, the Justice Department objected to the legislated Texas House plan; a revised plan, passed into law along the lines of a lawsuit settlement, won preclearance in July 1992.

The timeline for the state’s Senate plan that decade probably should be read at your own risk. The original legislated Senate plan was withdrawn from the Justice Department before a preclearance decision, according to the timeline. Another plan, settling a lawsuit charging the legislated plan with discriminating against minority voters, was passed into law, then rejected for preclearance by Justice only to be precleared by the Washington federal court. Other judges, in Austin, ordered that plan used in the 1994 elections and, presumably, through the decade.

In the 2000s, Senate districts drawn by the redistricting board won preclearance, according to the council’s timeline. Lawmakers failed to agree on redrawn congressional districts, so a federal court imposed a plan for the 2002 elections before the 2003 Legislature swapped in its version, which the Justice Department precleared in December 2003 despite a memo from staff lawyers saying the plan violated the section by diluting black and Hispanic voting power in two congressional districts, according to a Dec. 2, 2005, Washington Post news article. Garza noted that the U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 held that one district in the plan diluted the minority vote in violation of another section of the Voting Rights Act, fueling changes.

Justice denied preclearance to Texas House districts as drawn by the redistricting board. A Nov. 16, 2001, Justice Department letter says the state failed to show the plan had neither a discriminatory effect or intent against minority voters in Bexar County, South and West Texas. A Texas-based panel of federal judges later redrew districts to address the concerns.

In August 2012, In August 2012, most recently, a U.S. District Court in Washington denied preclearance of the legislated remaps of House, Senate and U.S. House districts adopted by the GOP-majority Legislature in 2011. The state has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Sources: Timelines for Texas redistricting, Texas Legislative Council. 
Upshot: Nine of the dozen initially legislated or board-devised redistricting plans did not win preclearance, counting the 2011 congressional, Texas Senate and House plans whose court rejections are on state appeal. Conversely, three initial state plans won preclearance, though a federal court acting on a discrimination lawsuit later redrew much of one and the Supreme Court held that another one had a non-Section 5 voting-rights flaw.

Bickerstaff offered his summary dating back further, emailing that by his memory, since 1975, lawmakers or the redistricting board have adopted 13 statewide redistricting plans, not counting education board plans. ""Only one plan,"" the Senate plan written by the board in the 2000s, ""escaped objection under Section 5 and was used for the decade,"" Bickerstaff said.

Our ruling

Martinez Fischer said that since Texas was placed under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in 1975, the Texas Legislature has never gone through redistricting without violating it.

We see a reasonable basis for this claim in that Section 5 objections have been lodged by federal authorities in every once-a-decade round of redistricting since then. Still, three initial redistricting plans won preclearance and one plan survived through its decade unscathed by the Justice Department or federal courts. In these ways, ""never"" is misleading, rendering the claim partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0BF940>],/factchecks/2013/mar/01/trey-martinez-fischer/trey-martinez-fischer-says-texas-legislature-has-n/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Ami Bera']","
Rep. Ami Bera says due to sequester, 'people are going to be unsafe. Homes are going to burn'
","
With an across-the-board federal cut looming, Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., took to the House floor to sound a sequester fire alarm.

""Mr. Speaker, the American public is tired of the blame game. They want to see real solutions. Irresponsible, across-the-board spending cuts are not a real solution. If we don't act to avoid these spending cuts, we threaten the very safety of our community and our country.

""There will be $50 million cut from firefighting funding. In my own district, that's $1.5 million in SAFER grants. Let me translate that. My fire chief, Kurt Henke, says that's the equivalent of one engine company and slower response times. People are going to be unsafe, homes are going to burn. We have to act.

""Mr. Speaker, I urge you to lock us in a room and cut a deal. Let's figure out how to avoid sequestration. This is devastating to our economy and our country.""

Really? Homes are going to burn because of the sequester?

Let’s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount -- tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for non-defense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.)
   
The uniform cuts must be applied to any ""program, project or activity"" that isn’t otherwise exempted.

We found two main federal firefighting grants programs: Staffing for Adequate Fire & Emergency Response (or SAFER) Grants, which focus on personnel, and Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG), which focuses on non-personnel expenditures such as equipment.

The Sacramento example

The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, the one headed by Chief Henke, won grants from both in December 2012. including a $5.6 million SAFER grant for ""hiring."" (It also won an AFG grant worth $370,277 for ""wellness and fitness programs,"" but we won’t factor that in since Bera didn’t mention it.)

If all SAFER grants nationally were to be cut by an equal amount, then a 5.3 percent reduction in Sacramento’s SAFER funding would be roughly $300,000. That’s less than the $1.5 million Bera cited, and Bera’s office acknowledged to PolitiFact that the congressman may not have given the correct figure. Here’s a fuller explanation.

In an interview, Henke said his department has lost millions of dollars because of a decline in  property tax receipts. The fire department closed three firehouses and sidelined six engine companies, which led to ""significantly longer response times,"" Henke said.

To improve its response to calls, the department sought SAFER grants to cover the cost of two additional engine companies. Henke said they would help the department meet the ""two in, two out"" rule, which requires that two firefighters remain outside a burning building before two can enter it. Because $1.5 million is the ballpark estimate for the cost of one engine company, that’s where Bera got his number. But that’s speculation; that’s five-times the proportionate cut we calculated.

So Bera’s number was a significant exaggeration.

The national outlook

Beyond Sacramento, is it accurate for Bera to say that, due to the sequester, ""people are going to be unsafe. Homes are going to burn""?

We spoke with experts who said there is some truth to that. They said cuts to firefighting grants will put more pressure on existing fire services and, on the margins, could result in greater damage or casualties, though the extent is certainly speculative.

""In some cases, response will be affected,"" said James Pharr, a professor in the Eastern Kentucky University College of Justice and Safety who previously served as a firefighter, fire investigator, fire chief, fire marshal and emergency management director. ""Slow or inadequate response can reduce the ability to prevent death or serious injury.""

Thomas J. Cova, director of the Center for Natural and Technological Hazards at the University of Utah, emphasized that sequester comes on top of budgetary strains caused by the recession.

""Budgets have already been reduced in the last four years at all levels -- local, state, and federal -- to the point that more cuts could noticeably compromise response capabilities,"" Cova said. ""All the obvious corners have already been cut, and that means, unfortunately, that further cuts could result in structures burning that otherwise wouldn’t, due to reduced response times, personnel, and equipment.""

Shawn S. Kelley, the director of strategic services for the International Association of Fire Chiefs Kelley, said rural departments stand to be hurt more than big cities because the rural agencies are more dependent on federal grants.

Still, we see several reasons why Bera’s claim is exaggerated.

• Federal funds are a small portion of most fire departments’ budgets. In Sacramento’s case, this year’s total budget is $153 million, meaning that the SAFER grant accounts for 3.6 percent of the budget. That means the sequester could hold back two-tenths of 1 percent of the department’s entire budget.

We were unable to find specific data nationally, but several experts agreed that Sacramento’s case is not unusual. ""Most municipal fire departments are locally funded,"" said William John Siembieda, who heads the city and regional planning department at California Polytechnic State University. ""Federal dollars are not a large part of annual budgets.""

In other words, Bera didn't have enough justification to sound such a strong alarm. The kind of rhetoric Bera used ""been rejected"" by firefighter organizations in trying to fend off proposed cuts, said Anthony Brown, an Oklahoma State University professor who specializes in fire and emergency management.

• Not every locality will be losing federal firefighting money due to the sequester. Both programs are competitive grants, meaning that a locality will apply for federal funds and, if it’s lucky, it will get a grant. Many localities will either decline to apply for the grants or fail to receive them. So while Sacramento may lose money due to sequester cuts, not every local fire department in the country will. Those departments that didn’t receive grant money in the most recent round won’t be directly affected by such sequester cuts at all.

• It can be difficult to determine whether local cuts or sequester cuts are at fault for personnel decreases. SAFER funds are, in effect, responding to what is happening at the local level. If a firefighter is laid off, or is about to be laid off, and then sees his job restored by a SAFER grant, then sees that funding taken away due to the sequester, is that all the fault of the sequester, or is it partially the fault of the local budgetary situation? We think it’s a mixture of both, and thus it’s a stretch for Bera to blame the sequester.

• The Obama administration proposed even bigger cuts for these programs in its fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. In its 2013 budget, the Obama administration proposed an amount 17 percent lower than its level two years earlier, an average of more than 8 percent per year. That’s a bigger cut than the sequester itself. So if the administration or its allies are going to cry foul at sequester cuts, the same charge could be leveled at the administration’s own policies.

Our ruling

Bera said that due to the sequester, ""people are going to be unsafe. Homes are going to burn.""

The precise impact of sequester cuts on firefighting is speculative, but it’s safe to assume there will be some impact on the margins, at least in places that receive federal firefighting grants. Still, Bera’s language is overheated, both on Sacramento’s case in particular and in the overall picture.

In the communities lucky enough to receive SAFER grants, such funds typically account for a small portion of the total departmental budget. In addition, firehouse woes do not begin and end with the sequester; local budgets and policies also deserve some blame. Finally, blaming the sequester obscures even larger cuts the administration itself proposed prior to the sequester. On balance, we rate Bera’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AB74C0>],/factchecks/2013/mar/01/ami-bera/rep-ami-bera-says-due-sequester-people-are-going-b/
"['States', 'Virginia', 'Ken Cuccinelli']","
Cuccinelli says Virginia is the only state where attorneys general resign to run for governor
","
Ken Cuccinelli is ending a recent tradition of Virginia attorneys general resigning from office when they run for governor, causing an early stir this election year.

During a Jan. 29 radio interview, Cuccinelli said he told voters in 2009 that he would serve out his four-year term as attorney general and that he intends to keep that commitment.  ""I ran for attorney general to be attorney general,"" he said.

Cuccinelli, who is unopposed for the Republican gubernatorial nomination this spring, was confident he could handle the dual responsibilities of being the state’s chief lawyer and a candidate. He was dismissive of Virginia’s custom of attorneys general stepping down to run for higher office.

""We’re the only state in the country that has this attorney general resign background,"" he said.

No doubt, Democrats hope to make an issue of Cuccinelli’s decision to stay in office. A dozen Democratic legislators sent a well-publicized letter to the attorney general last month asking him to follow the tradition of resigning.

And American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal Super PAC, has released two web videos labeling Cuccinelli a ""part-time"" attorney general. ""For nearly three decades, attorneys general who ran for governor from both parties have all resigned to campaign,"" the group notes.

We decided to check whether the custom really is unique to Virginia.

The tradition actually began on Aug. 28, 1957, according to our search of the archives at the Richmond Times-Dispatch. That’s when Democrat Lindsay Almond Jr. announced he would step down as attorney general to focus on that fall’s gubernatorial race.

""It is apparent to me that the political campaign soon to be actively launched will consume my full time and energy, necessitating extended absence from and consequently inattention to the important responsibilities of the office which has been entrusted to me by the people of Virginia,"" Almond wrote in a letter to then-Gov. Thomas Stanley.

Almond won the election that year. And in 1961, he accepted the resignation of Democrat Albertis Harrison, another attorney general who became governor.

Sixteen years passed before another attorney general would be nominated for governor -- Democrat Andrew Miller. He resigned as the state’s lawyer in January 1977, well before the heavy campaigning began. Miller lost the gubernatorial race to Republican John Dalton.

The tradition was temporarily broken in 1981 by Republican Marshall Coleman who, instead of resigning as attorney general, announced that April that he would accept only half of his $45,000 salary while he ran for governor. Coleman lost to Democrat Chuck Robb.

Since then, six straight attorneys general resigned to run for governor: Jerry Baliles in 1985; Mary Sue Terry in 1993; Jim Gilmore in 1997; Mark Earley in 2001; Jerry Kilgore in 2005 and Bob McDonnell in 2009. Each essentially said that an attorney general needs to devote full attention to the the job.

We asked Cuccinelli’s campaign for proof of the candidate’s claim that Virginia is ""the only state"" with the resignation tradition. Spokesman Jay Wilcox offered nothing concrete. He sent a scattershot list of four attorneys general from other states who, over the years, did not resign to run for governor and three more who did not step down when they ran for the U.S. Senate.

We sought more conclusive information, calling the National Association of Attorneys General, the Democratic Attorneys General Association, the Republican Attorneys General Association and the National Governors Association. Each organization said it doesn’t keep records of whether state attorneys general across the nation resigned when they ran for governor. Most of the groups declined additional comment.

Only Travis Berry,  executive director of Democratic Attorneys General Association, was willing weigh in. ""It seems to be a Virginia-specific tradition,"" he said.

Finally, we decided to research every gubernatorial race in the country since 1985 -- the year Baliles started the string of six straight Virginia attorneys general resigning to run for governor. During the course of this, we came across some information from a few earlier elections. All told, we found 31 states outside Virginia where an attorney general ran for governor, and not a single one of them resigned.

The attorneys general who stayed on were from both parties. Some became household names: Bill Clinton of Arkansas in 1979; Jerry Brown of California in 2010, Eliot Spitzer of New York in 2006 and John Ashcroft of Missouri in 1984.

Here’s the list of no-resign states and the year of the gubernatorial election:
* Alabama, 1958
* Arizona, 2002, 2006
* Arkansas 1978, 2006
* California, 1982, 2010
* Delaware, 1964
* Florida, 2006.
* Idaho, 1994.
* Illinois, 1990, 2002
* Indiana, 1992
* Iowa, 1994
* Kansas, 1960
* Kentucky, 2003
* Maine, 1978, 1986
* Massachusetts, 1998
* Minnesota, 1998, 2006
* Michigan, 2002
* Mississippi, 1983
* Missouri, 1984, 1992, 2012
* Montana, 1992, 2012
* Nevada, 1978
* New York, 2006, 2010
* North Carolina, 2000
* North Dakota, 1992, 2000
* Ohio, 1990
* Oregon, 1990
* Pennsylvania, 2002, 2010
* South Dakota, 1978
* Texas, 1982
* Washington, 2004, 2012
* West Virginia, 1960
* Wisconsin, 2002.

Finally, we should note that 43 states popularly elect their chief lawyer, according to the National Association of Attorneys General. In five states, governors appoint the attorney general: Alaska, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Wyoming.

In Maine, the attorney general is elected by the legislature. In Tennessee, the office holder is appointed by the state Supreme Court.

Our ruling

Cuccinelli said Virginia is ""the only state"" that has a tradition of attorneys general resigning if they run for governor.

There’s no doubt that the custom exists in Virginia. The last six attorneys general have resigned to run for governor, dating back to 1985. Cuccinelli plans to break that string this year.

No one, it seems, keeps data on whether the custom exists in other states. So we researched every gubernatorial election in the U.S. since 1985 and, along, the way, ran across information from a few earlier elections. All told, we found 31 states outside Virginia where attorneys general ran for governor. None of the candidates resigned.

We rate Cuccinelli’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0BF0C0>],/factchecks/2013/mar/01/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-virginia-only-state-where-attorney/
"['National', 'Education', 'Federal Budget', 'Arne Duncan']","
Arne Duncan says teachers are losing jobs because of sequestration
","
We’ve heard that sequestration could delay airline flights, that kids might not be able to get vaccines, or attend pre-school.

In another doomsday warning about what the sweeping cuts to federal spending could mean, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan says the sequester has already put teachers out of a job.

""There are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips, who are getting notices that they can't come back this fall,"" Duncan said on Face the Nation on Feb. 24, 2013.

Most funding for public schools comes from state and local government tax revenue. But money for special education and Title I, which supplements the costs of educating poor children, is handed down from the federal government. The White House says Title I would take a $725 million hit if sequestration goes into effect. Special ed programs could lose $600 million.

But does that mean teachers are ""literally … getting pink slips""?

Districts under fire

If you read your local newspaper, you’re probably already aware that school districts have been in a financial bind for several years, largely due to the recession. The bad economy depressed real estate values and shrunk tax revenue, which in turn reduced the tax money that school districts could spend.

Now, with the potential loss of federal dollars because of the sequester, local school districts again stand to lose some important revenue. But it’s important to bear in mind that there is no direct cause/effect relationship between federal cuts and school staff reductions. Local districts decide what to keep and what to cut; a federal budget cut does not dictate that teachers be laid off.

That said, a spokesman for the Department of Education pointed us to numerous examples of districts around the country that are bracing for difficult decisions, including letting teachers go:

• Officials with Great Falls Public Schools in Montana are preparing a list of planned layoffs to the school board, including 20 teachers who could be at risk.

•  In New York, the Utica School District is already facing staff reductions for next year -- plus another 12 to 15 teacher cuts under sequestration.

• The Erie School District in Pennsylvania estimates it will have to lay off a minimum of 10 elementary teachers if federal money is axed.

""Jobs are the biggest line item in their budgets,"" said Education Department spokesman Massie Ritsch. ""It’s really hard to make up for it without cutting into personnel in some way.""

Notice, though, that those districts expect to have to make those cuts. They haven’t made them yet.

One county in West Virginia

After his appearance on ""Face the Nation,"" reporters pressed Duncan for examples of school districts where pinks slips had already been handed out.

He named Kanawha County in West Virginia, but insulated it in the caveat, ""whether it’s all sequester-related, I don’t know.""

The Washington Post sought to verify Duncan’s story by talking to Kanawha County school officials. Pam Padon, who directs the county’s federal programs, said 104 teachers had received transfer notices -- a necessary step before their positions can be eliminated.

""It’s not like we’re cutting people’s jobs at this point,"" Padon told the Post.

What’s more, those notices had more to do with a change in how West Virginia allocates federal funds designated for poor children, the Post reported.

Padon estimated that, of the 104 positions on notice, five or six jobs would ultimately be lost. ""The major impact is not so much sequestration,"" she said. ""Those five or six jobs would already be gone regardless of sequestration.""

The Post’s Fact-Checker separately gave Duncan’s claim four Pinocchios, its worst rating.

Ritsch, the education department spokesman, urged us to call Kanawha Superintendent Ron Duerring. He told a totally different story than Padon had.

As far back as last fall, Duerring said, he directed his staff to start preparing for tighter conditions under sequestration.

""As it got closer to our personnel season (the time when school staff must be notified if their jobs are changing), it became very clear ... that it was going to happen.  But the next question was how much of a percentage was that going to be,"" Duerring said, adding that the federal cuts are likely to mean 14 layoffs next school year and even more the following year.

Asked to explain why Padon offered such a different version, Duerring said, ""she was just answering what she thought.""

He said he talked publicly about the effects of sequestration at school board meetings throughout the fall and in monthly meetings with principals. But he could provide no documentation that such preparations were being made that long ago.

Also, we found stories in two different local newspapers appear to support Padon’s version of why the 104 notices went out -- a change at the state level.

A Jan. 7, 2013, story in the Charleston Gazette said the county was preparing for the squeeze ""because of a request by the state Department of Education, a new accountability system could be on the horizon for West Virginia schools that would require counties to set aside 20 percent of their budgets for their lowest-achieving schools."" The statement was attributed to Padon.

And the Charleston Daily Mail reported that ""the potential implementation of new Title I standards at the state level could mean putting about 100 teachers on ‘transfer’ status, Padon said.""

Neither story -- nor others reporting on school board meetings last fall -- mentioned sequestration.

Our ruling

Duncan said that because of the threat of sequestration ""there are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips."" That conjures images of hundreds or even thousands of teachers who have already been fired.

But the lone example of actual pink slips is the West Virginia district. And officials there provide a contradictory explanation for why 104 teachers are being notified their jobs might be transferred, and eventually eliminated.

The other districts held up by education officials haven’t fired a single teacher because of sequestration. Ritsch, Duncan’s spokesman, said that distinction hardly matters: ""Whether they’ve got a pink slip in hand or one is coming in two weeks, the basic point is the same -- their jobs are at risk.""

Maybe so. But that’s not what Duncan said, which is that teachers right now are being shown the door. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4C3380>],/factchecks/2013/mar/01/arne-duncan/arne-duncan-says-teachers-are-losing-jobs-because-/
"['Elections', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Greg Abbott says last non-partisan body on election reforms decided photo IDs at polls were necessary
","A Texas leader quickly responded to President Barack Obama’s announcement of a ""non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America.""

Obama said in his Feb. 12, 2013, State of the Union address that he wanted the commission to focus on protecting the right to vote. ""When any Americans – no matter where they live or what their party – are denied that right simply because they can’t wait for five, six, seven hours just to cast their ballot,"" Obama said, ""we are betraying our ideals."" Obama added that he was asking top attorneys from the 2012 Obama and Mitt Romney campaigns to lead the effort.

Republican Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, responded on Twitter that night: ""To #Obama: The last non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America concluded that #VoterID was necessary."" Talk about a poke. State mandates requiring voters to present photo IDs at the polls have cleaved partisans. Republicans generally say such laws, including the 2011 Texas version that’s under legal challenge, will stop fraud. Democrats like Obama note there is little to no evidence of in-person voter fraud, also saying ID laws will deter voters, particularly minorities and the elderly, from going to the polls.

And did the nation’s last non-partisan commission on voting conclude that IDs were needed at the polls?

Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland guided us to a report by a commission co-chaired by former President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, and former U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker, III, a Republican. The Sept. 19, 2005, report from the 21-member Commission on Federal Election Reform, organized by American University, opens with a letter from Carter and Baker stating, in part: ""We are recommending a photo ID system for voters designed to increase registration with a more affirmative and aggressive role for states in finding new voters and providing free IDs for those without driver’s licenses. The formula we recommend will result in both more integrity and more access.""

The report notes that voters in nearly 100 democracies use a photo ID card without fear of infringement on their rights. The commission’s recommendation is that states require voters to use the REAL ID card, which at the time was expected to result in each state’s government-issued IDs meeting federal standards.

""The card includes a person’s full legal name, date of birth, a signature (captured as a digital image), a photograph, and the person’s Social Security number,"" the report says. ""This card should be modestly adapted for voting purposes to indicate on the front or back whether the individual is a U.S. citizen."" And, the report says, states should provide such IDs to non-drivers at no charge.

Until 2010, the recommendation says, states should ""allow voters without a valid photo ID card ... to vote, using a provisional ballot by signing an affidavit under penalty of perjury. The signature would then be matched with the digital image of the voter’s signature on file in the voter registration database, and if the match is positive, the provisional ballot should be counted.""

At a press conference, Carter said he initially had reservations but was won over to the ID proposal because 24 states, including Georgia, had approved such measures and some of the laws were ""abominable,"" making it hard for some residents to obtain the required IDs, according to the Political Transcript Wire.

Carter added that the recommendation included ""careful constraints to prevent abuse. For instance, these photo ID cards will be free. Second, there will be a wide distribution of them. The states will be required to go around the state to issue these photo ID cards to as many people as possible, which will be a good system just for recruiting new voters... And so, this will be, I think, a move forward in getting more people to vote. It would not restrict people from voting. It will be uniformly applied throughout the country. And it will be nondiscriminatory.""

At the press conference, Baker said he believes the commission came out ""86 percent in favor"" of the ID mandate because anyone who receives an ID would automatically be registered to vote.

Three commission members, led by Tom Daschle, the former Democratic Senate leader, dissented from the ID recommendation, and other Democrats, including then-Sen. Obama of Illinois, reacted by saying the proposal was likely to deter low-income, minority and disabled voters from casting ballots.

Daschle’s dissent was joined by Spencer Overton, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, and Raul Yzaguirre, former president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group. The dissent says some citizens would have difficulties coming up with the documents needed to obtain such IDs, such as driver licenses, for voting purposes. Those documents, the dissent says, include a ""birth certificate, passport or naturalization papers, a photo identity document, and proof of Social Security number. Obtaining such documents can be difficult, even for those not displaced by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. For some, the commission’s ID proposal constitutes nothing short of a modern day poll tax.""

In an expanded dissent, Overton says ""evidence suggests the type of fraud addressed by photo ID requirements is extraordinarily small and that the number of eligible citizens who would be denied their right to vote as a result of the commission's ID proposal is exceedingly large.""

By telephone, American University professor Robert A. Pastor, a commission member and its staff director, told us the commission had a balance of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Doug Chapin, an administrator at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, was the commission’s research director. Chapin told us by email the Carter-Baker effort was the latest national effort to review election laws.

Our ruling

Abbott said the ""last non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America concluded that #VoterID was necessary.""

Atlanta official seeks touchdown on stadium claim
","
To build or to renovate?

That is the question Atlanta leaders are grappling with as the Atlanta Falcons have discussed plans with city and state officials to build a $1 billion retractable-roof stadium downtown and demolish the 20-year-old Georgia Dome.

The key to any deal is the City Council’s approval of a commitment by Atlanta to finance about 20 percent of the total cost using bonds backed by a hotel-motel tax. That’s a bargain when you compare it with other recent stadium deals across the country, some city officials say.

""Of the 18 stadiums built from 2004 to 2013, 47 percent of the total cost came from public sources,"" Atlanta Chief Operating Officer Duriya Farooqui said at the first public hearing on the proposed deal.

Her boss, Mayor Kasim Reed, is a vocal proponent of a new stadium.

The claim was included in a slide presentation Reed’s staff prepared on stadium construction costs for the hearing in the City Council’s chambers. The Feb. 13 meeting drew so much interest that additional spectators watched the proceedings on television from another room.

PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether the claim was accurate, or is the public investment in professional sports facilities far less than the mayor’s staff is letting on?

Reed’s spokeswoman, Sonji Jacobs, referred us to a report on the sports news website Deadspin.com that had the information the mayor’s staff used in its presentation. Deadspin was the site that broke the Manti Te’o girlfriend hoax story.

""[P]rivate funding (53 percent) has actually surpassed public funding for the first time in decades,"" Deadspin wrote.

The percentage of public funding for sports facilities has decreased in recent decades, as taxpayers have become less tolerant of their money going to stadiums or arenas with teams owned by enormously wealthy owners.

Lawmakers have tried to become more creative in public financing of the construction of sports facilities, using lodging taxes on out-of-towners, a ticket tax, public parking revenue, taxes from car rentals and other sources. There are also the more traditional methods of funding these multimillion-dollar projects, such as collecting the money from sales taxes.

In the past decade, eight of the 18 facilities were built for Major League Baseball franchises, four for pro football, four for National Basketball Association teams and two for National Hockey League teams.

The cost of the stadiums range from as low as the $250 million to build the FedEx Forum in Memphis, Tenn., home of the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies, to $1.6 billion for MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. The NFL’s New York Giants and Jets share use of MetLife Stadium, the site of next year’s Super Bowl.

By our own count, these 18 sports facilities cost a combined $11.7 billion to build. The public contribution toward these projects totaled about $5.6 billion, 48 percent of the total cost.

We wanted to look at the public investment in sports facilities that cost $1 billion or more to build since that is the projected cost of the proposed stadium in Atlanta. There were four venues in that category: MetLife Stadium; Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas; the Barclays Center in New York City; and Yankee Stadium, also in New York City. The public investment in those facilities was about 18 percent. Again, the current discussion in Atlanta is a 20 percent public investment in a new football stadium downtown.

Jacobs, the mayor’s spokeswoman, noted that most of the billion-dollar sports venues were built in the New York City area, where land and construction costs are typically higher. She also noted that MetLife Stadium is shared by two teams, and she believes that skews any comparison of the billion-dollar venues.

Four of the five teams that play in the billion-dollar venues have a higher net worth than the Falcons, who ranked 28th among the NFL’s 32 teams, according to Forbes. Here’s the most recent Forbes breakdown:

Dallas Cowboys:     $1.85 billion.
New York Yankees:    $1.85 billion.
New York Giants:    $1.3 billion.
New York Jets:    $1.23 billion.
Atlanta Falcons:    $814 million.
Brooklyn Nets:        $530 million.

The Falcons are owned by Arthur Blank (who has a reported net worth of $1.5 billion and whom Forbes lists at the 329th-richest American). Blank sits on the board of directors of Cox Enterprises, which owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

But the owners of the teams in the billion-dollar venues are super rich. For example, Nets majority owner Mikhail Prokhorov is reportedly worth $13.2 billion. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has a net worth of $2.7 billion, Forbes reports. Jets owner Woody Johnson is part of a family that is worth about $13 billion.

On the other end of the cost spectrum, the least expensive projects had a higher percentage of public funding. For example, the FedEx Forum was built through an authority created by the city of Memphis and Shelby County. The authority included a $1.15-per-ticket surcharge to help pay construction costs, according to newspaper accounts.

Since Farooqui’s claim included smaller and, typically less-costly arenas, we also decided to break down the public investment in facilities solely used by baseball and football teams, since Atlanta is considering a football stadium. Our examination shows the public investment in those 12 facilities was 44 percent. That’s pretty close to the claim.

Jacobs said the best comparison is between the Falcons’ proposal and other multiuse stadiums. There were three retractable-roof stadiums built in the past decade. The public investment in them were 27 percent (Arlington), 68 percent (Phoenix) and 86 percent (Indianapolis).

Our conclusion:

Farooqui said in her presentation that 47 percent of the cost of 18 pro sports facilities built in the past decade came from public sources. Our examination of the claim showed the estimate is on target, even if you remove arenas.

The public investment, though, in other billion-dollar stadiums is much less than 47 percent. We believe this context is necessary to fully understand Farooqui’s statement.

We rate Farooqui’s claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097304700>],/factchecks/2013/mar/01/duriya-farooqui/atlanta-official-seeks-touchdown-stadium-claim/

Chairwoman of Ocean State Prevention Alliance says many Rhode Island teens don’t think daily marijuana use poses serious risk of harm
","As Rhode Island lawmakers debate proposals to legalize marijuana, health officials and others opposed to drug use are warning of serious consequences.

Among their concerns is that efforts to legalize the drug may lead teenagers to believe there is no risk of serious harm in using it. Some national surveys say that marijuana use among young people has increased in recent years, after surveyed declines during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Nancy Devaney is chairwoman of the Ocean State Prevention Alliance, a Rhode Island organization that opposes marijuana legalization. In a Feb. 20 news release from the Alliance, this statement is attributed to her: ""In annual surveys of Rhode Island communities that receive [federal] Drug Free community grants, many report that more than 50 percent of youth surveyed do not think daily marijuana use poses any serious risk of harm.""

PolitiFact Rhode Island contacted Devaney to ask about the claim. She e-mailed us numbers she said came from surveys conducted in five of the eight Rhode Island communities that make up the alliance, which works to pursue grants aimed at preventing and reducing drug use.  

Devaney said the communities conducted the surveys to fulfill requirements of federal grants they received.

Devaney gave us survey numbers but not the survey questions and results, so we sought to verify them. We contacted officials from the communities involved and got  results from six of the eight communities in the Prevention Alliance.

Some of the communities surveyed middle school students and some didn’t, but all surveyed high school students, so we’ll focus on those results.

When we looked at the numbers, things became a bit complicated because the communities asked the question and tabulated the results in different ways.

Tiverton, Middletown and North Kingstown, for example, asked high school students whether daily use of marijuana posed risk of serious harm -- the way Devaney phrased her statement.

But other communities asked variations of the question. For example, some asked whether smoking marijuana a few times a week -- not daily -- posed a serious risk.

And when the responses were tabulated, some grouped results, combining ""moderate"" and ""great risk.""

All of the survey results we reviewed, however, supported Devaney’s general point -- that a majority of young people didn’t believe that regular marijuana use was risky.

PolitiFact Rhode Island also looked at national research.

The survey Monitoring the Future, done yearly by University of Michigan researchers since the 1970s, asked more than 45,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12 questions including about their perception of the risk of harmfulness of marijuana.

Asked about people who smoke marijuana ""regularly,"" according to Monitoring the Future, about 67 percent of eight graders said great risk.  In the 2012 survey, about 51 percent of 10th graders said great risk of harm for people who smoke marijuana regularly and 44 percent of 12th graders said they perceive great risk of harm.

By contrast, in the early 1990s, the percentages of 12th graders who saw great risk of harm for marijuana were in the high 70s.

A survey released in September 2012 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said that nationally 44.8 percent of people ages 12 to 17 in 2011 perceived great risk in smoking marijuana once or twice per week. And less than 28 percent perceived great risk in smoking marijuana once a month.

That survey said that in Rhode Island, from 2010 through 2011, an estimated 21.5 percent of people ages 12 to 17 perceived great risk for those who smoked marijuana once a month.

In other words, the national surveys generally supported Devaney’s claim as well.

Our ruling

Nancy Devaney, chairwoman of Ocean State Prevention Alliance, said in a news release:  ""In annual surveys of RI communities that receive Drug Free community grants, many report that more than 50 percent of RI youth surveyed do not think daily marijuana use poses any serious risk of harm.""

The percentages from surveys in several communities we checked generally supported her statement, though not all students asked about their perceptions of risk based on daily use of the drug. For those reasons, we rate the statement Mostly True.

Kevin McCarthy says federal government has more revenue now than ‘any other time’
","
There’s no need to raise taxes as part of reducing the nation’s deficit, says House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy.

Broad, blunt spending cuts known as the sequester go into effect March 1 unless Congress steps in. Democrats would prefer to reduce the deficit partly by raising taxes.

But the California Republican argued on Fox News that any solution should cut spending only — there’s plenty of revenue, he said.

""There's more money going in than any other time,"" he told host Greta Van Susteren on Feb. 25, 2013. ""In the last four decades, on average, we brought in 17.9 percent of GDP. Now we're going to bring in 19.1.""

Is the federal government collecting more than it ever has — more than it has on average the last 40 years?

Here’s what we found.

 ‘The last four decades’

McCarthy talked about ""percent of GDP,"" a common tool of economists evaluating the impact of tax policies over time. They prefer to compare tax revenues as a percentage of the overall U.S. economy, the gross domestic product.

It’s fairly easy to see why — using raw numbers wouldn’t account for inflation or changes in population, for example.

Was McCarthy correct that the federal government used to collect, on average, 17.9 percent of the gross domestic product, and that the number will rise to 19.1 percent?

McCarthy’s office pointed us to reports from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

A recent CBO analysis says that, indeed, federal revenue is projected to rise with changes in the law, such as the recent end to Bush tax cuts on households making more than $450,000 a year.

""Revenues are projected to grow from 15.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 19.1 percent of GDP in 2015 — compared with an average of 17.9 percent of GDP over the past 40 years,"" CBO’s analysts conclude.

So McCarthy accurately cites a reputable source when he says the federal government has collected an average of 17.9 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product over four decades, and now is ""going to bring in 19.1.""

(We should mention that even with higher revenue, CBO projects that deficits will increase ""because of the pressures of an aging population, rising health care costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance, and growing interest payments on federal debt."")

But what about McCarthy’s claim that ""there's more money going in than any other time""? That’s messier.

 ‘More money’

So, remember how percentage of GDP is a useful tool for comparing revenue over time?

The government will pull in 16.9 percent in 2013, lower than the average over the last 40 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That’s not more money than at ""any other time,"" as McCarthy said.

What about in 2015, when the government is projected to bring in 19.1 percent?

That’s still lower than revenue as a percentage of GDP in seven years of the last 40 — also not more money than at ""any other time.""

 Federal revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product

1981: 19.6 percent
1982: 19.2 percent

1997: 19.2 percent
1998: 19.9 percent
1999: 19.8 percent
2000: 20.6 percent
2001: 19.5 percent

 Source: Congressional Budget Office

McCarthy’s office told PolitiFact that CBO projects revenue in 2013 will be the highest ever in raw numbers, at $2.708 trillion, up from $2.568 trillion in 2007.

But that’s not the measure a listener would have assumed from McCarthy’s comments, which focused on revenue as a percentage of GDP — not raw numbers.

Nor are raw numbers a useful way to compare amounts of money over time.

The value of the dollar changes. Population changes. That means revenue in raw terms mostly climbs by default.

Tax policy experts we spoke with called comparisons based on raw numbers ""lousy,"" ""never valid"" and ""silly.""

""Ignoring the increased value of the dollar and population growth both distort comparisons and make them meaningless,"" said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.

 Our ruling

McCarthy told Fox News, ""There's more money going in than any other time. In the last four decades, on average, we brought in 17.9 percent of GDP. Now we're going to bring in 19.1.""

Starting in 2015, reputable projections show revenue rising to 19.1 percent of GDP, up from an average of 17.9 over the last four decades. But McCarthy’s wrong to say that there’s more money coming in than at any other time.

In fact, the nation collected more than 19.1 percent of GDP in seven years of the last 40. To say that the nation will collect the most revenue in raw dollars in 2013, according to tax experts, is meaningless.

Dodd flip-flopped on whether he changed amendment on bonuses to AIG and banks
","
Sen. Chris Dodd has been

widely panned

as the man responsible for allowing bailout recipient AIG to hand out huge bonuses, but it's really a

half truth

to say he's to blame.
 
Dodd was actually the author of a provision that

limited

bonuses for AIG and other financial companies, though it's true that he later added a loophole that allowed some bonuses.
 
Nevertheless, in the course of explaining his role in the matter, Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, committed one of this year’s most conspicuous flip-flops. As keepers of the Flip-O-Meter, we feel obligated to document it.
 
Here’s what happened: As word of AIG’s bonuses filtered out, critics zeroed in on an amendment Congress passed in February that outlawed such bonuses but exempted contracts signed before Feb. 11, 2009.
 
The amendment prohibited firms that had received federal bailout money from ""paying or accruing any bonus"" to the 25 most highly compensated employees as long as the company still owed the government money for the bailout. 
 
But somewhere in the legislative process, a line was added to say the amendment ""shall not be construed to prohibit any bonus payment required to be paid pursuant to a written employment contract executed on or before February 11, 2009.""
 
The extra line allowed AIG to hand out $165 million in bonuses for 2008 to executives of a division that lost piles of money that year.
 
Dodd had authored the original amendment. So CNN asked him on March 18 whether he was the one who added the Feb. 11 effective date.
 
""There is the suggestion today being made that you received more money from AIG than any other senator, and that you were responsible for the February 11th, 2009, date,"" CNN producer Ted Barrett said to Dodd on March 18. ""So, just — you know, again, I just want to get at ...""
 
""No,"" Dodd said. 
 
""You're saying you had nothing to do with that date?"" Barrett pressed.
 
""Absolutely not,"" Dodd said. 
 
That was pretty clear. And yet a day later, with other sources telling CNN that Dodd was in fact the one who made the change, Dodd admitted as much. 
 
""I agreed to a modification in the legislation, reluctantly,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash. ""I wasn't negotiating with myself here. I wasn't changing my own amendment. I was changing the amendment because others were insisting upon it."" 
 
""You were very adamant yesterday, very adamant that you didn't know how this change got in there,"" Bash said. ""And now you are saying that your staff did work with the administration?"" 
 
""Going back and looking — obviously, I apologize,"" Dodd said. 
 
Treasury officials later confirmed they had asked Dodd to change the amendment because they were afraid executives would sue if it was retroactive. In a

press conference

, Dodd stressed that he was the one who authored the bonus restrictions in the first place, and that Treasury requested the change.
 
""I'm angry about it, and angry that in a sense I've been held up as sort of responsible for all this when in fact I responded to what I thought was a reasonable request at the time,"" Dodd said. ""I went through six weeks of a lot of criticism from the financial press, from Wall Street and others that my amendment was too restrictive, that it was unfair, that there would be a brain drain, that people would leave right and left.""
 
Still, it was Dodd who chose to insert the loophole. For his 180-degree switch from steadfast denier to contrite confessor, the Flip-O-Meter registers a Full Flop.

Tens of billions in AIG bailout went to foreign companies
","Amid all the furor over retention bonus payments to AIG employees, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chair of the House Republican caucus, said another outrage in the AIG bailout saga isn't getting enough attention. ""And the other unreported story today is tens of billions of dollars that flowed straight through AIG into the coffers of foreign corporations and foreign banks,"" Pence said in an interview on MSNBC on March 17. ""You know, the American people are frustrated with this."" To date, American taxpayers are $170 billion into AIG bailout as part of an effort to save the global insurance conglomerate from a collapse that many fear would have a catastrophic effect on the U.S. and global economies. But for months, AIG refused to say where that bailout money was going. Under mounting pressure from Congress, on March 15 AIG finally released the names of financial institutions that benefited from the rescue money. Although U.S. firms like Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America got the lion's share of payouts, the list also included a number of big foreign banks: Société Générale of France and Deutsche Bank of Germany, which each received nearly $12 billion; Barclays of Britain, $8.5 billion; and UBS of Switzerland, $5 billion. In all, corporations in France and Germany got nearly $36 billion; and all foreign companies got nearly $60 billion. So Pence is right, tens of billions of U.S. taxpayers dollars certainly flowed to foreign corporations and banks. But what did people expect? asked J.D. Foster, a senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. AIG is a global company, indeed the largest insurance company in the world. Remember, Foster said, ""the reason that AIG was taken over by the federal government was to prevent it from going into bankruptcy."" It had a number of contractual obligations to both U.S. and foreign firms that it could not meet. ""If (AIG executives) had made the decision that they were only going to pay U.S. companies, the foreign companies would have gone to court and put AIG in backruptcy,"" Foster said. ""And the whole point was to keep them out of bankruptcy."" ""It’s understandable that people would be mad that taxpayer dollars would go to a place that you might not want it to go, to foreign corporations,"" he said. ""(But) the only reason to give money to AIG was to close out its contracts. Some of those contracts are with foreign corporations."" Pence isn't saying AIG should only have used taxpayer money to pay off obligations to U.S. companies. Pence doesn't think American taxpayers should have been paying for a bailout at all. Pence opposed the first rescue plan last fall, despite the urgings of President Bush and many key Republican leaders. Although a number of Republicans supported the bailout — enough for it to pass handily — Pence noted this week that a majority of Republicans in the House voted against it. ""The American people have had it,"" Pence said in a news conference on March 17. ""They want this Congress to get back to fiscal discipline and restraint and the belief that the freedom to succeed includes the freedom to fail. We have got to bring this country back, this business community back to the notion of personal responsibility and accountability for one's actions."" There are reasoned arguments on both sides of whether Congress ought to have committed billions of taxpayer dollars to bailing out the troubled AIG. But the fact is, one of the consequences of infusing AIG with taxpayer cash to help it pay off its financial obligations was that tens of billions of that money went to foreign companies. We rule Pence's statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/91ae1e1f-21f9-41b0-9651-a7a0a0813f96",[<zip object at 0x0000028097032200>],/factchecks/2009/mar/20/mike-pence/tens-billions-aig-bailout-went-foreign-comanies/
"['National', 'Economy', 'National Republican Senatorial Committee']","
Dodd failed to halt bailout bonuses, but he did limit future ones
","
With public outrage festering over AIG’s huge bonuses, Republicans are pointing the finger at Sen. Chris Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat.
 
Dodd has received more campaign contributions from AIG than any other elected official, and he helped draft parts of the stimulus bill having to do with executive compensation.
 
His involvement included inserting an amendment that allowed AIG to dole out its bonuses, National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director Rob Jesmer alleged in a fundraising e-mail on March 18. Jesmer's committee helps elect Republicans to the U.S. Senate, and Dodd is in a dead heat in a hypothetical matchup with potential Republican challenger Rob Simmons in 2010.
 
""Sen. Chris Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, placed an amendment in the 'stimulus' bill that allowed for banks bailed out with taxpayer money — including AIG — to hand out huge bonuses without any government oversight or regulation, as long as those bonuses were issued before February 11,"" the e-mail said. ""AIG did just that, paying out $165 million in taxpayer-funded bonuses.""
 
AIG was among the financial firms that suffered immense losses lately, largely as a result of writing trillions of dollars worth of ""credit-default swaps,"" a type of investment insurance, that it could not honor.
 
In September, Congress and President Bush pledged an $85 billion loan to help AIG, saying a failure there would cause a financial meltdown. By November the pledge had increased to $150 billion. The Federal Reserve and Bush’s Treasury Department negotiated the terms, which did not include a ban on bonuses.
 
In March, the Obama administration promised tens of billions more. Most estimates have the total federal aid to AIG at about $170 billion, more bailout money than any other company has received in the $700 billion bank bailout, known as the Troubled Assets Relief Program.
 
As the government started to cut all these checks, the public began to realize that bankers at Merrill Lynch and elsewhere were using bailout money to pay bonuses. Congress belatedly tried to do something about that this year.
 
Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, was among those leading the effort. In February, when Congress was working on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus bill, Dodd inserted an amendment sharply limiting executive bonuses at companies that received bailout money in 2008.
 
However, before the bill was voted into law, Dodd’s amendment was changed to apply only to bonuses contained in contracts after Feb. 11, 2009.
 
Thus, AIG was able in March to pay $165 million in bonuses for last year to executives in its financial products division, the very unit that caused such turmoil in the company and the financial system as a whole.
 
Dodd initially insisted he was not the one that changed his amendment.
 
""There’s a suggestion today being made that you received more money from AIG than any other senator and that you are responsible for the Feb. 11, 2009, date,"" a CNN producer said to Dodd on March 17. ""You’re saying you had nothing to do with that date?""
 
""Absolutely not,"" Dodd replied.
 
A day later, Dodd changed his story.
 
""I apologize, I had some confusion about whether or not we wrote it exactly,"" he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on March 18. ""But I didn’t write it at my own behest. I was being sought out and asked to modify this, with the alternative, quite candidly, being losing the amendment itself.""
 
He said staff members from the Treasury Department had asked him to make the change, but he did not name the staffers.
 
A separate amendment that would have restricted bonuses, proposed by Sens. Ron Wyden and Olympia Snowe, was removed entirely from the bill behind closed doors. It is not yet clear which lawmakers did that, and whether Dodd was involved.
 
Clearly, though, the charge by the National Republican Senatorial Committee refers to Dodd’s own amendment — claiming it ""allowed for banks bailed out with taxpayer money ... to hand out huge bonuses.""
 
That's not true in this sense: The bankers would have been allowed to hand out the bonuses even without Dodd's amendment. In fact, they would have been allowed to continue doing so in the future. Dodd’s amendment did not enable bonus-paying that would not have existed otherwise. Quite the contrary: It limited bonuses, albeit in a way that fell short of public expectations.
 
The Republicans’ charge is true in a limited sense — Dodd’s amendment did address the bonus issue while falling short of disallowing the recent AIG bonuses. It is fair for Republicans to call attention to Dodd's loosening his amendment, and to ask why he did so.
 
We find this claim Half True.

Model T got better mileage than SUVs
","
President Barack Obama lamented the nation's dependence on foreign oil when visiting an electric car testing center in California on March 19, 2009.
 
""The problem is that, for decades, we have avoided doing what must be done as a nation to turn challenge into opportunity,"" Obama said. ""As a consequence, we import more oil today than we did on 9/11. The 1908 Model T earned better gas mileage than a typical SUV sold in 2008. And even as our economy has been transformed by new forms of technology, our electric grid looks largely the same as it did half a century ago.""
 
We've written about Obama's positions on

imported oil

and the

electric grid

before. But the Model T gets better mileage than an SUV? Really?
 
To answer this question, we first wanted to look at the mileage for ""a typical SUV sold in 2008.""
 
There are many ways to slice and dice fuel efficiency numbers, and looking up the mileage for your

own particular vehicle

is far easier than deciding on mileage for a ""typical SUV."" But the Environmental Protection Agency found that light trucks — the class of vehicle to which SUVs belong — averaged 18.1 miles per gallon for model year 2008. The most efficient SUVs do much better than that — a Jeep Compass gets 23 mpg in the city and 28 on the highway — but Obama said ""typical.""
 
To find out what a Model T averaged, we consulted Bob Casey, author of

The Model T: A Centennial History

, and the curator of transportation at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. (The museum is named for Ford but independent of the Ford Motor Co.)
 
He said the best estimate for a Model T's mileage is 20 miles per gallon, though it might be able to get 25 under the right conditions.
 
So technically Obama is right.
 
But his implication is that we haven't gotten more fuel efficient in 100 years. And that's a reach.
 
Let's look at the differences between today's SUVs and the Model T of 1908.
 
To start with, Casey said, Model Ts reached top speeds of only 40 miles an hour. They guzzled motor oil, about a quart a month. The original tops were made of canvas, and they had no heating or cooling systems. They also had none of the safety features of modern cars: no bumpers, no air bags, no seat belts, no antilock breaks.
 
The cars had large, skinny wheels to more easily clear the obstacles on rocky, rutted roads. Corner them too fast and they could tip over. And if you crashed, the windshield would usually shatter into sharp, jagged pieces that could slice you to ribbons.
 
""The government would not allow anyone to sell Model Ts today because they're so unsafe,"" Casey said. ""It's a car that no one would use on a regular basis today. It's not a fair comparison.""
 
We agree that the two cars are totally different. But Obama was careful in the way he phrased his statement: ""The 1908 Model T earned better gas mileage than a typical SUV sold in 2008.""  As long as you don't consider any factors other than mileage, he's right. We rate his statement Mostly True.

AIG retention bonuses going to employees it plans to terminate
","
Often lost in the raging debate over $165 million in bonuses paid to AIG employees — amid a $170 billion taxpayer-funded bailout — is the fact that these were not performance bonuses, they were ""retention awards."" Essentially, they were payments made to employees to keep them from leaving the crumbling company.
 
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D-Md., has been railing against the retention bonuses for months, but this week he came across a line in a recent AIG filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that really galled him.
 
""Keep in mind, in their filings — AIG's recent filings — they said they were giving $57 million to people who were being terminated,"" Cummings said in an interview on ABC's

Good Morning America

on March 16. ""I mean, that goes in the opposite direction of retention. And I really do think the American people are being played for fools by AIG.""
 
Sure enough, if you go to page 222 of AIG's

10-K filing

last month, you'll find this line: ""Restructuring expenses include $44 million of retention awards and Total amount expected to be incurred includes $57 million for retention awards for employees expected to be terminated.""
 
What? Retention bonuses to people you don't plan to...you know...retain?
 
""As part of restructuring the company, we will ultimately eliminate jobs that are, at the moment, critical to maintaining ongoing operations and winding down certain businesses,"" Christina Pretto, an AIG spokeswoman, told Bloomberg. ""To have one of these positions obviously implies an uncertain future, and creates an incentive to leave the company. To retain such mission-critical people, we are making retention payments to them.""
 
In all, AIG committed to $1 billion worth of retention payments. In a Dec. 5, 2008, letter to  Rep. Cummings, AIG chairman and CEO Edward Liddy said retaining key employees is critical for the company to maintain its standing in the eyes of reinsurers and rating agencies, and ultimately is essential for AIG to recoup as much as it can for taxpayers. ""We would be doing a disservice to the taxpayer — and would place AIG's asset divestiture plan at risk — if we did not act decisively to ensure that our key employees remain with the company,"" said Liddy, who took over the reins at AIG in September at the government's request.
 
With the company posting monstrous losses, we should note that these retention payments will essentially be paid through the infusion of cash from the taxpayer-funded bailouts.
 
At the moment, the retention payments that have drawn the most scorn are those to employees in the financial products division, the folks that got the insurance conglomerate into the deep mess it's currently in. Those agreements predate the company bailouts by the federal government. Back in April 2008 and ""due to the declining market environment,"" the company established an employee retention plan with financial products employees ""to manage and unwind its complex business,"" according to SEC filings. An installment payment on those retention bonuses came due on March 15 to the tune of $165 million. That's the payment that triggered the recent political storm.
 
According to a letter sent by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to House Financial Services Charman Barney Frank on March 17, 73 employees got retention bonuses of $1 million or more; and 11 of them are no longer working at AIG (including one who got $4.6 million). In all, the New York attorney general's office found that 52 of the 418 employees who got the retention bonuses have left the company.
 
Liddy said the retention bonuses amounted to going to those employees and saying, ""You have a job. That job's going to go away after you wind down the book of business that you manage. If you'll stay...""


In a congressional hearing on March 18, Frank asked if those who got retention bonuses and then left had to give back their bonus. ""No,"" Liddy said. ""The arrangement is, if you stay, wind down your particular business, do a good job of it, and we're comfortable with the job you've done, you'll get that retention bonus.""
 
""I'm trying desperately to prevent an uncontrolled collapse of that business,"" Liddy said. ""This is the only way to improve AIG's ability to pay taxpayers back quickly and completely and the only way to avoid a systemic shock to the economy that the U.S. government help was meant to relieve. Make no mistake. Had I been CEO at the time, I would never have approved the retention contracts that were put in place over a year ago. It was distasteful to have to make these payments, but we concluded that the risk to the company and, therefore, the financial system in the economy, were unacceptably high. And if not paid, we ran the risk that we would have happen what everyone has worked so hard thus far not to have happen.""


Liddy said he has since asked employees of AIG Financial Products ""to step up and do the right thing. Specifically, I've asked those who received retention payments in excess of $100,000 or more to return at least half of those payments."" Some have already stepped forward, he said, and offered to give up a hundred percent of their payments.
 
Meanwhile, legislators have been scrambling to find ways to wiggle out of the retention contracts, with some threatening to pass legislation such that if the bonuses aren't returned, they will be taxed to nothing.
 
In a letter to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Liddy vowed to do everything he could to reduce 2009 retention payments by at least 30 percent.
 
But he also warned that messing with commitments to employees could lead to a mass exodus that could threaten the company's ability to make taxpayers whole. ""On the one hand, all of us at AIG recognize the environment in which we operate and the remonstrations of our president for a more restrained system of compensation for executives,"" Liddy said. ""On the other hand, we cannot attract and retain the best and brightest talent to lead and staff the AIG businesses — which are now being operated principally on behalf of the American taxpayers — if employees believe that their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury.""
 
Cummings isn't buying that.
 
In a statement provided to PolitiFact, Cummings said that while he ""understands where AIG is coming from in this argument, when I look at the bigger picture here, I just do not see this as being a reasonable argument for several reasons. First, it is simply unnecessary to give a $4 million bonus to someone who is already making $1 million a year — we are talking about quadrupling an annual salary — to keep someone at a company when the job market is as weak as it is. In these times, a weekly paycheck is all the retention payment anybody needs. Second, AIG is losing employees anyway, despite offering these retention payments. And, if you think about it, this makes sense. What employee is going to stay with a company when the company announces that it is liquidating its assets? This company has suffered the greatest quarterly loss in the history of corporate record-keeping in this country. Third, I just do not believe that the company is implementing the retention program in the most efficient and effective manner. I could possibly understand giving retention payments to a handful of top employees to keep them — but thousands of employees? I just cannot fathom how there can be thousands of indispensable employees right now, when there are hundreds of thousands of people in the financial sector who have lost their jobs.""
 
David Schmidt, a consultant at executive pay firm James F. Reda & Associates, said retention award programs are fairly common for companies that are in trouble. ""That doesn't mean you can't be annoyed by it,"" he said. But the bottom line, he said, is that if the government figures out a way not to pay the bonuses, it likely means ""a lot of these folks are just going to leave."" The reality, Schmidt said, is that many of these employees are in high demand.
 
This is a complex issue, and much of the detail about the retention bonuses has not yet been publicly revealed. And it's certainly debatable whether the company needs to be paying such large retention bonuses to so many employees. But the fact we are checking here is whether AIG plans to spend $57 million on retention awards for people it expects to terminate in the future. And the answer, according to the company's recent SEC filings, is yes. We rule the statement True.

Wyden and Snowe wanted AIG bonus money back
","
As public outrage builds over bonuses issued by bailout recipient AIG, two senators are claiming they tried to outlaw such bonuses but were thwarted by the White House and fellow lawmakers.
 
Sen. Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Sen. Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, say they proposed an amendment to the stimulus bill in February that would have imposed heavy penalties on bailout recipients that refused to pay back bonuses over $100,000.
 
Wyden made the claim during an appearance on

The Rachel Maddow Show

on MSNBC, and in other interviews.
 
""Back in early February, you and Senator Snowe added an amendment to the stimulus bill that, I think, would have prevented AIG from giving out these millions of dollars worth of bonuses,"" Maddow said to Wyden. ""That amendment was taken out of the bill. Am I right that your amendment would have stopped what we are experiencing right now?""
 
""You are right,"" Wyden said. ""And that's what's so sad about this situation. It simply didn't need to happen.""
 
Wyden went on to predict that a similar measure would pass now that the issue has gained so much public attention.
 
""I think finally, we'll get it done,"" he said. ""The tragedy is it should have been done a month ago when we had bipartisan legislation that got through the Senate and then somehow mysteriously disappeared.""
 
In a separate interview with the Huffington Post, Wyden blamed both the White House and fellow legislators, suggesting they caved to lobbyists for Wall Street who opposed the measure.
 
Wyden and Snowe announced the amendment Feb. 4, proposing it be tacked onto another amendment to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, otherwise known as the stimulus bill.
 
Last year's financial rescue package, commonly known as the bailout, had ""left open the escape hatch of golden parachutes for top executives on Wall Street,"" Snowe, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said at the time. ""This amendment insists on strong taxpayer protections and guarantees that no tax dollars be used to prop up Wall Street executives.""
 
The amendment required companies that received government rescue funds in 2008 to repay within four months any bonuses above $100,000 or face an excise tax of 35 percent on the portion of the bonus over $100,000.
 
It reportedly

would have raised

as much as $3.2 billion, a substantial chunk of the $18.4 billion in employee bonuses paid out in 2008 by companies that received more than $274 billion of bailout funds.
 
Wyden pressed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on the amendment at a Senate Budget Committee hearing on Feb. 11.
 
""Given the fact that the president, to his credit, called these bonuses shameful, and time is short, where do you stand on getting a solution to the problem of these just-paid excessive bonuses in the economic stimulus legislation?"" Wyden asked.
 
""We've talked about that privately,"" Geithner said, in part, in a lengthy response. ""Our staffs are working together. We'd like to work with you on how to achieve that objective.""
 

American Banker

, a trade publication, reported on Feb. 12 that the banking industry ""strongly opposes"" the provision, ""which the banking industry hopes to scale back when the House and Senate hash out differences between the stimulus bills.""
 
They appear to have succeeded. On Feb. 12, the Associated Press reported: ""The provision was removed as House and Senate negotiators hammered out final details of the $789 billion economic stimulus legislation this week.""
 
There is no documentation in the public record of exactly who removed the provision.
 
Wyden overstated the case a bit when he responded in the affirmative to Maddow's suggestion that the amendment ""would have stopped what we are experiencing right now."" It would not have eliminated the bonuses entirely — only that portion over $100,000 per person. And the tax that would have been imposed on companies that did not comply would have recovered just 35 percent of the excessive amount.
 
But Wyden can legitimately claim to have taken on the issue with gusto — well before the current outrage over AIG's bonuses. We find his claim to be Mostly True.

AIG does not insure the pensions of Congress
","
An anonymous e-mail making the rounds claims that Congress has its own selfish reasons for bailing out the insurance company American International Group, better known as AIG.
 
""Remember when this economic crisis hit, and Congress let Bear Sterns go under, pushed a bunch of forced marriages between banks, etc.?"" the e-mail asks.


""Then they bailed out AIG.  At the time, I thought: 'That's strange. What does an insurance company have to do with this crisis?'


""I think I just found the answer.  Among other things, AIG INSURES THE PENSION TRUST OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS!! No wonder they got bailed out right away!""
 
Note the classic signs of the chain e-mail — all capital letters and LOTS OF EXCLAMATION POINTS!!! But we digress ...
 
To recap the history here, AIG is an insurance company that collapsed in September 2008. Because the firm had so many obligations, the federal government concluded the broader economy could be badly damaged if AIG were simply allowed to go under.
 
So the government gave AIG  access to credit to make good on its obligations, more than $150 billion so far. AIG has in turn paid billions to customers such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wachovia.
 
We looked into the claim that AIG insures the pensions of members of Congress.
 
""It's not true — totally bogus,"" said Mike Orenstein, spokesman for U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which oversees federal pensions. He said he's been asked the question at least three times since the beginning of the year.
 
AIG does sell retirement services like annuities. But it does not insure federal pensions, said AIG spokesman Joseph Norton.
 
Next we turned for confirmation to the National Taxpayers Union, a nonprofit advocacy group that favors lower taxes and smaller government.
 
""Neither federal pensions in general nor congressional pensions in particular are insured by any private entity,"" said Pete Sepp, vice president for policy and communications.
 
The government doesn't need to insure its pensions because the pensions are ultimately paid for by government revenues. That means Congress will get their pensions ""until the federal government itself goes broke. If that were to happen, we would be a Third World country,"" he said.
 
The National Taxpayers Union believes this dynamic puts off needed reforms to the Civil Service Retirement System and Social Security, he added.
 
We should add that Congress members do not receive their full salary for life, as some Internet sources suggest. (This year, congressional pay is scheduled to be $174,000 a year, though there is a possibility Congress will reject a recent cost-of-living raise.) Instead, members accrue benefits based on how long they serve. In 2006, the average pension was about $61,000 a year for 20 years of service, according to the Congressional Research Service.
 
If anyone insures congressional pensions, it's U.S. taxpayers, not AIG. The chain e-mail that claims AIG insures congressional pensions is just plain wrong. In fact, we rate it Pants on Fire!

Executives in Japan do not regularly commit suicide
","
Lots of elected officials expressed outrage at the news that failing insurance company AIG was giving large bonuses to employees while accepting taxpayer money to stay afloat. But few expressed their outrage with AIG officials as starkly as Sen. Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa.
 
""I suggest, you know, obviously, maybe they ought to be removed,"" Grassley said. ""But I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little bit better toward them if they'd follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say, I'm sorry, and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide.""
 
""And in the case of the Japanese, they usually commit suicide before they make any apology.""
 
The next day, Grassley specified that he was not suggesting AIG executives should kill themselves, though he did say he wanted an apology.
 
We wondered if Grassley was right that Japanese executives who make significant mistakes often apologize and then resign or commit suicide.
 
We found many news stories of Japanese executives apologizing, a process in which the person stands and bows deeply. One story we found about a Sony battery problem detailed the exact posture of the executives. It noted they were seated while they bowed ""and did not bow deeply,"" which signaled how Sony had been reluctant to admit fault. The story noted that none of the Sony executives resigned.
 
We also spoke with Gary Knight, a professor of international business at Florida State University who teaches annual business courses in Japan.
 
Knight confirmed that apologies and resignations are more common among Japanese executives than their U.S. counterparts.
 
""Culturally, it's pretty different than the U.S.,"" Knight said. ""It's certainly the norm that if a top executive commits a blunder that affects employees or customers, they would apologize for it.""
 
Resignations are common, too, though that doesn't always solve problems, Knight said.
 
""The person resigning may be the most knowledgeable person at the firm. Meanwhile, you're faced with finding a manager who can solve the problem,"" he said.
 
But executive suicides — not so common. Knight said they happen occasionally, but overall they are ""pretty rare.""
 
Suicide in Japan is actually a serious social problem, according to several news reports. More than 30,000 people a year commit suicide in Japan, giving it one of the highest suicide rates among industrialized countries.
 
None of the reports we reviewed singled out shamed executives, however. In fact, the most commonly cited groups of special concern were laid-off workers, the elderly and the young.
 
In conclusion, we find that Grassley gets the apologies and resignations right, but overstates the regularity of suicides. Apologies appear to be much more common than suicides. So we rate his statement Half True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Christina Romer']","
Yes, but take this prediction with a grain of salt
","
Wasn't this supposed to be the next Great Depression?
 
So we were surprised to hear the chair of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, Christina Romer, claim that experts are saying the economy will start to recover later this year.
 
We suspected her claim, at the very least, lacked a bit of context. Which it does.
 
She made it on the March 15

Meet the Press

, after host David Gregory played a recent tape of her saying ""most people are predicting"" positive growth in the economy ""some time in the second half of the year.""
 
Romer, whom Obama recruited from the University of California-Berkeley, stood by that. ""I should say my prediction is very much what most private forecasters are saying,"" she said. ""We know that this last week the Blue Chip Economic Indicators came out that surveys lots of private forecasters. Almost all of them are predicting a turnaround in the third quarter and positive growth in the fourth quarter.""
 

Blue Chip Economic Indicators

is a monthly newsletter by specialty publisher Wolters Kluwer Law & Business. It claims to survey ""America's leading business economists"" and compiles their economic forecasts. It serves a blue-chip audience: A one-year subscription costs $875.
 
The consensus, or average prediction of the panelists, was that the economy as measured by the gross domestic product would grow 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 2009 and 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
 
That was not quite enough information to gauge the accuracy of Romer’s claim, so we asked editor Randell Moore for more detail. He said 50 economists were surveyed, with 30 predicting positive growth in the third quarter of 2009 and 45 predicting positive growth in the fourth quarter.
 
That does indeed support Romer’s claim, since 45 out of 50 constitutes ""almost all"" the forecasters.
 
Some context is in order, though. The 19-page report was hardly rosy. In fact, it was more pessimistic than the previous month's issue.
 
The issue's summary was titled, ""The Longest, Deepest Recession Since World War II"" and it said, ""The economy still is expected to emerge from recession by the end of this year but consensus forecasts of economic growth in 2010 slipped lower once again this month.""
 
The forecasters predicted that for 2009 as a whole, the economy is expected to shrink 2.6 percent, the largest annual contraction since the Great Depression. That was worse than the prior month’s prediction of 1.9 percent.
 
There were some glimmers of hope in there, but they came amid glum news, as in this sentence: ""They say it’s always darkest before the dawn. Well, this week bordered on a full-scale blackout.""
 
Also, we should add a general note of caution about the reliability of the newsletter. The economists surveyed work for companies such as JPMorgan Chase, General Motors Corp., Morgan Stanley, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Fannie Mae, all of which have decidedly less-than-sterling track records of late.
 
As a

New York Times

writer

noted in January

, ""these professional forecasters are typically employed by investment banks, trade associations and big corporations. They base their forecasts on computer models that tend to see the American economy as basically sound, even in the worst of times.""
 
The

New York Times

article added, ""They did not see a recession until late summer. One reason they were blindsided: Their computer models do not easily account for emotional factors like the shock from the credit crisis and falling housing prices that have so hindered borrowing and spending.""
 
Very few economists predicted the current economic crisis. One who did, New York University professor and noted pessimist Nouriel Roubini (who is not a Blue Chip panelist),

said on March 9

that he saw ""no hope for the recession ending in 2009 and (it) will more than likely last into 2010.""
 
But Romer is entitled to highlight optimistic forecasts. And it's true that almost all the panelists surveyed in

Blue Chip Economic Indicators

predicted a rebound by the fourth quarter of 2009. We find Romer's claim to be True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'John Boehner']","
Yes, Rep. John Boehner has never asked for earmarks
","
When House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, urged President Obama to veto the $410 billion omnibus spending bill because of all the earmarks in it, he spoke from particularly high ground on the issue.


""I don't do earmarks,"" Boehner said in a news conference on March 12, 2009. ""I've never done one. I'm not going to do one.""


Indeed, that's what he promised back in 1990 when he was first running for Congress. He often says he told voters, ""If you are electing me to raid the federal treasury on your behalf, you're electing the wrong guy.""


For eighteen years, Boehner says he hasn't wavered.


A strict earmark-free record would put him in rare company, so we decided to check it out.


""He hasn't taken any,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group that doggedly tracks earmarks. ""He has bragged about that long before this ever became a big deal, and he's right.""


We reviewed press coverage of Boehner since he was elected and couldn't find any either.
 
We did find several instances where local officials pushing for various highway projects ran up against Boehner's hard line. In an article in the

Dayton Daily News

in 2002, one official lamented that his area would have difficulty getting federal money for a highway project because of the congressman's policy.
 
""If you're looking for a congressman to go after a bunch of earmarks, he's not your guy,'"" said Bryan Bucklew, vice president of the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce.
 
It's a principled stance that hasn't always sat well with fellow Republican legislators who believe in earmarks, either.


But Boehner has stuck to his pledge. In May 2008, he told the

Wall Street Journal,

""It might have been the best decision I ever made.""


Yet despite his personal ban, Boehner has never argued for earmarks to be eliminated completely.


""I don't think I want to hold all my colleagues to that same standard,"" Boehner said in a

Fox News Sunday

interview on Feb. 5, 2006. ""There's an appropriate place for some of these earmarks, but we need less numbers of earmarks and more transparency and more accountability. Members' names ought to be associated with them. They ought to be visible. And members ought to have a chance to see these before they become law.""
 
This year, Boehner was joined in eschewing earmarks by other House Republican leaders: Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia and Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana. But in the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., sponsored or cosponsored 53 earmarks worth $75.5 million, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense.
 
All told, TCS counted more than 8,500 disclosed earmarks in the omnibus bill, coming to $7.7 billion. Together with $6.6 billion in disclosed earmarks in the three 2009 spending bills that passed in the fall, earmarks for the year come to $14.3 billion, which is $500 million less than earmarks last year. As is the custom, Republicans, as the minority party, got about 40 percent of them.


Of the 178 Republican House members, only 39 did not have earmarks in the omnibus, according to TCS. Three Democrats did not accept earmarks.


As for Boehner, he can rightfully claim he hasn't ever asked for or taken an earmark. We rule his statement True.

Eighth graders are in ninth, but showing improvement, not falling
","
In his first major education speech, President Obama endorsed charter schools, merit pay for teachers and increases in school spending. He justified his agenda partly by saying American students are slipping compared to counterparts around the world.
 
""We've let our grades slip, our schools crumble, our teacher quality fall short, and other nations outpace us,"" Obama said in the March 10 speech to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. ""In eighth grade math, we've fallen to ninth place.""
 
Since Obama brought up math, we decided to check his. Turns out we had to pull out the red pen.
 
We asked the White House to defend Obama's claim, and received no response. His claim that eighth grade math students in the United States are in ninth place internationally almost certainly comes from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, a periodic comparison of math and science achievement carried out since 1995 by research institutions and government agencies worldwide.  
 
The

most recent study

, published in 2007, did indeed show U.S. eighth graders in ninth place behind five East Asian countries and Hungary, England and Russia. 
 
But it was misleading to say they had ""fallen"" to ninth place. In 1995, they

came in 28th

. In 1999, they

moved up to 19th

. In 2003, they climbed

to 15th

. So rather than falling, U.S. students have actually

improved

in the past decade.
 
We considered giving the president partial credit since American students did come in ninth. But the point of his statement was that they had ""fallen"" to that position and that mathematics performance in the United States is getting worse relative to other countries. And that's just plain False.

Bridge to Nowhere could not happen again, Schumer says
","
What discussion of earmarks would be complete without a reference to the Bridge to Nowhere?

We're talking, of course, about the famed plan to build a nearly $400 million bridge to connect the tiny Alaska city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport. The project was derisively nicknamed the Bridge to Nowhere and became a national symbol of wasteful earmark spending before the project was killed.

Well, have no fear, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., says such a project could never again rear its porky head.

Schumer made the claim while fending off criticism of thousands of earmarks in the $410 billion omnibus spending bill signed by President Obama on March 11. Schumer noted that since the Bridge to Nowhere controversy, Democrats have instituted earmark reforms that have added transparency and accountability.

""They are transparent,"" Schumer of earmarks during an interview March 8, 2009, on NBC's  Meet the Press  . ""No Bridge to Nowhere could occur.""

We're not contesting Schumer's claim about more transparency. Last year, Democratic lawmakers spearheaded reforms that require each earmark be attached to a legislative sponsor. Lawmakers used to be able to earmark spending secretly. In the House, congressmen also must say where the project is, what it's for and why, and attest that they don't have a financial stake in it. 
""Every earmark has someone's name attached to it,"" Schumer said. ""There's my name attached to some. ... So you can no longer ever get the kind of Bridge to Nowhere that brought everything — and that was put in at the last minute in the conference committee with no name on it. People for weeks searched who put this in. So there has been reform."" 
First, Schumer bases his argument on some bad information. The Bridge to Nowhere  did  have names attached. Everybody knew who was behind it. 
On June 12, 2003, Keith Ashdown of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group that tracks federal spending, issued a news release awarding a ""Golden Fleece"" to Rep. Don Young, the Alaska Republican who sponsored the bridge. The AP even wrote a story about it. 
The following year, on April 10, 2004, the  New York Times  ran a front-page story about the bridge under the headline, ""Built With Steel, Perhaps, but Greased With Pork."" In it, Rep. Young, who chaired the powerful transportation committee, boasted that he wanted to be ""a little oinker."" 
Unlike most earmarks, it was not part of an appropriations bill, but was added by Rep. Young in the summer of 2005 to a transportation bill at the last minute on the floor of the House. So Schumer is right to the extent that the bridge was attached somewhat late in the House consideration. But there was no doubt that Alaska lawmakers were behind it, certainly by the time the Senate took up the transportation bill.

And the debate was very public. Despite mounting criticism, Young defended the project, telling the  Anchorage Daily News  in July, ""These people keep saying it's nowhere, they're just smoking pot."" 
""This is about opening the island,"" Young said. ""It gives the opportunity for Ketchikan to grow. ... Once they build the bridge across, you have the opportunity to expand, and growth occurs, and that's the whole idea of bridges — to get across a body of water."" 
The bill was passed in August 2005. But in the ensuing months, the project became somewhat of a national laughingstock. That October, U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed an amendment that would have redirected $125-million in funding for the Alaska bridge toward reconstruction of a New Orleans bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina. 
Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens was apoplectic. 
Stevens threatened to quit, to become a ""wounded bull on the floor of this Senate,"" and he vowed that if the bill passed, ""I will be taken out of here on a stretcher."" 
""I will put the Senate on notice — and I don't kid people — if the Senate decides to discriminate against our state, to take money only from our state, I'll resign from this body,"" Stevens said. ""This is not the Senate I came to. This is not the Senate I've devoted 37 years to, if one senator can decide he'll take all the money from one state to solve a problem of another."" 
The amendment was defeated by a lopsided vote, and we note that Schumer was among those who voted against it. 
Later, a congressional committee directed the $225 million earmarked for the Gravina Island bridge to the Alaska Department of Transportation. So Alaska would keep the money, but it would no longer be tied to the Bridge to Nowhere. Alaska could decide how to spend the money as it saw fit. But with the estimated cost of the bridge rising sharply, and amid the reality that more federal dollars were not forthcoming, Gov. Sarah Palin officially killed the project on Sept. 21, 2007. 
The important thing in judging Schumer's claim is that transparency wasn't the problem here. Young and Stevens were vocal, public advocates for the project. They were not sneaking around. 
Indeed, what allows projects like the Bridge to Nowhere is the unwritten rule among lawmakers not to judge other lawmakers' earmark projects, lest they judge yours. 
Groups like Taxpayers for Common Sense applaud the earmark reforms that were made last year, just as they applaud the calls by Congress and the president this week to add even greater transparency for earmark projects in the future. 
But that won't eliminate wasteful earmark spending. 
""Other than shame and voter anger, there's nothing that would prevent, specifically, the Bridge to Nowhere,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""Certainly not because of any rules being put in place."" 
The Bridge to Nowhere is a household word because many people decided it was a waste of taxpayer money. But the legislator who sponsored it didn't think it was a waste. It's a matter of opinion. 
And there are no rules in place today that would prevent a legislator from proposing an earmark that he or she deems worthwhile but that others deem wasteful. So we very well could have more Bridges to Nowhere, which makes Schumer's statement False. 
Update: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that an arm of the Ketchikan to Gravina bridge was named after Rep. Don Young.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097287B00>],/factchecks/2009/mar/12/charles-schumer/bridge-to-nowhere-could-not-happen-again-schumer/

With Democrats now running the show, it's their turn to take the heat for earmarks in a $410 billion omnibus spending bill to keep the government running for the rest of the fiscal year.


Congressional Democrats and the White House have been quick to note this spending bill is actually a holdover from the previous administration, that things will be different next year, and that earmarks hit a peak during Republican control in the middle part of this decade.


On CNN's ""State of the Union"" on March 8, Peter Orszag, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said, ""Look, the earmarks have come down significantly, 75 percent.""


The same day on NBC's

Meet the Press

, Sen. Charles Schumer threw out a nearly identical assessment: ""The bottom line is, there's been serious reform. We are now, this year, two years later, there's one-fifth the earmarks there were before — not 80 percent, 20 percent from before. They are transparent. No Bridge to Nowhere could occur.""


When it comes to earmarks, lots of numbers get thrown around. Different groups have different definitions of earmarks. Some people look at the number of earmarks, some at the dollar amount, some both.


Most everyone agrees that earmarks have gone down with Democrats at the helm, but we haven't found any source to reasonably back up claims that earmarks have declined anywhere near 75 or 80 percent.


According to the math provided by the Senate Appropriations Committee (Democratic-controlled, we note), earmarks were reduced by 43 percent last year, and the omnibus appropriations bill reduces earmarks by another 5 percent.


There's a big caveat to their numbers: They do not include ""project-based"" federal programs. For example, the Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees federal water projects, has such a high percentage of earmarks in its overall budget that Democrats exclude the projects from the totals. Their reasoning is that if they promise to cut earmarks by a certain percentage, as they have in the past few years, these programs will be disproportionately cut. By their count, there are $3.8 billion worth of earmarks in the omnibus bill.
 
The most trusted source in earmark accounting, Taxpayers for Common Sense, doesn't go for excluding that ""non-project-based"" stuff.
 
""An earmark is an earmark,"" said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""You can't start sequestering things off. I mean, I can meet my weight loss goals if I don't count my butt.""
 
They count more than 8,500 disclosed earmarks in the omnibus bill, coming to $7.7 billion. Together with $6.6 billion in disclosed earmarks in the three 2009 spending bills that passed in the fall, earmarks for the year come to $14.3 billion, which is $500 million less than earmarks last year, they note. Less, but not a whole lot less in the big picture.
 
The total amount of last year's earmarks represented a 23 percent reduction from the high water mark in 2005, according to TCS. The slight reduction this year would add a couple percentage points to that. But in no way does it come anywhere near the reduction of 75 or 80 percent that Orszag and Schumer cited.
 
So, we asked, where did Schumer and Orszag get their figures?
 
Schumer's office didn't respond.
 
And a spokesman from Orszag's Office of Management and Budget sent this vague reply: ""A number of groups which tally earmarks have estimates on the level of reductions that are in the omnibus. Peter pulled from those.""
 
Um, okay.
 
In summary, based on the figures from the most respected source on earmarks, Taxpayers for Common Sense — which uses Congress' own definition of earmarks — the figures cited by Orszag and Schumer are way off.
 
The Appropriation Committee numbers are a little closer to those cited by Schumer and Orszag. But we don't buy this number because it excludes ""project-based"" federal programs.
 
We note that Obama, in an announcement about earmark reform on March 11, said earmarks ""hit their peak in the middle of this decade, when the number of earmarks had ballooned to more than 16,000."" This number appears to include ""project-based"" federal programs. As we think it should.
 
At any rate, the Appropriations Committee numbers suggest less than a 50 percent reduction — not 75 or 80 percent. We don't know where Orszag and Schumer got their numbers. And they aren't saying. At least not to us. But the authorities on this matter say their calculations are bunk. We agree. And we rule the statements False.

White House highlights one way the tax code goes easy on the rich
","
In defending President Obama's plan to reduce tax deductions for high earners, the White House has said the tax code is tilted toward rich guys.
 
They've understated the case considerably. We'll explain how in a bit. First, some background:
 
The issue arose when Obama proposed reducing the percentage of charitable contributions that taxpayers who earn more than $250,000 can take as a tax deduction, from 35 to 28 percent.
 
That would raise about $318 billion toward Obama's proposed $634 billion ""reserve fund"" to be used to reform health care, according to Obama's budget proposal. Critics, including some Republicans and nonprofit executives, don't like the idea.
 
At a White House news briefing, Jake Tapper of ABC News said the proposal was controversial and asked White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, ""Are you willing to consider a different revenue stream than that tax increase to fund health care?""
 
""Well, I do think all issues are on the table,"" Gibbs replied. ""Let's, though, just discuss the — I assume you're talking about the charitable contribution — I mean, a middle-class family donates a dollar to charity, they get 15 cents off their income tax. Bill Gates donates a dollar to charity, he takes 35 cents off his income tax. The proposal that the White House has would simply reduce those levels to the same levels that we saw during the Reagan administration.""
 
Budget director Peter Orszag made the same argument in

this blog post

.
 
Let's walk through how charitable deductions impact taxes. If you donate $1 to charity, you can list that as a deduction, meaning you can subtract $1 from your income before calculating your taxes.
 
High earners like Bill Gates pay a tax rate of 35 percent on the portion of their income that is over about $350,000. So if they subtract $1 from their taxable income, their tax burden drops by 35 percent of $1, which is 35 cents.
 
By contrast, couples with taxable income between $16,700 and $67,900 pay a top tax rate of 15 percent. If they make that same $1 contribution, and subtract the $1 from their income, their tax burden falls by just 15 percent of $1, or 15 cents.
 
Gibbs' point rests on the contention that couples making between $16,700 and $67,900 are middle class, which we believe is fair — the median household income in the U.S. is

$50,233

.
 
So Gibbs was right, except that he understated the case. Here's how:
 
First, you can't take any deduction for a charitable contribution unless you itemize your taxes. Folks in the 15 percent tax bracket are unlikely to do so, while rich folks are very likely to. Only 35 percent of all taxpayers itemized their taxes in 2004, but 87 percent of taxpayers in the top 10 percent were itemizers, according to the

Urban Institute

.
 
We're not going to penalize Gibbs for understating his case, because his numbers hold true when comparing two taxpayers who itemize, and he confined his comment to the income tax.
 
It's worth noting that the rich only enjoy bigger deductions because they pay more taxes — a top tax rate of 35 percent instead of 15 percent, and an estate tax on top of that. But it's also true that a charitable contribution of, say, $1,000 will take a much bigger bite out of a middle-class person's income than a high earner's.
 
That's all academic though. The bottom line is that Gibbs' number are accurate. We find this claim to be True.

Republicans opposed Obama's stimulus but not tax cuts
","In its latest installment of cable ads suggesting that Rush Limbaugh is the de facto leader of the Republican Party, the liberal Americans United for Change takes Republican leaders to task for failing to support the Democrats' economic stimulus package. In particular, we were intrigued by the counterintuitive suggestion that several prominent Republicans are against tax cuts for working families. ""Republican leaders,"" the announcer begins. ""Their policies created the worst economic crisis in a generation. ""But what did they say to President Obama’s recovery plan?"" A series of ""no's"" follow from Republican leaders, set to Jacques Offenbach's can-can from ""Orpheus in the Underworld"" (you'll know it when you hear it, and yes, we had to look that up). The four leaders: Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate; John Boehner, the leader of Republicans in the House; Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip; and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. ""…To tax cuts for 95% of working Americans?"" This time, the chorus of ""no's"" come courtesy of Sen. Jim DeMint; Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin; Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee; and McConnell. We're not even sure what Palin and Steele are doing here. Palin and Steele do not serve in the U.S. Congress. They could not vote on the stimulus plan. So their stated opposition to the bill amounted to nothing more than opinion. And the opinions they offered did not speak directly to the proposed tax cuts. More important, though, is the suggestion that these Republicans oppose tax cuts for working Americans. The stimulus package signed by Obama includes a tax credit for workers intended to offset payroll taxes. Single workers would get $400 and working couples would get $800. We have looked at this proposal in the past and confirmed that it would result in tax cuts for 95 percent of working families. And yes, most Republicans voted against that economic stimulus package. But Republican opposition to the bill overwhelmingly focused on the spending portion of the plan. Here's what Palin said about the stimulus plan in a news release: ""The governor recognizes that some form of economic stimulus is necessary, but not the bill that passed the Congress Friday. She has advocated for a package that includes federal spending for infrastructure, tax breaks for individuals and small businesses, and measures to address the housing situation. The governor believes the current legislation is too large and is not sufficiently focused on these objectives."" We note that Palin specifically states her support for a plan that includes ""tax breaks for individuals."" So what about the two Republicans in the ad who did vote against the bill? DeMint offered an alternative to the Democrats' stimulus plan called ""The American Option."" In a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation on Jan. 29, 2009, DeMint lambasted the Democrats' stimulus spending as wasteful and reckless. His plan, developed by J.D. Foster and William Beach of the Heritage Foundation, would make permanent the temporary tax cuts of  2001 and 2003 — now set to expire in 2011.  DeMint also proposed to cut tax rates nearly across the board. According to Foster, DeMint's plan eliminated any tax relief to those who pay no income tax; Foster and DeMint have likened that to welfare. The only ones who wouldn't get a tax cut under that plan are people paying less than 10 percent now, Foster said.  The DeMint plan also called for permanent repeal of the alternative minimum tax; permanently extending the $1,000 per child tax credit; and repeal of the ""marriage tax"" penalty. Sounds to us like a tax break for working Americans. Asked about the Americans United for Change ad, a spokeswoman in McConnell's office noted that McConnell (and DeMint) voted in favor of an amendment to the stimulus package offered by Sen. John McCain that they say would have provided tax relief to all income tax payers. The McCain amendment, which failed by a party-line vote of 40 to 57, called for approximately $275 billion in tax cuts. McCain said it ""would eliminate the 3.1 percent payroll tax for all employees for one year and use general revenues to pay for the Social Security obligation. It would allocate $60 billion to lower the 10 percent tax bracket to 5 percent for one year. It would lower the 15 percent tax bracket to 10 percent for one year."" In other words, the Republican plans included tax breaks for workers too. Just not the variety proposed by the Obama administration. So yes, DeMint and McConnell voted against the Democratic stimulus plan. But they said they did so mostly because of objections to the spending portion of the plan. And they offered alternatives that included tax cuts for working families. To be sure, there are big differences in the distribution of tax cuts proposed by the two sides. But to say Republicans opposed tax cuts for working families based on opposition to the stimulus package grossly distorts the Republican position. We rate the ad's claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C335040>],/factchecks/2009/mar/10/americans-united-change/republicans-opposed-obamas-stimulus-not-tax-cuts/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Joe Biden']","
Biden points out disparities between CEO and average worker pay
","
Vice President Joe Biden gave a shout-out to the common man at the annual conference of the AFL-CIO Executive Council on March 5.


""I want to point out that economic injustice and inequity are bad for everyone,"" Biden said. ""It's just not right, it's just not right, and everybody knows it — it's just not right when the average CEO makes $10,000 more every day — $10,000 more every day than what the average worker makes every year — $10,000 per day. And by the way, before I said it, I did the math, I did the math, and it's literally true.""


Truth be told, when Biden said he did the math himself, it set off our alarms. And nothing personal, but when politicians say something is ""literally true,"" we often find it literally isn't.


Biden seemed to be daring us to check this one. We took the bait.


Asked where he got the numbers, Biden's press office referred us to a report called ""The State of Working America"" prepared by the Economic Policy Institute. The authors found that top CEO pay in 2007 was 275 times that of a typical worker.


""In other words,"" the report states, ""in 2007 a CEO earned more in one workday (there are 260 in a year) than the typical worker earned all year.""


There are a couple qualifiers. One, the report looks at compensation for ""top U.S. executives,"" who they said made over $12 million a year. That includes salary as well as stock options, bonuses and other compensation.


In that scenario, Biden would be correct. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, production workers (the group the Economic Policy Institute used for the comparison) currently earn about $31,900 a year. Add $10,000 to that, multiple it by 260 (working days) in a year, and you get to nearly $11 million. CEOs at the country's biggest corporations made more than that.


Two things: First, Biden didn’t qualify his comment by saying work days. He said ""every day.""


But the bigger problem is that Biden said ""average CEOs."" The Economic Policy Institute report talks about ""top"" CEOs, the ones from the biggest U.S. firms. Average CEOs make much less.


According to a Mercer CEO compensation study based on proxies issued in 2008, CEOs at the 50 largest U.S. corporations pulled in just under $14 million a year. But CEOs at medium-sized companies brought in $9.4 million; and CEOs at small companies got $4.7 million.


On average, at the 350 companies surveyed by Mercer, CEOs got $7.3 million. That comes to $28,000 per working day — a little less than the average worker makes in a year.


The Corporate Library, an independent research firm, found in its survey that average CEO compensation in 2007 came to $5.3 million. That comes to $20,400 per working day, again lower than the average worker's annual salary.
 
Biden's underlying point is solid: The gap between CEO compensation and a typical worker's pay has widened exponentially over the last few decades.


According to the Economic Policy Institute report, in 1965, U.S. CEOs in major companies earned 24 times more than a typical worker; by 2007, they made 275 times more. U.S. CEOs also make far more than CEOs in other advanced countries, the report said.
 
""The major CEOs pay is otherworldly,"" said Larry Mishel, one of the authors of the Economic Policy Institute report.
 
Biden's comments would have been ""literally true,"" as he said, if he used the term ""top"" CEOs, or some other qualifier to note that he was talking about average pay for CEOs at the nation's biggest corporations. Mishel thinks that's what people have in mind when you say average CEOs. But Biden ""literally"" said ""average"" CEOs, and for average CEOs, that's not correct. Average CEOs make a little less per day than the average worker makes in a year. We rate Biden's statement Half True.

Obama invokes Republican icons on health care
","
Not content to emulate Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, Republican icons for whom President Obama has expressed admiration in the past, Obama has aligned himself with a third GOP hero on the issue of health care.
 
""The problems we face today are a direct consequence of actions that we failed to take yesterday,"" Obama said, opening a health care conference in the East Room of the White House on March 5. ""Since Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform nearly a century ago, we have talked and we have tinkered. We have tried and fallen short, we've stalled for time, and again we have failed to act because of Washington politics or industry lobbying.""
 
We wondered whether Roosevelt really proposed reform on the scale of the near-universal health care Obama advocates, or if the new president was pushing the whole bipartisan-appeal thing a bit far.
 
We consulted two well-regarded biographers of Roosevelt, H.W. Brands and Kathleen Dalton. Both confirmed that in 1912, when the former Republican president was running as a Progressive Party candidate for what would have been his third term (after a four-year break), the party advocated national health insurance in its

platform

.
 
Health care was the 11th issue listed under ""Social and Industrial Justice,"" after occupational safety, a child labor prohibition, a minimum wage, ""one day's rest in seven"" and other progressive ideas.
 
""The supreme duty of the Nation is the conservation of human resources through an enlightened measure of social and industrial justice,"" the platform said. ""We pledge ourselves to work unceasingly in State and Nation for ... the protection of home life against the hazards of sickness, irregular employment and old age through the adoption of a system of social insurance adapted to American use.""
 
""What this envisioned was pretty much what FDR accomplished with Social Security, but with health insurance added,"" said Brand, author of

TR: The Last Romantic

(1998).
 
""We don’t know the specifics of the plan,"" said Dalton, author of

Theodore Roosevelt: A Strenuous Life

(2002). ""The roots were probably British, though he knew about German health insurance.""
 
Dalton said unequivocally Obama was on solid ground evoking Roosevelt. Brands more or less agreed, though he cautioned that health care was ""not the priority that trust-busting or conservation was"" for Roosevelt. ""It's worth remembering that health care was a far smaller concern in those days,"" Brands said. ""Doctors had few medicines, and most people died or got better on their own. The biggest issues were public health — eradicating malaria, cleaning up water supplies, and so on.""
 
In

Healthcare Reform in America: A Reference Handbook

(2004), Jennie Kronenfeld, a sociology professor at Arizona State University, writes that ""this was the first inclusion of a health insurance plank in any national platform with a major candidate, although the Socialist Party had endorsed a compulsory system as early as 1904.""
 
Roosevelt and the Progressives, nicknamed the Bull Moose Party, lost the election to Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic Party candidate. Republican William Taft finished third.
 
Clearly, Obama is on solid ground tracing the push for national health care back to Theodore Roosevelt. We find this claim to be True.
