Liberal group tags Bobby Jindal as 'anchor baby'
","Billionaire Donald Trump’s immigration proposals include forcing Mexico to pay for a wall at the border, tripling the number of immigration officers, and ending the long-standing practice of birthright citizenship. There are exceptions but generally speaking, if you are born in the United States, you can claim citizenship regardless of the immigration status of your parents. This goes back to the 14th Amendment. Once Trump raised the issue, other GOP contenders followed suit, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. On Aug. 17, 2015, Jindal tweeted, ""We need to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants."" This prompted the liberal group Occupy Democrats to post a meme on its Facebook page with this message: "" ‘We have to end birthright citizenship to stop anchor babies,’ says Republican Bobby Jindal whose noncitizen parents arrived in the U.S. four months before he was born and used his birthright citizenship to become Americans, making him an anchor baby."" The part we’re fact-checking is the claim that Jindal’s parents gained citizenship through him. People define ""anchor baby"" in different ways. Some use it when food assistance and medical care for a low-income child of undocumented immigrants produce indirect benefits for the parents. That doesn’t apply in Jindal’s case. For one, his parents had healthy incomes when they arrived, and more to the point, Occupy Democrats focused on another meaning of anchor baby — a child through whom a noncitizen can craft a path to full citizenship. Coming to America The Facebook post is shaky on its quotation of Jindal. His tweet didn’t mention ""anchor babies."" The closest he came to saying those words was during an interview with Fox News where, on being pressed by the host, Jindal said, ""I’m happy to use the phrase,"" but he still didn’t actually use it. However, regarding Jindal’s personal timeline, the post is accurate. Jindal’s parents moved from India to Baton Rouge, La., on Feb. 1, 1971. Jindal was born on June 10, 1971. So that’s just about four months later. Back in the days when people like Trump were clamoring for President Barack Obama to show his birth certificate, Jindal moved to ensure that no such questions would hang about him. In 2011, the Times-Picayune reported that Jindal had produced his birth certificate. It showed that he was born at Woman’s Hospital in Baton Rouge to Raj Gupta, his mother, and Amar Jindal, his father. At the time, his mother had a scholarship to study nuclear physics at Louisiana State University, and his father, an engineer professor, was working for a subsidiary of the Kansas City Southern Railway. A couple of years later, Amar Jindal took a new job with the Exxon oil company. Jindal’s mother Raj Gupta earned two master’s degrees, one in physics and another in nuclear engineering. She ultimately worked for the state Labor Department in information technology. Mike Reed, communications director in the Louisiana governor’s office, told us that Raj Gupta became an American citizen in 1976, and Amar Jindal followed 10 years later in 1986. Why does that matter? Because those dates mean that Jindal’s birthright citizenship played no legal role in his parent’s citizenship applications. Let’s see why. 21 is the magic number Two leaders in immigration law explained that Jindal only could have helped his parents become citizens when he had turned 21 years old. Under the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, the child of immigrants can sponsor them to become permanent residents. The child must be a citizen and must be 21 or older. Once the parents are permanent residents, they must live in America for five straight years. After that, they can apply for citizenship. If Jindal’s citizenship had made any difference, the earliest his parents could have been eligible would have been 1992, five years after he turned 21. When his mother became a citizen in 1976, Jindal was 5, and in 1986, for his father’s naturalization, he was 15. It’s not even close. ""If both parents had lawful permanent residence, then it doesn’t make a difference if they had a kid,"" said David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Lenni Benson, a law professor at New York Law School, also said that given the Jindals’ circumstances, the son’s citizenship was ""irrelevant."" ""Once they secured immigrant visas and became lawful permanent residents, they could seek naturalization on their own after five years of residence and meeting other requirements,"" Benson said. Everything Leopold and Benson told us matches the rules that we found on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. At the end of the day, there is no evidence that Jindal was an ""anchor baby."" Occupy Democrats did not return a message to the group’s email address. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said Bobby Jindal’s parents used his birthright citizenship to become Americans. We reviewed the law and spoke to two experts in immigration law. The only way Jindal might have been able to help his parents become citizens is if he had been 21. He was 5 when his mother became a citizen and 15 when his father took the same step. The experts we reached told us Jindal’s citizenship was irrelevant, bringing Occupy Democrats' claim into the realm of ridiculous. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2015/aug/25/occupy-democrats/liberal-group-tags-jindal-anchor-baby/

Black Lives Matter activist says 'the Clintons' passed policy that led to mass incarceration
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a glimpse of her approach to issues affecting African-Americans in a tense exchange with Black Lives Matter activists that was recorded and spread across social media. Clinton told Boston-area organizers Julius Jones and Daunasia Yancey that she didn’t believe in ""changing hearts"" on issues of racial justice but in changing laws and reallocating resources instead. Jones and Yancey expressed concern about Clinton’s remarks on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show the next week. ""She doesn’t actually feel like you can move this issue forward other than through policy,"" Jones said, ""even though the policy mistakes that she and the Clintons made got us, in large degree, to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration."" We wanted to see if Jones was right to blame the Clintons for the United States’ prison woes. We reached out to Jones, who identifies himself as the founder of Black Lives Matter Worcester, and Black Lives Matter Boston to clarify what Jones meant, but we did not hear back from either source. The underlying policy, however, is well-known. The question is how much it contributed to the growth of America’s prison population. As we'll see, the growth of the prison population started well before the federal law. A ‘tough-on-crime environment’ As Jones suggests, the United States has the highest incarceration rate among developed nations, at around 700 prisoners per 100,000 people. African-Americans in particular are locked up at disproportionate rates. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 37 percent of the 1.5 million men in state and federal prisons in 2013 were black, more than twice the percentage of their share of the population. It wasn’t always this high; before 1975, the incarceration rate hovered around 200 prisoners. Some of the growth had to do with Clinton policies, but experts said not all. Crime policy during the 1970s and 1980s was driven by the ""War on Drugs,"" an initiative launched by President Richard Nixon in 1971. Nixon famously called drug abuse ""public enemy No. 1,"" which led to tougher sentencing and more arrests. New York passed the nation’s first mandatory minimums for drug offenses in 1973, and Washington passed the first state-level truth-in-sentencing law in 1984. By 1987, five states had adopted sentencing guidelines for judges to follow. President Bill Clinton took office in January 1993 touting a ""tough-on-crime"" agenda in response to an increase in violent crime and swelling homicide numbers. High-profile killings, such as the murder of Polly Klaas, followed later that year. Bill Clinton was instrumental in the passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Authored by then-Sen. Joe Biden, the sweeping crime bill provided $10 billion to fund new prisons, $6.1 billion for crime prevention and money for 100,000 new police officers. It also enforced harsher sentencing in federal prisons and incentivized the creation of ""truth-in-sentencing"" laws at the state level. These laws require violent offenders to serve a minimum portion of their original sentence by ruling out the possibility of early parole. Under the bill, states that set this minimum at 85 percent of the sentence were granted funding for new prisons, and by 1998, 27 states and the District of Columbia had qualified. The president took the final minutes of his first State of the Union to lobby for the bill. Hillary Clinton, too, campaigned for the legislation in speeches and interviews across the country. The bill ultimately found wide support among Democrats and a handful of Republicans. Just five years after the crime bill was passed, 29 states had truth-in-sentencing laws, and 24 had three strikes laws. The bill’s effect So did the crime bill lead to mass incarceration? The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit group that supports reducing the prison population, has tracked the massive expansion of people in federal, local and state prisons over the past century.  Yes, the overall inmate population of the United States has grown significantly since 1994. But the sharp upward trend actually started in the early 1980s. Prisons were adding inmates in 1990 at about the same rate they were in 1997, three years after the crime bill became law. In addition, the bill’s new sentencing standards only directly applied to federal cases. But most of the growth since 1980 has taken place within state systems, which have added almost 1.25 million prisoners over that time. So even though the number of people in federal prison has grown, perhaps as a result of those new standards, federal prisoners represent only a small fraction of the national prison population’s overall growth. And while the bill incentivized truth-in-sentencing laws at the state level, many states had already enacted harsher laws on their own by 1994, said Marc Mauer, the executive director of the Sentencing Project, a prison policy think tank. Mauer said it’s hard to place the onus of responsibility solely on the Clinton-backed crime bill because the trend towards mass incarceration started as early as 1980. ""(The bill) is sometimes unfairly viewed as being the major factor that has contributed to high incarceration rates,"" he said. So what really drove up the inmate population? ""Criminal justice policy leading up to the crime bill was driven by the ‘War on Drugs’ and the desire to appear ‘tough on crime’ by focusing on punishment and retribution, not rehabilitation,"" said Nicholas Turner, president of the Vera Institute of Justice, an advocacy and research group that published a retrospective on the bill in 2014. Still, the 1994 bill was the single biggest legislative victory for the tough-on-crime movement. It ""certainly didn’t help"" the mass incarceration epidemic, Turner said. Crime rates have been on the decline since the early 1990s, making today’s high incarceration levels even more apparent. In the past few years, the Clintons have backtracked on the policies they once championed. The former president seems to regret the bill’s passage. ""I signed a bill that made the problem worse,"" he recently told the NAACP. ""And I want to admit that."" Hillary Clinton has also called for changes to the justice system during her presidential campaign, saying in an April 2015 speech that ""we don't want to create another 'incarceration generation.' "" Clinton's campaign highlighted its transcript of her exchange with Black Lives Matter activists where she concedes that ""what was tried and how it was implemented has not produced the kinds of outcomes that any of us would want.""   Our ruling Jones said, ""The policy mistakes that (Hillary) and the Clintons made got us, in large degree, to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration."" While Hillary Clinton as first lady had no official role in voting for or signing the 1994 crime bill, she certainly championed some of its policies that are now partially blamed for the growth of the prison population, such as longer, tougher prison sentences. The crime bill was not the root cause of this growth, however, as America’s prison population had been expanding since the late 1980s.

Glen Sturtevant says Virginia had ""zero percent"" growth last year
","Virginia needs a dose of Republican economic medicine to get out of a funk, says Glen Sturtevant, a Richmond School Board member who is running for the state Senate. ""Last year, we had zero percent growth in GDP in Virginia -- zero percent,"" Sturtevant said during an Aug. 18 candidates forum, sponsored by WCVE Richmond Public Radio. ""The only states that did worse than us were Alaska and Mississippi."" Sturtevant is seeking the 10th District Senate seat that long has been held by Republican John Watkins, who is not seeking reelection. Also running is Dan Gecker, a Democrat who serves on the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors; Marleen Durfee, an independent who is a former Chesterfield supervisor; and Carl Loser, a Libertarian from Powhatan County. We wondered whether Sturtevant’s dreary economic statistics were correct. A spokesman for his campaign said the information came from a June article in The Washington Post about preliminary state gross domestic product figures for 2014 that were released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the U.S. Department of Commerce. GDP is the value of all finished goods and services produced. Virginia’s GDP of about $427 billion last year was indeed flat -- there was 0.0 percent inflation-adjusted growth from 2013. Only two states trailed the Old Dominion in growth: Mississippi and Alaska, which saw their state economies shrink. Nationally, inflation-adjusted GDP expanded by 2.2 percent last year. These figures are preliminary, and Virginia’s position might improve slightly when the bureau releases its final report in September. Last year, for example, the preliminary report ranked Virginia 49th in economic growth in 2013; the final ranking pegged Virginia’s growth at 0.4 percent, 43rd among the states. The commonwealth’s economic growth has been lackluster for several years, spanning Democratic and Republican governors. In 2011, the state saw 0.6 percent GDP growth; in 2012, it saw 0.7 percent growth. Economists we spoke with said Virginia’s low numbers largely reflect a slow recovery from the Great Recession that has been exacerbated by its dependence on federal spending in an era of budget cuts. Virginia is home to large military bases and a fleet of defense and government contractors and federal workers that drive the economy of Northern Virginia. The Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that in 2013, federal spending was responsible for about 31 percent of Virginia’s economic activity. Only Mississippi was more dependent. Under the federal sequestration compromise, which kicked in at the start of 2013, Congress and the White House agreed to an automatic series of budget cuts to trim the national debt by $1 trillion over nine years. Half of the savings are coming from defense spending and half from domestic programs. A 2013 study by Stephen Fuller, director of the Center of Regional Analysis at George Mason University, said Virginia was ""particularly vulnerable"" to sequestration and predicted it would bite $15.4 billion a year out of the state’s economy. That was the second largest of any state. Fuller found California was projected to lose $16.7 billion. Texas was third, projected to lose $11.9 billion annually. Both of those states are seeing much greater growth than Virginia: Texas ranked second in the nation last year, with 5.2 percent growth; California ranked ninth with 2.8 percent growth. It should be noted, however, that both states have larger, more diverse economies than Virginia. California’s GDP was $2.1 trillion last year, Texas’ was $1.5 trillion, and Virginia’s was $427 billion, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis figures. Maryland, where many federal employees live, ranked 36th in economic growth last year. Although Maryland also is home to many federal employees, it’s less dependent on federal spending than Virginia. According to Pew, Uncle Sam funds about 27.5 percent of the economic activity in Maryland. While federal cuts start the discussion about Virginia’s sluggish recovery from the recession, they’re not the whole conversation. The state has also been hurt by the sagging coal industry in Southwest Virginia and declining furniture manufacturing in Southside Virginia, according to Terry Terry Rephann, regional economist at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service.

Bush says Trump was a Democrat longer than a Republican 'in the last decade'
","After losing ground to Donald Trump in the polls following the first GOP presidential debate, Jeb Bush has gone on the attack, questioning the real estate mogul’s Republican bona fides. ""Mr. Trump doesn't have a proven conservative record,"" Bush said at a town hall in Merrimack, N.H., on Aug. 19, 2015. ""He was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican."" Bush also said Trump has given more money to Democrats than he has given to Republicans, a claim we’ve previously rated Mostly False. Bush tweeted video of the town hall the same night, calling Trump ""a tax-hiking Democrat."" In his defense, Trump said on Face The Nation on Aug. 23 that living in Manhattan for years affected his alignment. ""I was from an area that was all Democrat,"" Trump said. ""And, frankly, over the years, I have — and especially as I have gotten more and more involved — I have evolved."" We know Trump has changed his political affiliation several times over the years, but we wanted to figure out just when and how the billionaire liked to party. Choosing sides Trump has regularly said that he has a broad range of political positions. ""I identify with some things as a Democrat,"" he told MSNBC in July. He had told CNN the same thing back in 2004. He’s also expressed interest in running as a third-party candidate. According to the New York City Board of Elections, Trump has changed his party affiliation five times since registering as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987. A form that year notes he had previously been registered in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, where he grew up, but his prior affiliation was not identified. Trump’s affiliations have gone back and forth since then. Here’s a quick look: Month and year of registration Party affiliation July 1987 Republican October 1999 Independence Party August 2001 Democrat September 2009 Republican December 2011 No party affiliation (independent) April 2012 Republican We don’t need to go back as far as 1987 for this check, of course, but it shows Trump has switched quite a bit. After 12 years as a Republican, he registered with the Independence Party in 1999. That moved Trump to New York’s version of the Reform Party, which is neither Democratic nor Republican. He even won the Reform Party’s California primary for president in March 2000, despite withdrawing from that contest. Bush’s campaign told us that ""the last decade"" meant when Trump was registered from 2000 to 2010. Trump was registered as a Democrat for 8 years, 1 month in that time span. But we think a reasonable person could mistake ""the last decade"" to mean the last 10 years. When we added up the years since 2005, we found Trump has been registered as a Democrat for 3 years, 9 months, and registered as Republican for 5 years, 6 months (and counting). Media reports said Trump’s switch in December 2011, where he checked ""I do not wish to enroll in a party,""  made him an independent voter before the 2012 presidential election, in which he considered running himself. His attorney Michael Cohen told Politico that Trump made the change ""in order to preserve his right to run as an independent if he is (not pleased) with the GOP nominee."" Trump decided not to run that year. He switched back to Republican in April 2012. One last note: Party affiliation in New York matters for who a person can vote for in a primary contest, because New York has a closed primary, just like Florida. If someone wants to vote in a primary, they must be registered to that party. But according to a partial voting record from New York state, Trump hasn’t cast a ballot in at least the last two presidential primaries. Our ruling Bush said Trump ""was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican."" The Bush campaign said he meant 2000 to 2010, during which Trump was a Democrat for a bit over nine years. Trump had largely been a Republican in the years prior to that. If that’s what Bush meant, he phrased his statement poorly. When we reviewed Trump’s voter registration in the 10 years leading up to the present, from 2005 to 2015, we found that he has been a Republican for more than five years. He was a registered Democrat for not quite four years in that time frame. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Rachel Maddow says under Scott Walker middle class in Wisconsin is shrinking fastest among states
","Joining a chorus of criticism of Scott Walker's record on jobs, liberal talk show host Rachel Maddow made a striking claim about the middle class. ""Under his leadership as governor, Wisconsin has had a really bad time of it when it comes to jobs and the economy,"" Maddow said on her MSNBC program on July 13, 2015, the day Walker announced his run for the Republican presidential nomination. She added: ""The Wisconsin middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than any other state in the country."" Maddow cited a respected source to back her claim. But it made a comparison back to 2000 -- a decade before Walker was elected governor. So we generated data that measures the middle class -- in Wisconsin and nationally -- during Walker's time in office. Maddow’s evidence As Maddow made her claim, a graphic on the screen showed a Washington Post article referencing a March 2015 report by the Pew Charitable Trusts, a widely respected nonpartisan research organization. Maddow's staff told us the report was the source for her claim. Pew defined middle class as households earning between 67 percent and 200 percent of each state's median income. Its report found that in all 50 states, the percentage of middle-class households was lower in 2013 than it was in 2000. For Wisconsin, the middle class covered income ranging from $34,500 to $103,000 in 2013. Pew found that 48.9 percent of Wisconsin households were middle class in 2013, down from 54.6 percent in 2000 (the 2000 income was adjusted for inflation.) Wisconsin’s drop was the largest of any state. But as we noted, Pew's starting point was 2000. And Walker didn’t become governor until January 2011. That means we don’t know from the Pew report how much of the shrinking of Wisconsin’s middle class occurred under Walker, versus any of the three previous governors dating back to 2000. That would include two Republicans (Scott McCallum and Tommy Thompson), as well as Democrat Jim Doyle, who served for eight years before being succeeded by Walker. Indeed, there's an indication that Wisconsin's shrinking middle class has been in the making for more than a few years. Trend years in the making A blog post on the Pew findings by the Wisconsin Budget Project, a program of the left-leaning Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, and has studied income inequality in the state, said: ""There’s no single reason why the decline in economic security for Wisconsin middle-income households has been so much greater than in most other states. One contributing factor is that Wisconsin’s population is growing more slowly and is on average older than the populations of many other states. Also contributing is the decline of manufacturing in the U.S.; Wisconsin’s economy relies more heavily on manufacturing than nearly any other state."" The blog post also cited the declining share -- since 2000 -- of Wisconsin workers who belong to unions, saying the higher wages paid to unionized workers vs non-union workers ""help push additional households into the middle class."" Walker's tenure For Maddow's claim, the question is how the middle class has fared versus other states since Walker has been governor. The answer is: Not great, but quite a bit better than last place. Using the same University of Minnesota data that Pew used, we compared 2010, the year before Walker took office, to 2013, the latest year for which data is available. Nationally during that period, the percentage of middle-class households grew in 15 states, including neighboring Iowa. But it fell in the other 35 states, including Wisconsin. As we noted, 48.9 percent of households in Wisconsin were middle class in 2013. We found that was down from 49.4 percent in 2010. That drop of 0.5 percentage points meant Wisconsin ranked 24th among the 50 states. Montana’s drop of 2.65 percentage points was the largest for that period. Our rating Maddow said that under Walker, ""the Wisconsin middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than any other state in the country."" A study by a nationally respected research group found that -- comparing 2000 to 2013 -- the percentage of households in Wisconsin that were middle class dropped by a larger percentage than any other state. But 2000 was more than a decade before Walker took office. Using the same data, we compared 2010, the year before Walker took office, to 2013, the latest year for which data are available. In that comparison, Wisconsin ranked 24th in terms of shrinkage of its middle class.

Jim Webb says U.S. didn't have income taxes until 1913
","Correction (Dec. 20, 2016): This fact-check initially published on Aug. 24, 2015, and was rated Mostly True. Upon reconsideration, we are changing our ruling to Half True. The text of the fact-check is unchanged. Democratic presidential candidate Jim Webb says the U.S. needs a leaner, more efficient tax code. The former Virginia senator broadly calls for lowering tax rates in exchange for eliminating ""loopholes and exceptions"" that he says ""have made a mockery out of true economic fairness."" Webb says investment income should be taxed at the same rates as wages. And he would like to see the U.S. shift some of its burden away from income and toward consumption. Big changes? Sure. But Webb says the tax code is not sacrosanct. ""We did not even have a federal income tax in this country until 1913,"" he wrote on his campaign website. Our radar beeped. Somewhere in the course of our lives, we recalled reading or hearing that the income tax had deeper roots in U.S. history than Webb claimed. So we investigated. In 1913, the year Webb cites, the U.S. began a tax on individual incomes, and a levy on personal earnings has been exacted ever since. That was the birth year of the 1040 tax form that, with many modifications, remains in use today. It came with one page of instructions back then, compared with 104 pages this year. Although the form was new, oldtimers in 1913 might have remembered another era when they paid income tax to Washington. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed a measure enacting an income tax to help pay for the Civil War. It imposed a tax of 3 percent on incomes between $600 and $10,000 and a 5 percent tax on incomes above that level. The levy, which had sunset provisions, expired in 1872. It was not forgotten, however. In 1894, Congress passed a new income tax, but it never went into effect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional the next year because it was a direct tax that was not apportioned on the basis of each state’s population. At that time, for example, if 5 percent of the U.S. population lived in Virginia, then no more than 5 percent of the total revenue could come from Virginia. That constitutional hurdle was cleared by the 16th Amendment, proposed by President William Howard Taft in 1909 and ratified by the states in 1913. It allowed the tax to be levied without any apportionment among states. Congress adopted a 1 percent tax on net personal income of more than $3,000 with a surtax of 6 percent on incomes of more than $500,000. By 1918, with World War I raging, the top income bracket soared to a 77 percent tax rate. We ran Webb’s statement past Joseph Thorndike, the director of the online Tax History Museum -- a nonprofit organization based in Falls Church. Thorndike, also an adjunct professor of tax policy at Northwestern University, said Webb’s historical oversight merits a minor penalty. ""I think it’s fair to treat the Civil War tax as an anomaly,"" he said. Wonder where the U.S. got its revenues prior to the income tax? Before the Civil War, government funds primarily came from custom duties, selling public land and temporary excise taxes, according to the Congressional Research Service report. During the decades after the Civil War, when the income tax lapsed, the IRS says about 90 percent of the country’s revenues came from taxes on liquor, beer, wine and tobacco. Our ruling Webb said ""we did not even have a federal income tax in this country until 1913."" The modern income tax structure, complete with Form 1040, was born in 1913. But his claim disregards two pre-1913 efforts to impose an income tax — one of which was in place for a decade.

Donald Trump's campaign manager: 400,000 'anchor babies' born in U.S. every year
","Donald Trump’s proposal to end automatic citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants spurred a week of talk about ""anchor babies,"" a term that some say is derogatory. Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski tried to clarify his boss' views on CNN’s State of the Union on Aug. 23, 2015. ""If you think of the term ‘anchor baby,’ which is those individuals coming to our country and having their children so their children can be U.S. citizens,"" Lewandowski said on Aug. 23. ""There’s 400,000 of those taking place on a yearly basis. To put this in perspective, that’s equivalent of the population of Tulsa, Okla."" We wondered whether there really were 400,000 ""anchor babies"" born in the United States every year (and yes, that is the population size of Tulsa). Are the undocumented mothers specifically coming here to give birth in hopes of some kind of legal status? We didn’t hear back from Lewandowski or the Trump campaign. We did, however, find the number in congressional testimony from the Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization that supports lower immigration levels. ""Every year, 350,000 to 400,000 children are born to illegal immigrants in the United States,"" the center’s Jon Feere said on April 29, 2015. ""To put it another way, as many as one out of 10 births in the United States is now to an illegal immigrant mother."" Those figures may have been accurate several years ago, but they are outdated when compared to current estimates, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center. Passel is the author of a widely cited 2010 Pew Hispanic Center report that pins the number of children born to undocumented immigrants at 340,000 in 2008 (about 8 percent of all births that year). ""Figures as high as 400,000 per year are plausible for the mid 2000s, but our current estimates are around 300,000 per year,"" he told us. ""The numbers were higher in the mid 2000s than now — in part because there were more unauthorized immigrants then and overall birth rates, for natives and immigrants alike, were higher before the recession."" So Lewandowski’s number is slightly exaggerated. His characterization of these births as ""anchor babies"" is also problematic, however, as the metaphor implies intent that the numbers don’t back up. Based on past reporting, it’s not clear whether every birth to an undocumented mother was for the purpose of tethering the family to American soil. ""There are a million hardworking Hispanic people in San Diego who came here to work and then happened to have a baby,"" midwife Lauren Weber said in the 2010 fact-check. ""Then, there are people who come over in order to have a baby."" Weber also described a practice known as ""birth tourism,"" in which middle- and upper-class visitors on tourist visas travel to the United States specifically to have a baby. The numbers for these types of births are much lower, at around 8,600, or 0.2 percent of all births, in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As for undocummented immigrants, experts don't think they have the same motivations.  ""I believe that most migrants come for economic reasons and opportunity,"" said Theresa Brown, the director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Institute. ""The idea that their child may be able to sponsor them for a green card in 21 years is probably too long term to be a primary driver of immigration."" Roberto Suro, a communications and journalism professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in Hispanic issues, had also pointed that if undocumented immigration was spurred by ""anchor babies,"" more undocumented immigrants would be women of childbearing age. The data shows the exact opposite: Adult immigrant men vastly outnumber women. Our ruling Lewandowski said that 400,000 ""anchor babies"" are born in the U.S. every year. The claim is not as straight-forward as it seems. First, the figure is outdated — a more accurate number for the amount of births to undocumented immigrants is 300,000. Lewandowski also makes a blanket statement when he says all of these births occurred specifically to anchor the undocumented families to the United States. While the practice occurs, it’s not safe to draw a single broad conclusion from the data and apply it to the intentions of every pregnant undocumented woman. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/aug/23/corey-lewandowski/donald-trumps-campaign-manager-says-there-are-4000/

S.E. Cupp: Only about 30 other countries offer birthright citizenship, making U.S. 'anomaly'
","The country’s 150-year-old right of citizenship to every person upon birth on U.S. soil has become the latest test question for GOP presidential candidates, with Donald Trump and Ben Carson coming out strongly in favor of ending the practice. In an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union, conservative pundit S.E. Cupp suggested the United States’ law makes it an outlier on the issue compared to the rest of the world. ""There are actually only 30 countries that practice birthright citizenship,"" she said on the Aug. 23, 2015, show, ""making the U.S. kind of an anomaly."" We wanted to see if the United States is one of 30 countries in the world to offer automatic citizenship to anyone born on its soil. We reached out to Cupp through her publicist but did not hear back. Around the world The legal term for birthright citizenship is jus soli, or ""right of the soil."" It’s different from the term jus sanguinis, or ""right of blood,"" referring to laws which rely on a person’s heritage to determine his or her citizenship status. Birthright citizenship in the United States was first made law by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, primarily to grant legal status to emancipated slaves. The amendment stipulates that ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" The Supreme Court solidified the Constitution’s authority on this issue in 1898 by ruling that citizenship is a right offered unconditionally to all born on U.S. soil. How many other countries share this guarantee? NumbersUSA, a group that favors reduced immigration, compiled a list that shows 33 nations grant citizenship to anyone born within their borders. The United States is joined by Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, along with nearly every country in Central and South America. The United States and Canada are the only two ""developed"" countries, as defined by the International Monetary Fund, that still have unrestricted birthright citizenship laws. A closer look at the list shows an interesting trend: Countries that offer birthright citizenship are located almost exclusively in the Western Hemisphere. No country in Europe or East Asia, for example, has a similar citizenship policy. So why does birthright citizenship literally divide the world? One explanation may be colonialism, said John Skrentny, a sociologist at the University of California, San Diego. As European countries colonized the Americas, Skrentny said, many created lenient naturalization laws in order to grow and overpower native populations. ""Getting people to move in was a good way to establish authority,"" he said. This method of citizenship hasn’t changed that much in the centuries since. Many of the birthright laws in South America have remained due to low immigration numbers, he said. The United States, however, has retained its birthright citizenship laws, even as it admits around 1 million people every year through its legal immigration system. Canada, which also has a birthright citizenship law, still takes in around 250,000 legal immigrants a year. Conversely, in Europe, many countries have modified their requirements for citizenship in recent years. Ireland got rid of its birthright citizenship law in 2005, and France did away with its own in 1993. Many European countries still maintain a version of birthright citizenship, however. In Germany and the United Kingdom, citizenship is now automatically granted to a person if at least one of his or her parents is a citizen or permanent resident. Our ruling Cupp said, ""There are actually only 30 countries that practice birthright citizenship, making the U.S. kind of an anomaly."" The United States is one of 33 countries around the world that offer citizenship to every person born on their soil. Among those 33, the United States admits the highest number of immigrants per year. In contrast, most other developed countries have added more requirements for citizenship. This makes the United States somewhat of an outlier on the issue. We rate Cupp’s statement True. Clarification: Among the 33 countries with birthright citizenship, the United States admits the highest number of immigrants per year. An earlier version of this story was unclear.",/factchecks/2015/aug/23/se-cupp/se-cupp-only-about-30-other-countries-offer-birthr/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Ben Carson']","
Ben Carson: Most of the border is 'not under our control'
","Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson suggested drones could really help the country’s overstressed border patrol. Carson told CNN’s Jim Acosta on State of the Union on Aug. 23, 2015, that the drones could be used for more than just surveillance along the Mexican border, potentially taking out caves that smugglers and cartels use to cross into the United States. ""We're not getting support from the federal government to deal with these people,"" he said. ""They're being outgunned. Fifty-six percent of that border is not under our control."" There was a bit of overlap between Acosta and Carson (this transcript quotes Carson saying 66 percent), but we heard 56 percent. We wondered if Carson was correct that more than half of our southern border was ""not under our control."" We didn’t hear back from Carson’s campaign when we tried to contact them for the source of the retired neurosurgeon’s figure. But we have an idea where he may have gotten it. A 2011 Government Accountability Office report said U.S. Customs and Border Protection considered 873 miles of the almost 2,000-mile U.S. border with Mexico under ""operational control"" in fiscal year 2010. Those are areas they classified ""as those in which it has the ability to detect, respond, and interdict illegal activity at the border or after entry into the United States."" Operational control was broken down into two definitions: ""Controlled"" areas had enough agents to either deter or detect and apprehend illegal entries immediately at the border. We must note this still doesn’t mean a 100 percent apprehension rate, but controlled status accounted for 129 miles, or about 15 percent of those 873 miles under operational control. The other 85 percent were considered ""managed"" areas, where agents could still identify and apprehend most entries from as far as 100 miles away. The other 1,120 miles of border — the 56 percent of the total border to which Carson is likely referring  — fell under two other definitions. The report said nearly two-thirds was considered ""monitored,"" meaning illegal entries were likely to be detected, but resources or accessibility could make responses difficult. The other third was labeled ""low-level monitored,"" defined as regions where detection and interdiction were constrained by few resources or poor infrastructure. ""Border Patrol reported that these two levels of control were not acceptable for border security,"" the GAO report said. So does that mean they aren’t under control, as Carson said? Experts have told us before that there’s no set definition for a secure border, and it’s not fair to set the standard as a 100 percent border-crosser apprehension rate because then no part of the border would qualify. Border Patrol agents are charged with many duties beyond stopping illegal immigration. They are supposed to catch drug smugglers, weapons traffickers, potential terrorists, money launderers and more. Apprehensions only tell part of the story. Because no one knows how many crossing attempts there truly are each year, by any group targeted by the border patrol, there’s no way to really set a universal metric for security. The 2011 GAO report said the Department of Homeland Security was replacing its border security measures, and it expected data reported to Congress to wane as programs were updated through 2012. A January 2015 report by now retired Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said that as of 2014, more than 700 miles of the southern border ""were not secure."" The report blamed ""little to no deployment density or aviation surveillance coverage."" The oversight report blamed the problems in part to a lack of overall border security plan by the Department of Homeland Security. But Coburn’s report also said that ""it is impossible to judge whether the border is secure"" based on available data. There’s no way to tell just how many crossings went undetected, the report said, and changes in apprehensions and economic and social factors in immigration made extrapolating overall security very difficult. As far as reported statistics, we know that illegal migration through the border has decreased in recent years. The Bipartisan Policy Center said that in 2007, there were 1.6 million instances of people apprehended, turned back at the border or evidence of people making it across, known as ""gotaways."" The center said that number had dropped to 741,881 in 2013. There also is evidence the number of native Mexicans living in the U.S. is leveling, experts have said, and eight of the nine sectors the border is broken into by the Border Patrol had higher effectiveness ratings in 2013 than they did in 2006. Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, gives Carson credit for using the term ""control,"" since that’s the word the border patrol used in part to measure its own effectiveness. But as a practical matter, it’s impossible to stop everyone from crossing the border, he said. That makes it difficult to settle on how much enforcement would be required for everyone to consider it ""enough."" Wilson added things have indeed improved, no matter which source you cite. ""All the different measures point to an overall improvement in border security over at least the last 10 years,"" Wilson said. ""We don’t know what a secure border is, because we’ve never defined it as a society."" Our ruling Carson said that ""56 percent of that (U.S.-Mexico) border is not under our control."" U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a 2011 report that 873 miles of the U.S. Mexico border was under ""operational control."" The other 1,120 miles, or about 56 percent, fell under two classifications ""not acceptable for border security."" That doesn’t mean there is an utter lack of control, but that the agency’s ability to detect or respond (or both) to crossings was hampered by a lack of resources or infrastructure. Carson did not specify what he meant by control, and experts have told us security is a subjective metric. It doesn’t appear he pulled the number out of thin air, but available data does show that illegal crossings along the border have overall been on the decline.

R.I. Center for Prosperity & Freedom rails against 'regulatory fiat'
","Rhode Island has issued a controversial vaccination requirement designed to fight HPV, or human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted virus that can cause cancer. The requirement, ordered by the Rhode Island Department of Health, took effect Aug. 1. It has drawn fire from a group of critics that included the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, which calls itself a ""free enterprise think tank."" The new policy calls for the vaccination of  all  seventh grade boys and girls before the start of school. The requirement does not apply to students whose doctors cite a medical problem; or to students whose parents object for religious reasons. And the health department defines religious reasons very liberally. Before a series of public information meetings on the vaccination requirement, the Center for Freedom and Prosperity posted this statement on its website: ""Rhode Island will become just the second state to mandate the vaccine … and the only state to do so by regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people."" We telephoned Mike Stenhouse, the center’s founder and chief executive officer, and asked him for his sources. We didn’t get anything from him right away.   So we did our own research and found that Virginia is the only other state to require students to receive immunization for HPV. Virginia’s vaccination requirement, which is only for sixth-grade girls, took effect in 2008 following an act of the legislature. Rhode Island’s policy is the product of a regulatory process that began in 2013 under the leadership of Michael Fine, then the state’s director of the Department of Health. In both states, HPV vaccination policies use the word ""required"" and both have opt-out provisions. In Virginia,  parents have ""sole discretion"" on whether their children receive the vaccination. Stenhouse labels the policies in Virginia and Rhode Island as mandates. But Jason L. Schwartz, an assistant professor at the Yale University School of Public Health, says you can’t call policies with such liberal exemptions mandates. The breadth of Rhode Island’s opt-out provisions may not have been clear to the  public — or to Stenhouse — before a public meeting Aug. 5. That’s when Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, the new director of the Department of Health, told parents that their philosophical objections would qualify for the religious exemption spelled out in the regulations. But what about the center’s claim that Rhode Island imposed the requirement by ""regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people""? And, as the center says later in its policy statement, was the health department’s decision an example of ""regulatory despotism"" that ""bypasses the traditional democratic process""? While it’s true that the General Assembly did not pass a law for the HPV vaccination, existing Rhode Island law gives the health director the power to adopt regulations to protect public health. And, of course, the health director is appointed by, and serves at the pleasure of, the governor. Further, control of health-care policy by the executive branch is common in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, makes decisions affecting the health welfare of the country without first getting an act of Congress. ""To say it’s anti-democratic would be a misunderstanding of how we structure our government in the United States,"" says Schwartz, the Yale professor, who co-authored a recent article about state vaccination requirements for the Journal of the American Medical Association. Also it’s not as if the state adopted the regulation in a back room somewhere — even though Stenhouse’s organization on July 30 described the news of the requirement as a ""stunning revelation."" On Dec. 2, 2013, Fine, the former health director, filed a notice of public hearing for Jan. 16, 2014, and also solicited written statements on the issue. In response to criticism, the department delayed the beginning of the program from Aug. 1, 2014, to Aug. 1, 2015, according to a form for the regulation that was filed with the Office of Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea. The Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union registered its ardent opposition to the proposed regulation at the hearing and in written comments. On Jan. 27, 2014, the ACLU called on the health department to reconsider the proposal. The ACLU also criticized the requirement on Facebook. That’s seems like debate to us. We tried to get Stenhouse to explain what the center meant by the phrase ""regulatory fiat."" He declined. Instead, he sent us a written statement in which he said the center ""stands by its statement"" and he challenged PolitiFact’s fairness and objectivity. Our ruling The center says ""Rhode Island will become just the second state to mandate the vaccine … and the only state to do so by regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people."" The center, in its statement, got two things right and two things wrong. It was right about Rhode Island being the second state and it was right that the requirement was not adopted by ""the elected representatives of the people."" It was wrong when it said the vaccination requirement was imposed ""by fiat"" and ""without public debate.""   In 2014, the ACLU sharply criticized the vaccine requirement at the public hearing and debated the proposal in social media and on its website.   As for acting by fiat, the regulation was put in place through a process established by law. And comments at a public hearing influenced that process, leading to a decision by the director of health to delay execution of the policy for one year.    More recently, the new health director told the public that philosophical objections were enough to qualify for the religious exemption. In other words, parents can pretty much say whatever they want to get exemptions for their children.   For those reasons, we rate the statement Half True.

"['Elections', 'Texas', 'Bruce Elfant']","

Bruce Elfant says U.S. about 100th in voter turnout, Texas near bottom too
","A Travis County official declared the United States and Texas lag far behind other countries and states in voting. On Aug. 5, 2015, Democrat Bruce Elfant, the Travis County tax assessor-collector, was interviewed by Dick Ellis of the KOKE-FM Austin Radio Network about the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act. Johnson, Elfant said, ""would be very disappointed by the number of Americans who choose to use that right. The United States is about 100th in voter turnout among the industrialized nations and Texas is near the bottom in terms of voter registration and voter turnout,"" he said. We previously found merit to a claim that Texas had the nation’s worst voter turnout in 2014, though we noted voter statistics weren’t yet final. So, does Texas rank near the bottom nationally in voter registration and turnout? And is U.S. turnout about 100th among industrialized nations? Elfant’s backup To our inquiry, a county official, Tiffany Seward, said by email that Elfant drew the international comparison from one source and reached his conclusion about Texas from a U.S. Census Bureau survey. Seward sent along a chart, attributed to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, showing the U.S. had turnout of nearly 67 percent of registered voters in the 2012 presidential elections, placing it 97th in the world among more than 175 countries with national elections—basically tied with Montserrat, Mongolia and Bahrain. Also based on the 2012 turnout, according to the chart, the United States ranked 139th with 54 percent of its voting-age population turning out, tied with Canada and several smaller countries. The presented turnout percentages for other countries were based on elections from 2007 through 2014, according to the chart. Seward also provided a chart, drawing on bureau survey results released in July 2015, showing 59 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens were registered to vote in November 2014, placing Texas 45th among the states by that metric in a virtual tie with New York and Nevada. Nearly 35 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens turned out that November, according to the chart — about the same share turning out as in Indiana and narrowly better than turnouts in New York, Oklahoma and West Virginia, which each had 34 percent turnout. We confirmed the state-by-state figures by downloading the relevant chart from the bureau’s website which also had a report stating that nationally in 2014, about 42 percent of voting-eligible citizens turned out—the lowest rate since the bureau started asking about both voting and citizenship status in 1978. The report said the figures reflected answers to supplemental questions posed after the November 2014 elections as part of its annual Current Population Survey. According to the report, the bureau has posed supplemental post-election questions every two years since 1964. Turnout in U.S., industrialized nations Next, we turned to Elfant’s moan about U.S. voter turnout ranking about 100th among ""industrialized nations."" Our whoa: We’re doubtful there are 100 industrialized nations on the planet. The State Department lists 195 independent states in the world and the CIA’s World Factbook breaks out only 34 ""developed countries"": Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holy See, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Among the developed countries identified by the CIA, U.S. turnouts have been among the lowest by two measures tracked by the International IDEA--the share of voting-age residents casting ballots by country and the share of registered voters turning out. Still, the U.S. turnout of 67 percent of registered voters in 2012 was better than such turnouts in Greece, Canada, Japan, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, San Marino and Switzerland. Also, the U.S. turnout of 54 percent of its voting-age population that year was better than such turnouts in Liechtenstein, Ireland, Austria, Switzerland, Andorra and Monaco, according to the international group, which describes itself as an intergovernmental organization, founded in Stockholm in 1995, whose mission is to ""support sustainable democratic change."" Asked to assess Elfant's claim, an institute spokeswoman, Lynn Simmonds, told us by email that Elfant got it right, though she added: ""Please note that the label ‘industrial nations’ may cause confusion and therefore, we would say among all countries."" We asked Elfant about his focus on ""industrialized nations."" By phone, he said he’d made a misstatement to Ellis in that he meant to roll in more countries. But ""any way you slice it, we’re way towards the bottom"" in voter participation, he said. Other analyses There are other ways to sort this out. Seema Shah, an institute official, advised by email that if you define voter turnout as the ratio of voters compared to the entire population of citizens eligible to vote, then for presidential elections, the U.S. lately ranks 75th (with 53.58 percent of eligible voters turning out) if you focus only on the 113 countries with presidential elections. And the institute's Peter Wolf said that if the focus is limited to the 34 countries (including the U.S.) that comprise the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, which promotes economic development, the U.S. turnout of nearly 67 percent of registered voters in the 2012 presidential elections landed in a ""mid-field position""--lower than turnout, say, in New Zealand (77 percent), comparable to turnout for parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom and yet higher than than turnout in Canada (61 percent). Wolf said the nearly 43 percent U.S. turnout rate in the 2014 congressional elections was among the lowest rates for the countries. In May 2015, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center said U.S. voter turnout typically trails turnout among the other OECD member-nations. An accompanying chart showed the U.S. ranked 31st among the selected nations, based on its 2012 turnout, besting Japan, Chile and Switzerland. Among the member-countries, the highest turnouts were in Belgium (87.2 percent), Turkey (86.4 percent) and Sweden (82.6 percent). Then again, Pew noted, Belgium and Turkey are among 28 nations where voting is compulsory, according to the International IDEA; countries that require voting include Australia, Peru, Singapore and Uruguay. Drew DeSilver, who wrote the Pew analysis, told us by phone he compared turnouts in the OECD nations because they represent the world’s advanced industrialized democracies, hence amounting to reasonable peers. DeSilva added by email: ""That is to say, it wouldn't make much sense to compare the U.S. to either developing-world democracies or to developed but not-so-democratic countries."" Our ruling Elfant said the U.S. is ""about 100th in voter turnout among the industrialized nations and Texas is near the bottom in terms of voter registration and voter turnout."" Texas is nearly last among the states in voter registration and turnout and U.S. voter turnout ranks low internationally, though that's among all nations, not the limited number of countries considered industrially developed.

Scott Walker says Wisconsin percentage of people working is 5 points higher than nation
","Gov. Scott Walker took a new approach when asked about his jobs record during the first GOP presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace reminded viewers that Walker promised in 2010 that state employers would create 250,000 jobs in his first four-year term. ""In fact, Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth,"" Wallace said, addressing Walker. ""Now you're running for president, and you're promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream,"" he said. ""Given your record in Wisconsin, why should voters believe you?"" Walker responded that the state’s unemployment rate has declined from more than 8 percent in the depths of the Great Recession to 4.6 percent, and that the state had ""more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession."" Then he turned to the claim we want to check:  ""And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally."" Is he right? And is that something new under Walker? About the statistic Walker’s campaign said he was referring to the Labor Force Participation Rate, a measuring stick created by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The participation rate includes ""the number of people who are either employed or are actively looking for work,"" according to Investopedia.com. It does not include those who are no longer actively searching for work. It’s a different vantage point than the more typically used unemployment rate. As of June 2015, the state’s rate was 67.9 percent. That compares with the national rate of 62.6 percent. Thus, Wisconsin’s rate is about 5.3 percentage points higher than the national one. So, Walker is correct on the number. (A note: the national figures come from a different set of data, the Current Population Survey, while the state figures are from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics.) The history behind the numbers But, a deeper look shows that the state’s performance predates his time in office. That is, Wisconsin’s labor force participation has exceeded the nation’s for years. For instance, in 2010 -- the year before Walker took office -- the state’s participation rate was 63.4 percent, compared with 58.5 percent nationally. That was a difference of 4.9 points, at a time when the economy was just beginning to emerge from the recession. Wisconsin’s high water mark was 71.8 percent in 1997, compared with 63.8 percent nationally, a difference of 8 points. Nationally, the number reached a high in 2000, at 64.4 percent. Wisconsin has topped that figure in 24 of the past 38 years. Our rating In the debate, Walker said ""the rate in which people are working (in Wisconsin) is almost five points higher than it is nationally."" He’s right on the numbers, but the same statement could have been true had it been made by any of his seven immediate predecessors, Republican and Democrat. That important bit of context was missing from his claim. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/21/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-percentage-people-work/
"['Abortion', 'Georgia', 'Alliance Defending Freedom']","
Numbers don't tell whole story on mammogram claim
","Covertly filmed videos showing fake brokers discussing terms for procuring fetal tissue have prompted federal efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, led to a statewide inquiry into how the group disposes of such tissue in Georgia and apparently created some confusion among voters. One reader forwarded us a Tweet from the Alliance Defending Freedom that shows two national maps side by side, wondering how mammograms play into the abortion debate. The first map purports to pinpoint the 8,000-plus mammography facilities licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The second map lacks a single dot, to show the number of licensed facilities run by Planned Parenthood. ""Zero Planned Parenthood facilities are licensed to do mammograms,"" the Tweet read. ""Planned Parenthood, women don’t need you!"" Our reader wanted to know, is it a false flag to talk about essential women’s health care such as mammograms in the debate over Planned Parenthood? PolitiFact has been down this road before, but it’s worth a repeat trip given the defunding debate stirred by those stealth videos. The anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress says its videos show Planned Parenthood proposes to illegally sell fetal tissue, something that Planned Parenthood adamantly denies. PolitiFact recapped the facts in that controversy here. Two state agencies have since reported that abortion clinics in Georgia are properly disposing of aborted fetuses and fetal tissue. Among the 12 clinics found to be following state law was the sole facility run by Planned Parenthood Southeast in the state, in Augusta. But on the federal level, the effort by congressional Republicans to strip $500 million in annual funding to Planned Parenthood has drawn more ire on both sides of the issue. Critics of Planned Parenthood say the videos show the organization has questionable practices. Supporters denounce the effort as an effective cut to women’s health care, citing the gynecological, referral and medical services the agency also provides. Casey Mattox, the senior counsel at the anti-abortion Alliance Defending Freedom, said he was attempting to cut off that debate by using the maps to point out that Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms. ""You can’t go there and actually get a mammogram, which is what most people assume when they hear you can go there and get cancer screenings for breast health,"" Mattox said. ""That is, at best, misleading, if not directly false."" Mattox pointed us to the Food and Drug Administration’s list of facilities licensed to perform mammograms under the Mammography Quality Standards Act. The agency certifies the facilities across the nation and in military bases worldwide. The list, updated weekly, includes more than 8,700 facilities. A representative from the FDA did not get back to us by deadline, but a search of the list does not yield any facilities with the official ""Planned Parenthood"" name in its title. Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Liz Clark confirmed why: The organization does not provide mammograms at any of its health centers. (One caveat: some clinics have brought in mobile mammography vans to clinic sites for special events. But none of the machines were a permanent part of a Planned Parenthood center). So Mattox is correct, by Planned Parenthood’s own acknowledgement, that the organization does not provide mammograms. But does that mean there is no need for Planned Parenthood when it comes to accessing the tests? The answer to that is far less clear but provides the context that shows why the overall argument is muddled. Planned Parenthood provided 487,029 breast exams or breast care services in 2013, the most recent year available. Based on those clinical exams and a doctor assessing risk factors, the group refers patients for mammograms and/or specialist follow-ups for procedures such as biopsies and, in some cases, financial assistance, Clark said. In that regard, Planned Parenthood functions mostly as a privately paid OB-GYN would in referring a patient for a service the doctor’s office didn’t provide. ""Focusing on one narrow data point to create a false ‘gotcha’ moment ignores the larger picture of how Planned Parenthood both provides and connects millions of people to health care in communities across the country,"" Clark said. ""The graphic is misleading because I wouldn’t walk into a mammogram facility to get a mammogram without first visiting my OB-GYN for an exam and a referral -- which is what Planned Parenthood provides,"" she added. Mattox said there is no reason, though, that Planned Parenthood must serve as the referring agency. According to the Charlotte Lozier Institute, there are more than 13,000 clinics nationwide that provide comprehensive health care for women and could at least provide referrals and, in some cases, the mammograms themselves. The pressure to ""defund"" Planned Parenthood is actually to redirect the federal money to those other facilities, Mattox said. ""It’s nothing unique to Planned Parenthood if all they are doing is a referral,"" he said. ""There are other health center options, with licenses that can do this directly on site. If you go to Planned Parenthood, you need to know you are not going to get that."" Dr. Otis Brawley, the chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society, agrees that Planned Parenthood does not need to be the referring physician for a mammogram. But the standard is for a doctor to provide the clinical, physical exam and then refer the patient for the screening at a mammography center – and it has been since 1970, Brawley said. Various risk factors determine referrals, as does the patient’s age. For women between 20 and 40, a doctor will order a mammogram if an abnormality is detected or suspected during the physical exam. For women older than 40, even a normal exam generally triggers a screening mammogram, Brawley said. ""I’ve personally had patients who went to Planned Parenthood and got a referral that was also a voucher, so that the mammogram was paid for as well,"" Brawley said. ""The first step is always to see a doctor, but there are cases where the referral was also a way for Planned Parenthood to reimburse the outside facility for the mammogram screening."" Our ruling Covert videos showing discussions of fetal tissue sales have reignited the abortion debate nationally and in Georgia. In an effort to debunk defenders that Planned Parenthood provides essential women’s health services in addition to abortions, an anti-abortion group claimed that none of the organization’s clinics is licensed to provide mammograms. Federal data and Planned Parenthood’s own documents back up the claim from the Alliance Defending Freedom. However, that narrow bit of information ignores that Planned Parenthood physicians perform the clinical exams that lead to referrals for a mammogram or other specialized breast care. The physical exam is a necessary step in the process of getting the screening, although ADF has a valid point that other physicians could provide that piece of the process. That puts the claim in the realm that won’t make either side happy: partially accurate but misleading without additional details. We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/21/alliance-defending-freedom/numbers-right-mammogram-claim-missing-context/

Julián Castro says less than half of lowest-income American households have home Internet access
","This summer, Julián Castro touted actions on his watch in his first year as U.S. secretary of housing and urban development. But the former San Antonio mayor and Democratic vice presidential prospect also let it be known that work remains to be done, especially in closing the digital socio-economic divide. In an anniversary speech otherwise trumpeting anti-homelessness programs and public housing developments, Castro said: ""Technology has transformed how we live, learn and work, but not everyone has been able to participate in these developments. ""Less than half of the poorest American households have a home internet subscription,"" Castro said, which poses barriers when most college applications and job openings are handled over the web. Castro went on to describe the agency’s new ConnectHome project, which he said would accelerate broadband adoption, helping up to 200,000 children gain high-speed online access. We were curious about his ""less than half"" claim relating poverty and home Internet connections. Castro cites White House report Responding to our request for elaboration, Castro’s press secretary, Cameron French, emailed us a web link to a July 15, 2015, White House ""fact sheet"" stating that an analysis that day by the Council of Economic Advisers, which advises the president on economic policy, ""illustrates that some Americans are still unable to benefit from high-speed broadband, especially America’s lower-income children."" ""In fact, while nearly two-thirds of households in the lowest-income quintile own a computer,"" the White House document said, ""less than half have a home Internet subscription. While many middle-class U.S. students go home to Internet access, allowing them to do research, write papers, and communicate digitally with their teachers and other students, too many lower-income children go unplugged every afternoon when school ends. This ‘homework gap’ runs the risk of widening the achievement gap, denying hard-working students the benefit of a technology-enriched education."" The council’s analysis, a 10-page report titled ""Mapping the Digital Divide,"" said that according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey, ""less than half of households headed by someone who did not graduate high school had a home Internet connection, compared to over 90 percent of households headed by a college graduate."" The bureau says it annually conducts the survey to help Americans understand changes ""taking place in their communities."" The report also presented a chart suggesting high-income Americans widely have home Internet access:  U.S. Census Bureau research Of course, Castro didn’t say he was limiting his ""less than half"" statement to households headed by non-high school graduates. To our follow-up email, French said the council drew on a census bureau report based on the 2013 ACS, titled ""Computer and Internet Use in the United States: 2013."" The bureau report cited specific questions in the survey asking if, in the household, there is access to computers, access to smartphones and a working Internet subscription.  The authors then broke out the results by race, education and household income. Upshot: Slightly less than half of the lowest of five income groups — 48.4 percent of households bringing in less than $25,000 a year — reported having Internet access. Households with greater incomes reported home Internet subscription rates of 69 percent to 95 percent, the report said. Some 47.2 percent of the lowest-income households had high-speed web connections, according to the report, with higher-income households reporting high-speech connection rates of 68 percent to 95 percent.  Another analysis Next, we sought other relevant research, landing a September 2013 poll of U.S. residents by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center asking adults if they used broadband Internet. Generally, Pew said, 70 percent of the surveyed residents reported broadband connections at home. But that didn’t hold across income categories. In contrast to the bureau, Pew separated annual income levels into four categories: less than $30,000, between $30,000 and $49,999, $50,000 to $74,999, and $75,000 or more. Pew said 52 percent of adults in the lowest-income group said they had broadband access at home — compared with 71 percent to 91 percent of higher-income adults.  Separately, Pew said in a September 2013 web post that as of that May, 15 percent of American adults did not use the Internet or email. ""Groups that are significantly more likely to rely on internet access outside the home include blacks and Hispanics, as well as adults at lower levels of income and education,"" Pew said. Our ruling Castro said that ""less than half of the poorest American households have a home Internet subscription."" About 48 percent of the nation’s poorest quintile of households--the bottom 20 percent--reported a home Internet connection in 2013. Home web access correlates with income, it appears.

Hillary Clinton: Emails wouldn't be public if I hadn't asked for it
","Hillary Clinton says her emails are now out in the open solely because she wanted them to be made public. In an Aug. 17 interview with Iowa Public Radio, Clinton told reporter Clay Masters what she thinks will come of her controversial decision to exclusively use private email while secretary of state. ""I think this will all sort itself out,"" Clinton said. ""And in a way, it’s kind of an interesting insight into how the government operates. Because if I had not asked for my emails all to be made public, none of this would have been in the public arena. But I want people to know what we did, I’m proud of the four years I was secretary of state."" We know that Clinton did ask the State Department to release her emails, and they are now being released on a rolling basis. But it isn’t quite right to say that if she hadn’t made that request, her emails would not now be ""in the public arena."" A quick refresher on how and when this aspect of the email story unfolded: The State Department’s decision to release the emails as soon as possible was a response to Clinton’s specific request. But even if she had not made that request, there were other people pushing to make the emails public. When the story broke, numerous media outlets and conservative organizations had already submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the State Department, looking for various records (including emails) connected to Clinton. Up until that point, the State Department had yet to produce the vast majority of those records. Notably, Jason Leopold of Vice filed a FOIA request in November 2014 asking for all of Clinton’s emails, among other records, and he filed a lawsuit in January 2015 because of the State Department’s slow response. The State Department’s May 2015 response to Leopold’s lawsuit said the release of Clinton’s emails would satisfy a large portion of his FOIA request. It’s reasonable to assume that these FOIA requests would have eventually made the emails public, whether or not Clinton made her own request. Her emails, at least in part, might have been made public sooner, had she not exclusively used the private email address. Until Clinton turned over her emails to the State Department in December 2014 -- at the department’s behest -- the department did not have the full set of emails in its possession. This made Clinton’s emails basically inaccessible to FOIA requests until then. This wouldn’t have been the case if she used a government email address. Take the case of Gawker: In 2013, Gawker filed a FOIA request for emails between Clinton and long-time adviser Sid Blumenthal after a hacker revealed emails that Blumenthal sent Clinton. Although the emails were already known to the public, the State Department told Gawker that no such correspondence existed. In a previous article, we spoke with several experts who said Clinton’s email setup was tailor-made to circumvent FOIA requests. Additionally, Clinton’s phrasing is disingenuous. It implies that requesting her emails to be made public was a proactive measure, in the interest of transparency and highlighting her record as secretary of state. Rather, it was reactive -- a response to the New York Times article that broke the story and its aftermath. If Clinton’s email practices hadn’t come to light, it’s possible she would never have made such a request. Our ruling Clinton said, ""If I had not asked for my emails all to be made public, none of this would have been in the public arena."" The shred of truth here is that Clinton’s request was the driving force behind the State Department’s decision to release the emails as soon as possible. However, multiple pending FOIA requests for her emails likely would have made some of these emails public regardless. It’s disingenuous for Clinton to treat her request as proactive transparency, when her practices protected her email from public scrutiny until she was out of office.

Marco Rubio says the Army just cut 40,000 spots
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said at the Iowa State Fair that to face threats from across the globe, ranging from the Middle East to Asia to Russia, the United States needs to keep its military strong. ""The most important obligation of the federal government is to keep you safe and me safe and our family safe,"" Rubio said on Aug. 18, 2015. ""And it’s not doing that now, because we are eviscerating our defense spending."" One example he cited: ""We have an Army that just cut 40,000 spots."" We were curious if that number was correct, so we decided to check it out. Army announcement Army officials had been talking about reducing the size of their force for several months when they announced specific plans in July 2015. The Army said it will cut the size of the regular Army from 490,000 to 450,000 by fiscal year 2018 -- that’s 40,000 -- with some of the largest cuts at sites in Georgia and Texas. Those cuts will start in October 2015 and end by October 2018. That means the cuts to the Army haven’t happened yet and will be finished under the next president. The cuts are expected to come through attrition, early retirements and layoffs. That’s in addition to plans to cut 17,000 civilians. The Army has been substantially scaling back its force the past few years. In 2012, the Army had about 570,000 soldiers. In 2013, the Army announced a drawdown of 80,000 to bring the size to the current 490,000. The new cuts will save about $7 billion. Army officials said the cuts are a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the budget sequestration that followed. If sequestration continues, the Army expects to shrink to about 420,000 soldiers sometime in 2019. ""We think 450,000 is the minimum force to meet our obligations across the globe,"" Army spokesman Lt. Cmd. Joe Buccino told PolitiFact. Some lawmakers have questioned the cuts in light of the current situation with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, among other crises. In an op-ed in the Washington Post in May, Rubio was critical of Obama’s actions in Iraq and Syria. He called for the president to ""increase the number of U.S. forces in Iraq."" Rubio correctly cited the number that the Army plans to cut, but he omitted some caveats, including that the cuts haven’t taken place yet. And it’s difficult to predict if the cuts will be fully implemented as the end date in 2018 will be under a new president and Congress. ""The reduction in active Army end-strength is likely but far from certain, given that lots of people in the Congress would like to get the Army more money,"" said Benjamin Friedman, a military expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said she expects the cuts to occur. ""The Army waited as long as possible to even start this latest reduction in force size,"" she said. While the talking about the reduction in soldiers makes good political fodder, it doesn’t address  whether higher troop counts are needed, said Charles Knight, co-founder of Project on Defense Alternatives, a group that advocates for lower levels of armed force and military spending worldwide. ""The only circumstance in which the Army needs those soldiers is if the U.S. were to reoccupy Iraq, invade and occupy Syria or Iran, or such,"" he said. ""Current government policy is explicitly against such options."" But the next president -- whether it’s Rubio or someone else -- ""could easily reverse current policy starting in 2017,"" Knight said. A few experts took issue with Rubio’s statement that we are ""eviscerating"" defense spending. ""The term eviscerate is, to my mind, entirely unwarranted for a military that continues to spend almost $600 billion a year, well above the Cold War average and nearly 40 percent of the world’s total,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, a defense expert at the Brookings Institution. Our ruling Rubio said, ""We have an Army that just cut 40,000 spots."" Rubio was referring to an announcement by the Army in July that it will cut 40,000 spots by fiscal year 2018. Those cuts had been talked about for several months, but the specifics were released in July. The cuts will start this fall but are expected to continue under the next president. Since the end date is under a new president and Congress, it’s difficult to guess if they will all happen, but that’s the plan for now. We rate this claim Mostly True.

No, Michele Bachmann did not say there are no 'illegal Mexicans in China' thanks to the Great Wall
","Donald Trump’s border wall proposal has earned him high praise from his political predecessor, former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., according to a meme circulating on social media. According to one version of the meme, Bachmann said, ""There are those who say a border wall won't work. They just don't have the vision Donald Trump does. The Chinese built a Great Wall 5,000 years ago. You don't see any illegal Mexicans in China."" It’s a tidy confluence of past and present presidential campaigns, as Trump’s lead in the Republican field is often compared to Bachmann’s early success in the 2012 presidential election. Several readers asked us to look into whether Bachmann actually made the comments. We obliged and found no evidence backing the claim. We also reached out to Bachmann’s spokesperson, who said the former member of Congress never made the remarks. The first thing that had us raising our eyebrows was some of the text that accompanied the meme when it was posted on Facebook. ""What do you think about a Trump/Bachmann ticket in the 2016 Presidential race?"" it said. ""Former Rep. Michelle Bachman (sic) told Fox News' Jenna Jameson she ‘admired Donald's leadership and vision’ and also complimented Trump on his reality show success, ‘If Donald can do for this country what he did for Arsenio Hall America will be great again.’ "" Jameson is a former porn star, not a Fox News host, nor is she employed by the network in any way, said a Fox spokesperson. (Jameson did make a rocky appearance on a Fox entertainment program in 2013.)  We also searched three comprehensive databases -- Nexis and CQ, which aggregate transcripts, and Critical Mention, which records video and closed captioning -- and found no record of Bachmann ever making those comments. To our knowledge, she hasn’t appeared on Fox News since Trump announced his candidacy. She has commented on and praised Trump in several interviews on different networks, though she has never mentioned his wall proposal. Here’s a rundown of her Trump-related remarks: • Aug. 6 on MSNBC’s Hardball: When asked if Trump will make for a good candidate, Bachmann said, ""Well, that's what he’ll  have to prove on the stage"" at the first GOP debate.   • Aug 8 on CNN Tonight: ""He’s like the Rocky Balboa of politics. He’s a winner. He’s been winning all through his life."" • Aug. 10 in an interview with conservative radio host Tony Perkins: ""When he talks about the effects of illegal immigration on the United States, that resonates with the American people.""   • Aug. 17 on CBS News: ""He’s getting it right. … Donald Trump has the secret decoder ring of what’s on voters’ minds. I think I had that too when it came to the repeal of Obamacare. Donald Trump understands people are not happy with massive immigration from third-world countries.""      Before Trump, Bachmann championed the idea of a border fence for years, but we couldn’t find an instance when she’s evoked the Great Wall of China. ButTrump has.

Has the U.S. really spent more on Afghanistan than on post-WWII Europe?
","The days of a massive American military presence in Afghanistan are over. Afghan forces might benefit from about 10,000 U.S. trainers and advisers, but otherwise, the country’s security is in their hands. Yet after more than a dozen years of American engagement, the situation is fragile in the extreme. Talks between the government of President Ashraf Ghani and the Taliban are on hold with no date to restart. Military casualties are up 50 percent from last year. Nearly 5,000 civilians have died so far in 2015. In this context, Politico cartoonist Matt Wuerker offered his take on the results of billions of American taxpayer dollars invested in rebuilding the country. In an Aug. 4, 2015, cartoon, a bewildered Uncle Sam stands on top of a pipeline of aid to Afghanistan riven with cracks that spell the word ""corruption.""  Superimposed is a box that says, ""The U.S. has now spent more on reconstructing Afghanistan than was spent on the Marshall Plan and the reconstruction of Europe."" A reader asked us to verify that comparison. In terms of inflation-adjusted dollars, the statement holds up. But, as we’ll explain, it falls short on two points. The primary source of the claim Wuerker pointed us to one of many news reports during 2014. In June that year, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction released one of its regular updates for Congress. In a short section, it compared the two programs. ""Adjusted for inflation, U.S. appropriations for the reconstruction of Afghanistan exceed the funds committed to the Marshall Plan, the U.S. aid program that delivered billions of dollars between 1948 and 1952 to help 16 European countries recover in the aftermath of World War II,"" the report said. The Inspector General analysts wrote that in inflation-adjusted dollars, the United States had spent $103 billion on the Marshall Plan and $109 billion on Afghanistan. The investment of American dollars is a fair yardstick, but experts noted others. Two very different programs While both efforts aimed to rebuild war-torn nations, the most striking difference is the Marshall Plan spent no money on the European armed forces. In contrast, about 60 percent of the aid spent on Afghanistan went towards arming and training the military and police. In fact, the Inspector General’s report makes note of that distinction. By its tally, building the Afghan security forces absorbed nearly $62 billion of the total. (To clarify, the total for Afghanistan excludes the cost of American military operations.) The Marshall Plan unfolded long ago, so a short summary is in order for those who might not know it well. The Truman administration and Congress created the Marshall Plan to stabilize the economies of Western Europe. In the early part, the program delivered hard goods such as food, animal feed, fertilizer and fuel. Later, direct aid shifted to providing raw materials and production equipment. Aid also came in the form of grants and loans. In the dollars of the time, spending reached $10.3 billion. About half was invested in power plants, roads, railroads and agriculture. Another portion went towards debt relief. There were loan guarantees to spur American firms to invest in Europe. Charles Maier, a Harvard historian, is a leading authority on post-World War II Europe. Maier told us that making comparisons across a span of more than 50 years is ""notoriously tricky."" The circumstances on the ground in Europe in the later 1940s and Afghanistan today are fundamentally different, Maier said. ""The European countries — outside Greece — were really functioning administrative systems,"" Maier said. ""Few of those societal infrastructures have been operative in Afghanistan. Also, when the aid was being provided, there was no fighting in the recipient countries, except for the civil war in Greece, 1946-49."" Maier also emphasized that while the inflation-adjusted dollars might put the Afghanistan price tag above that of the Marshall Plan, when compared to the size of the American economy at the time, the Marshall Plan represented a much heftier commitment than U.S. aid to Afghanistan. U.S. GDP then and now During the years of the Marshall Plan, the size of the U.S. economy was in the neighborhood of $310 billion (in dollars at that time). So, with total spending of $10.3 billion on European reconstruction, the Marshall Plan represented about 4.3 percent of average GDP. Maier then contrasted that with the Afghanistan spending between 2002 and 2014. During those years, the economy averaged about $14.3 trillion. The money spent on Afghanistan represented about 0.75 percent of average GDP. ""That's about one-twentieth of the Marshall Plan burden,"" Maier said. ""This seems a much more rational way of thinking about the burden the U.S. was bearing."" Seen through the lens of the strain on the American economy, the Marshall Plan required more effort than rebuilding Afghanistan. Our ruling Wuerker said that the United States has spent more for Afghanistan reconstruction than it did to rebuild Europe under the Marshall Plan. While the math behind the claim adds up, it's important to know that the reconstruction programs are not identical. The Marshall Plan spent no funds on military projects, while about 60 percent of Afghanistan aid was spent on security. The Marshall Plan was entirely focused on economic investments, while the spending in Afghanistan has been weighted much more toward establishing a secure space in which economic growth can occur. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/20/matt-wuerker/has-us-really-spent-more-afghanistan-post-wwii-eur/

Bill Clinton: Glass-Steagall repeal had nothing to do with financial crisis
","Recently, activists have shown up at Hillary Clinton’s campaign events to urge her to bring back Glass-Steagall. What is Glass-Steagall? It’s the Depression-era bank regulation that kept different types of financial institutions separate; then-President Bill Clinton signed legislation reversing it in 1999. Some Glass-Steagall supporters argue that its demise led to the 2007 financial crisis, and some Democrats have put a good amount of effort into restoring it -- such as presidential candidates Martin O’Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. But Hillary Clinton won't pledge to reinstate Glass-Steagall if she becomes president. And Bill Clinton says criticism over the law’s repeal is unfounded. ""Look at all the grief I got for signing the bill that ended Glass-Steagall,"" Bill Clinton said in an interview with Inc. magazine for its September issue. ""There's not a single, solitary example that it had anything to do with the financial crash."" Given the significant attention on Glass-Steagall among Democrats, we wondered if it’s true that it didn’t have ""anything to do with the financial crash."" Our research shows the law’s demise was part of a broad deregulatory push that greatly contributed to the financial crisis. But Clinton has a point that a direct line from the 1999 repeal to the market crash in 2007-08 is hard to identify. Too big to fail Congress passed Glass-Steagall in 1933, in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash that led to the Great Depression. The law kept commercial banks (where customers deposit money and take out loans) separate from investment firms (which hold securities and make investments) -- more colloquially, the law separated Main Street from Wall Street. Some experts and lawmakers want to keep these kinds of activities separate, because they’re worried that merging them could put the public’s money at risk. Here’s a simple hypothetical: A bank merges with an investment firm to create a massive company. The investment side makes a huge bet on an investment that fails big time, so the commercial bank side’s money -- money individuals have deposited for safe-keeping -- could be at risk. Because those deposits are federally insured, it might require a government bailout. (Think too-big-to-fail.) Supporters of the law say keeping these activities separate prevents this kind of domino effect. Is this what caused the most recent financial crisis? There’s plenty of room for debate here, given that there isn’t a single what-caused-the-crisis narrative that every economist accepts. It’s safe to say, though, that there is not a prominent group of economists who argue ""but for the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall, the crisis would not have happened."" Lawrence White, an economist at New York University, doesn’t see Glass-Steagall playing any role in the financial crisis whatsoever. He pointed to the crisis’ biggest culprits: firms such as Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs and AIG, to name a few. He added that much of the crisis hinged on activity by these institutions that would have been possible with or without Glass-Steagall, such as mass investment in notoriously bad mortgage loans. (Clinton’s staff linked us to commentary by several other experts who share White’s view.) We also contacted Barry Ritholtz, a wealth management expert and commentator, who said Glass-Steagall would have done nothing to stop the financial crisis, but not having it made the crisis worse. It encouraged banks to get bigger and to take on riskier investments, so the ripple effects of the crisis were bigger than they would have been otherwise, he said, adding that it wasn’t just the headline-making banks that struggled. The extent over Glass-Steagall’s effect on the financial crisis is a topic on which reasonable people can disagree. More so in Clinton’s favor is the fact that Glass-Steagall was a shadow of its former self by the time 1999 rolled around. Deregulating like it’s 1999 A few decades out from the Depression, starting in earnest in the 1970s, there was a push to roll back financial regulations that continued throughout the administrations of former presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. As part of that movement, banks and lawmakers steadily chipped away at Glass-Steagall and took advantage of loopholes. Banks were engaging in the kinds of activity Glass-Steagall was intended to stop even though the law was still on the books. By the time Clinton signed the Financial Services Modernization Act, commonly known as Gramm-Leach-Bliley, repealing the key components of Glass-Steagall in 1999, the regulation was nearly toothless. The law was simply catching up to what the market had already accomplished in the previous 10 to 15 years, said Kathleen Day, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University and an expert in financial crises. Take for example the poster child of the end of Glass-Steagall: The merger of Citicorp, a bank, and Travelers Group, a financial conglomerate, was announced in 1998 before Glass-Steagall was repealed. Even though this was the exact type of merger Glass-Steagall was intended to halt, the financial industry did not see many obstacles for the creation of Citigroup. ""Citigroup and others wanted and got the repeal of Glass-Steagall in order to validate what they had already been allowed to do,"" said Simon Johnson, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. So the overall, decades-in-the-making decline of Glass-Steagall might have contributed to the financial crisis and its fallout, as it was part of the deregulatory push. But Clinton putting pen-to-paper on the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 probably didn’t make any meaningful difference. But Clinton’s hands aren’t clean of the financial crisis, because his administration played no small part in the longer term deregulatory trend. Clinton and his administration did not make an earnest attempt to maintain oversight over the big, hybrid banks created by the demise of Glass-Steagall, Day said. Additionally, the administration’s firm decision not to regulate other aspects of the financial market played a meaningful role in the crisis -- for example, the absence of regulations regarding over-the-counter derivatives, which were becoming increasingly prevalent, despite internal warnings. Clinton’s claim ""might be technically true, but it’s a sin of omission,"" Day said. Our ruling Clinton said, ""There's not a single, solitary example that"" signing the bill to end Glass-Steagall ""had anything to do with the financial crash."" By focusing on the bill that officially repealed Glass-Steagall, Clinton's statement ignores the fact that the demise of Glass-Steagall took place over decades, amid a deregulatory push in which the Clinton administration played a role. By the time the law to repeal hit his desk, Glass-Steagall had been whittled down so much that it wasn’t very meaningful. It's a matter of debate how much of a role the overall demise of Glass-Steagall had in causing the financial crisis, but we couldn't find any economists who argue that the regulation was the sole linchpin keeping the financial system stable until its official repeal in 1999.

Wisconsin Democrats say path to citizenship supported by majority in all 50 states
","As two flocks of Republican presidential hopefuls debated Aug. 6, 2015, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin made a claim and posed a question about one of the debate topics. ""Majority in every state favors path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants,"" the party tweeted. ""Even @scottwalker used to. Who are these guys pandering to?"" PolitiFact Wisconsin has traced Walker’s reversal of his longstanding support for legal status for undocumented immigrants. We rated it a Full Flop in March 2015. Walker attributed the change in position to discussions with border-state governors; critics said he sought to better position himself to win support from conservative voters critical to the GOP nominating process. But what about the first part? Is public opinion in all 50 states in favor of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants? Where the numbers come from Most of the independent polling on immigration is done on a national basis, with results drawn from samples of about 1,000 people; typically those polls do not break out state by state results. But a nearly yearlong telephone survey of 40,751 Americans, conducted from April 2014 to January 2015, the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) featured state results on immigration and other topics. It was part of what the organization calls its American Values Atlas, an online map based on a large sample size the group says ""allows analysis of specific census regions, all 50 states, and even 30 major metropolitan areas."" The American Values Atlas was funded by The Ford Foundation and The Carnegie Corporation of New York. Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff cited the Values Atlas as proof of the claim in the tweet. The effort found that majorities in every state, ranging from 52 percent in Wyoming to 66 percent in Delaware, favored allowing immigrants living illegally in the United States a way to become citizens, provided they meet ""certain requirements."" Those requirements were not spelled out. In Wisconsin, 61 percent in the poll favored the citizenship viewpoint. In terms of the overall national picture, the path to citizenship viewpoint was taken by 60 percent in the survey. Republicans backed it by a slim majority (52 percent), Democrats by 68 percent. The other two choices respondents were given included allowing illegal immigrants to become permanent legal residents (but not citizens), or identifying and deporting them. Permanent legal status drew a range from 9 percent (Wyoming) to 23 percent (Hawaii). Deportation drew between 11 percent (Vermont) and 38 percent (Wyoming). More about the poll We asked nationally respected Marquette University pollster Charles Franklin to assess the American Values Atlas. He said the institute that conducted the poll has a good reputation in the polling community, uses sound methods and is transparent in its reporting. The poll uses the same methodology for all states and does not use Internet or robo-polling. Immigration opinion has been reasonably stable recently, diminishing concerns about polling over a whole year, he said. Franklin cautioned, though, that some small states have small sample sizes, reducing the precision of those results. He defined small as under 300 responses; 14 states fit that description. Wyoming, for instance, had 95 residents interviewed. In those small-sample states, the margin of error would grow to at least 6-10 percentage points in either direction, he said. (That compares to 0.6 percent in the nationwide sample). It’s worth noting, though, that in all but Wyoming, the small-sample states had majorities of at least 56 percent for a path to citizenship. Some of those states were as high as 65 percent. In Wisconsin, the Marquette Law School Poll directed by Franklin has found majorities of 52 percent to 58 percent in Wisconsin for a path to citizenship in polls conducted from 2012-14, Franklin said. State polls Question wording and timing also influence poll results, and that can lead to conflicting results at times, especially on a complicated issue. With that in mind, we searched for other independent state-level polling on immigration reform choices. In Wyoming, a November 2014 poll by the University of Wyoming found only 25 percent backed a path to citizenship. Another 39 percent supported allowing illegal immigrants to stay and work for a time, while about 37 percent backed deportation. While the wording is different than the survey cited by the Democrats in their claim, the results undermine the idea that a majority in every state favor a path to citizenship. Meanwhile, an advocacy group that seeks to discourage illegal immigration and reject ""amnesty"" for illegal workers has raised questions about polls on a path to citizenship. The group, Federation for American Immigration Reform, thinks deportation is politically infeasible and should not be presented as the only alternative to citizenship or legal status. Instead of a path to citizenship, the group prefers to ask people how they feel about ""encouraging illegal immigrants to return home"" by removing jobs and government benefits. In a 2013 survey it commissioned, the group found a majority backed either deportation or such ""encouraged"" departures, according to its website. Robert Jones, CEO of PRRI, the group that did the American Values Atlas, said asking about deportation was fair based on rhetoric used by key Republican leaders. Our rating A ""majority in every state favors path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants,"" the Wisconsin Democratic Party tweeted. There’s recent backing from a respected and independent opinion research outfit for the state-by-state claim. We found one instance of a contradictory result in a somewhat similarly worded question, and small sample sizes in some states are pretty small. So the finding is not airtight. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/19/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democrats-say-path-citizenship-supported/

TB real concern at Atlanta homeless shelter
","Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has made no secret of wanting to close the homeless shelter at Peachtree and Pine streets. Reed, who has been active in downtown’s post-Recession resurgence, says he’ll push for the city to acquire the property through eminent domain and turn it into a police precinct and fire station. Health concerns are a major reason for closing the Peachtree-Pines shelter, Reed said during a lunchtime speech to Atlanta’s Commerce Club on Tuesday, Aug. 11. ""Peachtree and Pine is one of the leading sites for tuberculosis in the nation,"" he told the crowd. Reed said top officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently asked to meet with him and ""laid out how tuberculosis cases, not in Georgia, but across America, are being traced back to Peachtree and Pine."" Could Peachtree-Pine, billed as the largest homeless shelter in the Southeast, be a leading site for tuberculosis in the nation? PolitiFact decided to do some checking. First a little background. The homeless are prime candidates for tuberculosis because they typically have greater exposure to cold weather, are in crowded conditions when they stay in shelters and lack proper nutrition and medical care. That means shelters, such as Peachtree-Pine, have to be vigilant to avoid becoming breeding grounds for TB, which is spread person to person through the air and caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB normally attacks the lungs, but also can strike the kidney, spine, brain or another body part. In most cases, tuberculosis is treatable and curable, although people can die if they don’t receive the proper treatment. Most people live with the bacteria, or latent TB infection, without feeling sick or showing symptoms. In 2014, 9,412 new tuberculosis cases were reported in the U.S., 334 in Georgia, according to the CDC. A new drug-resistant strain of TB was discovered in 2008 at the shelter at Peachtree and Pine, which is run by the Metro Atlanta Task Force for the Homeless. The strain was labeled G05625 TB by the CDC. The research  To fact check Reed’s statement, we reached out to Fulton County government, the CDC, the mayor’s office and the Georgia Department of Public Health, as well as shelter management. Anita Beaty, Peachtree-Pine’s executive director, rejects Reed’s assessment of the shelter and says it is ""100 percent compliant"" with CDC protocol for spotting, treating and avoiding the spread of TB.  She said Reed and the business community have conspired for years to force the shelter to close so they can take over its prime location, just south of Midtown and in sight of the Fox Theatre. Tuberculosis has been a worry at all Atlanta and Fulton County shelters, not just Peachtree-Pine, for years. But alarm bells apparently really started going off after an uptick in TB cases last year. ""At a time when the incidents of tuberculosis has been declining across the metropolitan Atlanta area and the rest of Georgia, it has actually increased in Fulton County,"" Brenda Fitzgerald, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote Fulton County Commission Chair John Eaves in April. A month later, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were sitting down for the first of two meetings with Reed about the ongoing TB problem generally, and Peachtree-Pine specifically. ""Our inability to control (the Peachtree-Pine) outbreak has led to infections in multiple other states,"" Philip A. LoBue and Jonathan Mermin, doctors with the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, wrote Reed after they met in May. Based on interviews, data and documents that PolitiFact reviewed, here’s a summary of the major points. -- Since 2008, new cases of the drug-resistant strain of TB that originated at the Peachtree-Pine shelter have turned up in metro Atlanta and Georgia as well as eight other states -- Alabama, California, Florida, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. (Genotype evidence, similar to a fingerprint, exists for every strain of TB, and that’s how every new case of G05625 in the state and nation can be traced to the Peachtree-Pine shelter. Similarly, that’s how the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 201, was traced back to a 2-year-old from a small village in Guinea who died in 2013 and who became known around the world as Patient Zero.) -- At Fulton County’s four shelters, the number of TB cases rose by 230 percent, from 13 in 2013 to 43 in 2014. Twenty-two of the 43 cases, or slightly more than 50 percent, were at Peachtree-Pine. (The CDC defines a large outbreak as being 10 or more cases, CDC spokesman Brian Katzowitz said.) -- The number of drug-resistant G05625 tuberculosis cases, those linked to Peachtree-Pine, grew 10-fold from 2013 to 2014, from two to 23. -- Fulton County accounted for 82 percent of all cases of that strain of tuberculosis in Georgia and 69 percent of all cases of the strain in the United States. -- At least four clients of the Peachtree-Pine shelter, according to Fitzgerald, have died of tuberculosis since early 2014. In her letter to Eaves, Fitzgerald said, public health researchers identified the homeless shelter at the corner of Peachtree and Pine Streets ""as a major source of the current outbreak. ""If it [tuberculosis]  gains a foothold in the community, then the cost in healthcare and human suffering will be incalculable,"" she wrote. Jessica A. Corbitt-Dominguez, director of external affairs for Fulton County government, said Fulton health workers, in conjunction with officials from the Georgia Department of Public Health and CDC, responded to the outbreak with an aggressive campaign of education, testing and treatment. Anyone with active disease was relocated from the shelters while in treatment under the supervision of Fulton Health and Wellness. The county set up special teams that make daily visits to shelters to perform screenings and administer medicines, Corbitt-Dominguez said. In June 2015, the county health department also signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with four shelters, including Peachtree and Pine. This was considered a significant step since a lack of administrative controls and protocols is considered a likely contributor to the spread of TB. As of this month, the number of 2015 confirmed TB cases at Fulton homeless shelters is 13, Corbitt-Dominguez said. Beaty’s attorney last week provided reporters with a certificate showing the shelter is fully in compliance with the CDC’s TB protocol, and Beaty told PolitiFact ""it’s ludicrous to think we wouldn’t be on it."" Corbitt-Dominguez confirmed that the shelter has never been cited by the county, although Eaves has said there have been concerns about the shelter’s TB safeguards. In a letter to Fitzgerald, he wrote that the shelter’s administration ""routinely exhibits sub-optimal administration of the procedures required to control the spread of this disease."" Beaty said Reed’s statement makes clear he ""is just not getting good information."" ""We have been cleared by Fulton County, which is on site every day to monitor. And we’ve got 100 percent clearance from the CDC’s requirements,"" she said. ""We resent those easy headlines that have no basis in fact and that marginalize homeless people in our facilities."" Tom Andrews, president of the non-profit Mercy Care, which operates 14 clinics, some associated with shelters, said the strain of TB originating at Peachtree-Pine has to be a major concern. Since it is medicine-resistant, it requires a more expensive and longer treatment program, Andrews said. The CDC estimates that the costs of treating a person with TB increases with greater resistance. Direct costs in 2010 U.S. dollars average from $17,000 to treat drug-susceptible TB to $430,000 to treat the most drug-resistant form, according to the agency’s website. So is it a national leader in TB? We asked the mayor’s office for evidence to back up Reed’s statement that Peachtree-Pine ""is one of the leading sites for tuberculosis in the nation."" Anne Torres, his spokeswoman, provided us copies of the letters from Fitzgerald and the doctors, as well as a highly technical report from the CDC. We reached out to the CDC. A spokesperson said agency officials would not comment on the mayor’s public statements. CDC officials also would not identify the states where they said the TB strain from Peachtree-Pine had spread. We were able to obtain that list from the Georgia Department of Public Health, as well as the number of cases of G05625 strain TB in each state from 2008 to 2014. The most were in Florida (14), followed by California (8) and North Carolina and Alabama (2 each). New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and South Carolina each reported one case in the five years -- for a total of 30 in the eight states in five years. But do 30 cases over a several-year period raise Peachtree-Pine to a leading site of TB in the nation? We posed that question to Philip Hopewell, a leading tuberculosis expert and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Peachtree and Pine is clearly  a major site for transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and it may be one of the leading sites in the nation,"" Hopewell said. ""However, there are not data from every such facility in the country,"" he added. ""To say that the Atlanta facility is one of the leading sites in the country -- it probably is -- implies that there are data with which to compare the Atlanta facility. Thus, strictly speaking, what he said can't be backed with evidence. Even so, I wouldn't fault the mayor for saying this."" Our ruling Mayor Kasim Reed said ""Peachtree and Pine is one of the leading sites for tuberculosis in the nation."" Thirty cases of a medicine-resistant strain of TB in eight states have been traced back to the shelter at Peachtree and Pine. The shelter also had a large share of the cases in a recent TB outbreak in Fulton County and four TB deaths, according to state data. CDC officials clearly believe it’s a concern, but a leading tuberculosis expert says there’s a dearth of comparative data. We rate Reed’s statement Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2015/aug/19/kasim-reed/tb-real-concern-controversial-atlanta-shelter/
"['Congress', 'Florida', 'Alan Grayson']","
Grayson says Murphy 'hasn't passed a single bill out of committee'
","U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson is bringing his brash reputation to bear in his Senate campaign, calling his Democratic primary opponent U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy ""ineffective"" as a legislator. In an Aug. 12, 2015, statement, Grayson, D-Orlando, offered to help Murphy learn how to legislate. Grayson posted the video for the old Schoolhouse Rock song ""I’m Just A Bill"" and cited an InsideGov.com listicle that called Murphy one of ""the least-effective members of Congress."" ""Patrick Murphy is one of the least effective members of Congress, in part because he hasn't passed a single bill out of committee,"" Grayson said in the release. Murphy, D-Jupiter, is competing with Grayson for the Democratic nomination to run for the Senate seat now held by GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio. Murphy has already been attacked by some Democrats for allegedly not being progressive enough, but we wondered whether the second-term congressman hadn’t gotten any bills out of committee. It’s time for us to take our own roll call. Murphy’s law? We’re not going to rate Murphy’s effectiveness as a legislator, because that’s a subjective measure. We’ve also noted time and again that passing bills is not the only way to determine a lawmaker’s effectiveness. There’s simply more to the job, such as writing language that gets included in other bills, proposing amendments, being a co-sponsor, holding hearings or negotiating with other legislators, as well as constituent services.  Murphy was first elected in 2012, so he has largely been a freshman with little seniority. He’s also a Democrat, which means he’s in the minority party in the Republican-controlled Congress. Grayson cited an InsideGov article as evidence for Murphy's lack of action, but we found two problems with that evidence.  First, the article sticks to a single measure: How many bills a member of Congress sponsored and passed out of committee (that is, having them sent to the House floor for debate) as a percentage of all the bills they introduced. Murphy is listed as having zero during his freshman term. Florida Republicans Richard Nugent and Daniel Webster are on the list, too. The list is stacked with rookies — 21 of the politicians named have served four years or less. It’s also overwhelmingly filled with Democrats, the minority party in the House since 2011. But there are other ways to get legislation out of committee. Murphy’s campaign disputed the list, and pointed out two instances of him getting bill language out of a committee as a freshman: • In May 2013, Murphy introduced HR 1974, a bill that would have changed how the Small Business Administration gave out loans for businesses rebuilding after a disaster. Instead of being reported out of committee, Murphy’s language was attached to HR 4121 as an amendment along with other SBA-related changes and sent from the Small Business Committee to the House. No action was taken on the bill. • In October 2013, Murphy was a co-sponsor and co-author of HR 3329, concerning banking regulations. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., was listed as the sponsor, but Murphy’s campaign noted he and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., managed the bill in the House. In the Congressional Record, Capito credited Murphy for writing the bill with Luetkemeyer. The bill eventually became law. The second problem is that the article didn't look past 2014, so it's out of date. In addition to highlighting several amendments passed on the House floor, Murphy’s campaign said that the House Committee on Veterans Affairs moved HR 456 forward in May 2015. That Murphy-sponsored bill's language amended HR 475 to cover application fees to post-secondary institutions for veterans. HR 456 came during Murphy’s second term, and wasn’t covered by the InsideGov list. Several experts told us the list Grayson is citing isn’t providing a good picture of what lawmakers do. Washington University in St. Louis political science professor Steven Smith told PolitiFact that party-line voting in committees usually keeps Democratic-sponsored legislation from getting anywhere. He called the InsideGov article ""disappointing"" because of its limitations. ""It lists only legislators at the low end of the scale, so we cannot see the majority party bias built into the legislative process and their measure,"" he said. Grayson, in case you’re curious, passed two resolutions about honoring Rollins College and when high schoolers should learn about the U.S. Constitution during his first term in 2009-10. He also was behind a law passed giving gold medals to astronauts. Our ruling Grayson said Murphy ""hasn't passed a single bill out of committee."" He cited a source that only looked at Murphy’s first term, not his second. Experts said the source is flawed, and is not a good way to measure how government works. Murphy had a hand in at least two items coming out of committee in 2013: One bill became an amendment, and he co-authored a second that became law. A third bill that Murphy sponsored moved out of committee as an amendment in 2015. We rate Grayson's statement False.",/factchecks/2015/aug/18/alan-grayson/grayson-says-murphy-hasnt-passed-single-bill-out-c/

Howard Dean: 'Tremendous' number of public officials have done what Hillary Clinton did with email
","Morning Joe co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist tried a number of ways recently to get Howard Dean — former Democratic National Committee chairman and ardent Hillary Clinton supporter — to admit Clinton erred in using a private email server as secretary of state. Each time, Dean stood firm in his support for the Democratic presidential candidate. Geist then asked Dean how he would feel about a Republican doing what Clinton did. ""Howard, is it fair to say if this were a Republican secretary of state, and someone you were not supporting for president,"" asked Geist, ""you would be troubled by a secretary of state having a private email server in his or her home?"" ""No, I wouldn’t,"" Dean replied, cutting Geist off, ""because I used to do that as governor, and I know there’s a tremendous other number of public officials who have done the same thing."" Geist followed up, ""And would only use a private server for State Department emails?"" Dean demurred, saying whatever she was done was within the constraints of the law at the time. (Whether Clinton violated State Department protocols or the law is unclear.) We wanted to check Dean’s claim that he used a private server during his days in office and that the practice is widespread among politicians. Dean’s emails Clinton has drawn criticism for conducting government business through an email address privately hosted on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., instead of through the State Department's system. On Morning Joe, Dean equated her actions with his own, as well as a ""tremendous"" other number of officials. So we looked into Dean’s record for insight into his past email practices. We reached out to Dean through Democracy for America, the grassroots organizing group he founded, but didn’t get a response for the story. Dean, who was governor of Vermont from 1991 through 2003, faced questions about his email in 2001 when a concerned citizen requested to see his correspondence with a ski resort developer, according to an article in the Rutland Herald. Dean’s lawyers at the time said the emails were exempt from release because they were conducted through the governor’s private account. The article also mentions that Dean used neither a government-issued email address nor the computer supplied to him by the state. Vermont state archivist Tanya Marshall said Dean’s administration did not transfer any emails to the state records office at the end of his tenure. So Dean clearly used a private email account while he was governor. But we could find no evidence that he used a private server as well. And there's a difference. In fact, only one other politician is on record as doing the same: Clinton’s Republican presidential rival Jeb Bush.  As Florida governor from 1999 to 2007, Bush used a private server for both his personal email account and the accounts of some of his staffers. Account vs. server Many politicians use private addresses, but private servers like the one Clinton had in her basement are rarely seen, said John Wonderlich, a policy director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group focused on government transparency. And there’s a big difference between a private account, which is generally free and simple to start, and a private server, which requires a more elaborate setup. Two other presidential candidates, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, used private email accounts hosted by large services like Google during their time in office. With services such as Gmail, messages they sent would have been stored on Google’s own servers around the world. While Google has a high level of security, email data stored on these kind of large commercial servers is often mined internally, for marketing purposes, for example, Wonderlich said. The Atlantic speculated the Clintons ""may have wanted to be in control of the encryption of their correspondence, ensuring that no third parties — whether commercial, hacker, or government — were able to snoop on them."" The unorthodox approach has opened up questions about her system’s level of security. Because the server was set up outside the State Department’s proverbial security fence, ""any protection … aside from the physical protection of the Secret Service — would have been limited to the Clintons’ own personal resources,"" according to a March 2015 article in Wired. If the server was managed without the help of a third party, ""you would have to have a staff that’s keeping up with all the latest fixes,"" said Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California’s Center for Computer System Security. ""That can be hard with a small staff,"" he said. Clinton’s campaign says she used the private account and server out of convenience, and that ""it enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule."" While Clinton’s immediate predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, did not email extensively during her time in office, Colin Powell did use a private email address while he was secretary of state from 2001 to 2005. Powell, however, did not operate his own server. Our ruling In the context of discussing Hillary Clinton’s private email server for handling government business, Dean said, ""I used to do that as governor, and I know there’s a tremendous other number of public officials who have done the same thing."" It’s possible that Dean was trying to say that many public officials have used private email accounts. But by failing to mention that Clinton also set up her own server, he completely misses the point of Geist’s question. Besides Clinton, Jeb Bush is the only other official who used a personal server during his time in office. That does not speak to a ""tremendous"" trend.

Trump says illegal immigrants get $4.2B in tax credits but doesn't count their taxes paid
","After weeks of incendiary rhetoric on illegal immigration, Donald Trump unveiled his official policy plan on what is arguably the central issue of his campaign on Aug. 16. Highlights of the plan include deporting all undocumented immigrants, ending birthright citizenship and ""making Mexico pay for the wall."" ""For many years, Mexico’s leaders have been taking advantage of the United States by using illegal immigration to export the crime and poverty in their own country,"" the position page on Trump’s website reads. ""The costs for the United States have been extraordinary. ... Indeed, the annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011."" The $4.2 billion figure caught our eye. Though Trump’s campaign didn’t get back to us, we found a 2011 audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that corroborates his claim. Nonetheless, Trump confuses a few points. In 2009 (not, as Trump says, in 2011), ""individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States were paid $4.2 billion in refundable credits, according to the report. That’s indeed more than four times the amount in 2005 ($924 million). How did this happen? Although undocumented immigrants can’t get a Social Security Number, they can file taxes with a different nine-digit number, the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number or ITIN. Experts told us that illegal immigrants make up the vast majority of ITIN filers, though there’s no way of knowing just how many. The group also includes legal immigrants (refugees, asylum seekers, spouses), foreign workers (professors, technology workers, people who own businesses in America but live abroad), and dependents of both citizens and immigrants. Regardless of immigration status, ITIN filers are not eligible for Social Security. According to the Social Security Administration, undocumented immigrants doled out an estimated $12 billion in payroll taxes but will never get the benefits. Also, ITIN filers can’t get the Earned Income Tax Credit, due to a provision in a 1996 law. ITIN filers, however, can receive the Additional Child Tax Credit, a refund given to people who owed less in taxes than deductions they could receive through the Child Tax Credit (up to $1,000 per child). The credit as it stands today was established in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, one of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. Unlike in 1996, Congress did not write a provision barring ITIN filers from claiming the refund. As a result, claims for the additional child credit have increased significantly since 2001, according to the Treasury Inspector General audit. By 2009, 2.3 million ITIN filers received $4.2 billion through the additional child credit, a four-fold increase over 2005. Here’s a chart from the audit:  Under this current system for ITIN filers, ""the government isn’t losing out,"" according to Bob Greenstein, president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It gets more money in revenues than it gives out in credits. However, Greenstein told us it’s slightly misleading to say that the recipients of the child credit are illegal immigrants. ""The vast majority of that $4.2 billion, the filer may be undocumented, but you have to have a child to receive it. And the children are overwhelmingly U.S. citizens,"" he said. In other words, the $4.2 billion in tax credits largely benefits American-born children, whose parents are admittedly undocumented immigrants. Trump’s immigration plan actually addresses this potential issue: He calls for an end to birthright citizenship. ""So his position is pretty consistent,"" pointed out Greenstein. Our ruling Trump said, ""The annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011."" Based on an audit by the Treasury Inspector General, the claim leaves out some context. Trump conflates ""illegal immigrants"" with ""unauthorized workers,"" a group composed largely of undocumented immigrants but also legal immigrants and others. The $4.2 billion refers to the amount given in tax credit refunds for children, the large majority of whom are U.S. citizens. And the actual year is 2009, not 2011 (that was the year the report was published). Also, it's important to note that illegal immigrants pay an estimated $12 billion in payroll taxes to Social Security and don't receive benefits. So Trump is leaving out a significant part of the picture when it comes to taxes and undocumented workers.  Overall, we rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/18/donald-trump/trump-illegal-immigrants-four-two-billion/

Lightning strikes more common in Texas than in-person voter fraud, says Cory Booker
","The Voting Rights Act turned 50 on Aug. 6, but the anniversary also doubled as an occasion for voting rights advocates to celebrate a new victory: The day before, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Texas’s 2011 photo ID law was unconstitutional, because it violated the rights of minority voters. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., went on ABC’s This Week on Aug. 9 to explain why he supported the decision: ""Take Texas for example, where Lyndon Johnson's obviously from, they passed these voter ID laws. In the decade before it, 10 years, they only prosecute two people for in-person voter ID, only two people. You're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find any kind of voter fraud."" We were surprised by the colorful comparison. So we decided to see if we could figure out whether lightning really is more likely to strike in Texas than people trying to cast ballots using fake identities. The odds In 2014, the National Weather Service gave the odds of being struck by lightning as 1 in 960,000. Their methodology consisted of taking the number of reported deaths and injuries (267) and then adding in another 63 estimated injuries, since not every injury caused by lightning will be properly reported, or even reported at all. Texas had the second-highest number of lightning-related fatalities from 1959 to 2013, behind only Florida. But that’s mostly because Texas is so big, both in terms of area and population; once you adjust the death rate, Texas actually ranks 33rd. An expert from the National Weather Service confirmed to us that the probability of being struck by lightning in Texas is slightly lower than the national average, right around 1 in 1.35 million. So how does this 1 in 1.35 million chance compare to the probability of finding voter fraud? To find out, we first counted up the total number of ballots cast from 2000 to 2014 using the Texas Secretary of State’s online record. The website includes presidential, congressional, and special elections, but skips over a lot of the more local ones. We came up with just about 71.5 million votes cast, but since the database isn’t comprehensive, we rounded up to 72 million (though that’s probably still an underestimate). Before delving into how many cases of voter fraud there are, here’s a quick definition. Voter fraud is ""the intentional corruption of the electoral process by voters. This covers knowingly and willingly giving false information to establish voter eligibility, and knowingly and willingly voting illegally or participating in a conspiracy to encourage illegal voting by others,"" according to Lorraine Minnite, a professor at Rutgers and author of the book The Myth of Voter Fraud. Minnite goes on to distinguish between election fraud — which includes fraud perpetrated by other parties involved in elections, such as advocacy groups or election officials — and voter fraud, which is a subset of election fraud committed specifically by voters. Booker’s press secretary said he was referring only to in-person voter fraud, or voter impersonation, which is the type targeted by voter ID laws, and given the full context of Booker’s comments, that makes sense. Looking at the kind of fraud that voter ID laws aim to prevent excludes certain categories of fraud, such as those involving absentee ballots. A spokeswoman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent us information on electoral prosecutions. Since 2002, there have been a total of 85 election fraud prosecutions resolved. Some of these were dismissed; others were classified as a pre-trial diversion, which generally means that authorities agreed not to charge the defendant. In total, then, there were 51 guilty or no contest pleas and 9 convictions, for a total of 60 cases of election fraud. Our next step was to identify how many cases were of in-person voter fraud. We reached out to experts who have studied these cases in detail. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said most of the prosecutions would not have been prevented by the voter ID law. ""There were a bunch of prosecutions for unlawfully turning in a ballot that people weren't supposed to have possession. There are a few instances of marking someone else's ballot without their consent — those are all absentee ballots.  There are a few of fake registration, or of voting while ineligible — none of which are stopped by a rule requiring ID at the polls,"" Levitt said. ""There are vanishingly few instances of voter fraud — incidents flat-out, not just prosecutions — that could be stopped by applying a rule requiring ID at the polls."" Minnite, the Rutgers professor, pointed us to 2012 court testimony from Major Forrest Mitchell, a criminal investigator with the Texas Attorney General’s office, in which Mitchell admitted that only about five of the more than 300 election fraud referrals that had been investigated since 2002 dealt with in-person voter impersonation. Mitchell’s testimony indicated that only two of these cases could have been prevented by a voter ID law. Three people were prosecuted, though, since one case involved two people. So Booker was off by one when he claimed two people had been prosecuted in the ten years before the ID law was implemented. Levitt, for his part, found only three credible allegations of fraud in Texas elections since 2000 that could have been prevented by an ID rule. Minnite found four cases of this kind from 2000 until 2014. Four cases of fraud for 72 million votes makes the chance of voter fraud 1 in 18 million. Our ruling Booker said, ""You're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas"" than to find in-person voter fraud. Since 2002, there have been a total of 85 election fraud prosecutions, not all of which have resulted in conviction. Only a small number of those cases -- four or possibly fewer -- included allegations of in-person voter fraud, also called voter impersonation. Those are the kinds of cases the voter ID law in Texas is aimed at preventing, and Booker is right that they have been less frequent than lightning strikes.

Tom Tancredo muffs illegal immigrant murder stats
","As several of Donald Trump’s Republican opponents have pointed out, his fiery statements on any given subject strike a chord among a set of voters who feel the political system has failed them. Tom Tancredo, a former GOP politician turned pundit, credits Trump for ""forcing all 17 Republican candidates to talk about the social costs of illegal immigration."" In an Aug. 8, 2015, article for the conservative website Breitbart, Tancredo said the ""mainstream media – including, sadly, major segments of the presumably conservative media, like the Wall Street Journal — are working overtime to keep the American public and the American voters in the dark on the scope of illegal alien crime."" Tancredo provided these bullet points: ""Between 2008 and 2014, 40 percent of all murder convictions in Florida were criminal aliens. In New York it was 34 percent and Arizona 17.8 percent."" ""During those years, criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York, while illegal aliens constitute only 5.6 percent of the total population in those states."" Tancredo said his source was a presentation from a conservative think tank, the Center for Security Policy. Several readers asked us to look into Tancredo’s core statement that between 2008 and 2014, ""criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York."" There are serious glitches in his claim. He botches the takeaway of the presentation, which has plenty of issues on its own. A botched summary We tried a variety of ways to reach Tancredo and did not hear back. In his column, he embedded a video of the presentation by the Center for Security Policy and invited readers to watch the whole thing. We did. The first thing that jumped out was Tancredo mangled the dates. He said ""criminal aliens"" accounted for 38 percent of murder convictions in five states between 2008 and 2014. In fact, the presentation offered numbers for 2005 to 2008. That's not the only issue. The presentation’s author, James Simpson, told us he had emailed Breitbart about Tancredo’s use of his presentation. ""(Tancredo) quoted the whole thing incorrectly,"" Simpson told PunditFact. Our research found that even if Tancredo had quoted the presentation as it was given, there would still be plenty of concern about its accuracy. State data not prevalent Simpson’s report includes findings from two separate sources: an article that describes 2008-14 data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, and his digest of a 2011 Government Accountability Office report, which uses 2005-08 numbers. We got into the weeds of each source, and the fact is neither provides an accurate look at the percentage of murders committed by criminal aliens in those five states. The real figure may be impossible to know; Texas appears to be the only one of the five states that actually keeps track of convictions of criminal aliens. The ""criminal aliens"" label applies to noncitizens who have either legal or illegal immigration status. (It is incorrect to consider all of them as illegal immigrants.) With various estimates floating around in Tancredo’s article, it’s useful to start with the solid numbers out of Texas. The Texas Department of Public Safety continuously updates its tally of criminal aliens booked into local jails, tracking the charges filed and whether the person was convicted. The agency’s latest report covers June 1, 2011, to July 31, 2015. In that time, 344 noncitizens were convicted of homicide. In about the same period, Texas had 4,571 murders. (There’s a difference between calendar and fiscal years, but as of this writing, the differences balance out.)  So based on counts of actual cases, criminal aliens account for 7.5 percent of all homicides in Texas. That figure is striking because it is one-fifth as large as the number Simpson gave in his presentation. Simpson said, ""Illegal aliens have committed 35 percent of all murders in Texas since 2008."" Simpson told us he had not seen the official Texas report. He had relied solely on an article for PJ Media. In our view, official hard data beats something in an article. Murky federal data The numbers from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a widely respected source, are also imprecise — which is obvious from all of the report’s cautionary notes. In 2011, the GAO aimed to learn the cost of keeping criminal aliens behind bars. The government analysts wrote that due to the large number of arrest files, they randomly selected 1,000 criminal aliens  in five states — Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas — and took a close look at their arrest records. The researchers detailed a host of caveats: At the state level, it’s possible that some people are counted twice if, for example, they are first kept at a county jail and are then transferred to a state prison. And the margin of error for the overall tally of homicides, as well as other crimes, was +/- 20 percent. The GAO was clear about the lack of precision in its results. A close look shows why anyone should use them with great caution. Because this was a study of costs, the only state prisoners examined fell under a federal reimbursement program called the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). Working with broad estimates, the GAO gave the percentage of convicted murders in each state’s population under that program. We used those percentages to come up with the number of criminal alien murderers in each state (see our chart). Without wading too deep into the weeds, we found that our analysis of the publicly available data wasn’t matching up with Simpson’s. Simpson’s total of murders is about 7,085, and our estimate was much lower at 5,300-5,400. Further, in Florida, he reported three times as many killers as our estimate, and his percentage of all homicides due to criminal immigrants in Texas was about double the official number  (albeit for a different time period). We should note that Simpson’s numbers are the basis for Tancredo’s claim that criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York. When we asked Simpson about his figures, he said after several months of writing to the GAO, he got the actual raw numbers. But Simpson’s figures must be based on some statistical assumptions, not raw data, because his total is larger than the number of individual cases examined by the GAO. And Simpson told us ""the whole thing is difficult to understand frankly, and they couldn’t explain it very well over the phone either. I may have to go back to them for clarification."" Also, Simpson compared the number of immigrants convicted of murder to the total number of murders. Tancredo said the percentages referred to all murder convictions. Since many murders go unsolved, that statement is clearly incorrect. This error underscores another way that Tancredo misquoted Simpson's work. We do have the number of people arrested for homicide in Texas 2011-2014 (a shorter period than the one for the number of criminal aliens convicted of homicide). Convicted aliens represent 12 percent of all homicide arrests, but it's important to note that due to the mismatched time periods, that figure is too high. The bottom line is this: Even the man who generated the numbers, which Tancredo then misquoted, expresses uncertainty about their precision. Our ruling Tancredo said that between 2008 and 2014, over one-third of the murder convictions in Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas were committed by illegal immigrants. The man who presented the data Tancredo cites said Tancredo ""quoted the whole thing incorrectly."" Tancredo used the wrong time period. He thought the baseline number was homicide convictions when it was actually all homicides. Most important of all, he took the presentation he relied on at face value and ignored the hard numbers available from the Texas Department of Public Safety. And while Tancredo might not have known it, the researcher whose work he used himself has questions about the underlying data he used. We have hard data from Texas that refutes the big and estimated numbers Tancredo used. Undocumented immigrants do commit murder, but perhaps only one-fifth as often as Tancredo said. We rate the claim False. Update: We added the Texas homicide arrest data after we first published.",/factchecks/2015/aug/17/tom-tancredo/tancredo-muffs-illegal-immigrant-murder-stats/

Pie chart of 'federal spending' circulating on the Internet is misleading
","Is federal spending on the military about 50 times higher than on food stamps? That’s the message of a pie chart now circulating on the Internet. The pie chart is headlined, ""Look closely at this chart of federal spending."" It says spending on the ""military"" accounts for 57 percent of the federal dollar, with other categories ranging from 1 percent to 6 percent. The caption says, ""Somewhere within the tiny orange sliver at the bottom is the food stamp program that Republicans blame for our budget deficit. And so ends today’s lesson in Republican logic."" To check the accuracy of this pie chart, we had to make a few assumptions. For starters, the chart isn’t dated, so we used estimated figures for fiscal year 2015. And since the chart uses some non-standard categories for federal spending, we had to make a few assumptions about which departmental spending should be placed in what category. That said, we found some fundamental problems with the graphic’s calculations and conclusions. To understand them, we’ll first provide some background on how federal spending works. Most federal spending can be categorized as discretionary or mandatory. The levels of discretionary spending are determined through the congressional appropriations process, with both houses of Congress and the president ultimately signing off on an agreed level of spending. Most spending by cabinet departments and independent agencies falls under this category, and it’s ""discretionary"" in the sense that if political leaders want to raise, or lower, the amount of spending for a given purpose, they can do so by tinkering with appropriations bills. The other major category is mandatory spending, which is sometimes referred to as ""entitlements."" Spending within this category is determined by a formula, and the big pieces are three familiar programs: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. For each mandatory program, the amount spent is tied directly to the number of people deemed eligible by age or income level. These programs effectively run on autopilot unless Congress changes the formula, making this type of spending more insulated from lawmakers and the president than discretionary spending. With that background, let’s now take a look at how the figures in the pie chart compare to a breakdown of fiscal 2015 discretionary spending (the third column), and to fiscal 2015 total spending (that is, discretionary plus mandatory spending, in the final column).   Category of spending Percent listed in meme Category's share of 2015 discretionary spending Category's share of all 2015 spending (including both discretionary and mandatory spending) Defense and homeland security 57 54 16 Education 6 6 3 Veterans 6 1 4 Housing and Urban Development 5 3 1 Health and Human Services 5 9 28 State Department and foreign aid 3 5 2 Energy and EPA 3 7 1 Science and NASA 3 2 1 Transportation 3 2 4 Labor 2 1 1 Food and agriculture 1 2 4 Social Security 0 1 25 Remainder* 6 7 9 * ""Remainder"" includes legislative branch, judicial branch, independent agencies and departments of Commerce, Interior, and Treasury, minus offsetting receipts.   The pie chart’s figures aren’t far off if you’re looking just at discretionary spending, though even here there are some differences. For instance, the pie chart significantly understates the amount of spending going to health and energy. More problematic, though, is that the pie chart ignores mandatory spending. About 60 percent of all federal spending is considered mandatory, with 34 percent considered discretionary and 6 percent devoted to interest. In other words, the chart, despite referring broadly to ""federal spending,"" only counts about one-third of federal spending -- the discretionary part. If we look at all of federal spending, the picture changes: • The ""military"" share, including spending on homeland security, shrinks from 57 percent to 16 percent. • The ""health"" share zooms from 5 percent to 26 percent, once expenditures on Medicare and Medicaid are counted. • Social Security -- a category not even included in the pie chart now circulating on social media feeds -- rises from 0 percent to 25 percent. • Food and agriculture quadruples from 1 percent to 4 percent due to the inclusion of food stamps, a mandatory program, and agricultural income and price supports. Calculating it this way severely undercuts the graphic’s message. Rather than the federal budget being dominated by the military, the budget is actually dominated by spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. In fact. the ratio of military spending to food and agriculture spending in the full budget is 4-to-1, rather than 57-to-1. A more accurate representation would be this one:  Our ruling A social-media meme says that 57 percent of federal spending goes to the military and just 1 percent goes to food and agriculture, including food stamps. To get numbers that approximate this, the pie chart cherry-picks just discretionary spending. But that means the pie chart represents only about one-third of federal spending. Once you include the 60 percent of the budget that is mandatory spending, the military share plunges from 57 percent to 16 percent, and the categories that include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid collectively account for a majority of federal spending. Spending on food and agriculture is still small, but it does quadruple from 1 percent to 4 percent. Due to its skewed methodology, the pie chart offers a deeply distorted picture of federal spending. We rate the claim False. ",/factchecks/2015/aug/17/facebook-posts/pie-chart-federal-spending-circulating-internet-mi/

Israel O'Quinn says S.W. Virginia coal counties are nearing 20 percent unemployment
","One speaker after another railed against the Environmental Protection Agency during a recent meeting of the Virginia chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group founded by billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch. Among the critics was Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington County, who traveled about 320 miles from his district in the southwest corner of Virginia to the Aug. 10 event at the University of Richmond. He warned that new EPA regulations curbing carbon emissions will pound the already wounded coal-producing counties in his district. ""Virginia’s unemployment rate is not spectacular right now, regardless of what the governor would have you believe,"" O’Quinn said. ""Now in Southwest Virginia, we have counties that are much, much higher. ""We have counties in Southwest Virginia that are well into double digits and some that are pushing 20 percent unemployment. Twenty percent, that’s not an insignificant number and you can track almost every single one of those to the coal industry because when coal takes a downswing, the entire economy of Southwest Virginia takes a big lick right along with it."" No doubt, the coal industry has seen better days and plays a vital role in Southwest Virginia’s economy. But we wondered whether counties in the region really are experiencing unemployment rates ""well into the double digits"" with some ""pushing 20 percent."" We defined Southwest Virginia based on a map published by the Center for Economic Education at Radford University. The region stretches from Lee County in the corner of the state to Roanoke County. It includes 19 counties and six cities. According to the Virginia Employment Commission’s latest statistics, the state had a seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate of 5 percent in June. The rate was 6.1 percent in Southwest Virginia. None of the counties or cities in the region had unemployment rates that came anywhere close to ""pushing 20 percent,"" as O’Quinn said. Two counties were in low double digits: Buchanan at 11.1 percent and Dickenson at 10.2 percent. In third place was Wise County, with 9.2 percent unemployment. It’s notable that Buchanan, Dickenson and Wise have the highest unemployment rates in the region because they are the three largest coal-producing counties in Virginia and, according to VEC data, are home to about 80 percent of the state’s coal miners. In 1990, the three counties had 9,773 coal mining jobs. That plummeted to an average of 2,812 jobs last year. Coal mining also has steadily declined in Kentucky and West Virginia during recent decades, and experts cite several key reasons: increased competition from cheap shale gas and and from less expensive, low-sulfur coal out west, particularly Wyoming’s Powder River Basin; increased automation in coal mining; increased regulations from the EPA. Getting back to O’Quinn, it’s clear that the unemployment rate is high in Virginia’s three largest coal counties, but not as bad as the delegate described. When we asked O’Quinn for the source of his numbers, he sent us a map from the VEC confirming the county unemployment rates we’ve detailed and he told us he misspoke. He said he meant to say that ""underemployment"" was pushing 20 percent in some coal counties. Underemployment occurs when a person holds a job that is below his training and doesn’t meet his financial needs. Neither the VEC nor the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics measures underemployment for Virginia counties. O’Quinn told us many local government officials in his district ""anecdotally"" believe ""underemployment there ""could absolutely be as high as 20 percent."" O’Quinn also said that since the release of June unemployment figures, coal companies in his district have filed federal notices that they are planning to lay off more workers. U.S. law requires most companies with 100 or more employees to provide 60 days notification in advance of layoffs. Records show one such notification, called a WARN notice, has been filed by a coal company in Virginia this year. On July 8, Alpha Natural Resources said it will lay off 165 Virginia workers on Sept. 6. Our ruling O’Quinn said, ""We have counties in Southwest Virginia that are well into double digits and some that are pushing 20 percent unemployment."" He offered the statistics at a rally where speakers were trying to muster opposition to new EPA carbon restrictions by arguing, in part, the rules will accelerate the decline in coal mining jobs. There is no county in the region that comes close to a 20 percent unemployment rate and it’s debatable whether any are ""well into double digits."" The highest June unemployment rates were in Virginia’s three biggest coal counties: Buchanan, 11.1 percent; Dickenson, 10.2 percent; and Wise, 9.2 percent. Those are big numbers. But McQuinn, who acknowledges he misspoke, exaggerated them. We rate his statement False. ",/factchecks/2015/aug/17/israel-oquinn/israel-oquinn-says-some-sw-virginia-counties-are-n/

Ben Carson says the number of Americans who 'believe in socialism...is increasing'
","A recent Fox News poll shows a late-summer surge for anti-establishment candidates on both sides of the aisle. Former neurosurgeon Ben Carson made significant gains since the first GOP primary debate, finishing with a net gain of eight points (bested only by Carly Fiorina’s 12 point gain) in the Fox poll. During the same time, Democratic contender and self-identified socialist Bernie Sanders closed some of the gap on frontrunner Hillary Clinton, moving up to 30 percent. In an interview with Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace, Carson gave the far-left side of the political spectrum a shoutout as he defended his 10 percent flat-rate tax plan, which is based on the biblical practice of tithing. ""You make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion. Now, I know a lot of people say that’s a problem because that guy’s still got $9 billion left, we need to take his money. But you see Chris, that’s called socialism,"" Carson said Aug. 16. ""And I recognize a lot of people here who believe in socialism. That number is increasing.""   We were curious about Carson’s claim that socialism is gaining ground in America. We found that the polling evidence is lacking, but experts said there is a noticeable shift particularly younger Americans. We contacted Carson's campaign but did not hear back. What Carson misses There’s simply very little data on on the topic, said Karlyn Bowman, who studies public opinion at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. And given how infrequently the questions about socialism are asked, she cautioned against extrapolating any trends from existing polls. Charles Franklin, a professor of public policy and law at Marquette University, searched the University of Connecticut’s Roper Center archive on public opinion and got 70 hits for ""socialism"" out of more than 500,000 questions dating back to the 1930s. The issue pops up from time to time — for example, during the 1960s and President Barack Obama’s first bid for the White House — but there’s no long-running debate over the ideology. ""We haven’t had a serious socialist movement or competitive party in the country, so the issue hasn’t been a constant focus of public opinion,"" Franklin said. Here’s a sampling of what some historical polls show: It’s important to note that all these questions ask different things — and none asks whether someone ""believes"" in socialism, as Carson said. Also, the questions come from different research centers that have different margins of error and use different polling methodologies. Given all the caveats, we’ll take the experts’ advice and refrain from connecting the disparate dots.   What Carson gets right However, Carson does have a point that attitudes towards socialism have changed. Recent polling suggests that socialism is viewed more favorably, particularly among younger generations, though overall the numbers are still low. A Pew Center poll conducted during the Occupy Wall Street protests shows the number of people who had a positive reaction to the word ""socialism"" rose from 29 percent in 2010 to 31 percent in 2011. Similarly, 13 percent said they viewed a socialist in the presidential race positively in May 2015, according to a survey by Rasmussen Reports, up from 8 percent in the 2008 cycle. Both polls report margins of error around 3 percentage points, so the numbers may not actually be statistically significant.   Numerous polls point to a generational shift, says Joseph Schwartz, a political theorist at Temple University. Compared to older Americans, people from 18 to 34 have more favorable attitudes towards socialism. Add in a working class and/or minority background, the attitude becomes much more favorable. ""Folks under 45 did not come of political age during the Cold War,"" Schwartz explained. ""Millennials, I think, vaguely associate socialism more with Nordic social democracy than with authoritarian Communism, so they see these countries as less unequal than more ‘neoliberal’ U.S.-style capitalism."" Beyond the polls, Schwartz pointed to the surge of Sanders, the Occupy Wall Street movement and Black Lives Matter as indicative of ""the revolt of the baristas"" — mostly white, college-educated younger adults who’ve grown wary of capitalism, high college debt, weakened unions, corporate tax cuts and bailouts. Overall, the country is leaning left, and liberalism has seen great momentum in social issues like gay marriage and marijuana legalization, according to Bowman of the American Enterprise Institute. In other words, to millennials and Gen-Xers, supporting socialism is more about Scandinavian-style living than Soviet governing structure. ""Does that mean that millennials are for social/worker/state ownership of the means of production? Probably only a small minority,"" Schwartz said. Our ruling Carson said the number of people who ""believe in socialism ... is increasing."" There has been sparse polling over the years about what the public thinks of socialism, so experts told us to be cautious about the numbers that do exist. However, there are suggestions in the polling data that younger Americans are more open to the idea of socialism, which they equate with European social programs and Nordic-style social democracies.  We rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/16/ben-carson/ben-carson-says-number-americans-who-believe-socia/

Donald Trump: Iran gets to keep $150 billion even if U.S. rejects nuclear deal
","Whether Congress approves it or not, Iran will still reap all the financial benefits of the nuclear deal, Donald Trump said on NBC’s Meet the Press Aug. 16. When asked by host Chuck Todd how he would work with the Iran deal if he becomes president, Trump, running for the Republican nomination, said he would be ""tough"" on the contract, but it would be hard given all the money Iran would already have acquired as a result of the deal. ""The problem is by the time I got in there, they will have already received the $150 billion,"" Trump said. ""Do you know if the deal gets rejected they still get the money? Which is something I found out a week ago. I couldn't believe it. If the deal gets rejected, they still get all of this money. Iran is going to be unbelievably powerful and unbelievably rich."" Does Iran actually get $150 billion from this deal? And if Congress rejects the deal, does Iran still get the money? Let’s take one question at a time. The $150 billion It’s true that Iran will reap significant economic benefits from the deal because many sanctions levied against Iran will be lifted as long as Iran complies with restrictions on its nuclear program. But it’s not like Iran will automatically receive a check or, as some critics have called it, a signing bonus. ""Will some considerable portion get transferred to Iran? Sure. But not all of it will automatically. That’s not how this works,"" said Michael Malloy, a law professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law and an expert on economic sanctions. First, the money already belongs to Iran; Iran just hasn’t been able to access it. The $150 billion figure, primarily thrown around by critics, typically refers to the dollar amounts of Iran’s foreign assets that could be unfrozen when sanctions are lifted. An example is money Iran has earned from selling oil but is held by a foreign bank. There’s also the many billions of dollars Iran has lost in revenues and opportunity costs because the country has not been able to fully participate in the global marketplace, Malloy said. But $150 billion is on the high end of estimates of the value of Iran’s foreign assets, which start as low as $25 billion, said Garbis Iradian, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. Most experts we interviewed, including Iradian, peg the amount of unfrozen assets at about $100 billion, but no one is 100 percent sure of the amount. You can probably get to $150 billion if you count up every possible type of money that sanctions have made difficult for Iran to access and use, said Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. Iran has financial obligations other than the sanctions, so even if all the sanctions are lifted, they won’t suddenly have all of these assets at their disposal. For example, Iran owes billions to China for infrastructure projects. Lower estimates take into account restrictions on the money other than the sanctions, Nephew said. So even if the total assets are $150 billion, it’s unlikely that that much will actually be available to Iran when sanctions are lifted. The Obama administration has said that after Iran pays its outstanding financial obligations, it will have about $56 billion at its disposal. What if Congress rejects the deal? While the exact amount of Iran’s unlocked sanctions is less precise than Trump describes, experts told us that Trump’s broader point is largely correct: Even if Congress does not approve lifting the United States’ sanctions, Iran will likely be able to get a good chunk of the money it currently cannot access. This is because other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and the United Nations, could decide to stop enforcing their own sanctions against Iran anyway. Iradian estimated that Iran would be able to access $40 billion of its currently inaccessible assets in that scenario, and the Iranian economy could get an even bigger boost if European companies decided to invest heavily in Iran. The United Nations, for one, has already passed a resolution to provide Iran with the funds withheld under the sanctions if Iran meets its end of the bargain, noted George Perkovich, an expert on nuclear strategy and vice president of studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Of course, Iran wouldn’t be able to access all of its assets in this scenario because much of them are tied up in the United States’ sanctions. ""There would be some crumbling of the sanctions wall, but that does not on its own free up the entire $100 billion,"" Malloy said, adding that the United States controls much of the petroleum market, which is important to Iran’s economy. At the end of the day, the discussion entails a lot of speculation, but nearly every expert said there’s a reasonable likelihood that other countries would choose to stop enforcing sanctions no matter what the United States decides to do. It’s worth noting that it will be difficult for Congress to maintain the sanctions because there would have to be enough votes to survive a presidential veto. Our ruling Trump said of Iran that ""if the (nuclear) deal gets rejected, they still get"" $150 billion. Experts told us that even if Congress rejected the nuclear deal -- thus maintaining current U.S. sanctions -- other countries could stop enforcing their own sanctions anyway. As a result, Iran would be able to access at least some of its assets that have been frozen under international sanctions. However, experts said it’s highly unlikely that this would amount to $150 billion, the maximum estimate of how much Iran could benefit by the lifting of all international sanctions without regard to Iran’s outstanding financial obligations. Without United States participation, the best estimate we could find was $40 billion. Trump’s claim is partially accurate but cherry-picks the high end of estimates for the unfrozen assets.
