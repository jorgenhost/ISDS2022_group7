Union leader says Central Falls firefighters are among lowest paid in Rhode Island
","
When the City of Central Falls filed for bankruptcy on Aug. 1, Robert Flanders Jr., the state-appointed receiver, said in court documents that collective bargaining agreements with police, fire and municipal employees’ unions were interfering with the city’s efforts to reduce expenses through outsourcing, privatization and sharing services.

The next day, Joseph Andriole, vice president of the Rhode Island State Association of Firefighters, defended Central Falls firefighters -- and their contract with the city.

In a story by WPRI-Channel 12 on the station’s web site, Andriole, who has been negotiating with Flanders, is quoted as saying that Central Falls’ small size belies its big-city challenges for firefighters. The one-square mile, densely populated city is filled with old mills and aging triple-deckers.

Central Falls firefighters are among the ""hardest working"" in the state, Andriole said. ""When you look at what they get paid, they are one of the lowest, if not the lowest, paid fire departments in the state and entire region.""

We wondered if that was true. So we decided to check it out.

First, we called Andriole, who faxed us a three-page chart he and the union’s business manager use in contract negotiations which shows the annual wages for 33 Rhode Island fire districts whose firefighters have union contracts.

The list compares the top ""base pay"" rate for firefighters. These ""Private First-Class"" firefighters comprise the bulk of most local forces. (Firefighters with less than a year on the job typically earn less;  lieutenants, captains, battalion chiefs and other officers earn more.)

In Central Falls, the top base pay for those firefighters is $44,892.08 per year. (That’s after the state-receiver this month reinstated a 2 percent pay raise that the firefighters had agreed to forgo last January.)

Based on the union’s list, Central Falls appears to have one of the lowest base pay rates in Rhode Island. (We spot-checked the list for accuracy.)

We found two fire districts where the base pay was lower than in Central Falls: North Providence ($90 a year less) and the Lime Rock Fire Department in Lincoln ($1,200 a year less).

The firefighters with the highest base pay on Andriole’s list are in Warwick, where the top base pay rate as of July was $62,422.

But the comparison leaves out other compensation, including one of the biggest pay boosters: overtime.

In the fiscal year that ended June 30, Central Falls firefighters received a total of $545,339 in overtime pay -- an average of about $13,300 per firefighter. (The overtime pay in fiscal 2009 and 2010 averaged about $413,000, or roughly $10,000 per firefighter.) Short-staffing tends to drive up overtime pay because of minimum-staffing rules.

Central Falls isn’t unusual in that regard. In North Providence, overtime pay for firefighters during the same period was roughly $21,000, on average, per firefighter -- more than double the average in Central Falls.

But Andriole says that overtime shouldn’t be factored into the pay comparisons, since it’s not guaranteed. He conceded, though, that one could argue that other forms of pay guaranteed under union contracts -- such as longevity, holiday pay -- should be included.

Central Falls firefighters with five years on the job get longevity pay of $1,500 a year. Those with 20 or more years on the job get $3,000 a year.

And then there’s holiday pay. Central Falls firefighters currently get an additional 10 paid holidays a year, or roughly $2,100 a year.

Firefighters also get annual allowances for uniforms and, in some cases, clothing.

Until recently, Central Falls firefighters got a uniform allowance of $975 a year plus a $1,000 a year clothing allowance. (The uniform allowance was recently eliminated under an agreement between the firefighters’ union and the state-appointed receiver.)

So if you add in overtime, holiday pay, longevity pay and clothing allowances, the annual pay for a firefighter in Central Falls with five years on the job climbs to more than $58,000 a year.

That’s significantly more, for example, than firefighters in the Lime Rock Fire Department in neighboring Lincoln.

Lime Rock is one of two fire districts in the town with paid firefighters; the others are all volunteer.  The department responds to about 600 to 650 fire calls per year -- just under half of the calls the Central Falls department handles.

Lime Rock’s top-paid privates earn $43,680 per year. No overtime. No longevity pay.  And their  uniform allowance is $700.

As far as how Central Falls firefighters’ pay stacks up with the rest of the region, that’s harder to say.

(Nationally, the median annual income for firefighters last year was $45,250 -- $358 more than the Central Falls’ base pay -- according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.)

By ""region,"" Andriole explained, he’d meant Massachusetts and Connecticut. We found no master lists, but did some spot-checks.

The base pay for firefighters in Hartford, Conn., -- a city more than six times the size of Central Falls -- is $45,857. That’s $965 a year more than Central Falls firefighters are paid. After five years, Hartford firefighters’ base pay rises to $68,073 -- $10,000 more than in Central Falls.

The base pay for firefighters in Holyoke, Mass., -- an old mill city similar to Central Falls, -- is $49,011 -- about $4,100 more than in Central Falls.

But Holyoke’s firefighters earned, on average, less than half of what firefighters in Central Falls earned during each of the last three fiscal years in in overtime pay.

The point is that firefighters can, and often do, earn a lot more than their ""base pay.""

In short, Andriole was right when he said that Central Falls firefighters’ pay is among the lowest in the state and region -- but he was talking only about base pay.

He left out some important context - namely, all of the other compensation firefighters receive -- which is why we rate his statement Mostly True.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Paint Creek, Texas doesn't have a ZIP code
","
Introducing himself to out-of-Texas Republicans, Gov. Rick Perry spoke of his upbringing in the West Texas fly speck of Paint Creek.

According to Google Maps, the Haskell County community is 57 miles north of Abilene, 160 miles southeast of Lubbock, about 170 miles northwest of Fort Worth and 288 miles northwest of Austin, the capital where Perry has lived since 1991.

""It doesn’t even have a ZIP code,"" Perry said at an Aug. 14 dinner speech in Iowa, the day after saying something similar while declaring his candidacy for president at a South Carolina meeting.

No ZIP code at all? How do they get mail in Paint Creek, via the Pony Express?

Some background: ZIP codes (the acronym stands for Zoning Improvement Plan) were launched in 1963, the Postal Service says, so the delivery system could better handle increasing amounts of mail. The first number of each code represents a general geographic area of the nation — ""0"" in the East moving to ""9"" in the West. The next two numbers represent regional areas, and the final two numbers identify specific post offices. There are now more than 42,000 U.S. ZIP codes.

Sam Bolen, a Texas-based spokesman for the postal service, it takes a minimum of 10,000 mail deliveries in an area for it to qualify for its own assigned ZIP code, though some existing codes cover areas with fewer deliveries.

At the Haskell post office, about 10 miles northwest of Paint Creek, clerk Nancy Snelling told us that Paint Creek has a ZIP code; it’s 79521, which is also the ZIP code for Haskell, the county seat.

Perhaps Perry means Paint Creek is not big enough to warrant its own ZIP code. In that vein, there’s an element of truth to his claim. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF6B940>],/factchecks/2011/aug/27/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-paint-creek-texas-doesnt-have-zip-/

Rep. Costa says drug testing for welfare recipients will save money for Rhode Island
","Rep. Doreen Costa, of North Kingstown, a Republican and member of the Rhode Island Tea Party, thinks the state could save money by requiring welfare recipients to pass a drug test. She is proposing that Rhode Island adopt a law modeled after one enacted in Florida,  which took effect July 1.

The law bans recipients who fail a drug test (and a confirmatory test) from receiving cash assistance for a year, unless they successfully complete substance abuse treatment at their own expense. If they complete treatment, they can reapply after six months. If they reapply and fail another drug test, they are banned for three years.

The child of someone who fails the test will continue to receive money if the parent designates a family member, such as a grandparent, to handle the  funds or if the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) designates a ""protective payee."" The selected family member must also pass a drug test and be approved by DCF.

Recipients would not be tested for alcohol or tobacco use.

Costa said the test would cost $25 to $35 per person and recipients would have to pay for it up front. The state would reimburse them if they passed.

""The studies have shown us that it will be saving us money, but we don't have the exact amount,"" Costa said on WHJJ's Helen Glover Show. ""If we could save the state $10,000, I'll take it. If we could save them a million, I'll take it. We have to start somewhere.""

We're not going to examine whether drug screening is a good idea. But we were intrigued by the question of whether there are studies showing that it would save money.

For this item, we will look at the prospect of savings in Rhode Island, because Costa told us that’s what she was talking about at the time.

We will also examine what studies in other states have concluded when legislators have considered drug-testing their recipients on welfare, formally known as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (TANF).

The short answer for Rhode Island is that, under the current system, no state money would be saved because ""100 percent of the cash given to TANF recipients is federal money,"" said Fred Sneesby, spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training.

Under current law, the federal government doesn't allow Rhode Island to keep any money it saves by denying benefits to people who test positive for drugs, Sneesby said.

Nor will the federal government pay for such testing.

How much would testing cost the state? We did a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on data supplied by The Rhode Island Poverty Institute.

As of May 2011, there were 5,653 adults receiving TANF benefits, including 1,314 from two-parent families and the rest from single-parent families. The cost to the state would depend, in part, on how many people passed, because only those who failed would end up paying for their test. The state would pay for the rest.

When Michigan briefly did drug testing for welfare recipients (more about that state's experience later), about 92 percent passed, in part because they knew the test was coming.

If Rhode Island recipients passed at the same rate and testing cost $25 to $35 per person, as Costa suggested, that would result in a bill of $130,000 to $182,000 per year.

That doesn't include the continuing cost of testing new applicants, doing confirmatory tests to make sure the first test isn't a false positive and any administrative appeals filed by people who wanted to challenge any move to reduce their welfare checks.

So what about the studies that, Costa claimed, showed costs savings in other states?

When we asked her to pinpoint them, she couldn't cite any. She said she had done her research by going on Ask.com and Google.com and posing the question, ""Will drug-testing welfare recipients save money?""

We repeated that exercise. Our spot check showed that the top results consisted mostly of blog items, websites and news stories in which various politicians and commentators had asserted -- without real evidence -- that drug screening would save money.

However, we did find some studies, but they didn’t support her contention.

A 2009 analysis of a proposed drug testing law by Louisiana's Legislative Fiscal Office concluded that testing would save the state $480,373 in denied benefits while costing the state $184,114 for testing and $763,306 for treatment -- a net loss of $467,047.

If you strip out the treatment costs -- because Costa's proposal calls for people to pay for their own substance abuse treatment -- the net savings to the Louisiana taxpayer would be $296,259.

But Louisiana fiscal analyst Patrice Thomas told us that those calculations were prepared before the state was informed that the federal government would not pay for any of the testing and would not allow the state to keep all of the savings if people were denied benefits. Analyses of bills submitted in 2010 and 2011 showed the drug testing would be a money-loser for the state.

The most recent study we found was done in February 2011 by Idaho's Department of Health and Welfare. It estimated that 10 percent of welfare recipients would test positive for drugs and that 25 percent of that group would lose benefits after failing a confirmatory test, saving $1.13 million per year.

Idaho also assumed that the state would get to keep $67,905 of the savings. But those savings would be wiped out by the cost of the testing, estimated at $246,591.

Thus, for every dollar the state spends in testing, it would get back only 28 cents.

In January 2011, Indiana's Office of Fiscal and Management Analysis released an assessment of a drug testing proposal making the rounds in its legislature. It concluded the state would save between $57,000 and $87,000.

But that analysis didn't include any administrative costs. (Idaho estimated that for every dollar spent on drug-test costs, the state would need to spend $3.41 on various staff costs.) Even if you assumed that Indiana's extra administrative costs were the same as its testing costs -- $173,000 per year -- that would easily wipe out the savings to the state.

Florida isn't the first state to pass a drug testing law for welfare recipients. Michigan adopted one in 1999 but it was put on hold after five weeks because of a court challenge.

(About 8 percent of the 268 applicants tested during those five weeks scored positive for illicit drugs. Most had been using marijuana; fewer than 3 percent were found to be using harder drugs.)

The law was struck down in 2003 by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals,  which ruled that drug testing without probable cause was ruled to be unconstitutional.

A similar challenge has been predicted for the Florida law.

Arizona does drug testing, but only for people who admit on a written screening test that they have used drugs in the past, gotten into legal trouble because of drugs, or lost or been denied a job because of drugs.

That screening test, derided by advocates of chemical testing because it's easy for people to lie, gives the state probable cause to test for drugs, avoiding the constitutional issue. (Among the people who flunked the screening test, 12.5 percent ultimately tested positive for illegal drugs.)

Minnesota and Wisconsin do drug testing, but only of convicted drug felons.

The Florida law, and the one Costa would like to see passed in Rhode Island, does not call for written screening.

To sum up: Costa, when asked about her proposal to test welfare recipients for drugs, didn't predict specific savings for Rhode Island, only that ""The studies have shown us that it will be saving us money.""

But she was unable to produce any studies to back up that claim.

The ones we found showed that the costs to the state exceed any savings.

And Rhode Island can't save money by kicking people off the welfare rolls because federal funds finance the payments, and the federal government does not allow states to keep money saved through mandatory drug testing.

We rate her statement False.

"['Elections', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell no longer promising to finish gubernatorial term
","
Two weeks out from Election Day 2009, Republican Bob McDonnell had a big lead in the race for governor and was fielding questions about whether he would complete his anticipated term leading Virginia or turn his ambition towards Washington.

""Will you make a commitment right now that were you to win on November 3rd,  that you will stay for your entire four-year term and not run for President in 2012?"" asked Ryan Nobles of NBC12 in Richmond.

""Absolutely, I think those are all pipe dreams down the road,"" McDonnell replied.

""You’ll be there from the start right until the end?"" Nobles pressed.

""Absolutely, we need a full time governor,"" McDonnell said.

Virginia gubernatorial races get a lot of national attention. The Old Dominion and New Jersey are the only states that choose governors the year after presidential elections. There isn’t much else to feed political junkies during these odd years.

But the 2009 Virginia gubernatorial race particularly piqued national interest. It came a year after Barack Obama carried Virginia, marking the first time in 44 years a Democratic presidential candidate won the state. Suddenly, reliably-Republican Virginia was recast as a critical swing state presidential politics. McDonnell’s popularity in Virginia created a buzz about his potential for the GOP national ticket in 2012.

McDonnell, still seeking to nail down his gubernatorial win, dismissed the speculation.
""The candidate doesn’t want to talk about future ambitions, saying he will serve his full four-year term through 2013 if elected,"" The Virginian-Pilot reported on Oct. 17, 2009.

Two days later, during his interview with Nobles, McDonnell said, ""You know, there’s a lot of  number of national political pundits that are paying an exceptional amount of attention to Virginia. I am running to be governor of Virginia...I am fully committed to four years as Virginia’s governor.""

A month after his inauguration, McDonnell reaffirmed the pledge. Dispelling rumors that he might run for the U.S. Senate in 2012, McDonnell told WTOP Radio on Feb. 23, 2010: ""I am absolutely planning to serve for four years.""

McDonnell’s response changed earlier this year when asked, for the first time, whether he would be interested in joining the GOP ticket in 2012 as the vice-presidential candidate.

""What if the party’s nominee.. came to you and said  ‘for the betterment of your party and your country, I need you to serve as my running mate."" Nobles asked during a  February 21 interview this year.  ""Wouldn’t that be a difficult thing for you to turn down?""

""Probably,"" McDonnell replied.

McDonnell then stressed that he was honored to be governor and was not seeking to join the national ticket.

McDonnell expressed outright interest in the No. 2 spot in a Politico story that ran Aug. 15, noting the his popularity in Virginia and his recent ascension to the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association.

""I’d be very interested,"" McDonnell was quoted as saying. ""It is a swing state. I’m not asking for the call. I’m not looking for the call. As I’ve said many times, I’ve got the best job in America. But I think anybody who is in public life, if a presidential nominee called him and said, ‘I need your help to win,’ it would be a tremendous honor. … We’ll see. It’s going to be seven, eight, nine months before any of these decisions are made.""
.
The next day, McDonnell was accused of reneging on his promise to serve out his term by David Mills, executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia.

""Virginians deserve an answer: Is McDonnell just a flip-flopper who won’t stand by his word if it interferes with his personal political ambitions? Or did he knowingly mislead Virginia voters?"" Mills said in a news release.

Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s chief of communications, told us: ""The governor’s position has been absolutely consistent on this issue. He is fully committed to serving the people of Virginia. He is planning to serve the full four years of his term.""

Martin said the vice-presidential talk ""is a hypothetical conversation about a possible phone call that couldn’t even happen until a year from now. You can’t change your position on something that hasn’t happened.""

But McDonnell is no longer promising to finish his gubernatorial term. He has put out word he is interested in being nominated for vice president next year. That’s a Full Flop!

U.S. Surgeon General says less education means higher mortality rates
","
School is back in session. Having trouble persuading Junior to go to class?

Tell him that if he doesn’t graduate high school, he’s more likely to die.

U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin said as much during an interview on WABE-FM (90.1), as she talked about what she said was the close link between education and health.

""The United States death rate is two-and-a-half times higher for those who do not have a high school education,"" Benjamin said.

PolitiFact Georgia’s team of reporters was skeptical. Doesn’t that sound like something your mom would say to scare you into behaving? Like, ""if you keep making that face, it’ll stick that way""?

We called up the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Surgeon General’s Office.

Their officials replied with a pile of information. Chief among them was a 2007 report from the National Vital Statistics System, a collection of public health data overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It calculated death rates based on 2004 statistics.

According to this data, the gap was even worse than Benjamin said. People ages 25 through 64 with 13 or more years of education died at the rate of 208.3 per 100,000. The rate for those with fewer than 12 years of education was 667.2, or 3.2 times higher.

University of Colorado at Boulder professor Richard Rogers pointed us to a NVSS report released in 2010 that says Benjamin is closer to the mark. Data from 2007 shows the death rate for those with less than a high school diploma is 529.5, or 2.7 times the rate for those with at least some college, it said.

PolitiFact Georgia also consulted with experts and read studies on the subject. They agreed that Benjamin is correct. Since the 1970s, researchers have been aware that education is closely linked to health.

In fact, much of the increase in life expectancy has taken place among high-education groups.  Life expectancy actually declined for less-educated white women.  

According to a 2008 study, better-educated black men can expect to live more than eight years longer than their less-educated counterparts.

It’s not entirely clear why people with more education tend to live longer lives. Researchers we interviewed said there are likely many reasons.

Those with at least some college are less likely to smoke, be obese, live in dangerous places, or have a host of other characteristics that can shorten their lives, studies show. They have healthier behaviors in part because they have more financial and social resources.

Recent evidence also suggests that cognitive ability helps people make better health decisions, said Adriana Lleras-Muney, a University of California Los Angeles professor who has worked on the problem for about a decade.

Rick Perry says Texas added 21,000 doctors because of tort reform
","
Ask any Republican candidate about reducing the cost of health care and part of the answer is likely to include rewriting the rules for medical malpractice.  In 2003, Texas lawmakers passed a package of changes to malpractice law, plus the state added a few more through a referendum known as Proposition 12.

These turned the state into a beacon of hope among tort reformers and Texas Gov. Rick Perry talks proudly of the good the changes have done.

When he was asked about medical malpractice at the Politics and Eggs Breakfast in Bedford, N.H., on Aug. 17, 2011, he had some precise numbers at his fingertips.  ""I’ll tell you what one of the results was,"" he said. ""This last year, 21,000 more physicians practicing medicine in Texas because they know they can do what they love and not be sued.  Some 30 counties that didn’t have an emergency room doc have one today.  Counties along the Rio Grande, where women were having to travel for miles and miles outside of the county to see an ob-gyn, for prenatal care and now they have that care.""

For this fact-check, we're examining his claim that that the state gained 21,000 doctors because of tort reform.

First, we found the number is wrong.

Perry’s campaign relies on data from the Texas Medical Association, a physician trade group, which counts the number of medical licenses issued in Texas.  The problem is, not everyone with such a license practices in Texas.

The Texas Medical Board issues licenses and tracks whether those doctors actually work in the state.  According to their numbers, between 2003 and 2011, the accurate increase is 12,788.  That’s about 8,000 doctors fewer than the governor’s claim.

Still, thousands of additional physicians is nothing to sneeze at, and the next question is, can credit be put at the feet of tort reform?  

Not much. By far, the biggest driver is population growth.  From 2002 to 2010, the population of Texas grew by 20 percent.  At the same time, the number of doctors went up 24 percent.  

Jon Opelt, executive director of Texas Alliance for Patient Access, a group that supports tort reform and is funded by health care providers, sent us some analysis he had done that filtered out the population effect. Opelt said the higher rate for doctors -- 24 percent -- translates into an additional 1,608 physicians thanks to tort reform.

At least, that’s what he said when we first spoke to him. Later, after we showed him that the growth of doctors increased at a faster rate in the pre-reform years, Opelt sent us new numbers, saying tort reform brought 5,000 more doctors to the state and the ratio of doctors to residents has never been better. (We found those numbers to be a stretch: The upward revision comes from including administrators, teachers and other licensed doctors who don’t actually treat patients.)

In any event, from the pro-reform vantage point, the most accurate figure is 5,000 -- a far cry from 21,000.

But the case for Perry’s statement gets even shakier when you review numbers prior to the new malpractice rules. It turns out that in the nine years before tort reform, the number of doctors grew twice as fast as the population. So Texas did a pretty good job attracting doctors before the law changed.

Tom Banning, chief executive officer of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians, said that back in the early 1990’s the state began passing laws that made it physician-friendly.  Among them, a prompt-pay rule to ""to ensure that insurers pay physicians promptly and correctly,"" Banning said, ""which creates a very good environment for practices.""

Banning said tort reform was more good news for doctors, a sentiment borne out by opinion surveys from the state’s medical association. But he acknowledges that population growth is the biggest force behind the growing ranks of doctors. ""It’s like the Willie Sutton rule,"" Banning said, referring to the famous bank robber. ""Go where the money is.  From a doctor’s standpoint, you go where the patients are.""

Especially patients who can pay. Banning and other observers in Texas note that most of the new doctors are clustered in the affluent, fast growing suburbs around the state’s biggest cities.

This puts a damper on one of Perry’s additional points, that tort reform opens the doors for physicians to practice in the state’s most rural counties.  The results here are mixed.  The governor is right about emergency room doctors.  The state has 60 percent more of them then it did in 2003 and tort reform likely played a major role, experts told us.  ER doctors got more protections from tort reform than just about any other medical specialty.

But Perry also boasted that rural counties were getting specialists in obstetrics and gynecology that they never had before.  The reality here is murkier.  A report from the Texas Alliance for Patient Access says 14 counties (of 254 total) gained an ob-gyn. We looked at one community along the Rio Grande, Starr County, and found that yes, four years after tort reform, they got one.  But the situation has flipped back and forth, and as of May 2011, Starr County had no ob-gyn specialist.

Our ruling

There is no question that tort reform drove down medical malpractice insurance premiums and reduced the number of malpractice suits.  And there is no question that most health care providers like the change and say it’s a factor that leads them to practice in the state.  But the wholesale transformation that Perry describes is not backed up by the numbers.

Perry said Texas has 21,000 more doctors thanks to tort reform.  That’s flat out wrong.  Texas has only about 13,000 more doctors in the state and the historic trends suggest that population growth was the driving factor.  We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB0FEC80>],/factchecks/2011/aug/25/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-added-21000-doctors-because-/
"['Medicare', 'Poverty', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Kind']","
U.S. Rep. Ron Kind says that ""thanks to Medicare,"" 75% fewer seniors are in poverty, and most have health coverage
","
Democrats marked the 45th anniversary of Medicare by accusing Republicans of renewing hostilities against the popular program.

A partisan scrap over Medicare and the elderly? That’s nothing new.

But there was one aspect of the rhetoric during the summer of 2011 that caught our attention.

Democrats reminded audiences of life before and after Medicare -- the health insurance program funded by employer and worker taxes that passed in 1965 after years of debate.

The comments from U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., partly echoed points made by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats:

""Before Medicare, only 51 percent of Americans 65 and older had health care coverage and nearly 30 percent lived below the poverty line,"" Kind wrote on his website. ""Today, thanks to Medicare, things are drastically different. Nearly all seniors have coverage and 75 percent fewer struggle in poverty.

We wondered if the situation for seniors had improved as much as described -- and whether Medicare was the main reason why.

In the early 1960s, both the elderly population and hospital care costs were surging. Private insurers repeatedly were forced to increase premium rates.

""Old people were long considered ‘bad risks’ by commercial insurers, and unions had not made much headway in obtaining coverage for retired workers through employer-sponsored plans,"" notes an official government history of Medicare on the Social Security website.

Over the objections of the American Medical Association, Congress approved Medicare by wide bipartisan margins, with President Lyndon Johnson signing the measure in July 1965. Medicare took effect in 1966.

At what rate were seniors insured at that time?

Kind points to a 2000 government report that said ""in 1964, nearly half of all seniors were uninsured, making the elderly among the least likely Americans to have health insurance.""

We found wide agreement on this point among a half-dozen government and academic reports -- a range from 50 percent to 56 percent uninsured seniors in the early to mid-1960s.

One report broke it down further: 54 percent had hospital coverage, and 46 percent had surgical coverage, according to survey statistics cited by the National Health Statistics Reports.

It’s also true virtually all seniors have coverage today.

""The folks left out are those not eligible for Social Security (either as a worker or dependent or survivor),"" said Marilyn Moon, a Medicare expert at the American Institutes for Research, an independent policy group. ""This is mostly legal immigrants who do not have enough earnings years to qualify. It has traditionally been about 2 percent.""

That covers the question of who had coverage. But what about the poverty part of it?

Kind said that, thanks to Medicare, ""75 percent fewer struggle in poverty."" Pelosi did not use that number in her own release on this.

Kind pointed us to a chart in a federal report showing a 30 percent poverty rate for seniors in the mid-1960s, and he compares it to a number Pelosi used (7.5 percent) for ""today."" That would get you to a 75 percent drop. But the figure didn’t reach 30 until 1967 (29.5 percent). And the 7.5 percent was off; Pelosi’s office reviewed it after we asked and will be changing her website.

So we did our own check.

We turned to census reports, which show 8.9 percent of seniors in poverty in 2009, the latest year available.

The closest pre-Medicare census report on elderly poverty we found was 1959, when 35.2 percent of the elderly officially were considered poor. Compared to 2009, this is a 75 percent drop. (Census figures for elderly poverty were not kept for 1960-1965).

So, Kind is right on the 75 percent. But his statement is aimed at a larger point -- that the poverty reduction is due to Medicare.

In the Great Depression, at least half of all seniors were living in poverty, but that started to fall after the 1935 act creating Social Security. Experts agree that much of the drop in more recent decades is due not to Medicare, but to improvements in Social Security benefits, especially in the 1970s.

""The poverty measures are based on cash income and do not reflect the contribution that Medicare has made to the quality of life of seniors. Almost all the decline in poverty is attributed to Social Security,"" said Virginia Reno, a Medicare expert at the National Academy of Social Insurance.

Think of it this way: Social Security payments help determine a senior’s income. Medicare coverage impacts their health care coverage and costs, but isn’t factored into total income, which is how the poverty rate is defined.

As Reno wrote in a 2010 report: ""Poverty among older Americans declined in the 1960s and 1970s for the same reasons as their median incomes rose: more of them had worked long enough in covered jobs to qualify for Social Security benefits, and the level of these benefits was increased by Congress.""

Moon, of American Institutes for Research, added: ""What can be said is that without Medicare, many of those both below and above poverty would not be able to afford health care.""

Kind spokeswoman Leah Hunter said the congressman did not mean to suggest Medicare was the sole reason for the poverty-line change.

Let’s bring this home.

Kind claimed that basically half of seniors lacked health insurance before Medicare, and the program reduced the share of seniors in poverty by 75 percent. His statistics pan out, but he overplays his hand by making Medicare the hero for getting seniors above the poverty line when experts agree other things, chiefly Social Security, are the reason.

Sen. Rob Portman says U.S. export values per capita lag Ethiopia, China and South Korea
","
Ohio's Sen. Rob Portman is a former United States trade ambassador who supports more trade agreements to increase U.S. exports.

In a recent interview with Charlie Rose on PBS, the senator said the U.S. ""should be the largest exporter in the world, which we are in many categories, but also per capita. We are well behind all of our trading partners.""

Not only behind trading partners, he said: ""We rank below Ethiopia, I'm told, in terms of our exports per capita, well below any of the other developed countries we trade with, and well below China and (South) Korea and countries we hope to trade with more, in the case of Korea through the Korean trade agreement.""

When Portman made a similar statement early this year, saying that U.S. trade lags behind other developed nations, PolitiFact Ohio rated it as True. We found that the United States trails only Germany and China in terms of merchandise shipped abroad, but that U.S. exports are a smaller portion of the overall economy. The value of U.S. exports in relation to the nation's gross domestic product ranks near the bottom of a list of more than 200 exporting countries compiled by the World Bank.

Portman cited a different measure, exports per capita, on PBS. Knowing his expertise in international trade, PolitiFact Ohio again wanted to know more.

We looked at figures from the CIA World Factbook and were surprised at what we found. U.S. exports per capita (about $3,400 in 2009) were less than half of South Korea's ($7,700), just as Portman said.

But U.S. exports were substantially more per capita than China's ($899) and spectacularly more than Ethiopia's ($19).

We asked Portman's office for clarification, and were told the senator ""was referring to the GDP number"" on PBS.

Portman referred more than once to ""exports per capita."" But PolitiFact Ohio does understand slips of the tongue, and Portman clearly has expertise on this issue.

When we substituted ""percentage of GDP"" for ""per capita"" -- a substitution only suggested by our checking with his office -- his statement on PBS is accurate about China and South Korea, but not about Ethiopia. By a slim margin, exports from Ethiopia are a smaller percentage of GDP (11 percent) than are U.S. exports (13 percent) on the World Bank list.

So where does that leave us?

Portman's underlying point remains that U.S. exports lag behind other countries. Yet even allowing that he misspoke on the terms for his comparison, he still is off point on one of his examples.

His statement is partially accurate, but sorting it out requires knowing some important details. On the Truth-O-Meter, that makes it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EADFC0C0>],/factchecks/2011/aug/25/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-export-values-capita-lag-e/

State Sen. Michael Doherty says school districts receive more state aid for every student who receives a subsidized lunch
","
Taxpayers are picking up the tab for more than just lunch in Elizabeth schools, according to state Sen. Michael Doherty.

A story in The Sunday Star-Ledger revealed three officials from the Union County school district allegedly enrolled their children in a subsidized lunch program, even though they earn too much to qualify for it. Doherty (R-Warren), one of several New Jersey officials who called for an investigation into the matter, wrote a letter to acting state Education Commissioner Christopher Cerf saying he’s worried the program opens another avenue for abuse.

""This year, when you appeared before the Senate Budget Committee, I informed you about the potential for abuse of the free and reduced price lunch program, and how enrolling a student in the program triggers an ""At Risk"" designation, which results in an additional $6,000-7,000 of state school aid for a student,"" Doherty wrote to Cerf in an Aug. 22 letter. ""This additional school aid, which can exceed hundreds of millions of dollars, is collected from taxpayers throughout the state.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found Doherty is mostly right: when a student is enrolled in the federally supported lunch program, they are designated as at risk. But his claim that each at-risk student brings in up to $7,000 in additional state aid needs clarification.  

We’ll first explain how an at-risk designation translates into increased per-pupil spending.

The ""School Funding Reform Act of 2008"" set up the formula that calculates how state education spending is determined for New Jersey school districts. The formula sets a minimum amount that the state believes must be spent on a student to provide a ""thorough and efficient education.""

The base amount can increase depending on a variety of factors, including whether a student is considered at risk. At-risk students include those who qualify for a free or reduce-price lunch, according to state law.

An at-risk student is weighted differently in the formula, increasing the amount of funds the state believes should be spent to educate that child.  

So, we’ve determined Doherty is correct about the at-risk designation. But what about his claim that for each at-risk student, a school district receives up to $7,000 more in state aid?

The state auditor released a report in June, which said: ""The Department of Education's state formula aid per the School Funding Reform Act of 2008 is increased to a school district by between $4,700 and $5,700 for each student eligible for the school lunch program.""

Stephen Eells, the state auditor, said his department calculated the aid figures based on the minimum per-pupil spending amount set by the state -- and then rounded the figures.

So, a student in a school district where less than 20 percent of the population is considered at-risk receives about $4,700 more in aid. For districts, like Elizabeth, where more than 60 percent of the student population is considered at risk a student brings in nearly $5,700 in more aid, per Eells calculation.  Other districts fall somewhere within that range, Eells said.

Justin Barra, a spokesman for the state education department, said the education department doesn’t calculate specific costs for at-risk pupils because it is just one of many factors. But, he said in an email that the state ""estimates that no district receives more than $6,000 per at-risk student, with a significant number much lower than that, and some receiving no funding at all.""

Doherty told us his figures were in reference to districts like Elizabeth, but he doesn’t make that clear in his letter.

Still, his numbers aren’t far off from the state auditor’s figures for a district with a student population that includes more than 60 percent of at-risk students.

Here's the difference. Doherty included money for security aid, which is increased from a base amount of $70 per student to up to more than $400 per at-risk student, according to the state funding formula.

Doherty also included at-risk students who are bilingual, a designation that further increases per-pupil spending by his calculations to nearly $7,000.

The ruling

Doherty said school districts receive an additional $6,000 to $7,000 in state aid for every student enrolled in a free or reduced-price lunch program.

Doherty was right that more education funding is allocated for students who receive a subsidized lunch. Though the amount of that funding varies by district, we think Doherty’s statement is on point.

We rate his claim Mostly True.

"['Social Security', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
In Reagan library speech, Marco Rubio takes on Social Security
","
Freshman U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., gave a highly anticipated and hyped address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Aug. 23, 2011, where Rubio continued his call for a smaller, fundamentally different and more conservative federal government.

Rubio was invited to speak at the library at the personal invitation of former First Lady Nancy Reagan, and Rubio entered the library to deliver his remarks with her on his arm. He joked it was just the second person he'd walked down the aisle with -- the first being his wife Jeanette. (Rubio also helped Reagan up when she stumbled.)

He addressed the crowd for more than 20 minutes, talking about his Cuban-immigrant roots, his experience coming of age during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, his belief in the American free enterprise system and his conviction that America can be both a prosperous and compassionate nation, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Rubio also argued how both Democrats and Republicans created programs and levels of spending that -- while well intentioned -- were doomed to fail from the start.

""You see, almost in forever, it was institutions and society that assumed the role of taking care of one another. If someone was sick in your family, you took care of them. If a neighbor met misfortune, you took care of them. You saved for your retirement and your future because you had to.

""We took these things upon ourselves and our communities and our families and our homes and our churches and our synagogues. But all that changed when the government began to assume those responsibilities. All of the sudden, for an increasing number of people in our nation, it was no longer necessary to worry about saving for security because that was the government's job.

""For those who met misfortune, that wasn't our obligation to take care of them, that was the government's job. And as government crowded out the institutions in our society that did these things traditionally, it weakened our people in a way that undermined our ability to maintain our prosperity.

""The other thing is that we built a government and its programs without any account whatsoever for how we were going to pay for it. There was not thought given into how this was going to be sustained. When Social Security first started, there was 16 workers for every retiree. Today there are only three for every retiree and soon there will only be two for every retiree.

""Program after program was crafted without any thought as to how they will be funded in future years or the impact it would have on future Americans. They were done with the best of intentions, but because it weakened our people and didn't take account the simple math of not being able to spend more money than you have, it was destined to fail and brought us to the point at which we are at today."" 
Rubio is suggesting that pre-government intervention with the creation of programs like Social Security and Medicare and welfare, people and private groups provided the same support. We're not going to attempt to check that fact, though we should note we're not necessarily agreeing to that point. According to the Social Security Administration, only about 15 percent of the labor force had any type of pension plan in 1932 and only about 5 percent of laborers actually received retirement benefits. During the height of the Great Depression over half of the elderly in America lacked sufficient income to be self-supporting, the federal government said. 
That out of the way, we wanted to check Rubio's example of the Social Security system, that the number of workers per retiree has dwindled from 16 to 1 when the program started to almost 2 to 1 today.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia examined a similar claim made by U.S. Sen Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia.

Experts they talked to said the best information comes from the Social Security Administration, the federal agency that administers the program. Social Security was created in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as part of his New Deal. The program has been amended several times over the years, which makes an apples-to-apples comparison somewhat problematic.

But on regurgitating the data, Rubio is largely correct. 
The first set of Social Security Administration data comparing the ratio of workers to retirees comes from 1945 (the first benefits were not paid out until 1940). In 1945, there were almost 42 workers per retiree. 
In 1950, after changes to the program expanded coverage to an additional 10 million Americans and improved benefits, there were 16.5 workers for each Social Security recipient. That's the number Rubio is citing and is supported by experts. 
By 2011, the worker-to-retiree ratio had dropped to 2.9 to 1. The ratio is projected to continue to shrink, to 2.4 workers per retiree in 2022 and 2.2 workers per retiree in 2027. 
We should note the workers-per-retiree figure shrunk quickly following 1950. By 1955, the ratio was down to 8.6 workers per retiree. By 1965, the ratio was 4 workers per retiree.

None of that speaks counter to Rubio's statement. In some ways, it illustrates the main problem with Social Security -- more and more money is going out in benefits and less and less money is coming in through payroll taxes.

Rubio said, ""When Social Security first started, there were 16 workers for every retiree. Today there are three workers for every retiree and soon there will be only two for every retiree."" The official numbers from the Social Security Administration back him up. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA77480>],/factchecks/2011/aug/24/marco-rubio/reagan-library-speech-marco-rubio-takes-social-sec/

Brazile said 53 percent of black wealth has disappeared in the downturn
","If some of President Barack Obama's supporters are irritated with him about jobs, it's understandable because the times are so hard, said Democratic strategist Donna Brazile on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.

Brazile was responding to a question about harsh words for Obama from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.

""The president has to do more than just run against Congress. He has to tell the American people that his administration has used every tool at their disposal to get job creation back on track,"" Brazile said. ""But over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared. The average -- for white families, the median income is $113,000. For black families, $5,000, $5,000. It has dropped.

""So these families are hurting. They want help. They want relief. They don't want to hear about Congress. They don't want to hear about the tea party. They don't want to hear another plan. They want jobs,"" she said. 

We decided to fact-check Brazile's statement that ""over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared."" We'll also explain her comment that ""for white families, the median income is $113,000. For black families, $5,000, $5,000,"" which actually has a critical slip of the tongue. She should have repeated the word ""wealth"" in place of ""income."" More on that in a bit.

Brazile's first number comes from a recent study by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan ""fact tank"" that provides information on demographic trends but does not take policy positions. A study from Pew's Social & Demographic Trends project released a report about racial disparities in family wealth on July 26, 2011.

That report analyzed data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), an economic survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. 

The Pew report analyzed household wealth, a very different measurement than income. ""Household wealth is the accumulated sum of assets (houses, cars, savings and checking accounts, stocks and mutual funds, retirement accounts, etc.) minus the sum of debt (mortgages, auto loans, credit card debt, etc.),"" the report states. ""It is different from household income, which measures the annual inflow of wages, interest, profits and other sources of earning. Wealth gaps between whites, blacks and Hispanics have always been much greater than income gaps.""

As you might be able to guess from that definition, home values are a critical component of household wealth, and plummeting home values were responsible for wiping out a good deal of household wealth. The Pew report specifically compared the data from the 2005 survey with a 2009 survey, the most recent data available.

From the Pew report: ""The Pew Research Center analysis finds that, in percentage terms, the bursting of the housing market bubble in 2006 and the recession that followed from late 2007 to mid-2009 took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites. From 2005 to 2009, inflation-adjusted median wealth fell by 66% among Hispanic households and 53% among black households, compared with just 16% among white households. As a result of these declines, the typical black household had just $5,677 in wealth (assets minus debts) in 2009, the typical Hispanic household had $6,325 in wealth and the typical white household had $113,149.""

For comparison, in 2005 the median black household wealth was $12,124; Hispanic household wealth was $18,359; and white household wealth was $134,992.

Brazile said that, ""Over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared."" The Pew report wasn't for the most recent four years, as Brazile's words imply, but for the period between 2005 and 2009. However, as we already noted, that is the most recently available data from the Census.

We're doing a fact-check on the 53 percent loss of black wealth claim, but we should point out that Brazile went wrong in her second statement -- ""for white families, the median income is $113,000. For black families, $5,000"" -- when she said ""income."" She should have simply repeated the word ""wealth.""

We're rating Brazile's statement, ""Over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared."" That is the percentage that the Pew report found, based on data collected by the U.S. Census. But the years in question were 2005 to 2009. So we deduct one notch off the Truth-O-Meter and rate Brazile's statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EADFCAC0>],/factchecks/2011/aug/24/donna-brazile/brazile-said-53-percent-black-wealth-has-disappear/
"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Jonathan Steitz']","
Republican candidate Jonathan Steitz says Democrats approved a budget that left the state $3 billion in debt
","
Gov. Scott Walker signed the 2011-13 state budget in June. But that didn’t stop the spending plan from playing a prominent role in the state Senate recall campaigns in August.

Republicans worked to paint their Democratic opponents -- the members of the Assembly running against GOP senators and Democratic senators defending their seats -- as reckless spenders who left a mess to be cleaned up. The refrain was that the Democratic lawmakers, along with former Gov. Jim Doyle, are to blame for the state being bankrupt or broke.

There were many variations of it, but one seemed worth visiting even though the recall elections are over. Why? Some claims have a way of being recycled for future campaigns.

The one we are looking at came in a radio ad by Republican Jonathan Steitz, who lost his bid to unseat Sen. Robert Wirch (D-Pleasant Prairie) in the Aug. 16, 2011 recall election

The ad said:

""Wirch voted to raise job-killing taxes by $4.7 billion, and voted for $3.6 billion in out-of-control reckless government spending ...  and after all those taxes and all that spending ...  Wirch left us with three billion in debt... only to flee to Illinois instead of staying to get the job done.""

Call it the $3.6 billion question. Or, in this case, $3.6 billion accusation.

We previously rated False a statement by state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) that Walker’s estimate of the budget deficit was a ""bogus figure."" We also found Doyle’s late 2010 estimate of the size of the deficit was False, in part because it included many assumptions about what Walker might do. And we found Walker’s statement that the state was ""broke"" to be False. (We’ve also ruled on several statements about the ""structural deficit"" -- an entirely  different matter.)

See what we mean about themes coming up again and again?

So, back to the claim: Did Democrats under Doyle approve a budget that left the state in debt?

Not a deficit. Debt.

The short answer is no. That’s not how the budget process works, said Robert Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The state constitution requires lawmakers approve a budget that’s balanced, and the budget that was passed for 2009-11 was no exception.

The $3.6 billion figure came about when the state budget office looked at the 2009-2011 budget, as plans were being readied for the next one (the 2011-13 budget). The report considers tax revenue projections and what agencies plan to spend in the next budget, and came up with what Lang termed a ""shortfall.""

To be sure, the calculation depended on which party is running the budget office.

In November 2010, the outgoing Doyle administration said the shortfall was $1.5 billion, which was far lower than the $2.7 billion figure used by candidates during the campaign for governor. In February 2011, Walker’s Department of Administration ran its own version of the numbers and concluded that the shortfall was $3.6 billion.

So what does that number represent?

""It’s a challenge,"" Lang said of the figure. ""The challenge for the 2011-13 budget was $3.6 billion.""

In other words, that was the amount -- through a combination of spending cuts, tax increases or other measures -- that the state budget would have to be adjusted to account for all of the department budget requests and the projected tax revenue.

One thing is clear: The $3.6 billion was not a debt, as Steitz claimed.

Debt is something that is owed, typically over the long term. Borrowed money, for instance.

The state did not borrow, bond or otherwise owe money to anyone because of the $3.6 billion. Other steps -- some very controversial politically -- were taken to address the gap.

Lang put it this way: ""We did not have a deficit, nor were we in debt.""

Lang noted that the shorthand for the shortfall, including in Journal Sentinel news accounts, was a ""deficit"" -- but rarely, if ever, a debt.

That brings us to the bottom line:

Steitz claimed that the 2009-2011 budget approved by Democrats created a $3.6 billion debt for Walker and the new Republican Legislature. Under the state constitution, the state budget has to be balanced. While some phrased the shortfall for the next two-year budget as a deficit, it certainly was not a debt. That comes with borrowed money that must be repaid.

We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFCB2C0>],/factchecks/2011/aug/24/jonathan-steitz/republican-candidate-jonathan-steitz-says-democrat/

Mike Villarreal says Texans earning minimum wage more than doubled with Rick Perry as governor
","
Among Democrats vowing to critique Republican Gov. Rick Perry’s record, state Rep. Mike Villarreal of San Antonio swiped at his stewardship of the state’s economy.

At an Aug. 6 rally outside the Texas Capitol, Villarreal first noted news stories on Perry’s ""D"" in an economics course at Texas A&M University. Perry’s college transcript was recently snagged by the left-leaning Huffington Post.

""But you know,"" Villarreal said, ""I have less concern about that ‘D’ than his record in the governor’s office. Before he took office, only 4 percent of our total labor force was a minimum wage job, 4 percent. Today, that number has more than doubled (to) 9.5 percent.""

The latter statistic immediately rang a bell; The Austin American-Statesman noted in a July 17, 2011, news article that Texas and Mississippi led the nation last year with 9.5 percent of hourly workers earning at or less than the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25. Hourly workers aren’t the entire labor force, which the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as adults who are working plus those lately looking and available for work.

The Statesman story says that according to the bureau, 550,000 Texans earned no more than the minimum wage in 2010, and the number of Texas workers earning the federal minimum wage or less was greater than the totals for California, Florida and Illinois combined. The story quotes Lori Taylor, associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, attributing the state’s lower wages to its having a younger, less educated workforce and a lower cost of living.

To support his claim, Villarreal pointed us to a March 28, 2011, post by the Bureau of Labor Statistics titled ""Minimum Wage Workers in Texas — 2010.""

The post says that nearly 5.8 million Texas workers were paid hourly rates in 2010, representing 55.7 percent of the state’s workers, compared with 58.8 percent nationally. A bureau economist, Steven Haugen, told us that most other workers are salaried, though some work on commission or do piece work. And, he said, the bureau doesn’t collect data on those workers’ pay rates.

The post includes a graph plotting the state’s share of hourly workers paid at or below minimum wage from 1997 through 2010.

Separately, regional bureau economist Cheryl Abbot sent us an easier-to-read breakdown showing that in 2000, which Perry mostly spent as lieutenant governor before being sworn in as governor, 5.8 percent of Texas hourly workers were paid at or below the minimum wage—not the 4 percent aired by Villarreal, though. In 2001, Perry’s first full year as governor, 4.2 percent of Texas hourly workers were paid at or below the minimum wage.

According to the bureau, the share of Texas hourly workers in that category reached 4.5 percent in 2003, then dropped to 3 percent in 2006 before increasing each of the four subsequent years, reaching 9.5 percent in 2010.

There’s a wrinkle in these percentage changes that we noted in a 2010 fact check. The federal minimum wage increased three times between 2001, when it was $5.15 an hour, and 2010 — rising to $5.85 in 2007, to $6.55 in 2008, and to $7.25 in 2009. These stair-step jumps brought some above-minimum wage jobs down into the minimum-wage-or-below fold.

For that article, Abbot told us that from 2006 to 2009, ""just over 300,000 more Texans"" entered the minimum-wage-or-less category. She said the bureau has ""no way of determining if those are actually 'new jobs' or, more likely, workers whose pay rate is now equal to or below the increased federal minimum wage.""

By email, Villarreal told us the wording of his rally statement was off. He said that if he’d said the percentage of hourly workers earning the minimum wage or less in Texas has doubled since Perry's first full year as governor, his ""point would have been the same, the audience would have understood the same idea, and the statement wouldn't be snagged on any technicalities.""

Asked why the governor is responsible for changes in the state’s share of minimum-wage hourly workers, Villarreal replied that Perry has taken credit for job creation in the state, so all jobs should be taken into account. He said he offered the comparison in arguing that Perry has not led Texas ""towards investing in the education and human capital needed to grow high-paying jobs.""

Our take: Villarreal’s statement wobbles in two important ways, first by saying the percentages apply to the total Texas labor force when they do not and second by understating the percentage of hourly workers paid at or below the minimum wage before Perry became governor; it was 5.8 percent, not 4 percent, though the share dropped to 4.2 percent his first full year as governor.

We rate Villarreal’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7BADC0>],/factchecks/2011/aug/24/mike-villarreal/mike-villarreal-says-texans-earning-minimum-wage-m/

Two protesters were killed and one injured when police say a counter-demonstrator opened fire two days later. Some Facebook users say demonstrators’ concern about the first shooting is misplaced.

Similar allegations about Blake have thousands of likes, shares and comments, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool owned by Facebook. (Screenshot from Facebook) There is no evidence that Blake is a ""child rapist,"" as the Facebook post claims. The post references an active arrest warrant for Blake and a 2015 article from the Racine County Eye, an online news outlet based directly north of Kenosha County. First, let’s take a look at the article — which is unrelated to the warrant. In September 2015, police arrested Blake after he pulled a gun at a bar in Racine, Wis. He was charged with one felony count of resisting arrest and ""one misdemeanor count each of carrying a concealed weapon, carrying a firearm while intoxicated, endangering safety-use of a dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct,"" according to the Racine County Eye. Blake was charged in Racine County Circuit Court, but the case is not listed in the state’s database of circuit court records. According to the website, felony and misdemeanor cases that were dismissed or acquitted only display in the database for two years after they were resolved. Now, let’s take a look at the warrant for Blake’s arrest. The warrant was issued July 7 in Kenosha. According to Wisconsin’s circuit court records database, Blake has been charged with one felony count of third-degree sexual assault and two misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing.  RELATED: What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting in Kenosha, Wis. All those charges are related to an alleged incident of domestic abuse that occurred May 3. The criminal complaint was filed July 6. According to Wisconsin law, third-degree sexual assault can include nonconsensual sexual intercourse or other sexual contact, such as ejaculation or urination. Sex with a minor is not listed as one of the offenses included in the charge. The Facebook post includes a screenshot of another legal definition of third-degree sexual assault: sexual penetration with someone between the ages of 14 and 16. That definition comes from Rhode Island’s criminal code, which does not apply in Wisconsin. The post is inaccurate.

The teen accused of killing demonstrators is not a police officer
","Update: After this story published, the Wisconsin Department of Justice provided an update into its investigation. Those details are now included in this report. Authorities have not revealed much since a white police officer in Kenosha, Wis., shot a Black resident named Jacob Blake, prompting several days of demonstrations punctuated by a deadly night of unrest. But after two people were shot and killed and a third was injured during protests over Blake’s shooting on Aug. 25, one social media post pulled together a couple threads from the rumors spreading on social media.  ""Come to find out the shooter last night is a…. COP?"" the post says. It shows two photos: one of a police officer wearing a helmet and the other of someone in a green shirt holding what looks like an assault-style weapon.    This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The first photo shows Rusten Sheskey, a Kenosha police officer who was profiled by Kenosha News in 2019 for his work as a ""bike cop.""  Some social media posts have also claimed that Sheskey is the officer who shot Blake. (The Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation said after this story published on Aug. 26 that Sheskey was the shooter.) However, Sheskey is not the person who has been arrested in connection with the shooting that left two people dead and another person injured.  That person is Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Ill., who police arrested on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide in connection with the fatal shootings.  When the Kenosha News story was published, Sheskey had worked as a police officer in Kenosha for six and a half years, and at a different department for three years before that.  Rittenhouse would have been about 8 years old, nine years ago.  The second photo that appears in the Facebook post was published by several news outlets including Yahoo News, which describes it as a ""screengrab of video of white shooter during Tuesday night’s protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake.""

In Mo. House race, Wagner cherry-picks votes to attack Schupp over sex offenders
","In a U.S. House race that’s considered a tossup, Missouri Republican Rep. Ann Wagner pummeled her challenger, Democratic state Sen. Jill Schupp, by alleging Schupp has voted repeatedly to support sex offenders. Wagner makes four specific claims about Schupp in a one-minute attack ad that began airing Aug. 16: That she ""voted no"" on a constitutional amendment to strengthen laws against child sex abuse. That she supported legislation that would have let sex offenders ""live near schools and roam freely on our kids' playgrounds.""’ That she voted to let sex offenders ""coach youth sports."" That she ""opposed efforts to deport convicted illegal immigrant sex offenders."" The votes, the ad concludes, amount to a ""disturbing pattern of putting sex offenders over our safety."" The Nov. 3 election between the St. Louis-area lawmakers is rated as a toss-up by the Cook Political Report.  In a news release responding to the ad, Schupp said that she has ""worked hard to keep sexual predators behind bars"" and that Wagner’s attacks ""distort my record and attempt to mislead the voters."" In claiming that Schupp has shown a ""disturbing pattern of putting sex offenders over our safety,"" the ad focuses on four votes, but ignores other legislative actions Schupp has taken against sex offenders. We’ll start with Wagner’s four claims from the ad, then look at four other legislative actions taken by Schupp. 1. Constitutional amendment  Voiceover: ""When a serial sex offender got away with raping a child, a bipartisan constitutional amendment was introduced to bring child sex offenders to justice. Missouri voters overwhelmingly passed the amendment. But Jill Schupp turned her back on victims and voted no."" Amendment 2, approved by voters in 2014 by a margin of 72% to 28%, allows ""relevant evidence of prior criminal acts, whether charged or uncharged, to be admissible,"" subject to court approval, in prosecution of sex crimes involving a victim under age 18, ""for the purpose of corroborating the victim's testimony or demonstrating the defendant's propensity to commit"" the alleged crime. Schupp, then a state representative, was among 23 Missouri House Democrats and three Republicans who voted no on putting the amendment on the ballot.  At the time, opponents argued that allowing evidence from cases where someone was not charged or convicted presumes suspects are guilty, and that the amendment did not limit the admissible testimony to cases of similar acts.  2. Bill affecting sex offender registry Voiceover: ""Schupp supported legislation that would have given hundreds of sex offenders a clean slate, letting them live near schools and roam freely on our kids’ playgrounds."" Text on the screen quoted then-Gov. Jay Nixon as saying that if the bill became law, as many as 870 sex offenders ""could be removed from the registry.""  The reference is to a 2013 bill, HB 301, which would have provided for anyone who was under 18 when convicted to be removed from the state’s sex offender registry. Offenders would have had to wait for five years until petitioning for removal, but courts would have been required to grant the petition.  Offenders on the registry face restrictions on where they can live and how far they must be from places such as playgrounds. Schupp voted for the bill, which would have applied to an estimated 870 sex offenders; it passed the GOP-controlled House unanimously and passed the Senate 28-4.  Supporters said the bill gave a second chance to offenders unlikely to reoffend, noting that they would still have been listed on the registry for law enforcement access and anyone from the public who requested the information. Nixon, a Democrat, vetoed it, saying it did not distinguish between relatively minor offenders and those who used force or violence in their crimes. 3. Coaching youth sports The voiceover says Schupp voted to allow hundreds of sex offenders ""to coach youth sports."" Text on the screen says: ""Schupp voted in favor of an amendment striking some language restricting sex offenders."" Schupp voted for an amendment to a 2009 bill. Wagner’s campaign said the amendment would have exempted sex offenders who were prosecuted and convicted in a foreign country from restrictions on coaching youth sports teams. The amendment struck some language restricting sex offenders from a bill that made several changes to the state criminal code, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Schupp argued that the amendment went beyond the legal scope of the underlying bill, the Missouri Times reported at the time. The bill went through several changes as lawmakers debated the legal scope of the provisions, and Schupp was among 124 House members who eventually voted for the final version, the newspaper reported. 4. ‘Illegal immigrant’ offenders  The ad claims Schupp ""opposed efforts to deport convicted illegal immigrant sex offenders.""  HB 731, a 2011 bill, would have required Missouri to add citizenship status to the sex offender registry and report names of those in the country illegally to federal officials for possible deportation. It passed the House, 130-23. The campaign claimed Schupp’s no vote would have made it more difficult to deport sex offenders who were in the country illegally after they finished serving their prison sentences. Opponents argued the bill was redundant, citing local law enforcement policies already in place, the Missouri Digital News reported at the time. Schupp’s campaign cited numerous other legislative actions she took regarding sex offenders, including these four: Schupp sponsored a bill, enacted in July, that requires Missouri hospitals to provide rape kits to sexual assault victims beginning in 2023. The kits allow health workers to collect evidence that can be used to find and prosecute the rapist. In 2012, Schupp co-sponsored HB 1470, which would have expanded the list of mandatory reporters — people in positions who are required by law to report suspected cases of child abuse or neglect. The bill did not come up for a vote in the GOP-controlled state House. In 2011, Schupp co-sponsored HB 433, which would have made it a more serious felony to engage in human trafficking, including for purposes of sexual exploitation. The bill did not come up for a vote. In 2009, Schupp co-sponsored HB 936, which would have removed the statute of limitations for sexual offenses for which DNA evidence of the perpetrator had been collected; and would have strengthened other measures regarding rape, including cases of statutory rape when the offender was at least three years older than a victim under age 17. The bill did not come up for a vote. Citing four votes taken by Schupp, a Wagner ad claims Schupp has shown a ""disturbing pattern of putting sex offenders over our safety."" The text of Wagner’s ad focuses on four votes, including Schupp’s opposition to putting on the ballot a constitutional amendment that allows prior conduct to be used as evidence in cases against some sex offenders. But in claiming a pattern, the ad cherry picks votes, ignoring a number of other legislative actions Schupp took to try to to strengthen laws against sex offenders. In all, Wagner’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA4A400>],/factchecks/2020/aug/26/ann-wagner/mo-house-race-wagner-cherry-picks-votes-attack-sch/

No, Nancy Pelosi did not pass a bill awarding a $9 billion contract to her husband’s company
","Did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi abuse her position by passing a bill that gave a $9 billion dollar contract to her husband’s company? That’s the claim of a viral Facebook post, which makes a series of baseless allegations next to a photo of Nancy Pelosi and her husband. It reads:  ""This is Paul Pelosi AKA Nancy Pelosis husband. He owns Financial leasing services L.L.C. a San Francisco Real estate venture capitalist firm. His net worth is a 120 million.

Her husband's firm. Why is this important? The commission's rate was set at 9%. That is almost a billion dollar contract."" Let’s tackle the claims one by one.  Nancy Pelosi’s husband Paul does own and operate Financial Leasing Services, a San Francisco-based investment firm. But that’s where the truth in this post appears to begin and end.  First, Nancy Pelosi hasn’t been an active member of the House Appropriations Committee for 18 years, Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill told us. As speaker, Pelosi doesn’t serve on any committees. ""This is all completely false,"" Hamill told PolitiFact.  Next, there is no evidence to support the assertion that Pelosi passed a bill to give her husband’s company a $9 billion contract to sell postal service property. The bill referenced by the post seems to have been made up. No such bill exists.  The post could be conflating Nancy Pelosi with Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., whose husband’s company received a contract to broker the sale of USPS facilities in 2011. The contract was scrutinized closely by news outlets, and people still occasionally post about it on Facebook. However, Snopes found that there was ""no proof [Feinstein’s husband or his company] had obtained or kept their contract with the USPS due to the influence of Sen. Feinstein.""  A Facebook post asserted that Nancy Pelosi used her position on the House Appropriations Committee to pass a bill giving her husband a $9 billion contract to sell Postal Service properties.  However, Pelosi hasn’t held a seat on the House Appropriations Committee for 18 years and no such bill exists.

Another widespread Facebook post spreads false claims about Joe Biden’s tax plan
","Another Facebook post is falsely claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, will hike taxes on Americans earning modest wages.  ""Say your bi-weekly gross salary is $3,000,"" the Aug. 23 Facebook post says. ""You are giving these sad sacks 39.6% which is $1,188. Nearly half your paycheck! Forget feeding your family after you’ve paid all your bills. Are you really okay with this?"" The post is inaccurate and the latest mischaracterization by conservatives and social media users of Biden’s tax plan. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In reality, a single worker making $3,000 every two weeks — or $78,000 annually — would not be paying 39.6% in federal income taxes under a Biden presidency.  The Facebook post includes a photo of a Fox Business Network segment on Sen. Kamala Harris, Biden’s running mate. The segment listed the tax ideas Harris pitched while running for president herself, including a proposal to raise the top individual federal income tax rate, which Biden has also made. It’s not clear when the segment aired.  But Harris didn’t propose such giant tax rate increases for lower earners as a candidate, and neither has Biden. Biden has vowed not to raise taxes for those earning less than $400,000 per year.  His plan aims to raise up to $4 trillion in tax revenues over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center, in part by rolling back some of the tax cuts for corporations and people with taxable incomes over $400,000 that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2017. Among Biden’s proposed changes, he would: Increase the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. Raise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37%. Place a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000. Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. Under current law, the top marginal federal income tax rate is 37%, which kicks in for income above $518,400 for individuals, according to the Internal Revenue Service. A 22% marginal tax rate currently applies to single filers for income over $40,125 and under $85,525. Several independent tax groups that have examined Biden’s tax proposals have estimated that after-tax income for some lower earners could slightly decrease. But those changes would not be the result of direct increases to their tax rates. Instead, tax analysts say the changes in after-tax income for lower earners would be mostly due to indirect effects on Biden’s raising of the corporate tax rate, such as lowered wages. ""No direct taxes are imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year,"" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in its analysis. One March analysis from the Tax Policy Center predicted that on average, the bottom 80% of earners could wind up paying between $30 and $590 extra annually on Biden’s watch. The report estimated that over 90% of the tax increases would be borne by the top 20% of earners. A Facebook post said Biden and Harris would raise the federal income tax rate for a person with a bi-weekly gross salary of $3,000 to 39.6%, costing ""nearly half your paycheck."" That’s wrong. The 39.6% rate is what Biden proposed for earners in the top income tax bracket, which the IRS says includes individual single taxpayers making more than $518,400 per year.  We rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8692C0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/26/facebook-posts/another-widespread-facebook-post-spreads-false-cla/

These texts are suspicious, but not tied to sex trafficking
","Security warnings that are circulating on social media give some good advice: don’t click on links in text messages from unknown numbers. But there’s another layer to the cautionary posts that stretches beyond the typical guidance.  ""I saw that if you get a text message like this that it’s used in sex trafficking,"" said one post being shared widely on Facebook. ""If you click the link it’ll allow them to track you."" It tops a screenshot of what appears to be a text message with a link that reads, ""We found a parcel from March pending for you. Kindly claim ownership and confirm for delivery here."" Other posts echoed that message and showed screenshots of similar text messages, each seemingly addressing the recipient by their name and each including a link. One post uses the #SaveOurChildren hashtag, which is linked to the unfounded QAnon conspiracy theory that there is a global child-sex trafficking ring involving Democratic politicians and celebrities who have been supportive of the party.  These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We didn’t find any evidence to support the idea that these texts, while suspect, are part of a sex trafficking scheme.  We reached out to Polaris, which seeks to end human trafficking and operates the National Human Trafficking Hotline, to ask about the claim. The organization told us in an email that it wasn’t aware of any situations that follow this pattern, though such warnings seem to pop up every few months.  ""Polaris always encourages the public to educate themselves and others on the issues of sex and labor trafficking,"" Polaris said in a statement. ""However, we strongly caution against spreading stories with potentially misleading information about human trafficking recruitment tactics as they may ultimately cause more harm than good."" The human trafficking hotline has helped Polaris understand how sex traffickers recruit victims, according to the organization. Traffickers commonly prey on a victim’s specific vulnerabilities and make promises aimed at addressing that person’s needs as a way to impose their control and ""they may establish strong psychological and emotional ties with their victims before forcing or coercing them to engage in commercial sex.""  The text messages that appear in the Facebook posts seem similar to a so-called ""smishing"" scam that received news coverage in January. Smishing combines SMS, aka a text message, and phishing. In the case of this particular smishing scam, people said that they had gotten texts purportedly from FedEx that asked them to click a link and set up delivery preferences.  The link led to ""an obviously-fake Amazon listing and asked to take a customer satisfaction survey,"" reported How-To Geek, a technology news site. ""As a thank you for answering some questions, you’re given the opportunity to claim an ‘expensive’ product for free as a reward."" The catch was that to claim this reward, you had to hand over your address and your credit card number to pay for shipping and handling.  ""The real scam resides in the fine print,"" How-To Geek said. ""By agreeing to pay the small shipping fee, you’re also signing up for a 14-day trial to the company that sells the scammy product. After the trial period, you will be billed $98.95 every month and sent a new supply of whatever item you claimed as a reward."" Al Pascual, chief operating officer and co-founder of Breach Clarity, which develops identity theft protection tools, told us that these kinds of messages aren’t unusual as scammers are broadening how they attack consumers. The texts in the Facebook posts, he said, ""would create little risk for ‘tracking’ the recipient because of the difficulty inherent in delivering and subsequently installing the necessary malware on mobile devices."" Rather, these kinds of messages are often designed to direct people to spam sites that sell goods or services or solicit personal information under false pretenses, Pascual said.  We recommend that anyone who receives these kinds of texts block the number that sent them.

Fact-checking Rand Paul on Joe Biden and support for wars
","Republican Sen. Rand Paul advocated for President Donald Trump’s re-election by portraying him as someone who wants to end wars and casting Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as someone ""who consistently called for more war."" ""Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War, which President Trump has long called the worst geopolitical mistake of our generation,"" Paul said Aug. 25 during the second night of the Republican National Convention. ""I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya."" Is the senator from Kentucky right about Biden’s record? Biden voted for a resolution that paved the way for the Iraq War, and for a non-binding resolution to authorize military air operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). The conflicts in Syria and Libya happened when Biden was vice president and followed the policies of President Barack Obama. This checks out. In 2002, President George W. Bush argued that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons, sought nuclear weapons, supported terrorism, and threatened peace. In October 2002, then-U.S. Sen. Biden voted in favor of a resolution that authorized Bush to enforce ''all relevant'' United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iraq and if needed, to use military force against Iraq. In a Senate floor speech before voting for the resolution, Biden said that ""failure to overwhelmingly support"" the resolution was ""likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur."" The objective of the resolution was to compel Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, Biden said. He left open the possibility that Hussein might ""miscalculate"" and ""misjudge"" U.S. resolve. In that event, use of military force might be needed, Biden said. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, and the war officially ended in late 2011. No weapons of mass destruction were found. In 2005, Biden was asked in an interview if his 2002 vote was a mistake. ""It was a mistake,"" Biden answered. ""It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. … We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan."" RELATED: Trump still wrong on his claim that he opposed Iraq War ahead of the invasion Serbia: Biden voted for a 1999 concurrent resolution authorizing President Bill Clinton to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), in cooperation with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. (Concurrent resolutions express the sentiment of Congress, but are not signed by the president and do not carry the force of law.) Clinton in March 1999 ordered air strikes in response to Yugoslavia’s campaign of violence against ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo. The Kosovo conflict erupted in the 1990s between two groups within the former Yugoslavia — Kosovars, who are primarily ethnic Albanians, and Serbs, who are of Slavic descent. The two groups long disputed the territory known as Kosovo. After greater Yugoslavia fractured in the early 1990s, the dispute over Kosovo became violent, pitting the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against the Serb-dominated government of what remained of Yugoslavia. Paul’s office referenced conflicts in Syria and Libya that started in 2011, when Biden was vice president. Syria: Syrians began protesting their government in early 2011, calling for political and social reforms and the ouster of their president. The protests prompted a violent response from the Syrian government. The conflict escalated as different groups within the country, foreign countries, and terrorists became involved. The United States since 2011 has called for Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad to step aside. The Obama administration in 2014 launched air strikes against the Islamic State in Syria and in 2015 deployed troops there to fight the terrorist group. Biden’s campaign said the Obama-Biden administration supported the Syrian opposition in a variety of ways, including by deploying U.S. forces to combat ISIS. Libya: The United States, as part of a NATO operation, provided air support in an intervention that resulted in the ouster of the country’s longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi. Obama said Gadhafi was launching military actions that were causing civilian deaths and forcing ordinary Libyans to escape to neighboring countries, threatening a humanitarian crisis within Libya and instability for its neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia. The U.S. military spent about $2 billion and several months backing the Libyan uprising against Gadhafi. The uprising — part of the Arab Spring — toppled Gadhafi in August 2011, and rebel forces killed him that October. Paul’s office sent us as a 2011 fact-check of Biden as evidence for his support of the U.S. intervention. In that fact-check, we examined Biden’s claim that in Libya, ""America spent $2 billion total and didn’t lose a single life."" We rated that Mostly True. (The fact-check did not focus on Biden’s own position on the issue.) Biden’s campaign, however, pointed to a 2016 Politico report that referenced an interview Biden gave to journalist Charlie Rose in which he said that intervening in Libya was wrong. The Politico story said that Biden told Rose that he had ""argued strongly"" within the White House ""against going ... to Libya."" Politico reported that Biden in that interview also said the United States should not use force unless the interests of the country or its allies are directly threatened, whether it can be done ""efficaciously"" and whether it can be sustained. Paul said Biden, ""Voted for the Iraq war … He supported war in Serbia, Syria, Libya."" Biden as a senator voted for resolutions that supported interventions in Iraq and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). As vice president, he followed the policies of the Obama administration, which included interventions in Syria and Libya. Biden’s campaign said that Biden as vice president supported going into Syria, but pointed to 2016 reporting that said Biden within the White House argued against intervention in Libya. Paul’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Biden says Trump wants to cut local law enforcement aid. That’s correct
","On the opening day of the Republican nominating convention, a frequent refrain was that Democratic nominee Joe Biden wants to defund the police. The attack is inaccurate. In a June op-ed in USA Today, Biden wrote that ""the better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms."" After securing the nomination, Biden was asked by ABC News if he wanted to defund the police. ""No I don’t,"" Biden said Aug. 23. He then pivoted to President Donald Trump. ""By the way, he proposes cutting a half a billion dollars of local police support,"" he said. Trump is running as the law-and-order president, and cutting police support would seem inconsistent with that. We asked the White House press office staff about the charge and they sent us to the Trump campaign, which said Biden was exaggerating. They also sent us material showing cuts that happened during the Obama-Biden administration. But Biden was talking about what Trump is proposing to do today, and the best place to resolve the accuracy of that lies in the latest budget documents. Based on a broad definition of support for local law enforcement, Biden has a point. At the Justice Department, support for state, local and tribal law enforcement flows through the Office of Justice Programs. Or, to be totally accurate, that’s how the administration would like it to be after some program reshuffling. Congress has the final word, but we’re focused on the administration’s budget proposal, since that is what Biden was talking about. In its budget plan for fiscal year 2021, the Justice Department proposed funding state and local law enforcement through more than 75 different programs. In FY 2020, Congress appropriated $1.89 billion through these programs. In FY 2021, the Trump administration requested $1.51 billion — a reduction of $380 million. (Practically speaking, the cut is $280 million because $100 million of the reduction is related to security for the Republican and Democratic political conventions. That money wouldn’t be needed in FY 2021.)  In addition, the Trump budget proposed a separate $170 million cut and reorganization of a community policing initiative, Community Oriented Policing Services, that dates back to the days of President Bill Clinton.  After all the moving around of programs, the net reduction is $515 million. (The numbers get tricky because the COPS money shows up in the FY 2021 total.) The biggest caveat to Biden’s number isn’t so much the dollar amount as the programs those dollars pay for. The more than 75 programs in the state and local law enforcement category cover a lot of ground. ""The State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance programs largely consist of grant funding to support non-federal law enforcement, though some programs support other entities and tangentially support law enforcement through outcomes like crime prevention and improved administration of justice,"" said Maureen Q. McGough with the Policing Project at NYU School of Law. Funding goes to uses as diverse as body cameras on police, veterans drug abuse courts, offender re-entry training, and anti-human-trafficking efforts. People often lump the Office of Justice Programs together as aid for law enforcement, but law professor Rachel Harmon at the University of Virginia suggests a broader definition. ""It might be better to call them public safety resources because some of the programs fund goals, such as improving juvenile indigent defense, that contribute to justice and public safety, but do not directly benefit law enforcement agencies,"" Harmon said. Both Harmon and McGough said it is challenging to tease out the parts that aid local enforcement. Biden said that Trump proposes cutting half a billion dollars from local police support. According to the Trump administration’s budget requests, Biden’s number is about right.  The biggest area of interpretation is what counts as local police support. There is no question that Trump proposed a $170 million cut for the program that subsidizes community police initiatives, Community Oriented Policing Services. Beyond that, the Justice Department offers a wide range of programs. Some provide direct aid to local law enforcement, but some do not. One expert we reached said most of these programs do provide direct aid. Another said they all aim to advance public safety at the local level.

St. Louis couple who aimed guns at protesters makes false convention claim about Joe Biden, suburbs
","A Republican National Convention speaker falsely claimed that the Democratic Party under Joe Biden would ""abolish the suburbs altogether by ending single-family zoning."" That’s not true. The claim came from Patricia McCloskey, a St. Louis lawyer who, along with her husband, Mark, is facing felony charges for pointing guns at protesters marching outside their home. Addressing the convention from inside their house by video, the couple warned about ""radical Democrats’ America."" ""They are not satisfied with spreading the chaos and violence into our communities, they want to abolish the suburbs altogether by ending single-family home zoning,"" Patricia McCloskey said Aug. 24 during the convention’s opening night. ""This forced rezoning would bring crime, lawlessness and low-quality apartments into now-thriving suburban neighborhoods.""  ""President Trump smartly ended this government overreach, but Joe Biden wants to bring it back,"" she continued. ""These are the policies that are coming to a neighborhood near you.""  McCloskey’s claim is inaccurate. It echoes statements President Donald Trump has made about an Obama administration regulation related to discrimination in housing, the requirements of which Trump’s administration initially suspended in 2018. Trump recently repealed the rule. Biden, the former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed reinstating President Barack Obama’s policy, which required that certain jurisdictions work with the federal government to proactively examine housing patterns and make plans to deal with any discriminatory effects.  But it’s an extreme interpretation to say doing so would amount to ""abolishing the suburbs"" or ""forced rezoning."" Fact-checkers at CNN, NBC News, the New York Times and FactCheck.org reached the same conclusion. ""This is a red herring, pure and simple,"" said Robert Silverman, a professor or urban and regional planning at the University of Buffalo. ""Zoning is a local function in the United States, and the suggestions made in the McCloskeys’ speech are patently false."" ""The McCloskeys' claim is wrong on pretty much every count,"" added Jenny Schuetz, a fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program. We contacted the Trump campaign and the McCloskeys’ attorney about Patricia McCloskey’s claim. We received a brief emailed reply from Mark McCloskey: ""Google it."" The subject line in McCloskey’s reply: ""Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing."" The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule is a clause in the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibited discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, family status or national origin. The clause required the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other federal agencies to ""affirmatively further"" fair housing in their programs and activities. Prior to 2015, HUD required local jurisdictions receiving funding from the department to identify barriers to fair housing, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.  One example of a barrier would be an exclusionary zoning law that allowed only detached, single-family homes to be built on large lots, said Schuetz, the Brookings Institution’s fellow. But while HUD encouraged those jurisdictions to report their findings publicly and to federal government officials, it did not require them to do so. A 2010 report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found that some localities were not preparing their reports at all, or not updating them regularly, as was recommended under HUD guidance.  In 2015, the Obama administration reinforced the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing clause by making the reporting process more rigorous.  His administration’s changes to the rule asked jurisdictions receiving HUD funding to use data and tools provided by HUD in identifying barriers; set goals and strategies for overcoming those barriers; and submit publicly accessible reports to the department for approval. Biden has pledged on his campaign website to bring those changes back and ""ensure effective and rigorous enforcement of the Fair Housing Act."" But doing so would not force suburban areas to rezone or replace single-family homes with affordable apartments, as Patricia McCloskey claimed. As FactCheck.org first noted, HUD explicitly said that would not happen when it published its final rule in 2015. ""This rule does not impose any land use decisions or zoning laws on any local government,"" the rule said. ""Rather, the rule requires HUD program participants to perform an assessment of land use decisions and zoning to evaluate their possible impact on fair housing choice."" ""There is no mechanism in the AFFH rule to force rezoning,"" said Silverman, the University of Buffalo professor, adding that the rule has no ""top-down mandates for zoning changes."" If Biden restores the Obama-era changes, localities will again have to periodically assess their fair housing barriers and make recommendations to fix them, Silverman said.  ""Those recommendations would be generated locally, and any implementation of them would go through existing policy making processes used by local governments,"" he said. Schuetz agreed: ""AFFH doesn't ‘end’ single-family-exclusive zoning, or ‘force’ communities to build apartments. It just requires them to identify whether those barriers exist, and develop a plan to address them as part of a larger housing plan for the community."" Not all suburbs would feel the impact, Schuetz said. And they certainly wouldn’t be abolished.  In sum, McCloskey’s claim was ""highly misleading,"" Schuetz said, and it ""reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule works."" Patricia McCloskey said Democrats and Joe Biden ""want to abolish the suburbs altogether by ending single-family home zoning."" That’s an extreme interpretation of Biden’s proposal to reinstate an Obama administration requirement related to addressing discrimination in housing.  Under the Obama administration’s 2015 change to the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, localities receiving HUD funding were required to work with the federal government to identify barriers to fair housing and come up with strategies for dealing with them.  Experts said restoring that regulation would not force those jurisdictions to rezone or build low-income housing. It certainly wouldn’t spell the end for the suburbs.

Misleading ad in Montana Senate race casts Steve Daines as soft on drug companies
","Money is pouring into Montana as outside groups seek to influence the U.S. Senate race between Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock and Republican Sen. Steve Daines. One of these groups on the Democratic side skewers Daines in a Facebook ad for being generous to Big Pharma.  ""Daines voted to give billions in tax breaks to big drug companies even as they raised prices,"" the ad claims. The ad was made by Duty and Honor, a nonprofit affiliated with the Democratic-backed Senate Majority PAC. To maintain its nonprofit status, Duty and Honor can’t endorse a particular candidate. But in running ads harshly critical of Daines, it’s clearly trying to hurt his re-election chances.  The ad gives a misleading impression that Daines voted for a tax break tailored to big drug companies. The ad’s fine print gives us a clue about what Daines really voted for: the Republican-backed tax law signed by President Donald Trump.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made the largest single reduction in the corporate tax rate in U.S. history. It lowered taxes on corporations, small businesses, and most Americans. The law also reduced taxes on overseas profits, and it allowed overseas profits from earlier years to be repatriated after a one-time charge.  Daines joined Republican senators in voting for the final version of the tax plan. No Senate Democrats supported it. The ad doesn’t mention the benefits of the law for small businesses and the average taxpayer. At the same time, the bill did give ""big drug companies"" billions of dollars in tax breaks.  Pharmaceutical companies profited from the drop in the overall corporate tax rate. And since 10 of the top 30 companies with the biggest offshore holdings are biopharma companies, they also benefited disproportionately from the favorable treatment of repatriated overseas profits. Biopharma Dive, a business journalism outlet, reviewed regulatory filings of the 11 biggest drugmakers and found that the tax law shrunk their payments by nearly $4 billion. The ad claims that Daines helped the drugmakers while they were raising prices.  ""In general, companies have continued to raise list prices for brand name drugs faster than inflation,"" Stacie Dusetzina, associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt, told PolitiFact. However, this does not necessarily mean that prices have gone up. Drug prices fluctuate based on availability and the types of rebates pharmacy benefits managers negotiate.  On average, list prices — the cost that wholesalers pay to manufacturers — went up 7% in 2018. Prices after rebates and discounts (net prices) went up 2.1% that year. The numbers indicate that prescription drug prices increased overall the year the tax cuts passed. The ad also doesn’t mention that Daines supports legislation aiming to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In 2019, Daines voted in committee for the bipartisan Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act, which seeks to drive down drug prices through rebates. In an email interview, Duty and Honor spokesperson Matt Corridoni acknowledged that Daines has voted to lower drug prices, but noted that he ""voted against multiple amendments in committee that would have made the legislation stronger in terms of going after the drug companies on pricing."" The Daines campaign didn’t respond to our request for comment.  The ad claims Daines ""voted to give billions in tax breaks to big drug companies even as they raised prices."" Daines voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered tax rates and provided billions in tax relief to powerful drug companies. The missing context from the ad is that the law did not single out those companies in particular. Rather, it reduced taxes for the vast majority of Americans, small businesses, and the corporate sector.

Nikki Haley's False RNC claim that Biden wants 'massive' tax hikes on working families
","Speakers on the first night of the Republican convention criticized Democratic nominee Joe Biden on one of the foundational issues of the GOP: taxes. ""They want massive tax hikes on working families,"" said Nikki Haley, the former Republican governor of South Carolina and ambassador to the United Nations, of the Biden-Kamala Harris ticket. Haley’s charge stood in sharp contrast to Biden’s statement to ABC News’ David Muir a day earlier, when he said that ""no new taxes"" would be imposed on anyone making under $400,000. The Trump campaign pointed to one video clip in which Biden said that the ""first thing"" he will do in office is repeal the GOP tax cuts. However, that’s not his official campaign proposal. Biden’s changes would repeal provisions in President Donald Trump’s tax law for taxpayers earning over $400,000. Specifically, Biden would: Increase the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%; Raise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6%; Place a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000; Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. Independent tax analysts side with Biden’s characterization of his plan. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that’s hawkish on the federal budget deficit, has confirmed that no direct taxes would be imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year. Households below $400,000 a year could face small income losses indirectly, largely from the portion of higher corporate taxes that companies pass along to their workers through constraints on compensation. The group concluded that ""overall, Biden’s tax plan would make the tax code more progressive, with the vast majority of increased tax burdens and the entirety of direct tax increases falling on high-income households."" The group summarized four independent assessments of how Biden’s tax plan would affect members of the lowest, second-lowest, middle, second-highest, and highest income quintiles. The four analyses were conducted by the American Enterprise Institute, the Tax Foundation, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, and the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.  As the chart indicates, the lowest 80% of the income spectrum would register small income losses as a result of Biden’s tax proposal, typically about one-half of 1% of income, or in the range of a couple hundred dollars. For instance, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis, the lowest income group would see their incomes drop by $30; the next would see a drop of $110; the middle would see a drop of $260; and the second-highest, with incomes up to $170,000, would see a loss of $590. By contrast, the top one-fifth of earners would face a significantly bigger hit — a loss of somewhere between 2.3% and 5.7% of after-tax income in 2021. And the top 1% of earners would take the biggest hit of all, between 13% and 17.8% of after-tax income. Haley said Biden and Harris ""want massive tax hikes on working families."" Independent tax analysts agree that the Biden plan would not directly raise taxes on any household earning below $400,000 a year, and it would pose small hits from the indirect impact of raising the corporate tax rate. The vast majority of the income losses from the Biden tax proposal would fall on the top one-fifth of incomes, and especially on the top 1%. All in all, the indirect tax hikes on ""working families,"" such as they are, are not ""massive.""

No, Melania Trump didn’t remove roses from every first lady since 1913
","First lady Melania Trump is expected to deliver her Republican National Convention speech from the White House Rose Garden on Aug. 25, just days after the renovations she directed in the historic garden were revealed.  Not everyone was thrilled with the results of the month-long project.  ""Melania dug up the WH Rose Garden, removing roses from every First Lady since 1913,"" one Facebook post said. ""She is as clueless and classless as her husband."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reached out to the White House about the post and did not receive a reply. But a landscape historian we consulted about its claim laughed and said, ""People say the most outrageous things.""  Here’s what we know about the Rose Garden.  First lady Ellen Wilson planted a rose garden in 1913, but its official name at the time is unclear, according to the White House Rose Garden Landscape Report published this year by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. In the second half of the century, ""Rose Garden"" started to appear more frequently, but it was used interchangeably with ""West Garden."" The Rose Garden that Americans are familiar with today reflects the 1962 design of Rachel Lambert Mellon, who was approached by President John F. Kennedy to help renew the space after he was inspired by the gardens he saw at official residences on a state visit to Europe.  ""The garden had a simple plan,"" Mellon wrote in a 1983 essay posted on the White House Historical Association’s website. Saucer magnolia trees were planted in the garden’s four corners. A 50-by-100-foot lawn that could accommodate 1,000 people for ceremonies and receptions would be the garden’s center. Flanking the lawn: smaller trees, roses and other flowers.  ""The one flower that unites all occupants through the history of the White House is the rose,"" the essay says. ""Thus, for most of the 20th century, the Rose Garden has been a rose garden. Now, in 1961, President Kennedy wanted it restored in spirit but revised to become more than just a private garden."" The Trump administration’s overhaul was done in the spirit of the garden’s 1962 design, according to USA Today. The flowers in the garden are mostly pastels and include taller white roses in honor of the first papal visit to the White House in 1979. Boxwoods were added, crabapple trees were removed to be replanted elsewhere, and a limestone walking path now borders the central lawn. Speaking at the official reopening of the Rose Garden on Aug. 22, Melania Trump said improvements to the garden’s infrastructure and utilities would make it fully accessible to Americans with disabilities.  She also said that changes to the garden resulted from ""a thoughtful and collaborative process carefully crafted with the help of scholars and experts in architecture, horticulture, design, and historic preservation.""  Drawing from sources like newspaper articles and contemporaneous accounts, the Rose Garden Landscape Report lists 58 different roses that have been grown at the White House over the years, from the Cleveland administration to the Obama administration. The first documented, large scale plan of roses planted in the garden dates back to the Truman administration in 1952. There isn’t even a definitive rose planting plan for the Kennedy Rose Garden, according to the report, and ""records are scarce"" for plantings in the years after until the Carter administration. That was when the National Park Service started producing reports listing changes to the White House Grounds and Gardens, including the roses grown and their location in the garden.  ""These reports, along with the scattered knowledge of roses grown previously at the White House, offer a glimpse into changing fashions and tastes in American gardens for roses,"" the Rose Garden Landscape Report says. As the Washington Post reported in July, Melania Trump’s plans for the Rose Garden included the removal and replacement of most of the existing plants and lawn. But Adrian Higgins, the Post’s gardening columnist, writes that ""the renovation is long overdue."" ""Among the problems to be addressed,"" he wrote, ""a poorly drained lawn that had to be replaced annually, constant disturbance of roots of trees and shrubs by the seasonal planting of annuals, the die-off of rose bushes to the point where only a dozen or so remained."" Roses are ""fussy,"" said Marta McDowell, a landscape historian who wrote ""All the Presidents’ Gardens,"" a 2016 book about White House gardens. ""They don’t last forever — plants are living things — and so sometimes they do need to be replaced.""  When Kennedy and Mellon redesigned the garden in 1962, for example, the roses from previous first ladies were largely gone because they died off or had been replaced, McDowell told us.  ""Most of these were long gone by the time the Trumps moved in,"" McDowell said. Our ruling The Facebook post claims Melania Trump removed the roses planted by her predecessors going back to 1913. That’s wrong. Over the years, roses have both died and been replaced as different administrations have left their mark on the White House Rose Garden. Only about a dozen rose bushes remained before this most recent renovation.

"['Michigan', 'Paul Junge']","
Fact-check: Junge says Slotkin voted against condemning Chinese cyberattacks. That’s not true.
","Paul Junge, the Republican nominee running to unseat incumbent Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly, wrote a Facebook post criticizing Slotkin for failing to support action on Chinese cyberattacks targeting American companies and researchers working to develop vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus. ""She voted against condemning cyber attacks by the Chinese Communist Party on American organizations developing COVID-19 treatments,"" Junge claimed. Slotkin, a former national-security aide to presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, won election in 2018 in a traditionally Republican district in Southeast Michigan. She is fighting a challenge from Junge, a former prosecutor and TV anchor. Junge is referring to a resolution introduced by Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., condemning the cyberattacks and calling on the administration to punish those engaged in the attacks through sanctions. During debate on whether to take up a major infrastructure bill, Rep. Robert Woodall, R-Ga., attempted to force the House to begin considering Kinzinger’s resolution instead. That’s where Slotkin joined Democrats and voted to begin considering the infrastructure bill. Junge’s claim interprets Slotkin’s vote on a procedural move as a vote against the resolution condemning the cyberattacks. But there was no vote on Kinzinger’s resolution. What did the House vote on? In May, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued a public warning that hackers linked to China are engaged in cyberattacks to steal information from American research institutions and pharmaceutical companies working to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Russian hackers are also attacking universities, companies and other entities working conducting research on a coronavirus vaccine, federal officials have warned. Kinzinger, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, responded to these warnings with a resolution condemning the attacks. The House has yet to take a vote on it. President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have stepped up their attacks on China as they hone their messages for the fall campaign. On June 30, the House considered a resolution to take up the Moving Forward Act, a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill authorizing funds for federal highway, road safety and transit programs. The bill includes $300 billion for fixing roads and bridges and provides funding to states to expand broadband access. It also includes several water-quality provisions of particular interest to Michiganders, including reauthorizing the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. During debate on the House floor, Rep. Robert Woodall, R-Ga., promised to offer an amendment that would have forced the House to immediately consider Rep. Kinzinger’s resolution condemning Chinese cyberattacks. The House then took a vote on whether to end debate on taking up the infrastructure bill. In this case, voting against ending debate would have delayed consideration of the Moving Forward Act and allowed Rep. Woodall to offer his amendment to consider Rep. Kinzinger’s resolution. New York Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle, who introduced the resolution to consider the Moving Forward Act, noted his support for ""any resolutions on Chinese and Russian interference in American activities,"" adding, ""the work in front of us, however, is a $1.5 trillion transportation bill desperately needed for American citizens throughout this country."" The House cast a party-line vote to begin debating the Moving Forward Act, which passed the next day and is awaiting a vote in the Senate. As a result of this vote, Kinzinger’s resolution did not come up for consideration that day. Junge, as well as stories from The Washington Free Beacon and The Federalist, claimed that the House’s vote was a rejection of Kinzinger’s resolution. Slotkin ""voted against considering a condemnation of Chinese cyber attacks,"" said Rob Wagener, Paul Junge’s campaign manager. She ""could have demonstrated some of the moderation she promised"" by voting against moving forward with a debate on the infrastructure bill ""but she didn’t."" Slotkin’s campaign defended her move to keep the infrastructure bill on track. ""There is no reason to choose between confronting China's malign cyber activity and fixing our roads and bridges,"" said Gordon Trowbridge, Slotkin’s campaign spokesperson. Soon after the Free Beacon and Federalist reports, Slotkin was among only 14 Democratic lawmakers to support returning the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 back to the Committee on Armed Services to add an amendment authorizing sanctions against foreign actors conducting cyberattacks on organizations and people engaged in coronavirus research. The motion failed, and the law passed the House without any such amendment. Our ruling Junge claimed that Slotkin ""voted against condemning cyber attacks by the Chinese Communist Party on American organizations developing COVID-19 treatments."" Slotkin did not vote for or against the Kinzinger resolution to condemn Chinese-linked cyberattacks. That resolution did not come up for a vote. The vote was on moving forward with consideration on an infrastructure bill. Weeks later, she voted for a measure authorizing sanctions for cyberattacks on coronavirus researchers, but it did not pass. Junge’s post is not accurate.

Joe Biden gave his convention speech live. Rush Limbaugh’s claim that it ‘had to be taped’ is wrong
","Former Vice President Joe Biden capped off the virtual Democratic National Convention on Aug. 20 with a nearly 25-minute speech delivered live to a room of reporters, camera crews, campaign staffers and Secret Service agents at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del. In the days since, radio host Rush Limbaugh and other conservative media personalities have falsely claimed that Biden’s speech was pre-taped and edited to remove any mess-ups. ""Some people are of the opinion that it had to be taped and that it had to be taped in segments, and the segments had to be edited together because (Biden) is not capable of 22 minutes even reading a prompter with no screw ups,"" Limbaugh said Aug. 21 on his radio show.  ""This is the prevailing theory,"" Limbaugh added, claiming that he knew some ""professional video people"" who were studying the footage for evidence that it had been recorded in advance. Similar claims have spread widely on Twitter and Facebook. The Facebook posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claims are inaccurate. Biden’s speech was carried live by several cable and broadcast TV channels, streamed live by multiple news organizations, and attended live by dozens of people.  ""There were roughly three-dozen reporters, a skeleton camera crew, a handful of Secret Service agents and a smattering of campaign staff,"" ABC News reporter John Verhovek wrote in a report describing what the experience was like for the reporters who were in the room. Verhovek described receiving two negative COVID-19 tests and going through a ""security sweep, temperature check and 45-minute wait"" before entering the ""cavernous room"" with ""a massive camera set up pointed directly at a wooden podium.""  Joe Biden is shown from above as he speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 20, 2020, at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del. (AP) Some supporters of the Democratic presidential nominee watched the speech from their cars as it was displayed on a screen in a nearby parking lot. Verhovek tweeted out photos and lines from Biden’s speech as he spoke, as well as a video of Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, interacting with supporters afterward through video feeds. Other reporters have also tweeted proof that they were inside the venue, including Buzzfeed News’ Ruby Cramer, the Washington Post’s Annie Linskey, the New York Times’ Katie Glueck, the Wall Street Journal’s Ken Thomas, the Daily Beast’s Hanna Trudo, CNN’s Sara Mucha, the Atlantic’s Edward-Isaac Dovere, and CBS News’ Bo Erickson. One widespread tweet making the false claim that Biden pre-recorded his speech came from John Cardillo, a conservative media personality and former New York City police officer.  Cardillo shared three photos of Biden. Two were taken during Biden’s speech. The third was snapped later, while Biden and Harris were outside for the fireworks display.  Cardillo wrongly claimed that Biden was wearing a pin in the first two photos but not in the third photo, and a wristwatch in the third but not in the first two. He cited that as evidence that Biden’s speech must have been pre-recorded in multiple segments that were later stitched together.  But the photos Cardillo plucked out were cherry-picked and misleading. The same argument — and photos — formed the basis of similarly inaccurate claims on Facebook. Video footage of Biden outside with Harris for the fireworks shows him wearing the very same pin that Cardillo claimed had disappeared from his suit. And the watch, which was clearly visible when Biden and Harris joined arms outside and raised them, was likely hidden beneath Biden’s sleeve for most of the speech, when his arms weren’t outstretched in the same way. At one point during the speech, the watch on Biden’s wrist could briefly be seen glimmering under his sleeve. It was also visible for a moment after the speech as Biden, Harris and their spouses waved to supporters shown on a video wall behind the podium.  Between the speech, the interaction with supporters on screen, and the walk outside for the display of fireworks, Biden’s outfit never changed. (He did put on a mask before going outside.) Limbaugh did not respond to a request for comment. Limbaugh said Biden’s convention speech ""had to be taped in segments, and the segments had to be edited together."" The nearly 25-minute speech was continuous. It was carried live on TV stations, streamed live online and delivered live for a room of reporters, camera crews, campaign staffers and Secret Service agents in Wilmington.

QAnon hoax has been linked to violence. Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld falsely claimed it hasn’t
","QAnon, the sprawling and baseless internet conspiracy theory labeled by the FBI as a potential domestic terrorist threat, has on several occasions been linked to real-world violence. Fox News host Greg Gutfeld falsely claimed in a recent episode of ""The Five"" that it had not.  ""QAnon violence! There is none,"" Gutfeld said, while laughing and clapping, during an Aug. 20 exchange with co-host Juan Williams. ""That’s funny. You are hilarious."" In reality, the QAnon hoax has been connected to several incidents of violence or threatened violence. Gutfeld is wrong to say that ""there is none."" Gutfeld’s comment came one day after President Donald Trump demurred when he was asked for his thoughts about the conspiracy theory, telling a reporter who asked about the movement during a press conference that he had heard QAnon followers ""are people that love our country"" and ""like me very much."" The once-fringe conspiracy theory has expanded its influence since the start of the coronavirus pandemic by pushing miracle cures and misinformation. Supporters of QAnon believe or promote the belief that a cabal of Democrats and celebrities are Satan-worshipping pedophiles operating a global child sex-trafficking ring, and that Trump is leading a covert effort to stop them. The QAnon hoax takes its name from a user on the online forum 4chan, known as ""Q,"" who claims to be an anonymous government official. Q’s cryptic posts beginning in 2017 set in motion a wide-ranging conspiracy theory embraced by Trump supporters.  Since then, QAnon symbols and paraphernalia have been spotted at Trump rallies and events. Trump has also amplified QAnon Twitter accounts and lent support to QAnon followers running for Congress, including Republican House candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene in Georgia.  On some occasions, the hoax has helped spur its followers to violence. Kathryn Olmsted, a history professor at the University of California, Davis, and the author of a book on conspiracy theories in American politics, said Gutfeld’s QAnon claim has ""no foundation."" ""It’s a theory about a deep-state coup against the president,"" Olmsted said. ""If its adherents truly believe the theory, it’s not surprising that they might turn to violence to stop the conspirators."" Fox News did not respond to requests for comment. The FBI named QAnon specifically in a May 2019 intelligence bulletin produced for distribution among intelligence and law enforcement agencies that described ""conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists"" as a growing threat in the U.S. The document was obtained by Yahoo! News. The memo detailed multiple cases in which violent incidents or the threat of violence inspired by QAnon and other conspiratorial beliefs led to arrests. ""The FBI assesses these conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace, occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts,"" the memo said. West Point’s Combating Terrorism Center, an academic institute within the United States Military Academy, also cited a number of examples of violence related to QAnon in a July report.  ""QAnon has contributed to the radicalization of several people to notable criminal acts or acts of violence,"" the report said. Facebook, which recently joined other social media platforms working to crack down on QAnon content when it removed hundreds of groups that had promoted the conspiracy theory, cited the discussion of potential violence among those groups as reason for their removal.  ""We have seen growing movements that, while not directly organizing violence, have celebrated violent acts, shown that they have weapons and suggest they will use them, or have individual followers with patterns of violent behavior,"" Facebook said in the statement. The FBI memo and the Combating Terrorism Center report both logged multiple instances where QAnon beliefs were connected to real-world crime, as have news outlets and activist groups such as the liberal research organization Media Matters for America.  Those incidents of violence, potential violence or criminal activity include: In June, a Massachusetts man led police on a chase through Massachusetts and New Hampshire with his five children in the car. In a live-stream Facebook video of the event, the man discussed QAnon conspiracies. In April, an Illinois woman was arrested in New York City for driving onto a pier with a car full of knives in an apparent attempt to reach a Navy hospital ship housing COVID-19 patients. In a live stream of her travels, the woman threatened to kill Joe Biden over claims of sex trafficking. She also posted about QAnon on Facebook before the incident. In March 2019, a New York man killed Francisco Cali, a member of the prominent Gambino crime family. The man said the CIA had infiltrated the Mafia. The incident came after the man requested the arrest of several high-profile Democrats. He supported QAnon and during one court appearance scrawled ""Q"" on the palm of his hand.  In January 2019, a Seattle man was arrested for allegedly killing his brother with a sword. The man posted about QAnon on social media, the Daily Beast reported. In June 2018, a Nevada man in an armored truck blocked traffic on a bridge near the Hoover Dam, demanding the release of a government document and fleeing after a standoff with police. Law enforcement found weapons in his car. The man discussed QAnon beliefs after his arrest and cited them in letters he wrote from jail. In May 2018, the leader of an unofficial local veterans aid group falsely claimed that he had discovered a child sex trafficking ring at a homeless camp in Tucson, Arizona. He referenced QAnon as he and armed group members searched for other camps. He was later arrested for stealing and damaging water tanks belonging to a humanitarian group. QAnon has also been associated with various threats and other crimes, including vandalism. There have also been violent incidents related to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which has been largely subsumed into QAnon. Supporters of the Pizzagate theory also believe a child sex trafficking ring is being run by Hillary Clinton and other Democratic officials.  One armed man entered a Washington pizzeria in 2016 to investigate the baseless theory; another man motivated by conspiracy theories started a fire at the same pizza joint in 2019.  People may question whether QAnon caused the acts or was offered as a rationale after the fact, said Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor and the author of a book on American conspiracy theories. But it’s wrong to say that there’s been no violence related to QAnon, he said. Gutfeld said, ""QAnon violence! There is none."" In fact, there have been a handful of examples. The FBI identified QAnon as a potential terrorist threat in a May 2019 memo that listed some incidents of violence or threatened violence associated with the hoax and others like it. News reports, activist groups and an academic institute have also highlighted examples of violence.  And two experts on American conspiracy theories said Gutfeld’s claim is wrong. We rate this statement False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC129C0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/24/greg-gutfeld/qanon-hoax-has-been-linked-violence-fox-news-greg-/
