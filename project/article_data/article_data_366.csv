Anti-Rubio group says Rubio thinks troops are coming out of Iraq ""too fast""
","
A website created by Florida progressives is attacking Sen. Marco Rubio's positions on women's rights, government spending, immigration, Social Security reform and more, pointing out apparent contradictions and allegedly unethical behavior.

WrongWayRubio.com, a joint project by Progress Florida and Florida Watch, also takes issue with his foreign policy, a particularly important focus for a potential Republican vice presidential nominee. The site provides terse commentary on several issues, allowing readers to tweet the statements -- and the website's source material for the claim -- through their own Twitter accounts.

One of these tweetable missives reads, ""Rubio says troops are leaving decade-old war 'too fast'."" It refers to Rubio's reaction to President Obama's military exit from Iraq last year.

Among many negative claims about the senator, that one caught our attention: What was Rubio's position on the end of the Iraq War?

WrongWayRubio.com provides links for each of its tweets, so the first thing we did is click the link. It sends readers to a clip of Rubio on Fox News' Studio B, discussing Obama's drawdown of armed forces from Iraq on Oct. 21, 2011. Obama announced that day U.S. forces would leave the country by the end of the year, which they did on Dec. 15.

Right away, there is a difference between what Rubio said and what WrongWayRubio.com implied. What we found didn’t seem to support the tweet’s claim.

""Here's my fear,"" Rubio told acting host Trace Gallagher, ""my fear is that if the pull out happens too fast, Iran and their surrogates are going to come in there and take over and start exerting influence and creating havoc for us.""

Rubio was speaking there in hypothetical and not declarative terms. That means we had to dig deeper to see where the senator really stood on the withdrawal.

Rubio has made foreign policy a major focus of his time in the Senate, and he’s been making major speeches on America's role in the world since last year.

He has focused primarily on United States policy in Latin America, Europe, and Central and East Asia. But he has used Iraq and the Middle East as examples of a region requiring stronger American involvement.

""It has been suggested that the advice of military commanders in Iraq be completely ignored in favor of a dramatic troop drawdown that even Iraqis say is too drastic,"" Rubio said in a speech in Wingate, N.C., on Sept. 13, 2011.

He chided some of his contemporaries as doing only what is ""politically self-serving,"" and not in the best interests of the country. ""America, and the entire world for that matter, needs resolute leadership in this era of historic but volatile transformation, particularly in the Middle East and particularly in Iraq.""

Military involvement in foreign affairs has been a recurring theme in his speeches -- he mentioned the necessity of intervention in Egypt, Libya and Afghanistan, saying about the latter, ""even the slightest impression that the U.S. is looking to get out is devastating.""

We also found a more specific statement Rubio about Iraq. On Oct. 21, 2011 -- the same day as Rubio's Studio B appearance -- Rubio issued an official statement expressing disappointment in the drawdown Obama had just announced.

""I am disappointed that U.S. and Iraqi governments could not agree on a framework that would have allowed several thousand U.S. troops to stay in Iraq to combat Al Qaeda in Iraq and continue the training mission that is vital to Iraq’s future,"" he said in the statement. ""I urge the Administration not to allow today’s announcement to become an obstacle to further negotiations on an enduring security relationship with Iraq. We should remain open to renewing discussions to bring back a robust U.S. force at the Iraqi government’s request that can do counterterrorism and support the Iraqi Security Forces.""

That seems to be drawn-out politispeak saying, in essence, U.S. forces are leaving too soon.

Our ruling

The statement from WrongWayRubio.com reads, ""Rubio says troops are leaving decade-old war 'too fast'."" But the message offered a news story as evidence that doesn’t prove the point.  

Still, when we looked more broadly at Rubio’s public statements on Iraq, we found the tweeted message did accurately summarize the views he had in September 2011. During a recent foreign policy speech, Rubio didn’t mention Iraq, but we found nothing to indicate Rubio has changed his mind.

Given Rubio's stated views -- that U.S. forces should remain in Iraq to provide stability --  we rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2012/may/08/wrongwayrubiocom/anti-rubio-group-says-rubio-thinks-troops-are-comi/

Is John Ludlow the only candidate in the race to refuse to join PERS and can he?
","
Wilsonville businessman John Ludlow is in a four-way race for Clackamas County Commission Chair in next week's election. He says that he is the only candidate in the race ""who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System.""

Is he the only candidate in the race to make such a promise? Perhaps just as important a question: Are elected officials even able to decline joining the retirement system?

The Public Employees Retirement System is a hot-button issue with critics who claim it eats way too much money, hurting taxpayers to benefit public employees. The retirement program is open to participating employers, from the state of Oregon to school districts and cities.

We turned to Paul Cleary, the retirement system's executive director. He pointed to Oregon Revised Statutes 238A.100 (2): 
  
A person who is elected or appointed to an office with a fixed term ...may elect not to become a member of the pension program by giving the Public Employees Retirement Board written notice not later than 30 days after taking office. 

The trick here, says Cleary, is that for a person to decline membership, that person cannot have been a PERS member, ever. Ludlow is a former Wilsonville city councilor and served as Wilsonville’s mayor from 1989 to 1991, but received no retirement benefits from his time in public office.

Ludlow, 63, says he has never been a member of PERS, and the Public Employees Retirement System confirms he is not a member.

The other Clackamas County commission chair candidates are members of the Public Employees Retirement System. They are county Chairwoman Charlotte Lehan, county Commissioner Paul Savas, and state Rep. Dave Hunt. They cannot opt out. Savas said he never knew he could decline to join.  

He is the only candidate who will refuse, and who can refuse, to join PERS. We expect Ludlow to keep his promise if he wins, and we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2012/may/08/john-ludlow/john-ludlow-only-candidate-race-refuse-join-pers-a/

Barack Obama says Mitt Romney's tax plan gives millionaires an average tax cut of $250,000
","President Barack Obama has repeatedly argued that his Republican rival Mitt Romney is pursuing policies that favor the rich. Recently, Obama offered a specific claim about how wealthier Americans would benefit from Romney’s tax plan.

In a May 5, 2012, campaign speech in Columbus, Ohio, Obama said, ""My opponent won’t tell us how he’d pay for his new, $5 trillion tax cut -- a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country.""

We wondered whether Romney’s tax proposal really would be so generous to millionaires. (The Romney campaign didn't respond to our inquiry for this story.)

First, some background on what Romney is proposing. Here are some of key elements of his plan, according to the campaign’s website.

For individuals:

• Cut marginal rates by one-fifth on a permanent, across-the-board basis
• Eliminate interest, dividend, and capital gains taxes for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income below $200,000
• Eliminate the estate tax
• Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax

For corporations:

• Cut the corporate rate to 25 percent
• Make permanent the research and development tax credit
• Switch to a territorial tax system
• Repeal the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax The Romney campaign's website states that lowering both individual and corporate tax rates will stimulate economic growth. High tax rates ""discourage work and entrepreneurship, as well as savings and investment,"" the website states. ""With 54 percent of private sector workers employed outside of corporations, individual rates also define the incentives for job-creating businesses. Lower marginal tax rates secure for all Americans the economic gains from tax reform.""  And in a speech on March 30, 2012, Romney affirmed his plan to cut taxes for everyone: ""Taxes should be as low as possible, in line with those of competing nations, and designed to foster innovation and growth. That's why I will cut marginal tax rates across the board. "" For an independent assessment of Romney’s plan, we turned to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a think tank that, among other things, evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. While judging tax proposals is subject to some degree of interpretation, the Tax Policy Center has a significant degree of respect in tax circles.

The Tax Policy Center looked at two versions of Romney’s tax proposal. We will use the analysis of the more recent of Romney’s two plans, which the group published in March 2012.

Before we look at the center’s analysis, we should note that the group ran two sets of numbers. One version, known as ""current law,"" essentially gives Romney credit for extending the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and for an annual adjustment in the Alternative Minimum Tax. Under this calculation, taxpayers’ savings from these two extensions are added to the total tax cuts from Romney’s tax proposal itself.

The other version, known as ""current policy,"" assumes that the Bush and AMT tax cuts will be extended, with or without Romney. This method only counts the taxpayer savings from the new proposals in Romney’s tax plan  -- a smaller amount of tax savings than Romney would see under the ""current law"" calculation.

It turns out that the ""current policy"" calculation is the one that backs up Obama’s claim. The Tax Policy Center found that under Romney’s proposal, people with $1 million or more in annual cash income will receive an average tax cut of $250,535. Those in the millionaire category will receive an 11.8 percent increase in after-tax income, easily the highest of any income group. Collectively, the tax savings for millionaires would amount to nearly one-third of all the tax benefits that result from Romney’s plan.

The ""current law"" analysis shows even bigger gains for millionaires. By this method, the average tax cut for someone with cash income north of $1 million a year would be $390,876, according to the Tax Policy Center.

And the higher you go on the income scale, the bigger the tax cuts become. Under the center’s more restrictive ""current policy"" method, the top one-tenth of 1 percent of taxpayers -- those earning $2,868,534 a year -- would get an average tax cut of $725,716. That accounts for 19.4 percent of all the tax cuts’ benefits. Our ruling

Even using the more restrictive of the Tax Policy Center’s two calculations, Romney’s tax plan would save millionaires almost exactly what Obama said -- $250,535. We rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2012/may/08/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mitt-romneys-tax-plan-gives-mill/

Senator praises Reagan-era Social Security reform to push for bipartisanship
","
U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, bemoaning the lack of bipartisanship in Congress, recently told a story to emphasize the benefits of Democrats and Republicans working together.

The Georgia Republican went back to the early 1980s to make his case, saying today’s Congress should take a similar approach of rising above politics to address major fiscal challenges such as the increasing costs of Medicaid and Medicare.

""What I always found is if you look back at [former Republican President] Ronald Reagan and [former Democratic House Speaker] Tip O’Neill, they raised the Social Security age, made some significant changes back there,"" Chambliss said last month at the Atlanta Press Club. ""Boy, everybody thought that’s the political end of that Congress. Every single member of the House of Representatives who voted for that change got re-elected because they did the right thing. I just think if you do the right thing, the political side of things will take care of itself.""

PolitiFact Georgia was there for the senator’s speech and the question-and-answer session, where he made this particular claim. We wanted to find out whether Chambliss was right or was this a political tall tale.

Chambliss is a member of the Senate’s ""Gang of Six,"" a group of three Republicans and three Democrats that has tried to come up with federal budget solutions. The senator has taken much criticism for his participation in the effort, primarily from fiscal conservatives for his position on some ideas to reduce the nation’s multitrillion-dollar debt.

Senate leadership, Chambliss said, hasn’t taken kindly to the group’s work because of -- surprise! -- politics. The ""hard, tough votes"" on some of these issues might hurt the future ambitions of some senators, Chambliss said.

Reagan, considered by some as the father of modern conservative politics, was no fan of the Social Security system, which he saw as government run amok. When Reagan took office in 1981, federal economists warned that the system was in financial peril because of the steadily increasing number of senior citizens eligible for benefits and projections that more Americans would become future recipients. The president tried to overhaul the system.

Reagan’s first plan got not one vote in the Senate, and the Democratic-led House voted against it as well. Reagan then created a bipartisan commission led by future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to come up with solutions to keep Social Security solvent. O’Neill, a liberal from Massachusetts, appointed some members to the commission. The eventual compromise included increases in Social Security tax rates, increased benefits for disabled widows and, most importantly, a gradual increase in the eligibility age to 67 by the year 2027.

The Social Security Administration’s website has a list of how each member of Congress voted on the changes in March 1983. Overwhelming majorities of House and Senate members across party lines voted in favor of the changes.

But did each member who voted ""Aye"" on the legislation get re-elected the following year, as Chambliss said?

No, according to a tally by the federal government of 1984 congressional election results.

Ten House members lost in 1984 despite voting to pass the Social Security overhaul. The list included Elliott Levitas, a DeKalb County Democrat who lost to Republican Pat Swindall.

Levitas, now a senior counsel in the Atlanta offices of the law firm Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, said he pushed for Social Security reform and recalled voting in favor of changes to maintain the system’s  viability. He said it wasn’t a factor in his 1984 defeat. Reagan was. The president was re-elected in historic fashion that year (Reagan won 49 of 50 states) and had strong coattails that analysts say helped many Republicans win congressional contests in 1984.

""[The Democratic ticket] was not wildly popular in this area, and Reagan was,"" Levitas said.

In fact, all 10 House members who voted in favor of the Social Security overhaul and lost their re-election bids were Democrats. Chambliss press secretary Lauren Claffey noted that when we asked her office about the veracity of her boss’ claim. She said the senator was close; about 95 percent of the 243 House members who voted for the overhaul were re-elected.

""Although not every single member that voted for Social Security reform was re-elected, it is safe to say that an overwhelming majority of those who voted for the reform were, and supports the point that Sen. Chambliss was making that ‘if you do the right thing, then the political side of it will take care of itself,’ "" Claffey said via email.

This was a tough call for PolitiFact Georgia.

Chambliss wasn’t precisely correct when he said ""every single member"" of the House who voted for the overhaul was re-elected. But his overall point was correct -- most lawmakers who voted for changes to Social Security were re-elected. Nearly all of them.

Our rating: Half True.

"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Mike Foley']","
Mike Foley says Ohio gives tax breaks to rich people who own jets
","
Ohio law contains 128 tax breaks that cost the state about $7 billion per year in lost revenue it otherwise would collect, according to the Department of Taxation.

State Rep. Mike Foley, a Democrat from Cleveland, wants to close some of these loopholes so the state has more money for schools, safety forces and other local government services.

Foley co-sponsored a bill in February to establish a committee that would review the state’s tax exemptions every two years. More recently, he tried to get approval for his plan by adding it to a broadly supported general tax bill, House Bill 508, under consideration in the House of Representatives on April 25.

Foley said during a floor speech that tax exemptions need to be reviewed because some of them are ""fairly silly,"" such as a sales tax exemption related to private jets.

""I don’t think we need to be giving exemptions to rich people who own private jets,"" Foley said. ""We’re giving tax breaks to guys that own private jets – that doesn’t make any sense.""

Foley’s statement hits on individual tax burdens, a frequently discussed political topic that resonates with many voters. So PolitiFact Ohio decided dig into Foley’s claim.

Foley’s office provided us with a handful of documents to back up his claim, including a tax expenditure report presented in March 2011 by the Ohio Department of Taxation.

But before we examine the report and whether it supports Foley’s claim, let’s look into how these tax breaks work.

Here is the Taxation Department’s explanation:

""Tax expenditures represent tax dollars that are foregone through deductions, exemptions, credits, and other provisions in tax laws,"" the tax expenditure report says. ""Tax expenditures result in a loss of tax revenue to state government, thereby reducing the funds available for other government programs. In essence, a tax expenditure has the same fiscal impact as a direct government expenditure.""

Among the tax exemptions in the report is one for people  who buy a share of a private jet, or what is called a ""fractionally-owned aircraft.""

This particular tax break was passed in 2003 as part of the state budget.

It does have some limitations. It was crafted to apply only to those who do business with qualified companies that provide fractional ownership of private jets. Qualified companies would operate at least 100 aircraft and meet other criteria.

The tax break does not apply to individuals who buy their own private jet.

Foley did mention fractional ownership at another point during his floor speech: ""If you won a fractional or some other sort of ownership of a private jet, then we’re giving you an exemption on your taxes.""

The tax loophole caps sales tax at $800 for the sum of shares of a fractionally owned jet. Fractional owners are charged a fraction of the $800 that corresponds with their ownership stake. So if somebody owns one-eighth of the jet, he would pay $100 in sales tax.

There are only two companies in Ohio that fit the requirements as a qualified company for this exemption, according to the Department of Taxation. That means only people who buy their fractional ownership from one of these two companies qualify for the tax break.

The department, however, would not disclose those companies because ""the law prohibits disclosure of almost all information on specific taxpayers,"" taxation department spokesman Gary Gudmundson said in an e-mail.

Although the state would not say which two companies qualify for the exemption, NetJets and Flight Options are two prominent fractionally owned aircraft companies based in Ohio.

When lawmakers debated the merits of the tax break in 2003, a fractional-ownership company reported that its average share cost was $1.2 million, according to a Department of Taxation analysis of this tax expenditure produced in Jan. 2011. The analysis did not name the company.

The taxation department last year estimated in its tax expenditure report that the tax break for fractionally owned aircraft costs the state about $1 million a year.

So what does all this mean for Foley’s claim?

There is no doubt that a tax loophole exists for people who buy a stake in a private jet.

A listener hearing Foley’s quip about tax breaks for rich people buying private jets could believe he was referring to anyone who buys a private plane. The tax break, however, only applies to fractional ownership programs. That’s additional information that provides clarity. And to his credit, Foley did mention fractional ownership at a different point in his speech on the House floor.

And the average share price previously reported -- $1.2 million – suggests the tax exemption would be available wealthy people, just as Foley claimed.

Mitt Romney says creating 500,000 net jobs a month is historically 'normal'
","
With the economy struggling to recover from the last recession, the monthly job reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics have become key opportunities for both parties to spin the results to their advantage.

And right on cue, the release of the most recent statistics on May 4, 2012 -- showing a gain of 115,000 jobs over the previous month -- prompted politicians and their allies to pounce.

Shortly after the numbers for April 2012 were released, Mitt Romney went on Fox News to offer commentary. He told Fox & Friends co-host Gretchen Carlson, ""We should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month. This is way, way, way off from what should happen in a normal recovery.""

We decided to look at two parts of this comment. Is creating 500,000 jobs in a recovery ""normal""? And are the job creation figures under President Barack Obama ""way, way, way off from"" whatever the normal amount is?

We’ll take these two issues in order. (The Romney campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this story.)

Is 500,000 jobs created per month normal for a recovery?

The short answer is ""no.""

We arrived at this conclusion by looking at the net monthly change in jobs all the way back to 1970. Since Romney was referring to total jobs, rather than private-sector jobs only, we used total jobs as our measurement. And since Romney was talking about job creation patterns during a recovery, we looked only at job creation figures for non-recessionary periods, as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Finally, we excluded the current recovery.

The totals below refer to the percentage of months that produced job creation totals in the given ranges over the 386 non-recessionary months since 1970:

500,000 jobs or more per month: 1 percent of months
400,000 to 499,999 jobs per month: 5 percent of months
300,000 to 399,999 jobs per month: 17 percent of months
200,000 to 299,999 jobs per month: 29 percent of months
100,000 to 199,999 jobs per month: 23 percent of months
0 to 99,999 jobs per month: 15 percent of months
Negative jobs created in a month: 10 percent of months

Given these statistics, we think it’s hardly ""normal"" during a recovery to create 500,000 jobs in a month -- it only happened 1 percent of the time. Nor for that matter is it ""normal"" to produce 400,000 jobs or 300,000 jobs in a month -- the median is somewhere in the low 200,000 range.

So on this point, Romney is wrong.

However, we also decided to run a set of numbers adjusted for the size of the labor force. Due to population growth and changing patterns of employment, the labor force has almost doubled since 1970. For this calculation, we looked at how common it was to reach a lower job-creation threshold that approximated what 500,000 jobs would be today. Here’s what we came up with.

300,000 jobs or more per month in the 1970s: 35 percent of months
400,000 jobs or more per month in the 1980s: 6 percent of months
400,000 jobs or more per month in the 1990s: 5 percent of months
500,000 jobs or more per month between 2000 and 2007: Level never reached

So, even during the decade with the most robust job growth, the 1970s, it was not ""normal"" to reach a threshold that’s analogous to today’s 500,000 jobs created per month -- it happened about one-third of the time. And in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, it was even less common -- the likelihood of reaching an analogous threshold was never higher than 6 percent.

All told, then, Romney is exaggerating ""normal"" job creation for a recovery.

Is job creation under Obama ""way, way, way off"" from the normal amount?

It depends on what you consider the ""normal"" amount.

Let’s first compare Obama’s record to what happened in all recoveries between 1970 and 2007.

During the 34 non-recessionary months on Obama’s watch, the median monthly change in jobs has been 110,000, which is approximately half of what it was between 1970 and 2007. And even if you adjust for the severity of the last recession by starting the count in January 2010 -- a year after Obama took office -- the median job increase becomes 120,000. That’s not much of an improvement.

As we‘ve already noted, the median job increase in previous recoveries is in the low 200,000s. But Obama’s median job increase is 110,000. So Romney is correct when he notes that job growth is not matching the pace of previous recoveries during the past four decades.

But by another comparison, Obama does better. If you compare Obama’s record to that of his most immediate predecessor -- President George W. Bush -- Obama’s median monthly job growth exceeded Bush’s, which was 95,000.

How good do the job-creation numbers need to be?

Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, said the economy needs roughly 90,000 to 100,000 new jobs every month to keep up with the growth in the working age population.

""If job growth exceeds that threshold, we’re making progress toward bringing employment up to the full-employment level,"" Burtless said. (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

Burtless said that if you set a target unemployment rate of 4.5 percent (the current rate is 8.1 percent) and aim for a similar labor participation rate to the pre-recession level of 2007, ""it would be truly excellent – though improbable – if we could add 500,000 jobs a month. But adding 200,000 a month would probably satisfy the electorate, and adding 300,000 a month is not out of the question.""

Our ruling

Romney has a point that job creation under Obama has fallen well short of historical medians, at least going back to 1970. But job creation under Obama has exceeded the levels achieved during the George W. Bush administration. And Romney’s claim that 500,000 jobs a month is ""normal"" is way off. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/may/07/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-500000-net-jobs-month-historicall/
"['Children', 'Education', 'Florida', 'Rudy Moise']","
Rudy Moise says the congressional district for Miami-Dade and Broward counties has a dropout rate of ""almost 61 percent""
","
Rudy Moise, a Democrat running for Congress in South Florida, says his district ""is going in the wrong direction.""

He cites some troubling statistics on his campaign website:

""We're No. 2 in crime in the state. Unemployment is at 17 percent amongst minorities in my district. And we are losing our future with a staggering high school drop-out rate of almost 61 percent.""

The figure that caught our eye was the double-digit dropout rate.

Moise will face Democrat U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Miami Gardens, in the primary. (Wilson now represents Congressional District 17, but as a result of redistricting they will face off in District 24.)

First, some background about the race between Moise, a Haitian-American doctor, and Wilson, an African-American former state legislator.

The district largely lies in Miami-Dade County and includes a slice of Broward County. About 59 percent of the district is black or African-American. The Census also shows that within the district, about 11 percent were born in Haiti.

Haitian-Americans had hoped to win this seat in Congress in 2010 when U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek left to run unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate. But the Haitian community didn’t coalesce behind one candidate, and four Haitian-American candidates ran in a crowded primary, with Moise earning the most votes among the Haitian candidates. 
Moise’s 2012 bid drew attention in April when Haitian president Michel Martelly urged Haitian-Americans living in the district to vote for Moise.

Moise’s claim about dropout rates doesn’t mention Wilson, a former Miami-Dade school board member and principal who founded a dropout prevention program about 20 years ago.

Moise points to report on black males

When we asked Moise’s campaign for evidence, they pointed us to a report by the Schott Foundation about black males and education for 2007-2008. The Florida report shows graduation rates for black males by county and state: 27 percent in Miami-Dade, 39 percent in Broward and 37 percent in Florida.

Moise’s campaign took those rates and subtracted from 100 and got the ""almost 61 percent"" dropout rate. That works on pure math, though some educational experts say the dropout rate isn’t simply the inverse of the graduation rate.

More significantly, the number only counts the dropout rates for black males compared to white males. So that rate leaves out other students, including females.

PolitiFact examined the Schott report for a previous claim by state Rep. Stephen Wise, R-Jacksonville, about the gap in graduation rates between black and white boys. Michael Holzman, a research consultant for the Schott Foundation, told the Tampa Bay Times he simply divided the number of standard diplomas awarded in 2008 by the number of students who entered high school four years earlier. The calculation does not include people who obtained a GED.

Miami-Dade had the seventh-lowest graduation rate among the 59 districts examined while Pinellas, Palm Beach and Duval fared worse.

Pinellas officials criticized the Schott report, saying that the formula it used was oversimplified, and, among other shortcomings, did not account for students who transferred away from the district.

Calculating dropout rates tougher than it sounds

There are other ways to calculate the dropout rate, as our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas and PolitiFact National have shown in previous fact-checks.

""A dropout rate seems like it should be the most intuitive thing in the world, but it’s not,"" said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education who specializes in comparative statistics. ""There are almost as many ways of calculating state dropout rates as there are states.""

One way to calculate it is to track individual students as they progress from freshman year of high school until graduation. This provides the most accurate data, but tracking students this way requires a lot of effort, so many school districts do not do it.

An alternative is to track the decline in enrollment between freshman year and graduation. This is known as the AFGR, or averaged freshman graduation rate. It's much easier to do -- and it's the most consistent ""apples to apples"" statistic across the 50 states -- but it is undermined by a greater risk of error.

That's because this method does not necessarily distinguish between students who actually dropped out and those who left for other reasons, such as moving to another state or graduating early or late.

Students who leave for other reasons can be excluded, but this is not always done, and not doing it tends to inflate the apparent number of dropouts. Standardization mandated by provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act has reduced these errors over time, but the statistics are not yet perfect, our experts said.

The real dropout rates

So what are the dropout rates for Miami-Dade and Broward?

One measure Florida uses is the National Governor’s Association, or NGA, which counts standard and special diplomas as graduates but excludes GEDs and students who transfer to adult education.

These graduation rates are based on a cohort: it is the percentage of students who graduate within four years of their first enrollment in 9th grade.

In Broward County in 2010-2011, about 76.5 percent graduated with a standard diploma within four years, 3.3 percent dropped out at anytime during the four years and 20.2 percent were listed as ""not graduating."" Students are listed as ""not graduating"" if they need a fifth year or received a certificate of completion, for example, which means they didn’t meet all the requirements for a diploma.

In Miami-Dade County, those figures were 77.7 percent graduating, 6.8 percent dropping out and 15.4 percent not graduating.

(Starting in 2010-11, all states had to start calculating the Federal Graduation Rate, which is the most restrictive measure. This rate counts as graduates only recipients of standard diplomas, not special diplomas for students with disabilities or GEDs. The federal graduation rate for Broward was 71.6 percent and in Miami-Dade it was 71.3 percent, but the data we saw didn’t show figures for dropouts or other in-between categories.)

Although the inverse of the graduation rate isn’t the dropout rate, those students who don’t get a diploma within four years are at risk of dropping out, said Thomas C. West, an affiliated researcher with the Everyone Graduates Center at John Hopkins University.

""They are not with their peers,"" he said. ""Something has gone wrong.""

Both Miami-Dade and Broward sent us data showing the single year dropout rate per high school in the school districts. The majority of the high schools had dropout rates in the single digits. But both had some schools with double-digit dropout rates -- typically these were smaller schools that served targeted populations such as special needs, teen parents or students who had left school in the past. 

The Moise campaign responds

When we told Moise’s campaign about our conclusion, campaign manager Willis Howard said they would change the claim on the website to refer to black boys. 
He said that it’s important to talk about graduation and dropout rates for black students because of the demographics of the district: ""We are talking to predominantly black folks. … We’ve got to bring some light to we have an outrageous amount of dropouts in this district and South Florida and we’ve got to figure it out.""

Our ruling

Moise said that his district has a ""staggering high school dropout rate of almost 61 percent.""

Moise points to a report about graduation rates from the Schott Foundation which provides some interesting data. But we have several problems with it as it relates to Moise’s dropout claim.

• Most critically, Moise's claim is based on a measurement for black males. We saw nothing in his comment to indicate he was talking about male dropouts only.

• Also, the number is based on 2007-2008 data even though data is available from 2010-2011.

• The number subtracts graduation rates from 100 percent and concludes that the rest are dropouts. This leaves out some categories such as students who need a fifth year to graduate.

• Finally, the data is for the entire Broward and Miami-Dade school districts, not the congressional district, which includes only portions of those districts

Moise didn’t explain these caveats on his campaign website when he made his claim. He erred by trying to boil down a complex area of data into a single phrase about dropout rates that requires far more explanation and more thorough data. We rank this claim False.",/factchecks/2012/may/07/rudy-moise/rudy-moise-miami-dade-broward-drop-out-rate/
"['Crime', 'Texas', 'Jana Duty']","
Jana Duty says John Bradley hands off 36 percent of felony cases to be tried as misdemeanors by her office
","
In Williamson County, north of Austin, the elected county attorney is challenging the district attorney in the May 2012 Republican primary, saying he’s not so tough on crime.

An April 15, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story quotes Jana Duty criticizing the share of cases District Attorney John Bradley has sent her way. ""He reduces 36 percent of his felony cases to misdemeanors and passes them on to me,"" she said.

Refresher: A felony is an offense, as in murder or burglary, of graver character than a misdemeanor, which is a minor offense.

The Statesman article quotes Bradley as saying that plea bargains are a common practice and that his office resolves many low-level offenses by getting defendants to plead guilty to misdemeanors handled by the county attorney in the county court-at-law.

So, does Bradley reduce 36 percent of his felony cases to misdemeanors?

Not exactly, Duty conceded when we inquired, adding that contrary to what she told the newspaper in an emailed response, she typically says 36 percent of cases that start as felonies in the district attorney’s office are either dismissed outright or reduced to misdemeanors entrusted to prosecution by the county attorney’s office.

Duty offered as an example of her usual comment on the topic her written April 17, 2012, reply to a question from the Community Impact newspaper. Asked why she’s running for district attorney, Duty’s reply says, in part, that Bradley ""reduced or dismissed  36 percent of his felony cases to misdemeanors and passed them off to my office.""

For the Statesman article, Duty responded to a reporter’s question about whether she had ever prosecuted a felony by saying she has prosecuted felonies. Her reply continued: ""John Bradley is reducing 36 percent of all felonies to misdemeanors and passing them off to my office. That’s double the statewide average.""

Duty told us by email that she had not aired the percentage to complain about her workload. ""The two points that I am making are these: One, 36 percent  is too high,"" she said, saying that statewide in 2011, the average rate for dismissing some felony cases and referring some as misdemeanors was 16 percent. ""This is not being ‘tough on crime,’"" she said by email. 
Bradley later told us law enforcement officers initially indicate their judgment on whether a case should be a felony or misdemeanor. Then the DA’s office evaluates each case, he said.

Duty said she based the cited percentages on information collected and posted online by the Texas Office of Court Administration, which provides technical support and administrative assistance to the state’s courts and judges.

From the office’s website, it’s possible to download a report on ""felony case activity"" covering any recent time period for a county or the state. And according to the office’s information, of 2,013 total felony cases resolved in Williamson County in 2011, 738 -- 37 percent -- were ""dismissals."" Statewide, 16 percent of felony cases disposed were dismissals, according to the office’s information.

According to instructions for the district clerks who monthly update the figures, each case represents a charge against a defendant so several cases could involve a single person. However, if a defendant faces a multicount indictment, the instructions say, that’s to be recorded as one case based either on the most serious charge or the first charge leveled against them.

Those instructions also say the district clerks should report as dismissals those felony cases dropped for reasons including insufficient evidence; the defendant going unapprehended, being granted immunity for testimony or getting convicted in another case; a failure to hold a speedy trial; a decision to drop the case only to re-file a charge; or other unspecified reasons.

Another part of the instructions says ""transfers to county-level courts in your county when the case is reduced to a misdemeanor"" should be recorded in the ""all other dispositions"" category. In 2011, though, only 21 Williamson County cases fell into the ""all other dispositions"" category.

What the heck? 
Lisa David, the Williamson County district clerk, cleared up our confusion, saying in a telephone interview that felonies reduced to misdemeanors are mostly marked in the state database’s ""dismissals"" category. She said that’s because felony cases that become misdemeanors are mostly dismissed as a defendant agrees to plead guilty to a misdemeanor -- developments that fit the ""dismissals"" category.

In telephone interviews and by email, Bradley challenged the significance of Duty's cited ""dismissals"" percentage because not every felony charge is counted in the database under the method prescribed by the state. ""This is an ongoing issue with clerks and statistics,"" Bradley said. ""If this is true, then the total number of felony offenses being filed is being seriously undercounted.""

In a telephone interview, Angela Garcia, an Office of Court Administration official, agreed that the database records the disposition of only one case for each defendant facing a multicount indictment -- the first one or the most serious one. ""You could have 10 charges in a case, but it would only be counted as one case,"" Garcia said.

Garcia, the agency’s judicial information manager, said, too, that the information in the database is not a precise indicator of the number of felony cases a district attorney hands off since the ""dismissals"" category is broad. All figures in the database are intended to help state lawmakers and other policymakers make decisions about creating, cutting or expanding programs, she said.

Given uncertainties about the applicability of the database to Duty’s claim, we asked David, Duty and Bradley for precise counts for 2011 cases initially classified as felonies later converted to misdemeanors.

David told us by email that her office could not break out how many felony cases were converted to misdemeanor cases.

Bradley initially said he did not have a count. He later said by email that his office’s staff did track the number of 2011 felony cases referred to the county attorney as misdemeanors: 352. That would be a shade under 18 percent of the county’s felony cases resolved that year, according to the state database.

Bradley further said that in more than 90 percent of the referred cases, his office had already worked out plea agreements, meaning the county attorney simply had to file the cases and present the guilty pleas for judicial approval.

For her part, Duty provided a chart indicating that by her office’s tally, nearly 390 felony cases were reduced to misdemeanors in 2011. If so, that would have been a little over 19 percent of all the cases shown as disposed on the state database.

Duty, who through May 6, 2012, had not sought a correction of her original comment to the newspaper, summed up by email: ""Bradley reduces 20 percent of his felonies and he dismisses 16 percent of his felonies. This is a total of 36 percent of his cases being dismissed/reduced. I have repeatedly made this statement publicly for months and I stand by it.""

Our ruling

As Duty acknowledged to us, her published comment mistakenly indicated that 36 percent of felony cases in 2011 were reduced to misdemeanors handed off to her office; the relevant ""dismissals"" category on the state database folds in both cases dismissed and cases referred as misdemeanors.

The state database relied upon by Duty does not include a single category breaking out cases referred as misdemeanors, though the counts provided by Bradley and Duty indicate that the share of felonies referred to the county attorney’s office as misdemeanors in 2011 was less than 20 percent.

We’ll accept that Duty accurately described the 36 percent figure in other venues. However, her quoted claim to the Statesman rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/may/07/jana-duty/jana-duty-says-john-bradley-hands-36-percent-felon/

State Sen. Anthony Bucco claims Democrat-led Legislature is responsible for diverting money from unemployment benefits fund
","
Democrats have been in control of the New Jersey Legislature for so many years that they can be held responsible for many of the state’s financial woes.

But when it comes to diverting money from the state’s unemployment benefits fund, the Republican-led Legislature of years past deserves its share of the blame as well.

In a May 1 news release, however, state Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris) targeted ""an unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton"" for diverting money from that fund, which is used to pay unemployment benefits to people who worked in New Jersey.

""The Administration is to be applauded for putting the state’s unemployment insurance fund on the path to solvency more quickly than anyone expected,"" Bucco said in the news release. ""Through a combination of tax reforms, efficiencies, and aggressive prosecution of fraud and abuse, this Governor has fixed the mess he inherited as a result of years of diversions and fiscal irresponsibility by an unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton.""

The senator’s claim is largely wrong, PolitiFact New Jersey found. About 67 percent of the roughly $4.6 billion in total diverted funds was due to legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature between 1992 and 1997, according to the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services.

Due in part to the fund diversions -- as well as the increased demand for unemployment benefits -- the fund was depleted by March 2009 and New Jersey began borrowing from the federal government to cover benefit payments. State officials anticipate paying off the loan by May 2014.

Starting with a law enacted in late 1992, a total of about $4.6 billion has been diverted from the trust fund to cover charity care payments to hospitals, according to the OLS.

The Republican-led Legislature approved legislation in 1992, 1996 and 1997 that led to the diversion of $3.141 billion, representing about 67 percent of the total diverted funds.

In 2002 and 2003, Democrats controlled the State Assembly and the two parties shared control of the Senate. During those two years, legislators approved diverting $1.1 billion, or about 23 percent of the total funds.

After Democrats took full control of both houses in 2004, the Legislature agreed to divert $450 million, which is about 10 percent of the total funds.

Adam Bauer, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, acknowledged that Republicans also diverted money from the trust fund. But he argued that the trust fund balance still increased when the GOP was in the majority.

""Bucco’s line about ‘fiscal irresponsibility’ holds up because a diversion when the fund is not being stressed because of high unemployment and is approaching its record high fund balance is not irresponsible, but a diversion when there is high stress on the fund because of job loss and the fund is nearing a record low is irresponsible,"" Bauer said in an e-mail.

Joseph Henchman, vice president of Legal & State Projects for the business-backed Tax Foundation, said he could understand both holding money in reserve as well as ensuring it ""doesn't grow so large as to create pressure for unnecessarily higher benefits or beyond any possible future needs.""

""I can see both sides on this: on one hand, you want the fund to have enough in reserve to pay benefits when the economy dips, but you also don't want to accumulate funds beyond what you need,"" Henchman told us in an e-mail.

Our ruling

In a May 1 news release, Bucco claimed in regard to the state’s unemployment benefits fund that Gov. Chris Christie ""has fixed the mess he inherited as a result of years of diversions and fiscal irresponsibility by an unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton.""

Both political parties are responsible for diverting money from the trust fund. But of the roughly $4.6 billion in total diverted funds, about 67 percent of that was approved by the Republican-led Legislature between 1992 and 1997.

Bob McDonnell says U.S. trails Europe in economic recovery
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell recently added a new argument to his contention that President Barack Obama’s economic policies have failed.

""We’re recovering slower than Europe and other Western countries because I think our policies for jobs and energy are just anemic with this White House,"" McDonnell said in an April 21 interview on Bloomberg TV.

The economic news from abroad is hardly inspiring these days: crushing Greek debt; 24 percent unemployment in Spain; Britain falling back into recession. So we wondered whether the United States’ recovery really is trailing Europe’s.

We asked the governor’s office for proof of McDonnell’s European claim and asked it to identify the ""other Western countries"" he referred to. Spokeswoman Taylor Thornley sent us an email with no answers, but saying, ""Unemployment is too high. The national debt is out of control. And too many people are out of work.""

So we turned to data tables. Economists told us a standard way to examine the pace of the economy is to examine growth in gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced in a country.

At the time McDonnell made his statement, quarterly GDP figures through the end of 2011 were the latest ones available.

Tables from the European Union’s economics statistics office show the 27 countries in the European Union, on average, were growing faster than the U.S. in the first quarter of 2011 and that trends evened out in the second quarter. In the second half of last year, U.S. GDP was rising at a faster clip than Europe.

In the EU, GDP rose 1.1 percent in the third quarter of 2011 and but dropped 1 percent in the fourth quarter. The U.S., saw its economic output rise 1.8 percent in the third quarter and 3 percent in the fourth quarter.

Only five of 33 European nations grew faster than the U.S. in the second half of 2011: Poland, Iceland, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania. Iceland is not a member of the EU.

In the weeks and days before McDonnell made his statement, international organizations that track the global economy released growth projections for the U.S. and Europe for this year.

Figures released on April 17 by the International Monetary Fund show that U.S. GDP in 2012 is expected to grow 2.1 percent in 2012. That’s a bit quicker than the 1.7 percent increase the U.S. saw through all of 2011.

Throughout Europe, GDP grew 2 percent in 2011, but that is expected fall to 0.2 percent this year.

On March 29, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international group representing three dozen developed nations, released its projections for GDP growth in the first half of 2012.

""Our forecast for the first half of 2012 points to robust growth in the United States and Canada, but much weaker activity in Europe where the outlook remains fragile,"" Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD’s chief economist said in a news release.  

Figures in the report show that U.S. GDP growth at the end of 2011 was outpacing the major economies in Europe -- Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom -- which were shrinking or barely growing. Through the first half of 2012, U.S. growth was expected to outpace all those European nations.

Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said McDonnell is off base when he asserts Europe is recovering faster than the U.S.

""The United States, while its growth has not been spectacular, it certainly is growing modestly,"" Lachman said. ""Europe has just moved into recession. The last two quarters in Europe, many of the countries, you had negative growth.""

Only four European nations -- Poland, Iceland, Turkey and the Slovak Republic -- are expected to see their GDP rise at a faster clip than the U.S. this year, according to IMF data.

We also looked at unemployment rates in the U.S. and the European Union. We were unable to make an exact comparison because not all European nations define unemployment the same way as the U.S.

This much is clear, however: The unemployment rate in European Union Nations rose from 9.4 percent in March 2011 to 10.2 percent in March 2012. During the same two months, the U.S. rate fell from 8.9 percent to 8.2 percent.

Our ruling

McDonnell said the U.S. recovery is slower than Europe’s. But looking at the continent as a whole the opposite is true.

U.S. economic growth gained steam during the second half of 2011 while Europe’s started to flag. This year U.S. GDP is expected to grow at a higher pace than last year while Europe’s growth, is expected to be flat.

Only five outpaced the United States in economic growth during the last half of 2011. Only four are expected to outperform the U.S. this year. This information was available before the governor made his comment. We rate McDonnell’s statement False.",/factchecks/2012/may/07/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-us-trails-europe-economic-recov/
"['Ohio', 'Education', 'Sherrod Brown']","
Sherrod Brown says Ohio students graduate from college with an average tuition debt of $27,000
","
Editor's note: We originally rated this claim True. After receiving feedback from readers, we have downgraded that rating to Half True because the claim applies the average debt of about $27,000 to a much broader group than did the study from which it was cited. 
Interest rates on federally subsidized student loans went on the front burner as a political issue after Mitt Romney followed President Obama in saying he did not want those rates to go up. 
Congressional Republicans -- who earlier passed a budget allowing the rates to double in July to their 2007 rate of 6.8 percent -- closed ranks behind their  presumptive presidential nominee.

They voted for a hastily introduced bill that would keep the rate at 3.4 percent, and pay for it with funds intended for preventive health care programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Raiding that fund made the legislation unpalatable for Democrats -- just as the Democratic proposals to extend the lower interest rates were unpalatable to Republicans.

One of the proposals would have paid for the college loan subsidies by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Another would end a payroll tax exemption given some business owners.

Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown was a co-sponsor of the latter bill and of earlier legislation to stop the loan rates from going up.

""Federally-subsidized Stafford loans have allowed thousands of students—who might not otherwise be able pay for to college—afford the ever-increasing cost of higher education,"" he said in a news release. ""With the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution with nearly $27,000 in tuition bills, the last thing we should be doing is adding to their already-heavy debt load.""

The figure of $27,000 caught the notice of PolitiFact Ohio. It is more than $6,700 per year for four years of school.

We asked Brown's office for his source and more information. They referred us to the Project on Student Debt, a project of the independent, nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success.

Its most recent survey of public and private four-year institutions in Ohio found that 68 percent of students graduate in debt, and that the average debt on college loans is $27,713 -- the 7th-highest statewide average in the nation. (New Hampshire was highest, with average debt of $31,048; Wyoming was lowest, with $20,571.)

The actual debt level is probably higher, the Project on Student Debt noted, because the data is voluntarily reported by colleges and not available for all of them.

The report also reflects only graduates of public and private nonprofit colleges because few for-profit colleges report the student debt data. Based on national surveys by the U.S. Department of Education, graduates of for-profit four-year colleges are much more likely to borrow student loans, and borrow significantly more, than counterparts at nonprofit institutions.

Nationally, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average student loan balance per borrower is $23,300. The median balance is roughly half of that, $12,800. About one-quarter of borrowers nationally owe more than $28,000, and about 10 percent owe more than $54,000, according to the New York Fed.

In aggregate, the bank said, the outstanding student loan balance now stands at about $870 billion, surpassing the nation’s total credit card balance ($693 billion) and the total auto loan balance ($730 billion). About 37 million people hold outstanding student loan debt.

The key with all these figures is that they deal specifically with students who borrow and then graduate with loan debt.

So how does that mesh with Brown’s claim? In his statement he said ""the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution."" That describes a bigger pool of people than just the students who graduate with debt. In that most recent survey it would also include the 32 percent of the graduates who had no debt. But the figure Brown cited, nearly $27,000, was an average covering just those students who graduated with debt.

Brown’s statement is partially accurate. He cites the correct figure from a survey on debt among college students. But he describes those affected by debt too broadly, applying the average to all rather than just those who graduate with loan balances. Including all students would lower the average for loan debt by about a third. That’s an important detail needed to fully understand Brown’s claim.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Brown’s statement rates as Half True.",/factchecks/2012/may/07/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-ohio-students-graduate-college-/

U.S. locks up more people than any nation, congressman says
","
The U.S.A. Land of the free and the home of the imprisoned?

U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson says the United States puts a lot of people in prison.

How many?

""Mister Speaker, the United States imprisons more than any nation in the world,"" the liberal Democrat from DeKalb County said one day in the House of Representatives. ""We currently incarcerate 2.3 million people. The incarceration rate is not fitting for a nation which is routinely touted as the greatest nation in the world.""

PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Johnson was correct about his claim that America has more people in its prisons than any other country. Or should the congressman go into our fact-checking holding cell?

Johnson’s main reason for the statement was a verbal volley at the American Legislative Exchange Council, which he accused of lobbying for harsher prison sentences that benefit some members that run for-profit jails. Johnson’s office posted a video of his speech on YouTube.

The congressman’s office sent us several news articles and reports to fortify his claim. The news coverage all said the United States led the world in prison incarceration. The coverage was based on data from the International Centre for Prison Studies, based at the University of Essex in Great Britain. The center consistently tracks prison populations worldwide, and its World Prison Population List is widely used in studies and by reporters.

The most recent study, using data as of May 2011, found there were nearly 2.3 million people in U.S. prisons, the same number Johnson used in his congressional floor speech. A 2010 congressional report said 2.3 million Americans were in prison. The report was based on 2008 data.

In the most recent World Prison Population List, the U.S. had more prisoners than any other country. China was second with 1.65 million people in prison, but the report said it does not include people in pre-trial detention or ""administrative detention."" Russia was a distant third, with about 806,000 people in prison.

The center also measured the numbers by the percentage of people in prison. The report estimated the U.S. population at 308.4 million. It concluded that 743 of every 100,000 Americans were in prison. Again, the U.S. was first on the list.

Rwanda and Russia were second and third, respectively,  with 595 and 568 people in prison per 100,000 citizens.

The congressional report shows the U.S. prison population was about 100 per 100,000 between the 1920s and the late 1970s. Afterward, it went up like a rocket. One turning point, the report said, was New York state’s 1973 imposition of mandatory sentencing laws for drug offenses under the administration of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Other states followed. Georgia ranked eighth nationally in the number of prisoners in that 2010 report, with 540 per 100,000. Louisiana was first, and eight of the top 10 states are in the South.

The World Prison Population List includes totalitarian regimes and nations often on the world’s bad actors list such as Iran, Libya, Syria and Venezuela. But it does not include two Communist countries: Cuba and North Korea. So how many inmates do those countries have?

Amnesty International gave us a report it released in May 2011 on political prisoner camps in North Korea. It concluded there were an estimated 200,000 people being held in such camps, using satellite images and eyewitness accounts. That equates to 813 per 100,000, higher than the U.S.

As for Cuba, a 2003 study reported in The Miami Herald found an estimated 100,000 inmates in its 200 prisons and labor camps spread across the Caribbean island. Several prominent human rights organizations did not dispute the figure. In 1995, the United Nations estimated there were ""between 100,000 and 200,000 prisoners in all categories,'' the Herald reported.

""If accurate, the figure of 100,000 inmates in an island of nearly 11.3 million people would give Cuba 888 inmates per 100,000 people, far ahead of the United States,"" the Herald article said.

The Herald reported that the last time the report included Cuba was in 1997, when it used data from an academic in Norway to estimate there were about 33,000 inmates in Cuba’s prisons.

For various reasons, neither country is willing to open up its prisons for independent verification of the number of inmates in its jails.

The people who put together the World Prison Population List told PolitiFact Georgia that it is possible one or both of those countries may have more inmates than the United States.

""[T]he U.S. is accepted as having the highest prison population rate, but it is possible that Cuba and North Korea are depriving a higher proportion of their citizens of their liberty,"" Roy Walmsley, who helps put together the report, told us via email.

According to most reports, the United States does imprison more people than any other nation. But the figures are not as clear on the percentage of the population it locks up. Some reports do not include countries such as Cuba and North Korea. Those countries, according to some research, may have a higher ratio of inmates in their prisons.

Johnson’s statement is based on accurate data. But it needs additional context to move the needle higher on the Truth-O-Meter. We give the congressman a Half True on this one.",/factchecks/2012/may/07/hank-johnson/us-locks-more-people-any-nation-congressman-says/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Workers', 'Wisconsin', 'Tom Barrett']","
Dem recall candidate Tom Barrett says GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker ""caused"" top job losses in U.S.
","
Even if Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had never promised that 250,000 private-sector jobs would be created during his first term in office, critics would have castigated him once the state’s monthly jobs losses began to mount.

A direct attack was launched April 26, 2012, by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, the Democratic frontrunner in the gubernatorial recall election, who said in a tweet:

""Governor Walker has caused Wisconsin to lose more jobs than any other state in the country.""

Let’s address the two parts of the claim separately.

Wisconsin lost most jobs

Barrett’s tweet linked to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article published the same day, making it clear the period he was referring to in his tweet. In the article, Barrett cited a federal report that showed Wisconsin lost 23,900 jobs from March 2011 to March 2012 - the most in the country. That included 17,800 government jobs and 6,100 private-sector jobs.

So Wisconsin did lose more jobs than any other state during the period Barrett cited.

(For those of you keeping score on Walker’s private-sector jobs promise, they are up 5,900 during Walker’s tenure, according to the latest installment in our Walk-O-Meter.)

Now to the second part of Barrett’s claim.

Walker ‘caused’ job loss

Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak made four points in arguing that Walker caused Wisconsin’s job losses:

Economist prediction: A Wisconsin State Journal article published the same day as Barrett’s tweet noted that University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Steven Deller, in March 2011, predicted that spending cuts in Walker’s budget proposals would result in the loss of nearly 22,000 jobs in one to two years.

But as Deller himself has noted, some economists believe that job losses are caused by tax increases, which Walker would have needed to balance the budget had he not relied on spending cuts. So one prediction does not make it a settled issue.

Walker’s jobs bills: Walzak said Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature approved pieces of legislation that were touted as jobs bills, but the job losses indicate those policies failed.

Here, too, there is no proof that the measures caused the job losses; indeed, it could be argued by Republicans that if not for the bills, the job losses in the period cited might have been worse.

Walker claims credit: Walzak said Walker has touted his policies in response to good news - such as when jobs increased in a month or when the unemployment rate dropped - so he should be blamed for job losses.

That’s a fair point, from the politics point of view. But just as the credit is not entirely due to an incumbent executive, neither is the blame.

Indeed, in a May 2012 news article that Walzak himself sent us, Barrett said he agreed that presidents and governors get too much credit and blame for job creation, saying, ""obviously, there are many, many factors.""

Lack of focus: Walzak said Walker’s focus has strayed from job creation to issues such as curbing collective bargaining for public employees.

But that does not address how Walker has ""caused"" the loss of jobs over the past year.

In that vein, we rated as Half True two similar, if less blunt, claims made in TV ads by the Republican Governors Association, which blamed Barrett’s policies for driving up unemployment in Milwaukee and blamed policies of Kathleen Falk, the other leading Democrat in the recall election, for doing the same in Dane County while she was the county executive.

As we stated in those items, a chief executive such as a governor has influence over jobs, but so do a host of other factors, such as national trends, that are beyond a governor’s control. The national recession has certainly had a wide impact. Indeed, in 2008 and 2009, amid and immediately after the recession - while Democrat Jim Doyle was Wisconsin’s governor - the state lost 164,000 jobs, although it added 12,000 in 2010.

Our rating

Barrett said Walker ""has caused Wisconsin to lose more jobs than any other state in the country."" He is accurate on the job losses but overstates Walker’s role in causing them.

We rate Barrett’s statement Half True.

Donald Trump's faulty claim that Biden wants to end school choice
","On President Donald Trump’s list of ""really bad"" ideas in the Biden-Sanders unity platform, one involved school choice. ""There is nothing that the African American community wants more than school choice,"" Trump said in a July 14 Rose Garden speech. ""Joe Biden wants to end school choice."" Does he? The Biden campaign says he’s fine with school choice, just not the variety Trump has in mind. We reached out to the Trump campaign and the White House and didn’t hear back. For many Republican leaders, school choice is synonymous with vouchers to help families pay for tuition at private schools. Read that way, Trump has a point. But even Michigan, which ranks among the top states for charter school enrollment and has active school choice programs, has no voucher program. So school choice is not a yes-no deal. There’s a range of policies that runs from telling parents and kids they can only go to schools in their designated area to giving them private school vouchers. In between those two poles are several options that include charter and specialized magnet schools. Biden’s policy falls somewhere in the middle. The unity platform emerged from discussions between advisers to the Biden and Bernie Sanders campaigns seeking to bridge differences between Democratic Party factions before the general election campaign heats up. The 110-page list of recommendations never mentions the term ""school choice."" It does recommend ending one federally funded program that exists only in the District of Columbia. It’s called the Opportunity Scholarship Program, and in 2019, 1,732 students in the program used taxpayer-funded vouchers to go to private schools. About 80% of the students were Black and 42% came from households that receive food stamps or welfare. The yearly cost is about $20 million. The unity platform (page 83) says the program ""has consistently failed to demonstrate academic effectiveness."" The latest federal study largely backs that up. It found that after three years, ""those offered scholarships were doing no better academically, but also no worse than otherwise similar peers."" The value of the program is a matter of debate. Created in 2004 when Republicans held power, its funding tends to drop during Democratic administrations.  The unity platform presses for other changes that target charter schools. It opposes for-profit and low-performing charters, and it would give local school districts a powerful say over the use of federal funds to open new charter schools or expand existing ones. The Biden campaign said he’s firmly against using public money for private K-12 schools. Here’s the full statement we received: ""Joe Biden opposes the Trump/(Betsy) DeVos conception of ‘school choice,’ which is private school vouchers that would destroy our public schools. He's also against for-profit and low-performing charter schools, and believes in holding all charter schools accountable. He does not oppose districts letting parents choose to send their children to public magnet schools, high-performing public charters or traditional public schools."" As part of a broader education policy outlined on his website, Biden calls for nearly tripling the Title 1 funding for aid to schools serving lower income neighborhoods and raising teacher pay. The Trump-Pence 2020 website claims that Biden said ""that if he’s elected, charter schools are gone."" The campaign links to a comment Biden made at a December 2019 forum on public schools. Biden was attacking Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ policy on student sexual assault accusations. At the very end of condemning that policy on assaults, he said, ""If I’m president, Betsy DeVos’ whole notion from charter schools to this are gone."" Biden didn’t otherwise discuss charter schools or school choice broadly. EdChoice, an advocacy group that aims ""to advance educational freedom and choice,"" lists a number of practices that fall under the school choice umbrella. In addition to vouchers, that list includes charter schools, specialized magnet schools (for example, for math and science or the arts) and allowing students to choose which public school they want to attend. Biden’s platform includes all of those elements except vouchers. ""There are several ways to have choice,"" said Andre Perry at Brookings, a Washington policy research center. ""He doesn’t want public dollars to go to private schools. That still leaves room for choice."" Corey DeAngelis, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute and director of school choice at the Reason Foundation, says Trump's accusation about Biden seeking to end school choice is ambiguous. ""Did Trump mean all school choice, private school choice, or school choice for some families?"" DeAngelis said. ""It would have been more accurate for him to say something like ‘Biden wants to end some forms of school choice,’ or ‘Biden wants to limit school choice.’"" For school reform researcher Thomas Toch, director of FutureEd at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy, Biden sits somewhere to the right of some Democratic party activists. ""He has not embraced the progressive wing's strong opposition to any type of school choice,"" Toch said. ""He’s for choice, but not all forms of it. There are many centrist Democrats who are in the same position."" One final point about the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship voucher program that Biden opposes:  Washington, D.C., has a lottery program that assigns interested students to the nonprofit charter or traditional public school of their choice. Not every student gets to go where they want, but the latest report on the scholarship program suggested that ""the OSP’s lack of effectiveness might be related to D.C. families’ already-widespread access to school choice."" Trump said that Biden wants to end school choice. Biden wants to end voucher programs that use public money to pay for private school tuition. He also opposes for-profit and low-performing charter schools. But he supports good charter schools and allowing students to pick among public schools. Those also qualify as school choice options. Trump’s sweeping accusation goes too far. We rate this Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-biden-wants-end-school/

Trump said Biden wants to mandate net-zero emission buildings and get rid of windows. He’s wrong
","At a Rose Garden speech on July 14, President Donald Trump made multiple attacks on Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, saying his policies went too far left. One of those attacks included an accusation that task force recommendations from Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders included a mandate that would get rid of windows on buildings. Trump said that Biden plans to ""mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing."" The Biden-Sanders recommendations set a goal for having all new buildings achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. They don't say anything about a mandate. The plan also doesn’t mention windows — and the presence of windows in a building does not mean that a building can’t achieve net-zero carbon emissions. The White House and Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. The Biden and Sanders task force recommends setting a goal to reduce buildings’ impact on climate change, but not a mandate. This is what the task force recommendation says: ""We will set a bold, national goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by 2030.""  That target is included in Biden’s sustainable energy and infrastructure plan, which his campaign released July 14. The plan seeks to achieve a ""net-zero emissions standard for all new commercial buildings by 2030.""  The Energy Department defines ""zero energy buildings"" as those that ""combine energy efficiency and renewable energy generation to consume only as much energy as can be produced onsite through renewable resources over a specified time period."" Residential and commercial buildings contributed to 35% of U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2019, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Biden plans to invest in companies to incentivize them to update four million buildings to make them more efficient, according to the task force recommendations. In addition, the task force expects Democrats to work on state and city levels to make buildings more energy efficient. The Green New Deal, a far-reaching climate proposal introduced in February 2019 by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., set out to upgrade all buildings in the U.S. to make them as energy efficient as possible. The plan wasn’t brought to a vote in the House and failed to advance in the Senate. Biden’s clean energy and environmental justice plan, released in June 2019, called the Green New Deal ""a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."" The Democrats’ task force document doesn’t mention windows at all, and buildings with windows can have net-zero emissions. Steve Capanna, director of U.S. Climate Policy and Analysis at the Environmental Defense Fund said that Trump’s claim that Biden and Sanders want to get rid of windows is ""preposterous."" ""President Trump’s claim is not accurate,"" Capanna said. ""The Biden-Sanders team certainly is not proposing eliminating windows."" Capanna said that Biden’s target is ambitious, but there are already programs in place that push for energy efficient buildings. Those plans include measures for efficient windows. The Energy Department’s Zero Energy Ready Home program certifies homes that have more energy-efficient heating and cooling, insulation, and water distribution systems. The department also certifies zero-energy commercial buildings. The agency and the Environmental Protection Agency have a related program to encourage energy-efficient products and practices that includes guidelines for energy-efficient windows. Efforts to make buildings more energy-efficient don’t center around getting rid of windows. Rather, they include using ""sufficiently insulated windows,"" as outlined by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Capanna said that older, less efficient windows can let warm or cool air escape a building. That contributes to energy loss, ""which means you have to heat the building more."" However, improvements that made windows more efficient in recent years include having multiple panes and allowing in more natural light, which reduces the need for artificial light, Capanna said. Trump said that the Biden-Sanders task force ""mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing."" Biden has a net-zero emissions goal for new buildings by 2030, but his plan doesn’t mention a mandate. Neither the task force recommendation nor Biden’s new climate plan say anything about getting rid of windows, and net-zero emissions buildings can have windows (and many do). Trump’s statement doesn’t align with the facts. We rate it False. CORRECTION, July 20: This fact-check wrongly described how energy efficient windows allow more light into a building. The post has been updated to clarify that allowing more natural light reduces the need for artificial light.",/factchecks/2020/jul/17/donald-trump/trump-said-biden-wants-mandate-net-zero-emission-b/

‘The View’ co-host Sunny Hostin right about white-on-white, Black-on-Black homicides
","""The View"" co-host Sunny Hostin slammed President Donald Trump and other conservatives who have cited Black-on-Black homicides to discredit protests of police violence against Black Americans, saying their critiques are missing a critical point about murder in the U.S. ""I hear that so much in conservative circles, and what people need to understand is that homicides are intraracial,"" Hostin said July 15. ""When you look at white-on-white crime, it's 84%. Right? Homicides. White people kill white people.""  ""But that term ‘white-on-white crime’ is never used,"" Hostin added. ""So why is ‘Black-on-Black crime’ used?"" As fact-checkers, we can confirm that Hostin’s claim about most homicides involving people of the same race is accurate, based on available data. So is the figure she cited for the percentage of white homicide victims who were killed by white people. ""The fact that (homicides) are predominantly intraracial is widely and deeply accepted in criminology and in police circles,"" said Jeffrey Fagan, professor of law at Columbia Law School and an expert on policing, crime and race. Experts previously told us homicides typically involve people who know each other, and people often marry, date, befriend and live with people of the same race. An ABC spokesperson said Hostin was talking specifically about homicides and citing data from a 2011 Justice Department report summarizing homicide trends from 1980 to 2008 — a report that, while slightly outdated, we’ve referenced in several fact-checks related to race and crime.  The report found that between 1980 and 2008, 84% of white homicide victims were killed by other white people, and 93% of Black victims were killed by other Black people. An earlier report analyzing homicides between 1976 and 2005 had identified similar patterns. RELATED: Instagram graph misleads on the racial breakdown of homicides More recent federal data also puts the numbers in the same ballpark. In 2018, the most recent year for which FBI homicide data is available, about 81% of white victims were killed by white people, and about 89% of Black victims were killed by Black people. Here’s what the FBI’s annual crime reports show for the other years since 2008:  There are caveats to the FBI’s homicide data, as we have previously reported. The data shows information on race only for cases involving a single victim and a single offender, and for cases where the race of both parties is known. Race can be tricky to record correctly, too. ""We can only estimate intraracial or interracial trends when we know who the (perpetrator) or suspect is,"" Fagan said. ""But we only know that in about two-thirds of all murders."" The available data does support Hostin’s claim about white-on-white homicides. The co-host’s broader point — that homicides tend to be intraracial — also holds true.  A 2019 Justice Department report found that most violent crime in 2018 was also intraracial. About 62% of violent incidents against white victims were committed by white people, and about 70% of violent incidents against Black victims were committed by Black people. Hostin said, ""Homicides are intraracial. When you look at white-on-white crime, it's 84%. Right? Homicides. White people kill white people."" An ABC spokesperson clarified that Hostin’s 84% figure referred to the percentage of white homicides that involved white offenders. A 2011 report on data from 1980 to 2008 showed 84% of white homicide victims over that 28-year period were killed by white people. The report is almost 10 years old, but more recent annual data from the FBI also puts the percentage of white homicide victims killed by white offenders in the same range. Experts say most homicides where race information is known are intraracial. We rate this statement True.",/factchecks/2020/jul/17/sunny-hostin/view-co-host-sunny-hostin-right-about-white-white-/

Wisconsin lawmaker makes his case in separation of church and state debate
","The U.S. Supreme Court gave fresh oxygen to the age-old debate over the separation of church and state with its June 30, 2020 ruling in a Montana case that involved secular vs. religious tax breaks. Some lawmakers were dismayed by the court’s 5-4 decision, which said if a tax break benefits students/parents at a private secular school, it must also benefit students/parents at private religious schools. ""Our country & Constitution was built on a foundational separation of church and state, "" U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis, said in a June 30, 2020 tweet. ""Today, #SCOTUS ruled public funds—taxpayer dollars — can go to religious schools. I think it's time the church and state get a constitutionally-mandated divorce."" For our purposes, we are focused on the first part of that statement: Was ""our country & Constitution was built on a foundational separation of church and state""? When asked to provide backup for the statement, Pocan’s staff said ""the foundation of our nation’s separation of church and state is evident throughout our Constitution,"" and pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to Article VI of the Constitution and the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. Let’s start with Article VI of the the constitution, which reads, in part: The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. The First Amendment, adopted December 15, 1791, is one of the 10 amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights. It reads: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Close readers will notice something is missing. There is no direct reference to separation of church and state. Yet it is understood as a bedrock principle in American life. Where does it come from? That sent us to more sources and experts. The origin of the phrase may be an 1802 letter written by President Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association.  As characterized by the Bill of Rights Institute, in the letter Jefferson explained his beliefs about federalism and the meaning of what is known as the Establishment Clause. That is, the prohibition on government from making any law ""respecting an establishment of religion.""  In the letter, Jefferson assured the Danbury Baptist Association that the federal government could not interfere with their church or offer special favors to a particular sect. The key quote (emphasis ours): ""I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.""  The Bill of Rights Institute notes ""Jefferson’s letter has been used by the Supreme Court, including Justice Hugo Black as ‘almost an authoritative declaration’ as to the Founders’ intent for the Establishment Clause.""  The Bill of Rights Institute is a nonprofit educational organization based in Arlington, Virginia, founded by Charles Koch and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation. The Koch foundations are known for backing a variety of organizations, including conservative think tanks.  Meanwhile, Liz Hayes, assistant communications director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, on Jan. 9, 2019, wrote an essay on the topic entitled""The Religious Right says Church-State Separation isn’t in the Constitution. Here’s Why they’re wrong. The group, which has been labeled ""liberal"" by the Associated Press, is a nonprofit organization that advocates for separation of church and state. In the essay, Hayes said in part: ""While the literal words ‘wall of separation between church and state’ don’t appear in the Constitution, the concept of church-state separation certainly does. If you doubt that, just read the writings of Jefferson, James Madison and generations of U.S. Supreme Court justices tasked with interpreting and applying the Constitution."" Asked about Pocan’s statement, in a July 8, 2020 email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Hayes said: ""Yes, Rep. Pocan accurately describes church-state separation as a fundamental American principle that is rooted in our Constitution and secures religious freedom for all of us."" Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, said Pocan’s statement is ""neither true nor false.""  ""The statement is a common legitimate characterization of the provisions of the First Amendment -- a characterization that some scholars and other commentators would say is over-simplified, but certainly not ‘false,’"" McConnell said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.  McConnell pointed out that religious institutions receive the benefits of government programs, from police protection to tax exemptions to G.I. Bill benefits, and are similarly subject to governmental regulations, such as fire codes, public health regulations (such as the recent COVID-related shutdown), and tort laws.  ""Many think it is more accurate to describe the relation between religion and government in terms of neutrality rather than ‘separation.’ But neither term is true or false; they are legitimate statements of opinion,"" McConnell said. Pocan said ""Our country & Constitution was built on a foundational separation of church and state.""  Constitutional experts note the phrase ""separation of church and state"" does not appear in the Constitution, but say the concept certainly does.  Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is ""accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""

Wisconsin Dems ignore key details in saying GOP pushed for longer lines and limited voting time
","With the presidential election just under four months away, party officials on both sides of the aisle are trying to make political hay out of Wisconsin’s tumultuous spring election. The Republican Party of Wisconsin in early July accused Democrats of closing down voting locations in some of Wisconsin's largest cities during the April 7, 2020, election ""to cause chaos."" We rated this claim False, noting the decision to consolidate polling places came down to poll worker shortages. There wasn’t evidence to suggest Democrats would benefit from the chaos, either.  Now, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin has joined in the finger pointing.  In a July 10, 2020, fundraising email, Wisconsin Democrats touted their push for expanded access to absentee ballots. They also took a shot at their GOP counterparts for their role in the April election. ""While we pushed for vote by mail and expanded early voting, they’ve pushed for long lines and polls open for one day only,"" Wisconsin Democrats said in the message.  A number of cities — including Milwaukee and Green Bay — experienced long polling lines in April. But did Wisconsin Republicans really ""push"" for this? Let’s take a look. When asked to back up the party’s claim, Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Philip Shulman pointed to a Jay Weber Show interview with state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos from April 6, 2020. Shulman highlighted a portion of the interview in which Vos, R-Rochester, says he opposed extending the deadline to cast an absentee ballot beyond the day of the election.  The U.S. Supreme Court later that day cut short the extended absentee voting window in Wisconsin and required absentee ballots to be postmarked by April 7, 2020, in order to be counted. The same day, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ last-minute effort to shut down the election.  Shulman cited this action as one of the ways Republicans ""challenged every attempt… to make the election fair and safe.""  Shulman said Republicans ""knew full well"" there would be long lines due to the consolidation of polling locations, adding they fought against efforts to mitigate this issue. ""The GOP knew what would happen when they challenged and won in court,"" he said. Wisconsin GOP spokesperson Alesha Guenther, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, dismissed the Democrats’ claims, adding they ignore Republican efforts to encourage early and absentee voting. Guenther pointed to a March 25, 2020, Wisconsin GOP Facebook post encouraging voters to request an absentee ballot.  She also highlighted a March 16, 2020, post telling supporters to vote early for President Donald Trump and state Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, who ended up losing his race to Democratic challenger Jill Karofsky. A page on the Wisconsin GOP website instructs voters how to request an absentee ballot. It features a video from former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch demonstrating how to upload a picture of a photo ID.  What’s more, Vos in the June 6, 2020 interview with Jay Weber, also voiced his support for early voting and said he was ""open to the idea"" of allowing more time for absentee ballots to be counted, not cast. ""We have been encouraging people for a month to go ahead and vote early,"" Vos said. ""Vote by mail. If you don’t feel like you have the ability to go out or you have a concern about people who you love, make sure that you stay in your house. But you still have the right to vote."" There is no question the lawsuits preventing the cancellation of the election and eliminating the extension of absentee voting forced many to cast their ballots in person despite warnings from top health officials.  But the reality of the situation is more complicated than pointing the finger at one group. The assertion that Republicans advocated for ""polls open for one day only"" keys in on the rejection of extending absentee voting but ignores GOP messages encouraging early voting.  The idea Republicans ""pushed for long lines"" is reminiscent of the claim that Democrats wanted to ""cause chaos,"" which we rated False. Republicans did push for in-person voting during the April 7, 2020, election. But it is a stretch to say they ""pushed"" for long polling lines. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin in a fundraising email said Wisconsin Republicans ""pushed for long lines and polls open for one day only."" There is some truth in the assertion Republicans pushed for one day of voting, though it does ignore GOP calls for early voting. And although Republicans did advocate for an in-person election, the claim that they ""pushed for long lines"" is off the mark. Our definition of Mostly False is the ""statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""

Donald Trump gives false version of Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders ‘unity’ policy on immigrants
","In a speech berating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, President Donald Trump claimed that Biden favored immigrants illegally in the country over U.S. citizens. Speaking from the Rose Garden at the White House, Trump said he’d asked his people to draw up key elements of recommendations given to Biden by a task force composed of appointees of Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Trump said he couldn’t believe what he read about immigrants and government benefits. ""Sign new immigrants up for welfare immediately. This is Joe Biden,"" Trump said July 14, reading from a document. ""So they walk off, and they come in, and they put a foot into our land, and we sign up new immigrants up for welfare,"" Trump continued. ""We sign them up immediately. They get welfare benefits. United States citizens don't get what they're looking to give illegal immigrants. Think of that: sign up — it's hard to believe I'm even reading that — new immigrants for welfare immediately."" PolitiFact decided to review the task force recommendations and compare it against Trump’s words. Our verdict: Trump offered a highly misleading interpretation. The task force recommended undoing many of Trump’s immigration policies, but not an immediate enrollment of immigrants for welfare. Welfare is a term that describes federal programs providing food, health care, housing and financial assistance to low-income families. Much less, it did not say that immigrants illegally in the country should have more benefits than U.S. citizens. Neither the White House nor Trump’s re-election campaign provided evidence to support Trump’s claim. RELATED: No, Joe Biden will not ‘abolish’ police or prisons, as Donald Trump said The recommendations most related to what Trump talked about focus on health care and a new ""public charge"" rule imposed by the Trump administration. But they don’t seek what Trump said. Access to health care during pandemic: The task force said that during any pandemic or public health crisis like COVID-19, health coverage should be available to everyone, regardless of immigration status, for testing, treatment and other medical services. Affordable Care Act extension: The task force recommended extending Affordable Care Act coverage to immigrants illegally in the country who are protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and allowing additional immigrants illegally in the country to also buy health insurance, unsubsidized. Immigrants illegally in the country currently are not eligible to buy health insurance offered through the Health Insurance Marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act. However, they may be eligible for Emergency Medicaid to cover emergency medical needs. So the task force recommends allowing immigrants here illegally to get access to health care, including Affordable Care Act coverage. But being able to buy health insurance doesn’t amount to getting welfare. Other health-related policies apply to immigrants who are lawfully in the United States. Trump in his speech at times said ""new immigrants"" — but the context shows that his focus was immigrants who come illegally, not those arriving legally. Rescind public charge rules: The task force recommended rescinding new Trump regulations that allow immigration officials to deny immigrants visas if they are deemed ""more likely than not"" to use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers. Immigrants who are in the United States legally on temporary visas and have relied on such benefits could have more difficulty getting approved for lawful permanent residence. End five-year waiting period: Federal law says immigrants are not eligible for federal ""means-tested"" public benefits for five years starting on the date of their arrival as a ""qualified alien"" (such as lawful permanent resident). The task force said Biden should work with Congress to lift that five-year waiting period for low-income lawfully present immigrants, so they are eligible for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The proposed changes for the five-year waiting period and the public charge rule do not apply to immigrants illegally in the country, said Rebecca Sharpless, a professor and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law. Most federal assistance programs require that participants be U.S. citizens or eligible non-U.S. citizens. The recommendations presented to Biden do not restrict or prevent U.S. citizens from being eligible for the programs, despite Trump’s claim that immigrants illegally in the country would be getting an advantage. Trump said Biden wants to sign up immigrants illegally in the country for welfare and ""United States citizens don't get what they're looking to give illegal immigrants."" A task force recommended that Biden extend health care coverage to immigrants illegally in the country by allowing them to purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, and allowing them to have health care coverage during a pandemic. Being allowed to buy health insurance isn’t the same as getting welfare. The group also recommended easing federal benefits restrictions on immigrants — but for those lawfully present in the United States. The recommendations do not deny benefits to U.S. citizens or give immigrants illegally in the country an upper hand. Trump’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-gives-false-version-joe-biden-bernie-/

No, Joe Biden will not ‘abolish’ police or prisons, as Donald Trump said
","In a break from tradition, President Donald Trump used the White House’s Rose Garden as the venue for a lengthy rhetorical shot at his 2020 campaign rival, Joe Biden. Trump particularly targeted a policy document recently agreed to by representatives of the Biden campaign as well as allies of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who gave Biden a strong challenge from the ideological left in the 2020 Democratic primaries. ""The Biden-Sanders agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee, by far, in American history,"" he said. Trump went on to call out many parts of the platform, including its policies on criminal justice. ""We could go on for days,"" Trump said. ""Incentivize prison closure. So they want to close our prisons. They now want to abolish our police departments. They want to abolish our prisons, I guess."" This is wildly untrue. The Trump campaign didn’t respond to our inquiries. As we’ve reported, some protesters using the term ""defund the police"" want to eliminate police departments entirely. But most officials do not want to eliminate the police; they want to revisit the functions of police departments and reroute some of their funding toward social services. But Biden explicitly rejected the ""defund the police"" label. ""While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people’s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police,"" Biden wrote in an op-ed in USA Today. ""The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms. So what does Biden support? The unity document backs a wide array of criminal-justice provisions, including decriminalization of marijuana by jurisdictions that want to do so and repealing federal mandatory minimum sentences. Not only does the unity document not say anything about abolishing the police, it includes several passages that are based on the assumption that there will be police going forward. They include: • ""We will require officer training in effective nonviolent tactics, appropriate use of force, implicit bias, and peer intervention, both at the academy and on the job."" • ""Democrats will reinvigorate community policing approaches, so officers on the beat better serve the neighborhoods they work in."" • ""Democrats also support measures to increase diversity among the ranks of police departments, so our law enforcement agencies look more like the communities they serve. And we will seek increased funding for officer health and well-being in police departments across the country, including for personal safety equipment and mental health services."" There is one type of prison that the unity document does support abolishing: privately owned and run prisons. ""Private profit should not motivate the provision of vital public services, including in the criminal justice system,"" the unity document says. ""Democrats support ending the use of private prisons and private detention centers."" But to equate that with abolishing all prisons, as Trump did, is highly misleading. Biden wants to change some aspects of prisons. ""We also believe that too many of our jails and prisons subject people to inhumane treatment, and will work to end practices like solitary confinement for adults and juveniles,"" the unity document says.  Biden also supports reducing what he considers to be the outsized role of prisons in the criminal justice system. ""Democrats know we can end the era of mass incarceration and dramatically reduce the number of Americans held in jails and prisons while continuing to reduce crime rates, which have fallen steadily from their peak nearly three decades ago,"" the unity document says. However, the document envisions that prisons will exist in the future, just with a different model of administration and changes for some of the policies they currently enforce. We’ll close by highlighting similarities between what Biden hopes to achieve and what Trump has already done. Trump in 2018 signed the First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill. This measure tried to move the law in directions that are similar to aspects of the Biden platform, including efforts to reduce the severity of sentences, a greater emphasis on policies to reduce convict recidivism, and making retroactive the end to the disparity between crack and powder cocaine. Trump said that a Biden-Sanders ""unity"" policy document shows that ""they want to abolish our police departments. They want to abolish our prisons, I guess."" The document does not say anything about abolishing police departments or getting rid of all prisons. The document includes several passages that clearly indicate that police and prisons will exist in the future, with proposed changes. Criminologists say some of Biden’s policies represent a continuation of policies enacted by Trump himself in the First Step Act.

This 2017-18 flu season study does not include COVID-19
","We have debunked plenty of misinformation about vaccines for COVID-19 that are in development. Next up: more false information tying COVID-19 to the seasonal flu vaccine. An April 16 article shared on social media carries the headline ""New study: The flu vaccine Is ‘significantly associated’ with an increased risk of coronavirus."" Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article, from a self-described ""conscious media"" website, mainly cites a 2019 study from the U.S. Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch that was published in the journal Vaccine in 2020. The study focused on Department of Defense personnel, who have high rates of flu vaccination, and examined whether being vaccinated for a seasonal flu could make someone more or less likely to catch other respiratory viruses. But the study found no connection between the flu shot and an increased risk of contracting COVID-19. That’s because the U.S. Armed Forces study’s data was referring to seasonal common coronaviruses in 2017-18, not the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. (There are seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, of which the COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 is one.) This was clarified in the full article, but is ambiguous in the headline. What’s more, Richard Watanabe, a preventative medicine professor at USC, told PolitiFact that the article doesn’t really provide ""strong support for anything they are claiming"" since the study found little correlation between the flu vaccine and such viruses.  Even with regard to coronaviruses that predated SARS-CoV-2, the U.S. Armed Forces study concluded that further research is needed, as ""the overall results of the study showed little to no evidence supporting the association of virus interference and influenza vaccination."" The study’s data had mixed results for individual respiratory viruses and found that vaccinated individuals were ""more likely to have no pathogen detected and reduced risk of influenza when compared to unvaccinated individuals."" The article also leaves out parts of the study that question the data linking coronavirus cases to the influenza vaccine. For instance, the U.S. Armed Forces study referenced a study from 2013 that had similar results except there was ""no association between influenza vaccination and RSV, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus or coronavirus.""  Edward Belongia, an infectious disease epidemiologist who worked on the 2013 study, explained to FactCheck.org that there is little scientific data to support the speculative theory of the flu vaccine increasing the risk of other respiratory viruses.

Misreported test data in Orlando does not explain Florida’s COVID-19 outbreak
","One theory ricocheting around social media blames Florida’s large coronavirus outbreak on mistakes in case reporting. The claim was made by internet prankster Joey Saladino, who says he creates content ""to expose the Democrats and MSM,"" or mainstream media. The onetime candidate for a New York City congressional seat has 156,000 followers on Facebook.  His July 14 Facebook post said (typo included): ""The Flordia Covid-19 Outbreak is being EXPOSED as a HOAX!"" It included an image of a tweet he posted on Twitter, which also misspelled the state name: ""BREAKING: Orlando Health admits their Covid-19 numbers are wrong, saying it shows 98% positive, but it’s actually 9.4%. This explains the ‘outbreak’ in Flordia."" One commenter wrote: ""I knew it!"" Other Facebook users made similar claims, saying for example that 33 Florida labs reported ""98% positivity instead of 9.8%. Another claimed the state Department of Health ""increased the COVID-19 case number by a whopping 90%."" There is no evidence of that.  Saladino’s Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There have been discrepancies, and some confusion, in how test results are reported to the state. But the size of the COVID-19 outbreak has to do with raw numbers of people in Florida who test positive for infection — not what percentage of test results are positive.  On July 12, the Sunshine State made headlines by recording 15,300 new coronavirus cases — breaking the U.S. record for most coronavirus cases in a day. Florida led the nation in the number of cases over the previous seven days, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported July 15. The same day, the Florida Department of Health announced that on July 14, its new cases reflected a nearly 14% positive rate — that is, the number of people who test positive for the first time divided by all tests. That’s higher than the 11% positive rate for the 3.4 million tests done during the state’s entire outbreak. ""I think the way our community has come back together over the last couple of weeks has really just been inconsistent with preventing the spread of a respiratory virus,"" Dr. Angus Jameson, medical director with Pinellas County Emergency Medical Services, told the Tampa Bay Times on the record-setting day. Saladino’s Facebook post came the day that Fox 35, a television station in Orlando, did a news story about COVID-19 testing in Florida. The story said that all, or nearly all, of the tests done at some labs were reported to the state as being positive for the virus. That included, according to the story, Orlando Health reporting a 98% positive rate to the state on a batch of tests.  The hospital ""confirmed errors"" to the station, according to the story, and said the actual positive rate was only 9.4%. The story was picked up by Fox News and the conservative-leaning Washington Examiner. Orlando Health has 450 locations, including 13 hospitals, as well as clinics, labs and other facilities. Kena Lewis, a spokeswoman for the system, told PolitiFact there has been confusion over how the state Department of Health website reports testing results.  On one page, showing data as of July 15, Orlando Health is listed with 98% of its 522 tests showing a positive result. But Lewis gave us data showing the positive rate is only 10% when all 13 of the system’s hospitals, which go by different names, are taken into account. The rate was 9.4% as of July 12, she said. Another problem, according to the Department of Health, is some smaller labs were reporting only the tests that had positive results to the state. On the day the TV story aired, the department issued a statement saying it ""immediately began working with those labs to ensure that all results were being reported in order to provide comprehensive and transparent data. As the state continues to receive results from various labs, the department will continue educating these labs on proper protocol for reporting COVID-19 test results."" Dr. Raul Pino, the local health officer for the Florida Department of Health in Orange County, told the Orlando Sentinel that in tracking most diseases like gonorrhea or HIV, negative tests typically aren’t reported, but in a pandemic, calculating the positivity rate is important to track the spread. As for the errors, Pino said they don’t explain the state’s overall outbreak. ""It takes a lot to change"" the state’s overall positivity rate, Pino said. The state Department of Health and Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office did not respond to our request for additional information on how sites report test results. On July 15, DeSantis echoed Pino’s point, saying ""a number of labs are still doing the default, sending positive only without negatives. They are not trying to be underhanded. But we have identified it and they will start doing the negatives as well."" A Facebook post claimed: ""Wrong"" COVID-19 case count by Orlando Health ""explains the 'outbreak' in Florida."" State data show one hospital in the 13-hospital Orlando Health system reporting a 98% positive rate on its 522 coronavirus tests. However, systemwide, Orlando Health’s positive rate is about 10%. Around the state, some small labs have reported only positive tests to the state, possibly skewing to a small extent Florida’s overall positive test rate. But the size of the COVID-19 outbreak in Florida is reflected in the overall numbers — including the 301,810 total cases and Florida setting a one-day national record for cases.

Claim that Marquette threatened admission over pro-Trump views is greatly exaggerated
","Marquette University has drawn widespread criticism after an array of online sources picked up on claims of political bias made by an incoming freshman. The controversy dates back to June 7, 2020, when Samantha Pfefferle — an incoming freshman who had been accepted to the school — posted a video on the social media platform TikTok about how people ""try to hate on me"" for supporting President Donald Trump. It also featured a handwritten sign saying, ""Marquette University 2024."" That launched a series of events that has grown to include international news coverage, strong criticism from a leading state lawmaker and a tweet from Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son and confidante. ""Defund academic leftist indoctrination! It’s truly sad what’s going on in college campuses,"" Trump Jr. wrote in a July 8, 2020, tweet. ""Marquette University threatened to rescind student’s admission over pro-Trump TikTok video."" The tweet linked to an account of Pfefferle’s situation from thecollegefix.com, which used the same wording about Marquette threatening to rescind admission over the video. That same language was picked up in coverage by the New York Post, The Sun and The Daily Mail, among other news outlets. And it was the foundation of a July 15, 2020, letter from state Rep. Dave Murphy, chairman of the Assembly Committee on Colleges and Universities, condemning Marquette’s actions. Murphy, R-Greenville, asked Marquette to defend its actions, asked if the school was going to fire the admissions dean who spoke with Pfefferle and said he was considering holding a committee hearing on ""political bias and intimidation utilized in the admissions processes of our public and private universities."" So it’s time to clarify what happened here. Did Marquette really threaten to rescind admission based on a student’s support of Trump, as Trump Jr. claimed in his tweet? We’ll start with the background, since it’s a bit of a tangled tale. After Pfefferle’s TikTok video was posted — under the username conservativegirl0 — she told various media outlets she received a barrage of negative comments and even threats of injury and death. One Instagram user launched a campaign to get Pfefferle’s Marquette admission revoked by creating a form letter for people to send to the university’s admission office. That campaign stemmed from another social media post Pfefferle made about not believing a biological man can claim to be a woman, Pfefferle said. Responding to these reports, Marquette University Dean of Admissions Brian Troyer and another official had a Zoom meeting with the New London High School graduate. What happened on that call is a matter of dispute that we’ll get into shortly. In the wake of that call, Pfefferle began telling her story to various conservative media outlets in late June and early July. Many of their reports implied in headlines and social media posts that Pfefferle’s admission was in doubt because of her politics, leading to criticism of the Catholic, Jesuit university in conservative circles. There are two elements to the claim Trump Jr. repeated in his tweet: 1) Pfefferle’s admission was threatened, and 2) that happened as a result of her pro-Trump video. We’ll examine those one by one. The connection to the video is the simpler claim to address. And it’s simply wrong. The TikTok video — with 600,000 views and counting — is what attracted the most attention, but the complaints to Marquette that prompted the school’s involvement were about other posts by Pfefferle. ""Marquette received hundreds of emails, social media messages and formal bias-incident reports from current students, alumni and others regarding the incoming student’s social media posts and her comments on social media, which some deemed to be ‘transphobic and racist’ language,"" university spokeswoman Lynn Griffith told PolitiFact Wisconsin in an email. ""The concerns brought to us by hundreds of students and non-students were not specific to that (pro-Trump) TikTok. Rather, the messages and formal bias incident reports referenced other posts on the student’s social channels."" We didn’t find any allegation from Pfefferle in her various interviews that the video or her support of Trump were brought up in discussions with Marquette admissions staffers. So the controversy didn’t stem merely from her conservative ideology or this specific video supporting Trump. It’s less clear what impact, if any, this all had on Pfeffele’s admission. She remains enrolled and slated to attend classes this fall. And the university said in a statement released July 8, 2020, that it ""has not rescinded, nor did it threaten to rescind, her admission."" At issue are multiple interpretations of what happened on that Zoom call between Pfefferle and admissions officials. Griffith said Marquette officials had a conversation with Pfefferle based on the numerous ""bias"" complaints filed against her, and because her safety had been threatened by online posters. ""This particular incoming student was not treated any differently than any other incoming student where there are either concerns from members of our community and/or threats to safety,"" Griffith said. ""The objective of the conversation was to have a dialogue on how to live and interact with students and community members with different political views within our diverse community."" Griffith said admissions decisions ""are made based on academic achievements and student involvement, not political views."" Pfefferle — who did not respond to a request for comment — interpreted that exchange differently. She told Empower Wisconsin for a July 2, 2020, story that Troyer told her she wasn’t considered a student yet, although she had been accepted, paid for housing and been assigned roommates. She told radio host Todd Starnes on a June 30, 2020, podcast that she was put through a series of ""morality tests,"" asking her how she would interact with students with views different from hers. She said Marquette brought up social media posts going back to when she was 15 years old (she’s now 18).  Pfefferle told Laura Ingraham on Fox News on July 13, 2020, that she didn’t hear back for a week and a half after that meeting, during which time she assumed her admission status was in jeopardy. Pfefferle told The College Fix website for a July 7, 2020, story, ""This means that my classification is still in limbo."" Griffith said the week-plus delay was because the university was closed the week of June 29, as part of an annual closure around the Fourth of July. The account on thecollegefix.com — written by a freshman creative-writing student at the University of Wisconsin — summarized the situation as involving a threat to rescind Pfefferle’s admission over her pro-Trump TikTok video. And that’s the narrative that took hold, repeated by numerous media outlets and retweeted by Trump Jr. Murphy, the chair of the Assembly higher education committee, simply stated the reported threat as fact in a news release July 15, 2020. In a followup email to PolitiFact Wisconsin he said that was based on ""reporting I’ve seen"" and statements Pfefferle made in interviews. But Pfefferle never attributed the admissions concerns to the pro-Trump video. And we didn’t find any interviews where Pfefferle herself described it as a threat. On Fox News she was explicitly asked if Marquette told her they could rescind her admission. ""No, they told me I wasn’t a student, and then that I would hear back from them in a couple days, and then it took them a week and a half,"" Pfefferle said. A widespread claim repeated by Trump Jr. said Marquette University threatened to rescind a student’s admission over a pro-Trump TikTok video. The ""threat"" claim and connection to the video largely boil down to a student writer’s oversimplified description of a complex situation that was assumed as truth as it increasingly made the rounds online. That video attribution element is wrong. The issue that got Marquette — and the hundreds of people who contacted it in a campaign orchestrated online — involved related to comments on topics like sexuality and immigration in other posts. The allegation that Pfefferle’s admission status was threatened in some form is trickier, and gets into he-said, she-said territory. Pfefferle clearly felt her admission could be in doubt, but  the university said no threat was made. And Pfefferle herself hasn’t described the situation quite that way either. Putting that all together, we are left with a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/16/donald-trump-jr/marquette-admission-trump-samantha-pfefferle/

Existing research shows lower rate of children getting, spreading COVID-19
","Iowa, like many other states, faces a calendar-driven fact: the beginning of another school year. The state’s governor, Kim Reynolds, says schools should re-open for students who do not have health conditions that would put them at risk if exposed to the novel coronavirus.  ""Kids are less likely to get it,"" Reynolds said at a July 14, 2020, news conference about children’s susceptibility to the virus, COVID-19. ""They’re less likely to spread. So I think there’s some pretty good data out there that will help alleviate some of the concerns."" PolitiFact has visited this topic previously, stating that children can catch the virus but that their symptoms aren’t as potent as those in older people. And, President Trump has called forcefully for schools to re-open for the next school year. Deciding to re-open schools that have been closed since mid-March in Iowa while the coronavirus pandemic continues has been a balancing act. Parents and teachers are dealing with the virus’s health threat on students, teachers and staff but also fear negative effects on children isolated at home instead of learning face-to-face with teachers and interacting with other children. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association and the School Superintendents Association are on record saying interaction is necessary but also caution against moving unsafely when reopening schools. While there’s no mistaking that a child ill with the virus would deal with discomfort, or in a worse scenario serious health risks, existing research backs up Reynold’s statement about the virus’ incidence rate and spread rate for children and research backing that up. In Iowa, 5% of people testing positive for COVID-19 as of July 15 were 17 or younger, state data showed on July 16, 2020. That’s lower than the national rate, which shows 10% of Americans testing positive for COVID-19 were age 17 or younger, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed July 16. Almost one-half of Iowa’s COVID-19 cases were detected in people ages 18 to 40.  Researchers concluding, to date, that young children are at less risk than older adults of catching or spreading the virus include: An international research team conducting studies in China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. They concluded that the risk of transmitting the virus under the age of 20 could be as much as one-half the risk for those over the age of 20. They published their findings June 16, 2020, with Nature Medicine. Doctors and researchers at Mayo Clinic, of Rochester, Minnesota. ""While all children are capable of getting the virus that causes COVID-19, they don't become sick as often as adults,"" the clinic’s COVID-19 section on its website states. ""Children also rarely experience severe illness with COVID-19. Despite many large outbreaks around the world, very few children have died."" Chinese researchers whose work was published in July 2020 in Pediatrics, the American Academy of Pediatrics journal. University of Vermont researchers writing in Pediatrics’ July 2020 issue, which also published American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for returning to school classrooms.  A research team in Dresden, Germany. (more on that later) A World Health Organization-China joint report from February 2020. Skepticism has existed about the WHO-China report, especially when testing only was done in hospitals. Also, some researchers caution that infection and transmission rates among young people aren’t as high as they are for adults because the youths have not been exposed as much as adults to the virus. And that CDC data? It shows a higher percentage of people age 17 and younger who are tested for the virus showing up positive. Part of the reason for those CDC numbers is that fewer children than adults have been tested, and that what testing has been done has been with children suspected to be at risk. ""Our data is skewed originally to people with symptoms, and then skewed to adults over 18,"" Dr. Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said at a July 8, 2020, White House news briefing. More in-depth study of COVID-19’s affect on children is needed, she said.  Five days later, German researchers released a study of students in their country who were exposed to each other in school that, the researchers said, could indicate that COVID-19 might not spread as much among the youths as feared.  Pediatricians at Dresden University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus said they reached their conclusions after studying blood samples taken in May and June from 1,541 youths mostly in eighth through 11th grade. The samples were from 13 secondary schools and part of a 2,045-sample test that also included teachers, the researchers said. Reynolds said, ""Kids are less likely to get it (COVID-19). You know, they’re less likely to spread. So I think there’s some pretty good data out there that will help alleviate some of the concerns."" Reynolds’ assertion is supported by the bulk of the existing research, which shows that scientists have seen lower COVID-19 infection rates among young people and have not seen the virus spread among children at the rate as high as the ones for adults. However, researchers have only been able to study the virus since late January 2020, and they are learning more about it by the day. There may also be statistical quirks affecting the data, such as the limited extent to which children are being tested for the virus. Reynolds’ statement is largely supported by the research published so far, but with a big caveat that the science is preliminary and evolving.

Post crediting Blackfeet Tribe leader for Washington logo is true
","After decades of resistance, the NFL’s Washington franchise announced it will retire its longtime name and logo. The team announced the decision after it conducted an internal review amid mounting pressure from sponsors and protests that its name is racist and offensive to Native Americans. But posts on Facebook attempt to present a different perspective, noting that the logo was designed by a former leader of the Blackfeet Nation tribe who once said it ""made us all proud to have an Indian on a big-time team."" The post, which displays the logo next to a photo of what appears to be an American Indian, says:  ""Walter ‘Blackie’ Wetzel, a Blackfeet leader, designed the Redskins logo in 1972, inspired by Chief Two Guns White Calf. ‘It made us all so proud to have an Indian on a big-time team. It’s only a small group of radicals who oppose those names. Indians are proud of Indians.’ -Walter ‘Blackie’ Wetzel, 2002, Washington Post.""    The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This is mostly accurate. Walter Wetzel, a former Blackfeet tribal chairman, is credited as the driving force behind the creation of the team’s current logo, and the quote attributed to him is genuine. But he himself did not ""design"" the logo.  This history doesn’t change the fact that numerous American Indian tribes and advocacy groups, including ones Wetzel was affiliated with, have called for the team to change its name and imagery for years.  Members of Wetzel’s family told media outlets that they’re sad to see the logo go, but agreed the name needs to be changed. The team was initially based in Boston and was called the Braves before former owner George Preston Marshall gave it the latest name in 1933. The team relocated to Washington, D.C. in 1937 and received the first of its trademarks for the name in 1967.  In 1972, Native American leaders representing multiple organizations requested that the team change its name, calling it a derogatory racial epithet.  Wetzel, who had served as the Blackfeet tribal chairman and president of the National Congress of American Indians, asked team executives that same year to drop the ""R"" logo that was used at the time in favor of a profile of an Indian warrior.  Wetzel spoke with the Washington Post in 2002, shortly before he died, and said he had told the team he’d like to see an Indian on their helmets instead of the big R.  Within weeks, the team had a new logo based on a composite of Native American photographs, including one of early 20th-century Blackfeet chief, Two Guns White Calf.  ""It made us all so proud to have an Indian on a big-time team,"" Wetzel told the paper, ""It's only a small group of radicals who oppose those names. Indians are proud of Indians."" Almost five decades later, Wetzel’s family expressed mixed reactions to the team’s announcement.  His grandson, Bill Wetzel, told the Great Falls, Mont., Tribune (which is based about two hours from the Blackfeet Indian Reservation) that his grandfather was a good, honest man, and it bothered him that his grandfather’s name had been associated with a racial slur, but that times had changed. Jacob Wetzel, his great-grandson, told the paper that while the name change is ""long overdue,"" he was still sad to see the family legacy go. The NCAI, which describes itself as the country’s oldest, largest and most representative American Indian and Alaska Native advocacy organization, has pushed for the team to drop the name and imagery for years.   The organization commended the team for its decision. ""We thank the generations of tribal nations, leaders, and activists who worked for decades to make this day possible. We commend the Washington NFL team for eliminating a brand that disrespected, demeaned, and stereotyped all Native people, and we call on all other sports teams and corporate brands to retire all caricatures of Native Americans that they use as their mascots,"" the group said in a statement. ""We are not mascots — we are Native people, citizens of more than 500 tribal nations who have stood strong for millennia and overcome countless challenges to reach this pivotal moment in time when we can help transform America into the just, equitable, and compassionate country our children deserve,"" it said. But not all tribal members agree with the name change. Some say that the logo has been a point of pride, while others say teams like Washington that use Native American mascots are guilty of cultural appropriation and exploitation. Posts on Facebook say Walter Wetzel, a former Blackfeet Nation tribal leader, ""designed the Redskins logo"" and said it made Native Americans proud. Wetzel persuaded team executives in 1972 to change its logo to a profile of an Indian warrior, though he himself did not design it. He did once say in a Washington Post interview that it ""made us all proud to have an Indian on a big-time team."" Meanwhile, numerous tribes and Native American organizations say the team’s name and imagery is offensive and have fought for years to have it changed.

No, FEMA isn’t giving Americans $1,000
","Just before the July 15 tax deadline, a hoax disguised as good news started spreading on social media. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to Facebook posts, was giving Americans another grand.  ""Everyone including essential workers will be compensated $1,000,"" read one such post using FEMA’s logo. ""The money will be available to you in 5-7 business days. Thank me later! Click the link to sign up."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That’s because the link you’re supposed to click to sign up leads to an image of a gorilla flipping off the camera. FEMA isn’t providing assistance to individuals and families affected by the coronavirus, according to its website.  Misinformation about the coronavirus has been pervasive during the pandemic. FEMA has a page dedicated to ""coronavirus rumor control"" debunking several other wrong claims.  We rate this post Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2020/jul/15/facebook-posts/no-fema-isnt-giving-americans-1000/
