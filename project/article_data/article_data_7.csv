There are no atheist candidates.
","Huckabee says there are ""probably plenty"" of presidential candidates who do not believe in God. But the major candidates have all professed a belief in God and in fact most of them have made their faith in God an apparent element of their campaigns.
 
 
John Edwards said during a CNN candidates' forum that he has ""a deep and abiding love for my Lord, Jesus Christ,"" while Hillary Clinton said prayer helped her weather her husband's infidelity. Barack Obama is a prominent member of Chicago's Trinity United Church of Christ.
 
Among Republicans, Mitt Romney, a Mormon, said during the Republican debate, ""I believe in God, believe in the Bible, believe Jesus Christ is my savior."" John McCain's campaign created a commercial where McCain speaks into the camera about his faith in God.

Playing fast and loose with numbers
","It's not entirely clear from the context whether Giuliani is talking about the Democratic presidential candidates or the Democrats in Congress.
 
But it doesn't really matter, especially since so many in the Democratic field of candidates are in the Senate or the House. Either way, Giuliani is correct that Democrats are open to letting some of the tax cuts of 2001 expire, which would raise taxes for those affected.
 
Most of the Democratic presidential candidates have said they want to renew some of the those tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire in 2010. But they also have indicated that they would favor allowing tax cuts to expire that, in their view, unfairly benefit wealthy Americans. The tax rate on household incomes above $200,000 would return to higher levels, as would taxes on capital gains, dividends and estates.
 
But is that a 20 to 30 percent increase?
 
To defend his claim, the Giuliani campaign points to a Congressional Budget Office report that shows a 31 percent rise in revenue from 2006 to 2011 if all of the tax cuts are allowed to expire.
 
There are two problems with this. First of all, the Democrats aren't advocating the elimination of

all

of the 2001 tax cuts. And second, the logic of the Giuliani argument is that a rise in revenues is the same as a tax increase.
 
If that's the standard, than President Bush's own budget for 2008, released in February, includes a 29 percent tax increase over the same period, too.
 
Nope, that doesn't cut it.

Richardson takes credit for new jobs
 ","Statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that New Mexico gained 75,800 jobs from December 2002 to July 2007, which is slightly lower than Richardson's claim.

, Richardson has consistently cited the higher number, even when the actual number was lower.
 
For our ruling, however, we'll rely on the current 75,800 and call it mostly true.
 
It's difficult to calculate how big a role his tax cuts played in getting businesses to create those jobs.
 
James Peach, an economics professor at New Mexico State University, said many factors make a company decide to add jobs and that tax incentives often play only a modest role. Indeed, much of the job growth in the state began before Richardson became governor, Peach said.
 
Still, Peach said Richardson's tax incentives and income tax cuts have created a favorable atmosphere for business that is a stark change from the state's mentality in the mid-1970s, when state officials refused to provide help to a promising young company named Microsoft.

Accurate, but exploits misconception and uses unrealistic scenario
","Obama's Mideast oil claim, made to the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees on June 26, is artful sleight-of-hand.
 
He relies on an extremely optimistic (and possibly unrealistic) notion that the U.S. fleet would average 40-45 mpg at some point in the near future. He does not specify whether he means 40-45 mpg in the equivalent of today's tests (which would mean on-road performance much lower) or if he means on-road. Since he used the testing standard before, we'll assume the same here, which would equate to 35 mpg in the real world. At 35 mpg, Schipper estimates fuel usage could be reduced by about 40 percent.
 
Instead of simply saying it would reduce fuel use by 40 percent, Obama shrewdly plays on the belief by many Americans that the U.S. is heavily dependent on Mideast oil.
 
""Contrary to popular belief, we don't import a lot of oil from the Middle East,"" said
said John DeCicco, a senior fellow for automotive strategies with the advocacy group Environmental Defense.
 
In fact, the U.S. gets less than 20 percent of its imported oil from the Mideast, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. gets almost twice as much oil from Canada than it gets from Saudi Arabia.
 
Obama is correct that a reduction in oil demand because of more fuel efficient cars could theoretically eliminate the need to import any oil from the Mideast. But he ignores the reality of global petroleum markets. ""It's not correct to say that we can specify where we buy our oil,"" Schipper said. ""Oil goes into one big world barrel.""
 
Obama's comment ""if we import zero oil from the Middle East, that means the gas prices are going to go down at the pump"" is a bit of a stretch. Given the volatility of oil prices and the time it, the price at the pump might still go up because of other factors. But under his scenario, it would go up less.

Technically correct, but uses unrealistic numbers
","In a speech to the Detroit Economic Club on May 7, 2007, Obama said the U.S. needs to make more fuel-efficient cars. ""While our fuel standards haven't moved from 27.5 miles per gallon in two decades, both China and Japan have surpassed us, with Japanese cars now getting an average of 45 miles to the gallon.""
 
Obama's claim about Japanese cars getting more than 45 mpg involves the fuzzy science of measuring fuel economy, complicated by differing standards in each nation. Obama's campaign says his number comes from a 2004 study by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change that calculated Japanese cars would get 46 mpg if Japan followed the same test methods as the U.S. (Obama accurately says the U.S. mandate has been 27.5 for 20 years.)
 
Obama's claim is technically correct. But the Pew numbers exaggerate the differences between the countries because those estimates do not reflect real-world conditions, according to Lee Schipper, director of research at the World Resources Institute's Center for Transport and Environment.
 
He says the Japanese fleet actually averages about 23 mpg on the road today, but is improving. The U.S. number is only slightly lower, about 21, but has been stagnant. The real-world numbers are closer because, despite more fuel-efficient cars in Japan, heavy traffic congestion erases much of the efficiency.
 
Schipper said Obama ""is correct that Japan's fuel efficiency is higher and improving more rapidly, but his number is inaccurate. The number he used doesn't really represent a realistic on-road achievement.""
 
Yet Schipper said he doesn't fault Obama for the confusion. ""Everybody makes this mistake. What matters is what cars really get on the road, how long it takes to change the entire fleet and how much people drive."" (Japanese drivers drive about one-third as many miles per year as U.S. drivers.)

Fact-checking Rudy Giuliani’s ties to a hydroxychloroquine manufacturer
","Rudy Giuliani’s promotion of a lupus and arthritis drug to treat COVID-19 patients is raising eyebrows about his motivation. In an interview with Fox News on April 5, Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, said hydroxychloroquine could potentially be used to alleviate symptoms associated with the coronavirus. ""I think we should let doctors decide whether we should use hydroxychloroquine, not the national bureaucracy,"" he said. ""Everything shows that it works."" Giuliani’s comments echo what Trump has said over the past few weeks, despite the fact that medical experts still don’t know much about the drug’s efficacy against COVID-19. (Not every study shows that it works, for instance.) But a tweet published the same day as the Fox interview claims Giuliani has ulterior motives for promoting the drug. ""Here @whpresscorps Ask Trump about THIS!!"" @Wiseronenow said in the tweet. ""‘Giuliani, in early February, bought $2M in shares of Novartis, a primary supplier of hydroxychloroquine. How many shares did Sean Hannity & the Trump family buy?’"" (Screenshot from Twitter) The tweet was referred to us by VineSight, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation. We found the same claim circulating on Facebook, where some posts also implicated President Donald Trump. ""Novartis also paid Michael Cohen $1M in payments in 2016,"" one post reads, referring to Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney. ""Also Trump had a 1 on 1 meeting with Novartis CEO in January 2020."" We’ve seen a lot of misinformation about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, so we wanted to take a closer look at Giuliani and Trump’s financial interests in the drugs and their manufacturers. We could find no evidence that Giuliani purchased stock in Novartis in early February. The company paid Cohen more than $1 million in consulting fees in 2017, not 2016. And while Trump did attend a dinner with a Novartis leader in January, it was not a one-on-one meeting with the CEO. Novartis is a Swiss pharmaceutical company. It has donated hydroxychloroquine to the U.S. National Strategic Stockpile for use in treating COVID-19 patients. On March 29, the Department of Health and Human Services published a statement saying that it had accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated by Sandoz, the generics division of Novartis. The company said in an earlier press release that it plans to give out 130 million doses by the end of May. The donation came after Trump said during a March 19 press briefing that chloroquine could potentially be used to treat COVID-19. But the research is far from settled. RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know Two studies, one from France and one from China, found that hydroxychloroquine helped people clear the virus quickly and alleviate symptoms. But two other studies found that the drug had no discernible effect on the coronavirus. With more than 50 studies still in the works, the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 is still unproven.  Novartis has said criticism that the drug is unproven and the company is profiting from it is ""without merit."" Now let’s take a closer look at any ties to Trump and his lawyers. While Novartis has paid Giuliani in the past, we could find no evidence that the former New York mayor has a current financial connection to the company. A search of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s database, which contains information about publicly traded companies, turned up no documents linking Giuliani to Novartis. We also found no mention of Giuliani on the company’s website. A 2007 financial disclosure form from Giuliani, who campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, shows that Novartis paid him a $60,000 gross speaker fee on Feb. 6, 2006. The company is not listed anywhere else on the form. The New York Times reported that Giuliani’s interest in hydroxychloroquine stems in part from his contact with Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, a New York physician who has been giving the drug to people with coronavirus-like symptoms. Giuliani told the Times he does not have any financial interests in hydroxychloroquine. We reached out to him for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Novartis has had connections with another Trump associate. In May 2018, the company disclosed that it had paid Cohen, the former Trump personal attorney, for health care policy consulting. A Senate report published in July 2018 outlined how Cohen had received $1.2 million over a 12-month period ending in February 2018. A month after the deal was signed, Novartis ""determined he would not be able to provide the anticipated services,"" according to the report. However, Cohen was still paid for a year under the terms of the contract. In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. The connection between Cohen and Novartis has led some to speculate that Trump has financial motives for promoting hydroxychloroquine. Some Facebook users have claimed Trump met with the company ""one on one"" in January, making his recent promotion of the drug suspicious. There’s little evidence to back either claim up. Trump’s financial disclosure forms indicate that he has not held stock in Novartis since taking office. The last form filed was in May 2019. The New York Times reported that the president does have a stake in Sanofi, a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine, through a mutual fund. But the stake is rather small; the Washington Post reported that it’s ""between about $100 and $1,500 in total."" RELATED: Why experts worry about President Trump touting chloroquine As for the purported ""meeting"" between Trump and Novartis, there was a dinner the president attended with the company’s chairman — not its CEO — in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21. The event included a slew of executives from other companies around the world. Even if Trump or his associates did have some stake in Novartis, it’s uncertain whether they’d reap financial benefits from the increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine. The company is donating, not selling, nearly its entire supply of the drug. ""Any rumors that Novartis stands to benefit financially or otherwise from the donation of hydroxychloroquine is without merit,"" a company spokesman told PolitiFact in an email. Novartis shares spiked briefly after Trump began touting chloroquine on March 19, but since then they have performed about as well as the broader stock market. A tweet claimed that Rudy Giuliani bought $2 million in shares of Novartis in February. We could find no evidence that Giuliani has a current financial connection to Novartis, which has donated 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to the U.S. The company did pay consulting fees to a former Trump associate, but documents don’t show any financial connection between the president himself and Novartis. The meeting that Trump had with the company’s chairman in January was not one on one — it included many other business executives. Bottom line: Available evidence does not show any financial link between Giuliani or Trump and Novartis. Barring additional evidence, the tweet is inaccurate.

Is the government 'sneakily' trying to change encryption rules?
","A post now circulating on Instagram warns that pending legislation moving through Congress could allow the government to view anyone’s text messages and listen to phone conversations.  The March 17 post, which received at least 5,000 likes, said, ""While all COVID-19 news has been going on, the U.S. Government has been sneakily trying to remove end-to-end encryption, and it’s been working its way through Congress. If this passes, the government will be able to see all of your messages and listen to all of your calls, essentially removing all privacy from your conversations.""  The caption of the post refers to the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (EARN IT) Act of 2020. The post says:  ""EARN IT Act threatens end-to-end encryption.  ""While we’re all distracted by stockpiling latex gloves and toilet paper, there’s a bill tiptoeing through the US Congress that could inflict the backdoor virus that law enforcement agencies have been trying to inflict on encryption for years. ""At least, that’s the interpretation of digital rights advocates who say that the proposed EARN IT Act could harm free speech and data security."" The bill in question was introduced in March 2020 and given a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 11.  Here are some key elements of the bill, according to sponsors and media reports:  The bill amends section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally protects tech companies by saying they are not responsible for what users of their products upload.  It establishes a national commission to develop best practices to identify and report child exploitation. This commission would consist of the heads of the Justice and Homeland Security departments and the Federal Trade Commission, plus 16 other members appointed by Congress, and the guidelines would be subject to further approvals If child predators are caught on their systems, tech companies can either comply with these practices or abide by their own practices, as long as they’re approved by the commission.  The bill allows victims the chance to sue tech companies that don’t comply with practices approved by the commission.  The impetus for the bill is data showing the volume of child sexual abuse files. Reporting from the New York Times and research collected from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children CyberTipline show that in 2019, there were 16.9 million reports of problematic material, covering 69.1 million photos, videos and files of child sexual abuse, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Encryption is the process of encoding or scrambling a form of communication, such as an email or a text message, so that a key is needed in order to unscramble it, said Hannah Quay-de la Vallee, a senior technologist with the Center for Democracy and Technology, a group that supports civil liberties on the internet. This key — think of it as an extra-long password — is used to protect the data that is stored in a particular message. In encrypted systems that are not ""end to end,"" the tech platform that carries the message holds the keys to encode and decode the message. When two users message each other, Vallee said, ""the first user sends the message to a platform — that is one encrypted stream — and the platform re-encrypts it, sends it to the second user, the receiver of the message, and that’s a separate encryption stream.""  But an ""end to end"" encryption system means that the two users exchanging the message have their own keys.   End-to-end systems are more secure because only the two people communicating have keys, not the third-party tech platform over which their messages travel. But that set-up limits a tech platform’s ability to monitor messages for evidence of abuse or exploitation.  The EARN IT Act’s primary sponsor, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., argues that the bill won’t stop end-to-end encryption. In a press release, he called encryption ""a serious issue in the enforcement of child sexual-abuse material laws."" In Graham’s view, passage of the bill means that tech companies will be forced to address child exploitation occurring on their networks. He argues that this is a narrow intervention and dismisses assertions that it is a slippery slope to wider government access to private data. ""Our goal is bring these companies to the table and give them a choice: Prevent the exploitation of children online and stop the proliferation of child sexual abuse material, or face the same liability as every other industry in America,"" Graham said in the release.  The post is partially accurate in spotlighting the tech industry’s concerns surrounding the EARN IT Act. The bill would require tech companies to provide the government access to certain information falling under the law, specifically that related to child exploitation. Whether to give the government so-called backdoor access to customer messages and uploads is a long-running debate, going back to at least the 1990s. Historically, it has pitted law enforcement against technology companies and advocates for civil liberties. Groups representing the tech sector have generally expressed concern about how much power the government should have to access user data in the name of pursuing lawbreakers. Dean Garfield, CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, released a statement in 2015 responding to the government's attempts to circumvent encryption technology.  ""We deeply appreciate law enforcement's and the national security community’s work to protect us,"" he said, ""but weakening encryption or creating backdoors to encrypted devices and data for use by the good guys would actually create vulnerabilities to be exploited by the bad guys,"" such as hackers. The post leaves out important context about the status and scope of the bill. For starters, there is no evidence that Congress is  ""sneakily"" advancing it during the coronavirus crisis, when lawmakers are expected to be away from the Capitol for safety reasons, except to pass urgent coronavirus legislation. Neither a committee nor the full Senate has voted on the bill yet, and the Senate will not meet again until at least April 20. The portion of the post that says ""the government will be able to see all of your messages and listen to all of your calls"" — is also an exaggeration. The bill in its current form is aimed at preventing the online sexual exploitation of children. It is not a green light for the government to spy on Americans willy nilly. While critics of the bill see it as a slippery slope — and there may be legitimate concern that the law could be abused — the post doesn’t mention any of the limits on the government’s powers. Charlie Mitchell, editor of Inside Cybersecurity and the author of ""Hacked: The Inside Story of America's Struggle to Secure Cyberspace,"" said the government has for years made its case for securing access to encrypted communications using the most dire scenario — putting a stop to child predators.  The tech sector tends to argue that once a backdoor is created, it could be exploited for other purposes. Quay-de la Vallee acknowledged that there is nothing in the EARN IT Act that explicitly limits end-to-end encryption. But it may have that practical effect, she said, since the bill would establish guidelines that require companies to scan communications for illegal materials. ""If companies would have to do this scanning, in order to get this legal protection, then seemingly they’re doing this on behalf of the U.S. government, and that makes them agents of the government. This means that anything they found is now subject to Fourth Amendment unreasonable-search concerns,"" she said.  The post said, ""While all COVID-19 news has been going on, the U.S. Government has been sneakily trying to remove end-to-end encryption"" which means ""the government will be able to see all of your messages and listen to all of your calls."" If the EARN IT Act passed — which is not imminent — it would make it easier for law enforcement to demand information from technology companies about certain users of their services. But the bill is receiving public scrutiny and proceeding through Congress in a typical way, so it’s not accurate to describe it as sneaky. The post is also misleading about the official scope of the act. Far from green-lighting government intrusion into ""all"" messages and calls, any such requests would have to be premised on a link to suspected child exploitation.  Whether that limitation would hold in practice is hotly debated between civil libertarians and law enforcement. The post contains an element of truth, but leaves out important context that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/apr/09/instagram-posts/government-sneakily-trying-change-encryption-rules/

""THIS IS A SCAM!!!!,"" Chief James Davis said in the post. ""Do not answer your door for individuals asking you to try on (a) mask for protection against the coronavirus."" He didn’t mention robbery or say that the masks were doused in chemicals that would knock out the victims who tried them on.  A spokesperson for the city did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s phone call and email asking if that has happened in the community there. Searching for more information about robbers handing out compromised face masks, however, we found no other news stories covering such reports. We did find several fact-checks from news organizations debunking the claim.  Certainly, there is criminal activity connected to face masks. The New York Post reported on April 8 that a businessman is accused of stealing and selling about 2 million masks. A New York Times story about ""coronavirus bandits"" details two armed robbers who stole as much as $270,000 from a racetrack in Queens wearing surgical masks. CNBC says people are stealing masks from doctors’ offices over coronavirus fears. Common sense advice would be not to try on masks offered by strangers. (And aren’t you supposed to be staying home anyway?) But we found no evidence would-be thieves were  actually doing what the post says.  There are no credible reports of people handing out masks doused with chemicals so they can rob passed-out victims.

Trump deflects Wis. social distancing questions by saying the state is “run by Democrats right now""
","Images from Wisconsin’s bizarre election on April 7, 2020, show lines stretching for hundreds of yards outside polling places around the state, with voters spaced out six feet apart. But many people reported social distancing was impossible to maintain throughout the voting process, with people at times bunching closer together. President Donald Trump was asked how the Wisconsin election — which he encouraged voters to turn out for — lined up with social distancing recommendations from his administration to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The question came up at his daily briefing on Election Day. ""Well, there you have to ask the people that,"" Trump said. ""You have a Democrat in Wisconsin as governor. Ask him. That's his problem. Okay? He should be doing it. Again, some governors fail, and I won't let them fail, because when they fail, I'll help. But that's run by Democrats right now. Okay? It's run by Democrats."" So Trump deflects a question about social distancing in Wisconsin by saying the state is ""run by Democrats."" Let’s take a minute to review who’s in charge here. We’ll start with this: Wisconsin hasn’t been run by Democrats since 2010. That’s the last time Democrats held the governor’s office and both houses of the Legislature. Republicans established their own trifecta in 2011, and maintained it until 2019, when Democratic Gov. Tony Evers was sworn in after defeating Republican incumbent Scott Walker. Since then, Wisconsin government has been defined by this split power, with Evers and the Legislature warring over matters big and small. The lack of unity was on full display leading up to the election, as Evers first pushed for a mail-in election with a May deadline, then tried to move the election back to June through an executive order. Republican leaders adjourned a special session on the mail-in option within seconds, then went to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to oppose the executive order — where the high court ruled in Republicans’ favor. We’ll note that court is currently a 5-2 conservative majority. So to recap the three branches: Yes, Wisconsin’s highest office is held by a Democrat. But the Legislature is strongly Republican — a 19-14 majority in the Senate and a 63-36 majority in the Assembly. And the state Supreme Court has a strong conservative bent as well, though it could move a notch pending the outcome of the race between Justice Daniel Kelly, who was backed by Republicans, and challenger Jill Karofsky, who was backed by Democrats. Asked whether Wisconsin is properly observing national social distancing guidelines in light of the election, Trump said to ask the Democrats who ""run"" Wisconsin. Trump is right that a Democrat, Evers, holds the state’s highest office. But Republicans control the other two branches. And the pre-election battles illustrated exactly how divided Wisconsin is, as Republicans thwarted two different attempts to alter or delay in-person voting. That makes Trump’s central point — that Democrats are to blame for any social distancing violations — all the more off base. So we are left with a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/apr/09/donald-trump/trump-deflects-wis-social-distancing-questions-say/

The University of Maryland was founded in the early 1800s under that name, but it was re-charted in 1812 with its current name.  We couldn’t find any research published by the university’s school of medicine that supports any of the post’s alleged cancer cures.  Ted Gansler, the strategic director of pathology research at the American Cancer Society, called the claims in the post ""absurd."" ""There’s no credible evidence to back any of the absurd claims in that post,"" Gansler wrote in an email. ""Furthermore, these claims are inconsistent with scientific understanding of how cancer cells grow, spread, and die."" According to a list of cancer myths compiled by the Mayo Clinic, more research is needed to understand the relationship between sugar in the diet and cancer. Although all cells, including cancer cells, depend on blood sugar for energy, more sugar doesn’t make cancer cells grow faster, just as deprivation doesn’t slow growth. The health group says the misconception that it does may be based on a misunderstanding of how imaging tests called PET scans work. The scans are used to help show how one’s tissues and organs are functioning. Patients take a drug, known as a ""radioactive tracer,"" typically a form of glucose.  ""All tissues in your body absorb some of this tracer, but tissues that are using more energy — including cancer cells — absorb greater amounts. For this reason, some people have concluded that cancer cells grow faster on sugar. But this isn't true,"" the organization says in the post. While Mayo points to evidence that links high sugar intake with an increased risk for cancer, such sugar consumption is also associated with other indicators that increase cancer risk such as weight gain, obesity and diabetes. But eliminating sugar altogether (and in combination with the treatments proposed in this post) does not ""cause cancer to die a natural death,"" as the post says.  One study found that coconut oil reduced side effects of chemotherapy in some breast cancer patients, and another found that lauric acid, a component of coconut oil, can inhibit growth of colon cancer cells. But medical researchers say there’s no evidence that it cures all types of cancer, in any stage, outright. The National Center for Health Research, a D.C.-based nonprofit medical research organization, addressed rumors about lemons and cancer and said that the fruit is ""not a proven remedy against cancer of all types and no studies have ever been done that would compare the effectiveness of a lemon to chemotherapy.""

Trump claims his judicial endorsement caused Tony Evers to attempt election delay. It didn't
","The mid-pandemic election in Wisconsin yielded no shortage of bizarre storylines. But a noteworthy one emerged late in the day when President Donald Trump tried to put himself at the center of a debate over whether the election should have even been held as scheduled. The April 7, 2020, contest featured a Democratic presidential primary and a Wisconsin Supreme Court race between conservative-backed Daniel Kelly and liberal-backed Jill Karofsky, as well as numerous local elections. At his daily briefing that day, Trump connected his endorsement of Kelly to Gov. Tony Evers’ last-minute attempt to change the election. The implication was Democrats thought they’d have a better chance of boosting Karofsky by extending the election period. Here’s an excerpt of Trump’s extended discussion on the topic: ""(Wisconsin Democrats) didn't want to move the election. As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats say, ‘Oh, let's move the election to two months later, three.’ They didn't mind having the election until I endorsed him, which is very interesting."" So Trump is saying his endorsement caused Evers to try moving the election back two months. Let’s take a closer look at that timeline. In case you lost track of the election back-and-forth, the basics are these: Evers had said for weeks he didn’t have the authority to move the election on his own. Then on Friday — four days before the election — he called on the Republican Legislature to switch to an all-mail election that would allow votes to come in through May 19, 2020. He also ordered a special session of the Legislature for the following day to take up the matter. The state Assembly and Senate both gaveled out of that session in seconds, without taking action. Then, 18 hours before polls opened, Evers issued an order to delay the election to June 9, 2020. Republicans appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, where the conservative majority overturned Evers’ order, clearing the way to hold the election. Trump is claiming his endorsement of Kelly was a pivotal moment in this back-and-forth. Trump sent a tweet at 12:12 p.m. April 3, 2020, saying Kelly has his ""complete endorsement."" Evers’ call for a mail-in election was released about an hour later. But that’s a coincidence. Here’s why Trump is wrong. Evers’ call at that point was not to move the election by two months, but to switch the format to mail-in only and extend the deadline to May. The attempt to move the in-person election to June didn’t come until several days later. And the Evers’ administration had been moving toward that mail-in announcement well before Trump’s tweet, including calls to Republican leaders, said Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff. But there’s a much more glaring oversight from Trump. He had already endorsed Kelly several months earlier. At a rally in Milwaukee on Jan. 14, 2020, Trump urged his supporters to ""go vote for Justice Daniel Kelly to defend the rule of law."" At that time, of course, coronavirus was barely a blip on the national radar. And it was the pandemic that fueled the back-and-forth over Wisconsin’s election, not a repeat of a prior endorsement. In a statement later on Election Day, Evers said Trump was not a factor in his decision-making. ""I don’t pay any attention to who the president endorses,"" the governor said. ""Frankly, my focus right now is on keeping the people of this state safe, and that’s why I issued an executive order to extend Wisconsin’s election date and make sure everyone could vote safely from home."" Trump claims his endorsement of Kelly caused the Wisconsin attempts to push the election back until June. That’s not at all how it happened. Trump had already endorsed Kelly back in January.  And in any case, the action from Evers that coincidentally followed Trump’s reiterated endorsement on Twitter was to shift to a mail-in election, not to move the whole election by several months. That leaves us with a claim that is both false and ridiculous. We rate this Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2020/apr/08/donald-trump/trump-claims-his-judicial-endorsement-caused-tony-/

Louisiana governor is right, there was no suggestion Mardi Gras had to be canceled
","Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards on CNN was asked whether Mardi Gras celebrations in his state should have been called off earlier this year, in light of Louisiana now being considered a hotspot in the coronavirus pandemic. In New Orleans, the Carnival parades and celebrations started early January and ended Feb. 25 on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday). It’s estimated that more than 1 million people go to New Orleans annually for the Carnival season and experts now believe the festivities fueled the outbreak. ""The biggest Mardi Gras parades in Louisiana took place on Feb. 25, just as the national outbreak was starting. In retrospect, if you knew then what you know now, would you have canceled Mardi Gras?"" CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Edwards on April 5. ""Well, you know you don't get a do-over like that, Jake,"" Edwards said. ""There was not a single suggestion by anyone, a doctor, a scientist, a political figure, that we needed to cancel Mardi Gras. And, you know, in February, we had a Super Bowl, and it wasn't canceled and so forth."" Edwards’ comments echoed a similar statement from New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell 10 days earlier on CNN that there were ""no red flags"" from federal officials to suggest the festivities should be aborted. PolitiFact wondered if it’s true that there were no suggestions back in January or February that mass gatherings like Mardi Gras be canceled. We reviewed statements from President Donald Trump, and guidance from federal and state public health agencies and found that Edwards was right. Public health professors in Louisiana also told PolitiFact that there was no suggestion, prior to Mardi Gras, of community spread in the United States, much less New Orleans. The earliest suggestion we found from a federal agency saying that large events may need to be canceled came Feb. 26, after Mardi Gras celebrations. On Twitter and in public remarks, Trump did not suggest that large public events be canceled. In India on Feb. 25 and before leaving for India on Feb. 23, Trump said the coronavirus was very ""under control"" in the United States. Trump tweeted about the virus at least eight times from January to Feb. 25. His tweets generally said that his administration was in contact with China and others about the coronavirus, offered praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s handling of the outbreak, and said that his administration was monitoring developments and had it under control. On Lundi Gras, the day before Mardi Gras, he tweeted:  The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me! When the U.S. declared the coronavirus a public health emergency on Jan. 31, the government did not say that mass gatherings be canceled. Throughout January and most of February, U.S. officials said that the coronavirus risk to the American public was low and that they were not seeing community spread of the virus. By Feb. 25, there were 53 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States and no deaths, according to data compiled by the World Health Organization. On Feb. 26, the day after Mardi Gras, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doctor told reporters that the coronavirus situation was rapidly evolving and that the virus was spreading worldwide. There were still only a few cases in the United States and no reports of community spread, but that would eventually change, said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. She said there were mitigation guidelines that people and communities could take during a pandemic when there wasn’t a vaccine or proven medical treatment for the disease. ""On a larger scale, communities and cities may need to modify, postpone, or cancel mass gatherings,"" Messonnier said. Local communities would need to figure out which guidelines to implement and when, she said, based on the severity and the transmission of the disease and what could be done locally. On Feb. 28, Messonnier said it was possible that a reported case in California ""could be the first instance of community spread — meaning the illness was acquired through an unknown exposure in the community."" But it could also be that the patient was exposed through contact to a traveler who was infected, Messonnier said. The immediate risk to the general American public remained low, she said. On Feb. 29, a health official from Washington state, where there were four presumptive cases of COVID-19, joined a CDC press briefing and said the state was ""starting to see some spread in the community"" and the public risk was increasing. ""Should we start to see more spread in Washington, we might consider recommending measures like cancelling large public events,"" said Kathy Lofy, the state health officer at the Washington state department of health. There were no reported cases of coronavirus in Louisiana during the weeks-long Carnival celebrations. The state’s department of health in blog posts as late as Feb. 21 said that the coronavirus threat to Louisiana was very low and that people should be more worried about the flu. It recommended that people wash their hands and get a flu shot, since it was still flu season. Louisiana’s first presumptive case of coronavirus was reported March 9, two days before the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus a pandemic. On March 13, when Louisiana had 33 presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, Edwards signed a proclamation to stop gatherings of more than 250 people and close all K-12 public schools statewide to slow the spread of the disease. Based on models created mid-March, it’s assumed that infections silently spread in crowded parades during Mardi Gras, said Susanne Straif-Bourgeois, an associate professor of epidemiology at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans. Soon after Mardi Gras, epidemiologists from nearby states began reporting confirmed cases of coronavirus in people who had traveled to New Orleans for the festivities. But at the time that parade-goers gathered in streets with family and friends, it was not known that the virus was in the state, Straif-Bourgeois said. In his CNN interview with Edwards, Tapper said the Washington Post reported that governors had a gala in Washington, D.C. in early February, and that a group of governors met with federal experts who gave ""the same dire warning that they’re giving now."" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told the Washington Post, ""The doctors and the scientists, they were telling us then exactly what they are saying now."" Edwards told Tapper that in that Feb. 9 briefing, ""we spoke generally about the novel coronavirus"" and that it was ""not accurate to say that they gave the same sort of information that they are providing right now,"" since a lot more is now known about the virus. Edwards’ deputy chief of staff, Christina Stephens, told PolitiFact that at that briefing, the virus was described as low risk and there was no suggestion that large gatherings be canceled. In a Feb. 9 press release about the briefing, the U.S. Health and Human Services department said the task force ""reiterated that while this is a serious public health matter, the risk to the American public remains low at this time, and that the federal government will continue working in close coordination with state and local governments to keep it that way."" Edwards said of the coronavirus threat, ""there was not a single suggestion by anyone, a doctor, a scientist, a political figure, that we needed to cancel Mardi Gras."" New Orleans Mardi Gras celebrations began early January and ended Feb. 25. PolitiFact reviewed public comments from Trump, federal and state health officials on and before Feb. 25 and did not find suggestions that large public events be cancelled. At that time, there was no report of community spread of the virus. Edwards’ statement is accurate.

Only a few get an unemployment ‘pay raise’
","Some people who continue to work through the coronavirus outbreak are upset that they’re getting no additional pay, while some unemployed people are now receiving more in unemployment benefits than they were paid on the job. The frustration was expressed in a Facebook post directed at New York’s Democratic governor. ""OK, so now we have a problem, Mr. Governor Andrew Cuomo,"" the post begins. ""Non-essential people get to file for unemployment and make two to three times more than normal. The average worker bringing home $250-350 a week would be sitting at home getting $900 a week, while us essential workers are at risk putting our lifes (sic) on the line to provide for our families to make the same we always make."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is possible for workers in that pay range to receive unemployment payments that are two or nearly three times higher than what they were paid on the job. That’s the result of a federal stimulus bill signed by President Donald Trump, not due to any action taken by Cuomo. It includes $600 bonuses on weekly unemployment checks. But even with the bonus, higher-income workers who lose their jobs will receive less money on unemployment than they did on the job. As we’ve reported: The federal government’s largest stimulus law — the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act — adds $600 per week, for up to four months, to the regular unemployment checks that people receive through their state government.  The bonuses began April 5, 2020 and are available through July 31, 2020. Nationally, unemployment checks usually are about half of what a person earned on his or her most recent job, up to a limit, which is set by each state. Benefits in some states are higher than that. So, to use one of the figures in the Facebook post, take a laid-off New York resident formerly earning $350 per week, or $18,200 on an annual basis. That person would typically get an unemployment check of $198 per week, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute, a New York think tank. Add the $600 bonus, and the total is $798 per week — or more than double that person’s regular pay. At those rates, the laid-off worker would receive about $7,600 more in unemployment aid over the 17-week span of the program than they would have received in earnings if they had been able to stay at work. Nationally, the average weekly unemployment benefit was $385 per week as of January 2020, Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told PolitiFact. With the stimulus bonus, that person’s benefit would more than double to $985 per week. The stimulus includes a one-time payment of $1,200 that most adults are scheduled to receive sometime in April 2020, along with payments for each dependent child age 17 or younger. But those go to the unemployed as well as the employed. There is no additional pay from the federal stimulus package for people who remain employed. That includes people in essential jobs such as grocery store clerks, delivery workers, food and medical supply-chain workers, and lower-paid hospital staff.  If essential workers were laid off, they would have to make less than $798 a week in New York to do the same or better on unemployment. Workers who made more would be made worse off, even with the government stimulus.  Although the post alludes to New York, we found no actions taken by New York state to boost pay for such workers. That was confirmed to us by the Fiscal Policy Institute and the Rockefeller Institute of Government, both New York-based think tanks that focus on New York state government; and the Center for New York City Affairs research organization. A spokesman in the governor’s office told us that Cuomo has taken steps, such as waiving a waiting period, to make it easier to collect unemployment. Some states have tried to help certain workers in other ways. For example, New York, Illinois and Maryland are offering child care assistance to certain essential workers.  Also, in Saratoga County, N.Y., county officials are defending their decision to pay time-and-a-half to 340 employees deemed essential, the Daily Gazette reported. The cost for the overtime, which is being paid to about one-quarter of the workforce, is $150,000 per week. Several experts noted to us that some federal officials have discussed the possibility in a future stimulus bill of providing additional pay to essential workers. A Facebook post said that ""non-essential people get to file for unemployment and make two to three times more than normal,"" but essential workers still on the job get no pay raise. This dynamic only applies to some workers who have modest incomes. For four months, from April through July of 2020, unemployed people are eligible for $600-per-week federal bonuses that, in some cases, can double or nearly triple what they earned on the job.  We rate the Facebook statement Half True.",/factchecks/2020/apr/08/facebook-posts/only-few-get-unemployment-pay-raise/

No evidence 59 people died from drinking disinfectant to prevent coronavirus
","We’ve debunked a lot of claims about ways to ward off COVID-19, and just to recap, here’s what we know now: hot lemon, silver solution, stomach acid, marijuana, cocaine and sunlight won’t kill the coronavirus. Neither will gargling with warm water and salt or drinking bleach — please don’t consume fish-tank cleaner — and don’t bother breathing the steam of boiling orange peels and cayenne pepper.  But an April 6 Facebook post suggests that dozens of people indulged in another such remedy and paid the ultimate price. A screenshot of what looks like a news story from daily-sun.com shows a photo of a man pouring a red liquid into a woman’s mouth.  ""59 people die as pastor gives them Dettol to drink in church to prevent coronavirus,"" the headline below the image says.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Daily Sun, which describes itself as a leading English newspaper in Bangladesh, did post a story on March 26 with that headline, but it has since been deleted from the website. Google search results for the story show this snippet of the article, though: ""South African Prophet Rufus Phala allegedly gave his members Dettol, a household bleach to drink as a preventive medicine to coronavirus."" The same story appeared on March 19 on a website called Kenya Today. It goes on to say that 59 congregants were confirmed dead and four others are in critical condition after drinking Dettol.  But we couldn’t find any news reports to corroborate that account.  Rather, the image appeared online in 2016 on the website of another Daily Sun — a newspaper in South Africa.

Dettol South Africa’s verified Facebook account responded in a statement to reports of Phala ""practice of instructing his congregation to drink Dettol Antiseptic Liquid.""  The cleaning product isn’t for human consumption, the company said, urging anyone who drank it to consult a medical professional. ""We have been in contact with Prophet Rufus Phala and asked him to stop this practice,"" the statement says. We didn’t find any news reports that the congregants died after drinking Dettol.   A spokesman for the South African Police Service told AFP South Africa that it’s not true that 59 people died after drinking Dettol to prevent coronavirus, and he ""denied any investigations into the deaths of 59 people linked to the consumption of Dettol,"" according to the news outlet.  We rate this Facebook post False.",/factchecks/2020/apr/08/viral-image/no-evidence-59-people-died-drinking-disinfectant-p/

Trump said the Obama admin left him a bare stockpile. Wrong
","President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Obama administration left him with an empty national stockpile for emergencies. ""But they also gave us empty cupboards. The cupboard was bare. You’ve heard the expression, ‘the cupboard was bare.’ So we took over a stockpile with a cupboard that was bare,"" he said in an April 6 White House briefing. In previous briefings Trump described the stockpile as ""empty."" Trump is exaggerating. While the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted shortcomings in the nation’s stockpile of emergency supplies and equipment, Trump did not inherit bare inventory. It was full of supplies, but not enough to handle this particular pandemic. Most notably, the stockpile was short of N95 masks, the supply of which was depleted following the 2009 H1N1 outbreak during President Barack Obama’s tenure. RELATED: Fact-checking Jared Kushner’s comments on the national stockpile The Strategic National Stockpile was created in 1999 to prepare for chemical, radiological, biological or nuclear attacks. It expanded to respond to terrorism attacks, hurricanes, the H1N1 flu and ebola. While the locations of the stockpiles’ warehouses are secret, some reporters have been allowed inside, including journalists from the Washington Post in 2018. The Post wrote that there were ""hundreds of thousands of shrink-wrapped boxes of medicines"" and that if the medical countermeasures were laid flat they would cover more than 31 football fields. But Dara Alpert Lieberman, director of government relations for the nonprofit Trust for America’s Health, said that as large as the stockpile is, it’s always been lacking. ""The Strategic National Stockpile has never been funded at adequate levels to invest in new medical countermeasures, replenish expiring products, and purchase other needed medical supplies,"" she said.  A 2017 Health and Human Services report showed $324.5 million in replenishment contracts, more than half of that money for anthrax response and only $7 million earmarked for influenza.  In November, the director of the stockpile described it as an $8 billion enterprise. ""Even if the needed products are not currently held in house, stockpile experts have purchasing power to get what is needed to protect Americans,"" wrote Greg Burel, who retired in January. But two months later, it became clear that the stockpile didn’t have all the supplies needed for the current pandemic. One thing the stockpile clearly doesn’t have enough of is face masks. News reports found that the N95 face masks were not substantially replenished after H1N1 in 2009, the first year of the Obama administration.  The Obama administration distributed 85 million N95 masks, 12.5 million regimens of antiviral drugs and 19.6 million pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) for H1N1, also called swine flu. ""The 2009 H1N1 response was the largest known response of a national stock of drugs and medical material, and it was successful,"" Burel wrote in 2019. But experts warned after H1N1 that the supply of masks should have been replenished. Burel told Vice News in March that federal officials were left with ""horrible decisions"" about how to triage spending after H1N1. ""We had to trade off those funds that we had, and we chose to invest in those lifesaving drugs that would not be available from any other source, in the quantity needed, and in time,"" he said. ""I definitely want to see my health care workers protected; that's very important. But if I'm thinking, 'Do I buy this many masks to protect this many workers, or do I buy this many medicines to keep people safe that we can't get elsewhere?' There's no easy answer here."" Burel told CBS News in March that the stockpile was ""very stressed."" ""We didn't receive funds to replace those masks, protective gear and the antivirals that we used for H1N1,"" he said. ProPublica found that the budget battles during Obama’s tenure after the Republicans won the 2010 election hurt the stockpile’s budget. In early 2011, Obama’s administration released a budget request for $655 million for the stockpile, an increase of $59 million including to acquire new products. But Congress ultimately allocated $534 million for the 2012 fiscal year, a 10% cut from the prior year, ProPublica found. Across-the-board cuts hit the CDC, which managed the stockpile at the time. In its budget request for 2013, for example, the administration called for a cut of about $48 million to the stockpile. The stockpile ""is a key resource in maintaining public health preparedness and response; however, the current fiscal climate necessitates scaling back,"" the request stated. Budget figures going back to 2009 show overall funding for the stockpile dropped to its lowest in 2013, to about $477 million. Allocations have grown steadily since then to a 2020 budget of $705 million.  Despite the Obama-era cuts, Ellen Carlin, a professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, said it’s an exaggeration to state that the ""cupboard was bare.""  Appropriations to the stockpile during Obama’s presidency, when adjusting for inflation, went up a little, down a little, and then ended up about where they started. ""But those numbers don’t just reflect Obama’s requests. They also reflect congressional appropriations — under Congresses that at times were partially controlled by Republicans,"" she said.  It’s difficult to determine what budget cuts meant for PPE since federal officials closely hold the details of the inventory, she said.  While the Trump administration points the finger at Obama, Democrats have pointed the finger back at Trump, who also could have taken steps to replenish the stockpile before the current pandemic.  But because of the shared executive branch-legislative branch responsibility, Carlin said, ""almost everything about COVID-19 reflects a bipartisan failure across two branches of government."" The Associated Press reviewed federal purchasing contracts and found ""federal agencies largely waited until mid-March (of this year) to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers."" While HHS said early in the pandemic that the stockpile had 13 million masks, that was only a fraction of what hospitals needed, the AP found. Masks are not the only items that federal officials sought to obtain more of for the stockpile in past years. The New York Times reported on efforts that began 13 years ago — before the Obama administration —  to buy more ventilators. That effort stalled when the company that the federal government secured to design new ventilators didn’t come through, leaving the government to start over with a new company in 2014. Trump said the Obama administration left him with a ""stockpile with a cupboard that was bare."" In one specific way, he has a point: N95 masks were depleted after the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, and experts warned years ago that the supply should have been replenished.  However, Trump made a sweeping generalization and exaggerated when he described the stockpile as a bare cupboard. The former director of the stockpile, just a couple of months before COVID-19 cases appeared in the U.S., described it as an $8 billion enterprise, with extensive holdings of many needed items.

Who’s eligible to receive stimulus aid for dependent children?
","The coronavirus response bill signed into law by President Donald Trump March 27 will send a total of about $300 billion to Americans in the form of direct payments.  Exactly how much money each person will get depends primarily on their income and the number of dependents claimed on their tax returns. It can be challenging to understand, but if you’re looking for clarity, don’t turn to social media posts as a primary source of information. One such post is leaving some parents worried: ""If you’ve let somebody claim your kids for income tax purposes, you will not receive a stimulus check. The person who claimed your kids is gonna get it."" The reality isn’t as simple as the March 31 post makes it sound. Regardless of who claimed your children as dependents, you should still be eligible for a direct payment as part of the $2 trillion COVID-19 response legislation, as long as you meet the income requirements. But determining who will get the $500 payment that is available for each qualifying dependent child is complicated. The coronavirus response package will send most single, adult Americans one $1,200 direct payment. Individuals with Social Security numbers who reported an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less on their 2019 tax returns will get the full $1,200 payment. Married couples filing jointly who earned less than $150,000 will receive $2,400.  But the payment decreases incrementally as income goes up. Individuals who made over $99,000 or married couples who earned more than $198,000 and have no dependent children will not receive a payment. Even people who might not normally file income tax returns — including some Social Security beneficiaries — are eligible for payments.  Anyone claimed as a dependent is ineligible to receive a $1,200 payment, even if they are an adult, according to reporting by several news outlets. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the deadline for filing taxes on your 2019 income has been extended from April 15, 2020 to July 15, 2020. Keeping in mind that many people are still in the process of filing those returns, 2018 filings will apply in cases where the most recent filings are not available.  If you claimed a child under age 17 as a dependent, your direct payment will increase by as much as $500 per qualifying child, subject to the income level restrictions. ""Whoever claimed the child on the 2019 return — or the 2018 return if the 2019 return is not available — will be eligible for that $500 additional payment,"" said Elaine Maag, a tax policy expert and principal research associate at the Tax Policy Center. ""Almost all children are claimed by parents,"" Maag said, but there are several legitimate situations in which others can claim children as dependents. Caroline Bruckner, managing director of the Kogod Tax Policy Center at American University, said a typical example would be children being raised by relatives. ""It’s not uncommon for a grandparent to claim a grandchild living with them, or for an older sibling to claim their younger siblings or even stepsiblings where the parents are absent or deceased,"" Bruckner said in an email. In these cases, the payment goes to the person who claimed that child as a dependent for 2019. But Maag said there is still a chance that parents who did not claim their children on their 2019 tax returns could get the $500 direct payment.  If the parent is claiming the child as a dependent for the 2020 tax year — even if the child was claimed by someone else in 2019 — the parent could be eligible for the $500 payment, according to Maag. In that case, she said, the person who claimed the dependent in 2019 would not have to return the money, and the individual claiming the dependents for 2020 would also get a payment.  The stimulus aid is considered an advance credit on tax reductions you would otherwise be seeing on your 2020 taxes. (You won’t have to pay them back.) So if taxpayers would qualify for dependent children payments based on their 2020 returns, the IRS will let them claim the payment. ""There’s not a claw-back mechanism,"" Bruckner said. ""Congress is looking to pump money out to taxpayers as quickly as possible to weather this crisis — and they are using information taxpayers provide on their returns to quickly figure out who is going to qualify and how to get it to them as quickly as possible."" If you don’t claim your children in either 2019 or 2020, however, this does not mean you are ineligible for a stimulus check, as this Facebook post says. For most adults, you could still get up to a $1,200 direct payment as an individual or $2,400 as a married couple, subject to the income limits.  There are also age restrictions that apply to children 17 and older. Families with dependents who are at least 17 won’t be getting $500 per child payments, and those dependents won’t be getting the $1,200 check, either. A viral image reads, ""If you’ve let somebody claim your kids for income tax purposes, you will not receive a stimulus check. The person who claimed your kids is gonna get it."" The reality is more complicated. If you didn’t claim your child as a dependent, you’ll still get a direct payment as part of the federal coronavirus response package, as long as you don’t earn too much to qualify.  What you won’t receive is the additional $500 that goes to individuals and couples for each dependent child. Instead, that money will be given to the person who claimed the child as a dependent. But if you are claiming a child as a dependent for the 2020 tax year, you become eligible for a payment as well.

Some Goodwill employees have been laid off and furloughed because of the pandemic
","Scores of Americans have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has pushed the jobless rate to its highest point since the Great Depression. As of April 2, nearly 10 million people had filed for unemployment insurance.  But getting fired for cause — as opposed to being laid off or furloughed — can jeopardize workers’ ability to collect benefits. And a recent Facebook post suggests that Goodwill exploited shelter-in-place orders to fire its employees instead of merely laying them off. ""I just want to share what Goodwill Industries just did to all their employees,"" begins the April 2 Facebook post. ""They use this pandemic to fire all their employees instead of laying them off. They did say they would hire them all back as a brand new employee with no built up benefits or vacation time. I will not be donating or shopping there again. They definitely do not care about our community only how much money they can make off of us.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Lauren Lawson-Zilai, a spokesperson for Goodwill Industries International, told PolitiFact that each of the 157 Goodwill organizations in the United States and Canada is a locally operated nonprofit with its own president and CEO. More than 96% of Goodwill’s thrift stores have closed because of state regulations in response to the spread of COVID-19, she said.  But she said the Facebook post doesn’t appear to be accurate.  ""Some Goodwill organizations have had to furlough their employees,"" she said. ""These employees are receiving benefits"" that vary state by state.  Other Goodwill operations are ongoing in some capacity, she said. For example, 90% of Goodwills are operating business services. Local Goodwill organizations contract with commercial and government organizations, among others, ""to provide a wide range of business services, including janitorial and grounds maintenance, flexible staffing, food service ... and laundry services."" Lawson-Zilai said many are also providing job preparation skills and they’re offering online learning through Google Classroom. One Goodwill partnered with a local dry cleaner to dry clean previously donated clothes that physicians can use as smocks.  At Goodwill stores in parts of Arizona, however, a majority of employees lost their jobs.  In a statement, Goodwill of Northern and Central Arizona said that mandatory state stay-at-home orders led Goodwill there to ""make the very difficult decision to close our stores in order to protect the health and safety of our employees and shoppers."" The statement says ensuring the organization’s financial stability ""included the very difficult decision to part ways with the majority of employees at each store.""  ""We are providing a severance package, which includes two-weeks pay, to help these team members in their transition to new employment,"" it says. ""We truly hope when this situation passes, we will be able to rehire the majority of these employees."" Lawson-Zilai said those employees were laid off because of economic constraints, not fired.  The Facebook post, which was shared more than 19,000 times, drew hundreds of comments, too. Among them were comments from people who claimed to be Goodwill employees.  ""As an employee of a local Goodwill retail location, I can tell you this isn’t true at my location,"" one commenter wrote. ""I’m a full-time, hourly shift manager of five years who was given the choice of working or being furloughed; I chose furlough and I will keep my health insurance, my benefits and will retain my years of employment when I return, all while being eligible for full unemployment insurance benefits.""  ""As a furloughed employee I can confirm that this is a completely untrue statement,"" another commenter said. ""Health insurance is being paid in full by the company for full time employees while furloughed and accrued (personal time off) isn’t going anywhere.""  Yet another commenter wrote that she was ""‘let go’ because of the virus."" ""All I was told was that I’m eligible for rehire when they allow managers to hire again,"" she said.  Our ruling The Facebook post says that Goodwill fired all employees instead of laying them off.  That’s not accurate. Across the country, employees at local Goodwill organizations have been laid off or furloughed, but some operations have not shuttered, according to a Goodwill spokesperson.  In parts of Arizona, a majority of employees were laid off.
