Candidates in modern times have released 12 years of tax returns, says Debbie Wasserman Schultz
","Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz went on Fox News Aug. 12 to criticize Mitt Romney’s vice presidential pick, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

At one point, she turned the conversation to Romney’s tax returns.

Here’s some of the back and forth between the South Florida congresswoman and Fox News Sunday guest host John Roberts:

Wasserman Schultz: ""Barack Obama and Joe Biden have released 12 years of tax returns. Mitt Romney has released one and a partial view of a second one. His own father...""

Roberts: ""John McCain released two.""

Wasserman Schultz:: ""His own father -- no, John McCain released more than -- released about 12 years of tax returns.""

Roberts: ""John Kerry didn't release his wife's tax returns. I mean, you can make a lot of arguments what is appropriate in terms of...""

Wasserman Schultz: ""Spouses are not running for president. ... Mitt Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns. It's unacceptable.""

The subject of Romney’s tax returns and his taxes has generated multiple claims we’ve evaluated on our Truth-O-Meter. Here, we will examine Wasserman Schultz’s claim, ""Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns.""

PolitiFact recently examined a claim by former President Bill Clinton that it’s typical for presidential candidates to release 10 or 11 years of tax returns. We rated that claim Half True, and we will draw from that fact-check.

There have been several major presidential candidates to release fewer than 12 tax returns:

• In 2000, George W. Bush provided nine and Al Gore eight.

• In the 2008 primary, then Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., delivered seven, a move that was matched by Hillary Clinton about a month later.

• In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis released six years of returns. • In 2008, McCain released two years of returns, as Roberts said.

• In 1980, Ronald Reagan offered up just one return.

There is a difference for incumbents and challengers. Ever since 1976, when Jimmy Carter became president, sitting presidents and vice presidents have released their taxes each year they are in office. By the time re-election rolls around, they have put at least four tax returns into the public record. Challengers generally match or exceed that.

Our colleagues at Factcheck.org looked at this in July and found that since 1980, only two general election candidates have revealed no more than two years of tax returns. One was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in 2008 and the other is Romney, who released his 2010 tax return and an estimate of 2011.

When we contacted the DNC about this fact-check, they sent us a statement saying Romney should release more of his tax returns. What they didn’t provide was evidence to support Wasserman Schultz’s claim.

Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said, ""Mitt Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns.""

There are several examples of major party candidates for president in modern times who released fewer than 12 tax returns. And those examples have been highlighted in recent news articles. Wasserman Schultz’s claim is not correct, and we rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b2415e9e-2c2b-402f-8451-cf2041d0e8c8",/factchecks/2012/aug/14/debbie-wasserman-schultz/major-candidates-modern-times-have-release-12-year/

Workers' Voice ad says Josh Mandel bet against Ohio families
","
It is time for some basic finance: When interest rates rise, Treasury bond prices fall.

We could go on (buy low, sell high, etc.) but there is only one more financial fact you really need to know for purposes of understanding a new ad attacking Ohio Treasurer and U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel. That fact is that at some point during 2011, a trust that invests for the benefit of his wife, Ilana Shafran Mandel, held shares in an exchange traded fund that deals in Treasury bonds.

That investment now is being used by a group called Workers’ Voice, affiliated with the AFL-CIO, to claim that Josh Mandel was ""betting against Ohio families."" To understand the attack, you must understand the investment.

This fund, or ETF, is not a traditional ETF (a fund that in many ways is similar to a mutual fund) that buys and sells stocks and bonds and performs with the ups and downs of the market. Rather, this ETF, called ProShares Ultra 20+ Year Treasury, deals in long-term Treasury bonds in a manner that acts as a hedge against falling Treasury bond prices. It is a ""short"" fund, in financial parlance, and it performs inversely to the regular market for Treasuries. When prices on Treasuries fall, the value of this ETF goes up.

You could say that it bets on falling Treasury prices. Put another way, it is betting on rising interest rates. But if you wanted to criticize a politician, you might say, as Workers’ Voice did in an ad appearing on cleveland.com (the website affiliated with The Plain Dealer) and other newspaper websites, that this ETF was betting on a government default. After all, if the government couldn’t pay its bills, the value of its bonds would dive and this ETF could soar.

That, however, is an extreme and hypothetical example.

Workers’ Voice didn’t put it exactly that way, but it made clear that is what it meant. Its ad said that ""The more your family struggles, the more money Josh Mandel stands to make."" Its rationale, explained in a link it provided for readers, was that by investing in this ETF, Mandel, through his wife, was betting on the government defaulting on its obligations.

The ad’s sponsor suggested that this was especially egregious because Mandel wasn’t just any investor but was, rather, a potential driver on the road to default. Although it is not known precisely when Mandel’s wife bought or, perhaps, sold this ETF, it is known that in August 2011, Mandel stated that he opposed a congressional bill (which passed) to raise the government’s debt limit. A higher debt limit was necessary to borrow more money and keep the government operating. Without it, the government might have defaulted on some obligations, likely devaluing formerly iron-clad government investments such as Treasury bonds. In a default, the government might stop providing some services to Ohio families.

Put these together and you get a portrait of a candidate who, if elected to the Senate, would let the potential of a personal windfall stand in the way of doing the right thing for the country, or so the ad implies strongly.

That’s a powerful claim, so PolitiFact Ohio asked AFL-CIO/Workers’ Voice spokesman Michael Gillis for its basis. Gillis pointed us to an article, which is also linked prominently in the Ohio ad, that appears on the website of Think Progress, an arm of the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. The web article, dated July 27, 2012, was headlined, ""Exclusive: GOP Senate Nominee Shorting U.S. Treasury Bonds, Would Profit from Default.""

The article noted that a trust that invests for the benefit of Ilana Mandel, called the JMS Trust, owned shares in this ProShares short ETF during 2011. According to a financial disclosure form filed by Josh Mandel last November and cited by Think Progress, the JMS Trust owned between $1,001 and $15,000 of this fund. On a different page, the financial disclosure form listed what appeared to be an additional investment in this ETF, also held by the trust, worth less than $1,001.

The Think Progress article stated, ""If a default were to occur, the desirability of Treasury bills would plummet and Mandel’s ETF would skyrocket in value. That precise scenario could become more likely if Mandel wins his race against Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH). One of the top issues Mandel lists on his website is to ‘Stop increasing the debt ceiling.’ Similarly, when Congress was embroiled in the debt ceiling fight last year, he stated that he ‘would have voted against the debt deal’ that narrowly staved off a default.""

At least in theory, this single part of the claim -- that Treasury bills would be less desirable and the ETF’s value would rise if the government defaulted -- is accurate.

Yet that scenario is unlikely, and it oversimplifies the reason people invest in this ETF.

Consider that the government has never defaulted. Yet people keep investing in this ETF, according to financial websites including Morningstar and Bloomberg, and did so even when default wasn’t in the public vocabulary. In fact, it appears to PolitiFact Ohio, based on a more recent financial disclosure filed by Josh Mandel in May 2012, that Ilana Mandel’s trust bought even more shares of this ETF -- up to an additional $15,000 worth -- even after the threat of default passed.

ProShares declined to comment to PolitiFact Ohio, but it makes clear that this ETF is not an investment for amateurs. Investment advisers and active investors buy its shares as a hedge against changes in interest rates, a gamble referred to in columns and blogs that cover high-stakes finance. ProShares recommends in its marketing and disclosure materials that investors watch this fund daily, as it is subject to volatility. It is not a casual buy-and-hold investment.

Ilana Mandel is not a professional investor. According to Josh Mandel’s financial disclosure and his campaign spokeswoman, Nicole Sizemore, the ETF and other investments are owned through the JMS Trust. When those trust assets are put together with her husband’s far more meager holdings, the couple’s worth runs in a range between $1.95 million and $7.1 million, according to financial disclosure filings. Ilana Mandel inherited the money; her grandmother was a founder of Forest City Enterprises, the real estate and development company.  

""Neither Josh nor his wife have control over Ilana's family's trust so neither of them are making any investment activity decisions on it,"" Sizemore said. ""These decisions are made by the investment manager and presumably the trustees who oversee her family's trust.""

Josh Mandel has steadfastly refused to discuss his wife’s holdings, other than to report what is required by disclosure rules for public officials and candidates. His campaign said it was unable to discern why the investment manager or trustees bought this particular ETF but reiterated that neither Josh nor Ilana Mandel had a role in it.

As noted in a number of financial blogs and columns, other investors buy shares in this ETF as a hedge against rising interest rates. Not being investment professionals, however, PolitiFact Ohio turned to Jack Bao, an assistant professor of finance at Ohio State University and an authority on bonds.

""I guess that if the government did default, the short ETF would rise in value,"" Bao said when we told him of the Workers’ Voice scenario. But that is extremely unlikely, he said, adding that other options might have been possible to avoid default, such as printing more money, even if Congress had not raised the debt ceiling.

""To believe that somebody was buying $15,000 worth of a short ETF and betting on the government defaulting seems a little far-fetched to me,"" Bao said. What happens in most cases, he said, is the investor buys this ETF as a bet on interest rates. He or she thinks they’ll go up and the value of Treasuries will go down -- but not necessarily tank.

Before we rule on the Workers’’ Voice claim, it’s important to point out that Mandel never said he wanted the government to default. Like a number of other Republicans, he said that government spending needed to come down before Congress raised the debt ceiling. By playing this game of chicken, some Republicans said they hoped to force a more frugal solution that fell short of default. Democrats cobbled together a big enough coalition to raise the debt limit anyway. Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman joined them. The storm blew over.

That leaves us with an extreme claim -- that Mandel was betting against Ohio families and hoping to fatten his family wallet. While we cannot say why his wife’s trust chose that particular ETF, we know that investors have plenty of rationales besides betting on default. In fact, Bao, the OSU professor, disclosed that he too invested in a short Treasury ETF. We realized that he and Ilana Mandel’s investment adviser had chosen, in fact, the very same ProShares ETF.

So an OSU finance professor was betting on default, too?

"" I wasn’t betting on the government defaulting,"" Boa said. ""I was betting on interest rates going up.""

In all the world’s possibilities, default was one. In probabilities, it was not. As we noted, the JMS Trust appeared to buy additional shares of this ETF subsequent to last August’s debt-ceiling showdown. That’s an additional factor that makes the ad’s claim -- that Mandel was betting against Ohio families -- far-fetched. The claim relies on one extreme possibility -- a possibility that has never occurred -- and runs with it, ignoring the other reasons why a trust fund or even a finance professor might choose this investment. That’s just ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/aug/14/workers-voice/workers-voice-ad-says-josh-mandel-bet-against-ohio/

Lawmaker uses Georgia to push voter ID law
","
Politicians sometimes use other states to bolster themselves in policy debates.

""Look, we’re not as bad as that state!"" is typically how it goes. 

News quickly circulated to us through the Internet that a Pennsylvania lawmaker was talkin’ about Georgia.

State Rep. Warren Kampf was making the case at a town hall meeting for his state to have identification laws similar to Georgia to prevent voter fraud at the polls.

A court battle is under way in Pennsylvania on the legality of the state’s voter ID law.

""Georgia has a very similar law. They’ve had it for six years. And they had it in 2008, and in those communities which often are said to have been impacted by voter ID laws, the turnout was actually far greater than it should have been demographically,"" Kampf, a Republican, said.

The comments were initially reported on a Patch.com website in Pennsylvania, and then the Huffington Post.

We wondered: Was voter turnout higher among some historically disadvantaged groups during Georgia’s 2008 election cycle? And, if so, is there some context to consider?

This is not the first time someone has used Georgia as a case study on voter ID laws and their impact, or lack thereof, on the 2008 presidential election. The speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives said Georgia’s voter ID law did not dissuade blacks from voting and added it’s been helpful.

PolitiFact Ohio said the claim wasn’t supported by research and rated it Half True.

Kampf was apparently talking about black voters. A gentleman in Kampf’s office told us that the percentage of Georgians who are black who voted in 2008 was higher than past years. We asked him for more information to back up the representative’s claim, or to talk to Kampf himself. PolitiFact Georgia did not get a reply. A telephone message left at his office was not returned.

In 2006, the Georgia Legislature passed a law requiring adults to produce a form of picture identification when voting in person to stop fraud. Acceptable forms of ID include a driver’s license, a U.S. passport, military photo and student ID from a state college. Some black politicians and officials have criticized Georgia’s voter ID law and similar laws in other states as attempts by Republicans to discourage some who typically vote for Democrats, particularly African-Americans, from voting. 

""We call those poll taxes,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said during a recent speech to the NAACP in which he equated Texas' photo ID law to instances post-slavery in which blacks had to pay a tax or pass a test in order to vote.

Nonsense, voter ID proponents say. 

In 2004, about 76 percent of black women and 66 percent of black men registered to vote in Georgia cast ballots in that year’s presidential election, according to data we found on the Georgia secretary of state’s website. In 2008, an estimated 80 percent of black women and 70 percent of black men registered to vote in Georgia voted in the November presidential election, the website shows. 

In 2004, black voters made up 25 percent of Georgia’s electorate, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. In 2008, according to exit polls, African-Americans cast 30 percent of all ballots in Georgia. Similar increases occurred among black voters nationwide.

We quickly considered one clear difference between those two elections: Barack Obama. Most black voters were pretty excited about the prospects of the nation electing its first African-American president in 2008. Exit polls found Obama won 98 percent of Georgia’s black voters, the AJC reported.

PolitiFact Georgia spoke to three political science professors with expertise on racial voting demographics. All three said Obama was a factor in the percentage of blacks who voted in Georgia.

""2008 is not necessarily a good base year for anything because it’s such a special case,"" said Clark Atlanta University associate political science professor William Boone.

Boone said he’s unaware of any data that examines how many people have been turned away from voting because they don’t have an acceptable form of identification. That’s another reason Boone said Kampf’s claim cannot be substantiated.

University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said Obama’s presence on the 2008 ballot ""undoubtedly"" was a factor in turnout among black voters. Bullock contends that shows people can adjust to any local or state regulations in order to vote if they feel a particular race is important enough to them.

The 2008 results, Bullock said, ""suggest if you want to go out and vote, you’ll do that.""

Traditionally, Bullock noted, there are patterns based on education and income. Higher-educated people and the rich vote in higher percentages, he and others say. Emory University associate political science professor Andra Gillespie discussed that point with us.

""The legislator in question here seems to think that because there was a spike in turnout in 2008, there are no barriers to turnout for any blacks,"" Gillespie said via email. ""This is not the group ... about which advocates are concerned. They are worried about those who are poor, less educated, older, don't drive, don't use social services, or who live in inner cities or rural areas.""

We couldn’t find any data that examined whether low-income or lesser-educated black Georgians voted at a lesser clip between the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections.

It’s correct that black voter turnout in Georgia did increase between the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, but the increase wasn’t, as Kampf said, ""far greater."" Also, the 2008 election was, as Boone said, a ""special case."" 

Kampf’s statement is accurate, but it needs some clarification and context.

Sen. Ronda Storms voted for the courthouse known as the 'Taj Mahal,' says opponent Rob Turner
","
""Ronda Storms is NO Fiscal Conservative,"" claims a simple flier pushed by Storms’ opponent in the Republican primary for Hillsborough County property appraiser.

The mailer from incumbent Rob Turner highlights property tax increases over Storms’ six-year tenure as a county commissioner as well as a notorious courthouse project that occurred during her time in the state Senate.

""As a Senator she voted to fund the ""Taj Mahal’ Courthouse. … We Can’t Afford Any More Storms.""

Ah, the Taj. The not-too-distant origins of Florida’s finest courthouse serve as a cautionary tale about last-minute lawmaking and unscrutinized government spending.

Is it fair to say Storms voted to fund the new courthouse of the 1st District Court of Appeal?

Let’s dive in.

In her 2010 investigative story about the facility, Tampa Bay Times senior correspondent Lucy Morgan characterized the courthouse as ""a $48 million behemoth in which each judge will get a 60-inch LCD flat screen television in chambers (trimmed in mahogany), a private bathroom (featuring granite countertops) and a kitchen (complete with microwave and refrigerator).""

In a year of layoffs and cutbacks across the state, these touches of elegance were not appreciated.

So how did the project eke past officials and watchdogs (press corps included)?

Morgan compiled a detailed timeline stretching from a May 2004 meeting of the 1st DCA judges, in which they said they had outgrown their 23-year-old building, to December 2010, when the fresh, controversial structure was ready for move-in.

A key moment in the story happened on the last day of the 2007 legislative session, a typically hectic time ripe for last-minute, undetected budget maneuvering. Tampa Sen. Victor Crist introduced an amendment to a 142-page transportation bill that contained a bond issue for $33.5 million for the courthouse’s construction. No senators asked about the bond issue, and it passed on a voice vote.

The bill itself, HB 985, passed by a vote of 37-2. Storms, like most everyone, voted yes. It passed the House, then led by Marco Rubio, and was signed into law by Gov. Charlie Crist.

Storms, interviewed by PolitiFact Florida, said she thought she was voting to refurbish a dilapidated courthouse.

""It certainly wasn’t to build mahogany,"" she said. ""Anybody who was voting at that time was not voting for the ‘Taj Mahal.’ What we were voting to do was taking care of the 1st DCA.""

Storms and Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, became two of the project’s most vocal critics in the months following the Times story. At one point in a committee hearing, Storms quipped, ""We should insist on our pound of flesh and make them put the air at 80 in the summer and at 50 in the winter.""

As an aside, Storms said she probably voted against Crist’s amendment, which contained the bonding language, on an unrecorded voice vote out of a personal philosophy to protest unvetted, ""vendor-driven"" language affixed to bills in session’s closing days. (There is no record of voice votes, so we can't tell how Storms voted.)

Fasano told us Turner’s attack is ""just not honest"" despite Storms' technical support of the transportation bill.

""You might as well blame every legislator that voted for it,"" he said, which would total 105 members.

That’s the point, says Warren Weathers, who works for Turner. He recalled Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine, saying legislators share blame with the judges who pushed for the fine finishes.

""We didn’t say she built it,"" Weathers said.

Crist (of no relation to Florida’s former governor) defended Storms in an interview.

""Ronda approving the budget for the court system and the construction budget for a new courthouse has nothing to do with the court’s design, engineering and building,"" he said. ""It would be like saying her approval of the DMV budget holds her accountable for somebody’s else driving record.""

Crist’s position is understandable. He says groups aligned with the tea party are using the ""Taj Mahal"" -- a moniker he hates -- against him in his re-election campaign for Hillsborough County Commission.

Our ruling

Turner says in a mailer that Storms ""voted to fund the ‘Taj Mahal’ Courthouse."" She indeed cast a vote for a transportation bill that included funding for the courthouse, that much is true. But there is some additional information we find missing from this attack.

Namely, the courthouse money was inserted at the last minute into a larger bill without much explanation. The money, as far as most lawmakers knew, was to build a courthouse, not an opulent one. Once details of the ‘Taj’ became known, Storms openly criticized the plan.

Gloria Romero Roses says congressional candidate Joe Garcia ""voted to raise our utility rates""
","
Democrats are battling in a primary to take on U.S. Rep. David Rivera, R-Miami, who remains the subject of a federal investigation into undisclosed payments from the Flagler Dog Track to his mother's company.

One of the top Democratic contenders is Joe Garcia, who lost two previous congressional races, including one against Rivera in 2010. This year Garcia jumped late into the race after Democrats recruited political newcomer Gloria Romero Roses. They are the top two Democrats competing in the newly drawn District 26, a closely split Republican-Democratic district that stretches from Miami-Dade to Key West.

Romero Roses attacked Garcia in a mailer: 

""Trading on his cozy relationship with energy lobbyists to raise tens of thousands of dollars for his failed campaigns -- after he voted to raise our utility rates.""

The mailer is referring to Garcia’s tenure as a commissioner from 1994 to 2000 on the Florida Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities and sets electric rates. A footnote cites multiple newspaper articles most of which overlapped with Garcia’s commissioner tenure.

We wanted to check if Garcia ""voted to raise our utility rates.""

For this claim accusing Garcia of raising utility rates, Romero Roses’ campaign sent us a list of what they said were multiple examples of rate hikes.

First, some background on the Public Service Commission. The governor appoints members to the commission who must be approved by the Senate. When utilities -- electric, natural gas, water, and wastewater -- want a rate hike, they must get the commission’s approval. The commission has to set rates that allow investors an opportunity to earn a reasonable return. The commission does not set rates for publicly owned or cooperative utilities.

We interviewed J.R. Kelly, the public counsel who serves as the public’s advocate for utility related matters. Kelly said he couldn’t speak to Garcia’s votes while on the commission, because Kelly started at the Office of the Public Counsel about five years ago -- many years after Garcia’s tenure ended. But he spoke to us in general about the commission.

The commission usually grants some percentage of the increase that utilities seek, he said. The utilities have the burden to prove that they warrant the increase. Electrical utilities can also get an increase to pay for rising fuel costs which is separate from any rate hike on base rates.

If a utility meets the burden of proof for the rate increase, ""the commission is pretty much bound to approve what they are asking for.""

 Rate increase votes

We aren’t going to dissect here all the votes cited by the Romero Roses campaign. However, we did review the meeting minutes and news articles the Romero Roses campaign provided about those votes. We sent the list to Garcia’s campaign and they generally didn’t dispute the votes but raised some caveats, and we found some of our own caveats.

• One vote was a fuel surcharge -- not a base rate increase: When gas prices rise, electric companies are entitled to a fuel surcharge to cover their costs, according to state law. The Tampa Bay Times wrote that millions of Floridians would see their electric bills go up between $2.67 and $4.39 a month for the typical household in 2000 that used Florida Power and Light, Tampa Electric or Florida Power Corp. The minutes show he wasn’t participating in that vote though at some point he was at the meeting. Romero Roses' campaign obtained the minutes while our factcheck was underway and agrees Garcia didn’t participate in that vote.

• Many were increases only in certain areas of the state or had a limited scope. One vote in 2000 was a pilot prepaid electricity program for low-income customers designed to help them avoid service charges. A newspaper article said it would raise rates 8 percent but a commissioner described the program as ""optional."" The Fort Pierce News wrote that Garcia was in favor of the pilot: ""That extra cost needs to be borne by those who are going to use it...""

There were two votes to raise rates for City Gas Company that served Miami-Dade and Broward counties -- one was an interim increase approved in August 1996 and the other was an increase approved in October 1996. Business Wire wrote that the interim hike equaled a 4.8 percent average increase while the Miami Herald wrote the October vote would raise rates on average $2.34 a month. Customers had a temporary 4.8 percent increase and then when the increase later became permanent it went up to 5.8 percent.

A 1997 vote allowed Florida Power to raise rates for 1.3 million customers by 40 cents a month for the average customer. Florida Power sought the increase to pay for a legal settlement. The commission’s vote sheet shows that Garcia voted in favor. Romero Roses’ campaign said that would have applied to the Miami area. Garcia’s campaign said it was cheaper for the customers to have the case settled and pay a small increase rather than Florida Power continue the litigation.

• Not every vote was technically a vote to raise rates: The commission voted in 1995 to direct Southern State Utilities to include three additional counties in its rate hike request. The utility had planned on excluding them. The Tampa Bay Times wrote in 1996 that the impact of a rate increase would vary -- some customers would pay about $30 more a month while others would experience a decrease. The Times wrote that Southern State Utilities was the state’s largest water utility and served customers between the Panhandle and Naples.

Garcia says he cut rates

We sent Garcia’s campaign a list of his commission votes cited by Romero Roses. Garcia did vote in favor of raising rates while a commissioner, said his spokesman, Jeffrey Garcia. But the campaign argues those votes do not provide a full picture of his actions on the commission -- including his 1999 vote in favor of a $1 billion settlement with FPL.

""At the time that was the largest decrease ever by far and it outweighed any increases that took place during the previous six years,"" Jeffrey Garcia said.

In May 1999, the PSC unanimously voted in favor of the $1 billion settlement reached by the public counsel at the time, Jack Shreve. The settlement translated to a monthly average savings of $5 a month for three years.

Joe Garcia told PolitiFact that people paid less on utility bills in 2000 when he left the commission compared to 1994.

""By the time I was done, utility rates had gone down,"" he said. ""Peoples’ phone bills had gone down. Peoples’ gas bills had gone down. Particularly in the gas and telecommunication area we opened up competition so peoples’ rates automatically went down.’""

Garcia didn’t have documentation to prove that the $1 billion FPL cut washed out votes for increases, but he pointed to Miami Herald editorials in 2000 that described him as consumer friendly.

""Mr. Garcia was committed to consumer protection, yet admirably even-handed in balancing the diverse, competing telecommunications interests of the region,"" the Miami Herald wrote in one editorial in 2000.

Another 2000 Miami Herald editorial praised Garcia as the ""consumer friendly"" head of the commission and said he repeatedly sought legislative funding to promote a federal program to help provide poor families with telephones.

State Sen. Mike Fasano, a Republican from Pasco County who long battled a water utility, said it's wrong to claim that the $1 billion cut for Florida Power and Light would wipe out other utility increases everywhere in the state.

""For them to suggest let’s balance it off because he voted for a rate cut for FPL, how does that help people in Pasco County?"" Fasano said, because Pasco consumers aren’t served by FPL. ""It doesn’t.""

Our ruling

Romero Roses said Joe Garcia ""voted to raise our utility rates."" He did take votes in favor of utility rate increases while serving on the Public Service Commission between 1994 and 2000. The role of commissioners is to review rate increases and determine if they are warranted and if so grant them.

But Garcia’s tenure on the commission can’t be boiled down into a simple sentence. Some of those increases contain caveats -- for example, they were limited to only part of the state or to certain customers. Garcia also voted in favor of a $1 billion settlement for consumers who used FPL.

Whether all of Garcia’s votes for increases or decreases add up to on average less or more for a consumer could vary depending on where that consumer lived at the time.

Paul Begala says Mitt Romney said he would pay no taxes under Paul Ryan's tax plan
","The day after Mitt Romney introduced U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate, Democratic activist Paul Begala suggested the presumptive Republican presidential nominee took into account how he would personally fare under Ryan’s wide-reaching proposal for overhauling federal taxes.

Begala, a Texan advising a pro-Obama super-PAC, Priorities Action USA, said in a Twitter post on Aug. 12, 2012: ""So THAT'S why he picked him. In Jan. debate Romney said of Ryan tax plan: ‘Under that plan, I’d have paid no taxes in the last two years.’""

Did Romney air the personal impact of Ryan’s tax ideas so many months ago?

After emailing Begala, we found Romney’s remark in the Republican presidential candidate debate held Jan. 23, 2012, in Tampa, Fla.

But according to the debate transcript, Begala’s tweet struck a misleading note: Romney, who earlier noted that his proposed tax plan calls for eliminating the tax on interest, dividends and capital gains for anyone making less than  $200,000 a year, was referring to a plan advocated by then-candidate Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker.

After Gingrich confirmed that his plan called for a 0 percent tax rate on capital gains, Romney said: ""Under that plan, I`d have paid no taxes in the last two years.""

Gingrich: ""Well, if that -- and if you created enough jobs doing that -- it was Alan Greenspan (former head of the Federal Reserve) who first said the best rate, if you want to create jobs for capital gains, is zero. My No. 1  goal is to create a maximum number of jobs to put the American people back to work. It`s a straightforward argument.""

Moderator Brian Williams then changed the subject -- and Ryan’s tax plan went unmentioned in the debate. Begala later emailed us to share that his tweet stemmed from an Aug. 12, 2012, news blog post by the New York Times. The post, focused on Romney’s just-revealed choice of Ryan, includes this: ""In addition, the budget Ryan presented to the House in April last year called for the elimination of taxes on capital gains and dividend income. Romney pointed out in a January 2012 debate that ‘Under that plan, I’d have paid no taxes in the last two years.’""

Begala emailed us that his reliance on the Times’ account shows he ""was acting reasonably & in good faith."" The Times’ blog post ""may have been wrong, but I had a right to rely"" on it ""for a tweet.""  Wondering about the effect of Ryan’s plan, we pulled up an Aug. 11, 2012, news article in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, stating that by its analysis, if Ryan’s plan had been law, Romney's effective tax rate in 2010 would have been about 1 percent.

The story says Ryan’s proposal would have shaved Romney’s tax bill by about 90 percent by eliminating taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest -- an element identical to the Gingrich plank singled out by Romney in the debate.

""Since about 95 percent of Romney's $21.6 million income came from those sources in 2010,"" Roll Call said, ""he would pay no taxes on the vast majority of his earnings. It's not certain exactly how low Romney's tax bill would go, but his income from other sources amounts to about $1 million, and Ryan's plan would set a new top rate of 25 percent. Romney's total tax bill would have dropped from the $3 million that he paid to a few hundred thousand dollars if Ryan's plan had been in effect.""

The story says Ryan also proposes eliminating the estate tax, ""which would benefit Romney's heirs by tens of millions of dollars.""

The article’s descriptions of Ryan’s proposal align with information Ryan has on a website devoted to his proposal.

Separately, Matthew O’Brien of the Atlantic wrote in an Aug. 11,  2012, blog post that Romney’s 2010 tax rate under the Ryan plan would have been .82 percent. While his capital gains would have gone untaxed, the post says, Romney’s earnings of nearly $594,000 in author and speaking fees would be taxed at 25 percent. Romney would have saved another $292,389 under Ryan’s proposed elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, according to the post, while still owing $29,151 in self-employment taxes on his author and speaking fees. So he would have paid $177,650 out of a taxable income of $21,661,344, the blog post says.

We asked Romney’s campaign about this claim. Spokesman Christopher Walker said by email that Romney has a tax plan, making speculation about other plans irrelevant. On his campaign website, Romney says he wants to maintain existing tax rates on capital gains, interest and dividends for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 or more.

Our ruling

Contrary to Begala’s claim, Romney was not zeroing in on how he would fare under Ryan’s tax plan when he said he would have paid no taxes the past two years under ""that plan."" He spoke instead to Gingrich’s proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes for all taxpayers -- which Romney does not advocate.

Like Gingrich, though, Ryan calls for wiping out the capital gains tax for everyone, leaving this claim with an element of truth. We rate the statement Mostly False.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            UPDATE, 11:20 am, Aug. 14, 2012: After we posted this article, we were happy to hear back about Begala’s source for his claim. We added that information to the article. Our rating is unchanged.

Barack Obama links Mitt Romney to infamous tax shelter 'Son of Boss'
","
Barack Obama expanded his assault on Mitt Romney’s business ethics with a new ad that connects Romney to dodging taxes.

The ad opens with a clip of Romney in an interview.
  
Interviewer: Was there ever any year when you paid lower than the 13.9 percent? 
Romney: I haven’t calculated that. I’m happy to go back and look. 
Announcer: Did Romney pay 10 percent? 5 percent? Zero? We don’t know. But we do know that Romney personally approved over $70 million in fictional losses to the IRS as part of the notorious ""Son of Boss"" tax scandal, one of the largest tax avoidance schemes in history. Isn’t it time for Romney to come clean? 

If you haven’t heard of it, Son of Boss was a tax dodge that swept the country in the 1990s and allowed well-heeled investors and corporations to hide billions of dollars in taxes they owed the government.

We thought we should examine this new allegation and see whether Romney truly did have a hand in advancing a spurious tax shelter.

Marriott International and Son of Boss

The substance of this claim goes to Romney’s years on the board of Marriott International. According to Bloomberg News, he joined the board of directors in 1993 and became head of the board’s Audit Committee, a position he held for six years. By this point, Romney had already established himself as a successful fund manager.

His second year on the board, Marriott took advantage of a tax reduction method that Daniel Shaviro, a tax professor at the New York University School of Law, described to us this way:

""You and I purport to give each other, say $70 million. (But these cash flows are themselves largely fictional - e.g., I ‘borrow’ from you the money that I am ‘paying’ you). I then deduct the $70 million that I paid you, and don't include the $70 million that you paid me. End of story.""

Complex partnerships, financial securities and the occasional offshore accounts were used to mask reality. The method went by the name of Son of Boss, named after a similar discredited tax scheme called BOSS, or Bond Option Sales Strategy. It was marketed aggressively by tax accountants nationwide, including some of the largest accounting firms.

The Internal Revenue Service began cracking down in 2000. In 2008, the government estimated $6 billion in taxes had gone uncollected. A series of court decisions stated that the perpetrators were guilty of ""subverting the legislative purpose of the tax code by engaging in transactions that are fictitious or lack economic reality simply to reap a tax benefit.""

Citing court documents, Bloomberg reported that in 1994, an investment banker faxed a proposal to a senior tax attorney at Marriott. By creating new partnerships, the company could post a paper tax loss without doing itself any real financial harm. This was Son of Boss in action. Through it, Marriott reported $71 million in losses that the courts ultimately decided did not exist.

By the mid-2000s, Marriott was in court defending its use of this tax shelter. In 2008 it lost; the company appealed and lost again in 2009.

Romney’s role

The central question is, did Romney know what was going on and did he sign off? The ad relies on the opinion of two tax attorneys, Edward Kleinbard and Peter Canellos, who wrote that ""Romney approved the firm's reporting of fictional tax losses."" The authors go on to express their opinion that Romney had the expertise to understand the nature of the scheme and had the fiduciary responsibility to review it.

There is only one certain fact about Romney’s role at Marriott. At some point, the board would have reviewed and accepted various financial filings and audit reports that included the tax losses claimed under Son of Boss.

What we don’t know is whether the board or the audit committee specifically discussed the tax shelter itself, either before it was used or when it delivered the promised tax savings.

On this point, we have no outright denial from the Romney campaign. We asked the campaign if Romney approved the use of Son of Boss and they referred us to Marriott International.

At Marriott, Stephanie Hampton, senior director of global corporate communications told us, ""None of our directors has actively initiated or coordinated the company's tax planning strategies."" But this is no denial. Initiating and coordinating are not what board Audit Committees do. The ad claims that Romney approved the deal, not that he initiated it or coordinated it.

Absent a denial, we enter the hazy world of the role of corporate board audit committees in 1994. ""The standards for audit committees compared to what we see now were more modest,"" said Joe Carcello, professor of accounting at the University of Tennessee.

Carcello told us he is skeptical that company managers would have brought this transaction before the board at all. If they did, he expects the managers would have told board members, ""We vetted this with the tax lawyers and they say this is a legitimate transaction,"" Carcello said. ""Unless the audit committee had three or four tax lawyers, they wouldn’t have any reason to question it.""

Accounting experts seem to share this view, but tax lawyers have a different opinion.

The lawyers cited by the Obama campaign say by 1994, the New York State Bar had issued warnings about tax shelters of this sort. Shaviro at New York University told us there would be ample reason to question the transaction.

The company was claiming a large loss but it wasn’t actually losing any money. To Shaviro, the follow ups would be obvious: ""Can this really work? Do the tax lawyers agree? Is it too good to be true?""

Linda Beale, a professor at Wayne State Law School, said, ""The audit committee is the place to draw the line on improper behavior.""

Romney seems to have taken his board duties seriously. Bloomberg cited a fellow Marriott board member, Gilbert Grosvenor, who said Romney examined the company financial statements closely. ""Certainly deeper than we did as members,"" Grosvenor told Bloomberg.

Marriott International said the company ""takes prudent precautions, including seeking the advice of outside professionals, to ensure our tax strategy is consistent with Federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations."" It is important to note that in 1994, the federal government had yet to crack down on these tax schemes.

Our ruling

The Obama ad says Romney personally approved $70 million in fictional tax losses through the Son of Boss tax shelter.

Marriott International used Son of Boss. At the time, the illegality of the scheme had not been proven in court, but the nature of it was clear to all participants.

Romney was head of Marriott’s audit committee at the time. Experts disagree on whether the corporate board would have known about the deal and had the chance to question it. The company neither confirmed nor denied that the board approved the transaction. At some point, the board would have approved filings that included the fraudulent losses, but it’s unclear whether Romney specifically favored the tax move.

Outside group claims Aaron Bean voted to give health care subsidies to illegal aliens
","
A third-party group in the middle of an ultra-competitive Republican state Senate primary is continuing to make illegal immigration a centerpiece of the campaign.

The group, Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics, is targeting former state Rep. Aaron Bean for past votes. Bean is running for a Jacksonville-area seat against current state Rep. Mike Weinstein. Previously, we looked at the claim that Bean voted for ""in-state tuition breaks for illegal immigrants."" We examined the facts and rated the claim Mostly True.

Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics is doubling down with a different claim in a new TV ad, accusing ""Mr. Bean"" (a reference to the dimwitted British character played by comedian Rowan Atkinson, perhaps?) of voting to ""also give health care subsidies to illegal aliens"" in 2007.

We decided to see if the new attack has merit.

As evidence, the group cites HB 7189, a proposal considered during the 2007 legislative session about Florida KidCare, which houses federal and state subsidized health care programs for children.

The goal of this bill was to fulfill a plan by now-U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who was Florida House speaker in 2007 and 2008, to expand access to health care coverage for children. (It was Idea No. 86 in his 2006 book 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida’s Future.)

HB 7189 would have allowed anyone who is under 19, a Florida resident and uninsured to be enrolled in KidCare. The bill made a number of administrative tweaks to ease the application process.

More pertinent to our fact-check, the bill would have expanded premium assistance to two types of children, if the Legislature appropriated money for them: children of state employees, and ""noncitizens"" or ""not qualified aliens.""

The inclusion of ""noncitizens"" and ""not qualified aliens"" is the basis of the claim from Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics.

But that’s in error.

Non-qualified aliens and noncitizens isn’t code for ""illegal immigrant.""

States commonly use the terms to refer to other noncitizens who are lawfully present in the U.S. 
Arizona’s Medicaid administration agency, for instance, breaks down three groups of noncitizens like this: qualified aliens, undocumented aliens (aka illegal immigrants), and non-qualified aliens, who are admitted legally for a limited time and include foreign students, business visitors, and temporary workers on visas.

Rep. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, who sponsored the KidCare reform push in 2007 and is running for state Senate this year, told PolitiFact Florida the bill was not written to subsidize illegal immigrants’ health insurance.

""Certainly the intent of the bill was not to expand KidCare to illegal aliens,"" Galvano said. ""The thrust of the bill was ultimately to lessen the fiscal impact on the taxpayer while at the same time providing health care to those in need.""

Like most bills, this legislation was written without the kind of detailed rulemaking delegated to state agencies. Had the bill become law, those rules might have been more explicit so that the subsidized premiums would not apply to illegal immigrants, though they are already banned under federal law from receiving government assistance.

To be fair to Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics, what ""noncitizens"" and ""not qualified legal aliens"" actually meant got lost on the Legislature as well.

During debate on the House floor, Rep. Gayle Harrell, R-Port St. Lucie, introduced a late-filed, one-line amendment: ""The Florida Kidcare Program shall not provide premium assistance for enrollees who are illegal aliens.""

Her amendment spawned impassioned, and confused, debate, with some conservatives saying undocumented children should be eligible, too.  ""This is not about illegal children. It’s not about legal children. It’s about children in the state of Florida,"" said Rep. Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, according to a couple news accounts.

Harrell did not have the support needed to bring the amendment for a floor vote. The bill passed the House 98-14, with Bean and Rubio among conservatives voting in favor (Bean, then House Healthcare Council chairman, voted for it in committee too). But drama over the amendment slowed the bill’s momentum in the final days of session, and the Senate decided not to bring the proposal to a vote.

""Unfortunately, some people thought the bill would have impacted undocumented kids,"" said Karen Woodall, executive director of the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, who pushed for the bill in 2007. ""That whole debate -- while it was in my opinion morally correct and good -- it made it seem like it was going to impact those kids, and that’s why it didn’t pass in the Senate.""

Our ruling

Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics says Bean voted to give health care subsidies to illegal immigrants.

The group, however, misrepresents the bill’s intent by saying ""not qualified legal aliens"" is the same as ""illegal immigrants."" That’s not true. The bottom line is HB 7189 -- which never passed -- would have applied to children legally allowed to be in the United States.

Congressional candidate Anna Little claims she “made history” in nearly defeating Rep. Frank Pallone in 2010
","
Even though her 2010 bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone ended in defeat, Republican congressional candidate Anna Little says she still made history.

As Little prepares for a rematch against Pallone in the Nov. 6 general election, the Monmouth County native has said the 2010 victory was his narrowest win in more than two decades.

""We actually made history in 2010. We came the closest in 24 years to defeating Frank Pallone,"" Little, a former county freeholder and mayor, said in an Aug. 2 interview on NJToday. ""We think we’ve got a great foundation and we want to pick up where we left off.""

The 2010 election did mark the closest Pallone victory in two decades, but it wasn’t exactly the historic outcome that Little described in her TV interview.

As of 2010, the Democratic congressman was only first elected 22 years beforehand -- not ""24 years,"" as Little claimed. Yet even over those 22 years, Pallone’s margin of victory in 2010 was not the closest. He had tighter victories in his first two elections for a two-year House seat.

Here’s how the election results break down:

When Republicans took control of the House in 2010, Pallone narrowly defeated Little by 16,520 votes to continue representing the Sixth Congressional District. Little’s candidacy was backed by the Tea Party movement, which played a key role in securing wins for GOP House candidates across the country.

The close election in 2010 was a stark change from most of Pallone's preceding victories. Just in 2008, the congressman had won by more than 86,000 votes for the largest margin of victory in his career. In fact, the 2010 election represented the closest Pallone victory in 20 years.

But in 1988 and 1990, the congressman faced even closer calls.

Pallone defeated Republican Joseph Azzolina in 1988 by 9,545 votes for his first two-year term. In 1990, Pallone tallied 4,170 more votes than Republican Paul Kapalko.

The following chart shows Pallone’s GOP challengers and margins of victory since winning his first two-year seat in 1988. 
  
For trivia buffs out there, you’ll notice that Kyrillos -- Pallone’s 1992 challenger -- is the GOP candidate for U.S. Senate this year, looking to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez in the general election.

Our ruling

In a TV interview, Little claimed: ""We actually made history in 2010. We came the closest in 24 years to defeating Frank Pallone.""

There’s no doubt that Pallone’s victory over Little in 2010 was one of the closest wins of his career, but the timing of Little’s claim is off.

The congressman’s margin of victory represented his tightest win in 20 years -- not 24 years -- and the third-closest finish of all his races for a two-year House seat. Pallone won by even fewer votes in 1988 and 1990.

We rate the statement False.

"['Welfare', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
Bob McDonnell says Obama is ""unwinding"" welfare-to-work requirements
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell is accusing the Obama administration of reversing federal welfare laws that require people who receive public aid to be on a path towards finding a job.

McDonnell has joined a number of Republicans -- including presidential nominee Mitt Romney -- in criticizing the administration’s announcement in July that states will be allowed to seek waivers from welfare-to-work requirements passed in 1996 under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.

Those reforms tied block welfare grants for states to work requirements and limit the amount of time a person can receive benefits.

""By unwinding our nation’s welfare-to-work requirements, the Obama administration is making a tragic mistake,"" McDonnell wrote in an August 6 op-ed that ran in the Richmond Times-Dispatch and is posted on McDonnell’s political website and Romney’s campaign website.

Is Obama ""unwinding"" those requirements? We checked.

Tucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, backed McDonnell’s statement by citing editorials that take aim at the administration’s decision. Martin also emailed us an Associated Press article saying the White House has  ""quietly opened the door for states to seek major changes in how they meet federal welfare-to-work requirements for some of their poorest residents.""

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced the waiver program on July 12, saying exemptions would be granted  to allow states to ""test alternative and innovative strategies, policies and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families.""

The directive said  ""HHS will only consider approving waivers relating to the work participation requirements that make changes intended to lead to more effective means of meeting the work goals of TANF.""  The department said if a test project does not result in improved employment for welfare recipients, the waiver could be revoked.

George Sheldon, an assistant secretary at HHS, said in a July 12 letter to state human services officials that the administration’s move stemmed from a February 28, 2011 presidential memorandum that called on federal agencies to work with state governments to remove regulatory barriers that undermine federal programs.

As a result, Sheldon said HHS held talks with state, local and tribal officials about many issues -- including TANF.

""During those consultations, many jurisdictions expressed a strong interest in greater flexibility in TANF and indicated that greater flexibility could be used by states to improve program effectiveness,"" Sheldon said. ""We also heard concerns that some TANF rules stifle innovation and focus attention on paperwork rather than helping parents find jobs.""

The move caused an uproar among conservatives who argued the change was a bid to sneak around welfare-to-work requirements.

Romney went a step further in a TV ad that started running last week in Virginia and other swing states, saying, under Obama’s plan, ""you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check."" Our colleagues at PolitiFact National rated that claim Pants on Fire in an August 7 story.

Politifact noted that through the changes, the administration is hoping to make the welfare-to-work efforts more successful -- not end them altogether.

FactCheck.org examined that ad’s claim that the adminstration’s decision would ""gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements."" It concluded, ""The plan does neither of those things.""

It should be noted that the Republican governors of Utah and Nevada have expressed interest in obtaining waivers from TANF requirements in order to boost employment for welfare recipients.

""Nevada is very interested in working with your staff to explore program waivers that have the potential to encourage more cooperative relationships among state agencies engaged in economic stimulus through job creation, employment skill attainment and gainful employment activities,"" Michael Willden, director of Nevada’s Department of Health and Human Services said in an August 2, 2011 letter to HHS.

Mary-Sarah Kinner, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, said that although state officials discussed the possibility of a waiver, the state never requested one and doesn’t intend to.

But Utah officials have asked for a waiver.

""Utah’s goal through all of this is to increase work-related outcomes, and we felt that this waiver would better allow us to achieve that goal,"" said Nic Dunn, a spokesman for Utah Gov. Gary Herbert.

A final note: There’s a dispute about whether the administration is allowed to provide these waivers. Although HHS says it can, Republicans maintain the 1996 law doesn’t allow the executive branch to grant waivers to the work rules.

Our Ruling

McDonnell said the Obama administration is  ""unwinding"" welfare-to-work requirements.

But a new Obama program does not end welfare-to-work mandates. To the contrary, it strengthens the requirements by granting waivers to states seeking to make the work requirements more successful. The waivers would be granted to pilot programs that are individually evaluated; HHS is not proposing a blanket national change to welfare law.

Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel says U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown has sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries
","
Federal spending is a major issue in the U.S. Senate campaign of Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican trying to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. Mandel says spending is wasteful and unsustainable, and he names Brown as a reason.
Among several claims in Mandel's TV ad ""Change,"" which accuses Brown of trying to hide his record, is one that says ""Brown sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries.""

PolitiFact Ohio can't say if spending is wasteful, and we don't have a crystal ball to judge if it is sustainable. But we can assess if Brown is ""hiding"" (as the ad states) that he has sent billions of tax dollars overseas.

The ad's claim is spoken by an announcer and appears on screen next to a photo of Brown. In the background is a blended collage of the flags of Panama, China and South Korea.

The source cited in the ad for the claim is an article that appeared Sept. 9, 2010 in the Washington Times. The article said the Department of Energy had acknowledged that ""as much as 80 percent of some green (energy) programs, including $2.3 billion of manufacturing tax credits, went to foreign firms that employed workers primarily in countries including China, South Korea and Spain, rather than in the United States.""

The story also referred to a report by American University’s Investigative Reporting Workshop, in February 2010, that more than 79 percent of the first $2.1 billion in stimulus grants to wind energy companies went to foreign firms.

The report noted, however, that the grant money was distributed under a program administered by the Energy Department and Treasury, and not by Congress. In some instances, it said, the money went to the American subsidiaries of foreign companies.

The Washington Times story goes on to say that the Investigative Reporting Workshop report ""raised alarms in Congress. Leading Democrats insisted that the money be spent at home, but restrictions on the funds proved impossible without the specter of a trade war.""

Brown, who is not mentioned in the Washington Times article, was actually one of the senators who called for the Obama administration to suspend the program indefinitely ""until the law can be fixed so that funds only flow to projects that will create jobs in the United States.""

Co-sponsoring legislation to make that a requirement, Brown said, ""Taxpayers expect the government to use their dollars to support American jobs.""

PolitiFact Ohio looked at the wind project with the Chinese connection earlier this year and found it never got completed. Since companies could only collect money after completion and the program expired last year, it is safe to say that the amount that went to China was ""zero,"" Russ Choma, the reporter who performed the digging at the Investigative Reporting Workshop, told us.

Our friends at FactCheck.org, who also examined the Mandel ad's claim, found it to be ""highly misleading"" and not true.

Because the citation in the ad did not support the claim, we asked Mandel's campaign if it had additional sources.

""The charge in the ad is also supported by Sen. Brown's votes relative to foreign aid appropriations,"" spokesman Travis Considine said, citing a story from Politico as ""the most recent example of a vote held on the Appropriations Committee Sen. Brown sits on that approved $52.1 billion in foreign aid.""

He also provided a voting record to show that Brown ""has voted for at least $257.9 billion in foreign operations funding since he came to Washington in 1993."" The list included votes on omnibus appropriations bills, which cover many areas of spending and often enjoy wide bipartisan support.

The $52.1 billion figure in the Politico story refers to the State Department and foreign operations budget. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, that budget funds U.S. diplomatic and foreign aid activities, and ""has been the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. international affairs budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making in recent years.""

Included in the budget are the cost of building, staffing and protecting embassies and consular activities; funding for the war-related states of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which were exceeded by Israel as the top U.S. foreign aid recipients; foreign economic and security assistance, and contributions to international organizations and missions and multilateral financial institutions.

""U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests are rationales for most international affairs activities,"" the Congressional Research Service said in its report on the budget.

The CRS also summed up debate about the budget: ""International affairs expenditures typically amount to about 1.5 percent of the total federal budget. While some foreign policy and defense experts view that share as a small price to pay for a robust foreign affairs budget that they believe is essential to meeting national security and foreign policy objectives, others see international affairs spending, particularly foreign aid, as an attractive target for significant spending cuts in order to reduce deficit spending.""

How much could spending practically be cut?

Sen. Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, is a fiscal conservative who has been called ""the Senate's chief waste-watcher."" He released a $9 trillion deficit reduction plan last year that would trim ""wasteful, duplicative and low-priority spending"" from the Department of State and its foreign operations budget.

He estimated the 10-year savings at $192 billion, which still would leave a multi-billion dollar foreign operations budget annually.

As for the ad's flags of China, Panama and South Korea, we have previously found Brown to be one of the Senate's most ardent critics of U.S. foreign trade policies. He has voted against trade deals with China, Panama and South Korea -- and Colombia, Central America, Mexico and Canada.

Let's bring it home.

The ad claims Brown sent billions of dollars to foreign countries. The information that the ad uses to back up that claim, that Brown voted for the stimulus bill, has been proven false. Brown did not make decisions on how that money would be spent, and he was one of the senators who called for its suspension after the foreign grants were reported.

When confronted with those facts, the Mandel campaign offered as support for its claim that Brown votes for appropriations for U.S. foreign operations. That's the money for embassies, war-related spending to help establish new governments and the U.S. portions of international missions. That's a ridiculous stretch from what the ad implies, which is that Brown tried to hide that he irresponsibly sent billions or our tax dollars to foreign countries.

We have a rating for statements that are both false and ridiculous. It's Pants on Fire.

Tourism advertising is not on Georgia's mind, lawmaker says
","
Metro Atlanta cities may do little to ensure government dollars to promote tourism are doing their job, but that doesn’t mean that the state should rein in spending, an elected official said recently.  

Georgia isn’t spending enough money in the first place, said state Rep. Ron Stephens, chairman of the House Economic Development and Tourism Committee.

""We spend less dollars advertising than any other state in the South,"" Stephens said in an Aug. 6 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about oversight of city tourism funds.

That’s exactly the kind of thing we’d expect the head of the tourism committee to say. But is it true? We asked the Savannah Republican for more information.

We feel obliged to note that Georgia and its cities have a checkered history in tourism marketing.

State taxpayers will be paying $1.2 million annually for the next few decades on former Gov. Sonny Perdue’s ""Go Fish"" tourism program.

Perdue's vision for the plan was to make Georgia ""a fisherman's paradise"" by developing the economy, attracting high-dollar fishing tournaments, improving access to state lakes and increasing angling participation.

Critics argue it was a pork project for Perdue’s hometown, Bonaire, which is near the Go Fish Education Center.

And there’s Brand Atlanta, a shuttered effort to market Georgia’s capital city. It raised some $8 million between 2005 and 2006 from corporations and government, including $1 million from the convention and visitors bureau. The campaign featured a widely panned theme song.

But the budget went bust during the Great Recession, its staff was laid off in 2008 and Brand Atlanta is no more.

State tourism funds shrank as the economy stumbled, and Stephens thinks it’s a shame.  

""If we advertise the jewels we have, then more people will come here and we’ll get that money back,"" Stephens said.

Stephens said his statement about low spending referred to the amount of money state governments spend to promote tourism, as well as the number of dollars spent per capita. It excludes spending by the city of Atlanta and other localities.

Stephens referred us to data collected by the Georgia Department of Economic Development.

A department spokeswoman sent us state-by-state figures compiled by the U.S. Travel Association, an industry group that researches and promotes travel to and within the country.  

Policymakers, other trade organizations and media use USTA’s numbers widely. We were unable to find another organization that collects similar data.   

We started our analysis by separating out USTA data for Southern states. This is more difficult than you might think.

Government agencies disagree on what counts as the South. Born and bred Southerners do, too.

Even some newcomers get the vapors when Yankees lump South Florida in with the rest of us.    

What’s worse, the official U.S. census definition includes Oklahoma.

Really? We thought. Do they even sell sweet tea there?

We struck a Great Compromise and focused on the 11 states that formally seceded from the Union during the Civil War, plus Kentucky. (What would the South be without Kentucky or its bourbon?)

Then we crunched the numbers for fiscal year 2011-2012.

Georgia was second only to Kentucky in the lowest amount spent on tourism. Our fiscal year 2011-2012 provisional budget stood at $2,551,516, according to USTA data. Kentucky’s was $1,888,300.

The Peach State fared worse in other measures of state tourism spending.

The population and budgets of Southern states vary widely, so we considered two additional pieces of data that take these differences into account: The amount of state tourism funding allocated per capita, which Stephens also said was the lowest in the South; and tourism allocations as a portion of a state’s budget.

Georgia ranked last on a per capita basis at $0.26 per person. Arkansas placed first at $3.05 per person.

Georgia also ranked last on tourism advertising as a portion of the state budget. During fiscal year 2012, Georgia set aside 0.014 percent of its general fund budget toward tourism advertising.

Kentucky was the second-lowest on our list. Once again, Arkansas placed first.

Our ruling:

Stephens said that Georgia’s state government spends fewer tourism advertising dollars than any other in the South. He was right in the metrics that matter most: per capita spending, and spending as a percentage of state budget.

In dollars, Stephens was close. Only Kentucky spends less.

Disavowed Democratic Senate primary winner claims TSA makes non-straight employees grab children
","
Mark Clayton, the 32-year-old floor installer and former Army Reserve aircraft technician who recently won the Democratic Party primary as a candidate for the U.S. Senate from Tennessee, has made a lot of colorful, sometimes wacky statements, as he campaigns. We decided to check out one found on his campaign’s Facebook page, in which he claims that the federal government ""mandates transexuals (sic) and homosexuals grabbing children in their stranger-danger zones in the name of airport security.""

We asked Clayton for some supporting documentation or evidence for this assertion and he responded by sending a Public Advocate of the United States press release. It contains the statement of Eugene Delgaudio, president of Public Advocate, under the headline, ""We were right all along: Perverse court allows TSA male agent to grope women."" The statement begins: ""The TSA’s mix of ultra-leftist hiring practices along with their intrusive ‘security’ procedures of pornographic scanners and groping is leading to disaster.""

We suggested to Clayton that the assertions by Delgaudio, a Loudoun County, Va., supervisor and fervent anti-gay-rights advocate, did not support his statement factually, but we received no further response. We took note that the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks right-wing extremist groups, has labeled Public Advocate a ""hate"" group. The Democratic party has disavowed Clayton’s candidacy, has tried to keep him off the ballot and has suggested voters write in an alternative.

But we decided to look at the case that Delgaudio made involving a transgender employee named Ashley Yang who worked for the TSA in Los Angeles. Yang dressed as a woman and took hormone therapy to look like a woman. Yang was fired after complaining of discrimination, sued and received five months’ back pay and other compensation in a negotiated settlement.

From what we can find from legitimate sources, the Yang case does not involve ""transexuals (sic) or homosexuals grabbing children in their stranger-danger zones,"" nor even transsexuals doing so. It does involve employment law regarding the on-the-job treatment involving gender identity, and a voluntary settlement in which one party was a federal government agency.

Bending over backwards to try to make Delgaudio’s statement somehow support Clayton’s claim, we nonetheless note Delgaudio is alleging that Yang was groping women, not children. There is a difference, even if the allegation itself is dubious.

Delgaudio also made a statement that ""when I see men with wigs and dresses lining up to work as TSA screeners, or little boys crying because a strange man is violating their bodies, I know that I can’t possibly be on the wrong path."" Absent reports that such things are happening, that does not pass for evidence.

Nonetheless, we sought out a response to the claim from the TSA. Jonathan Allen, a TSA spokesman, responded to our inquiry with the following statement: ""While fulfilling a critical and necessary security mission, we are conscious of individual concerns of passengers and strive to conduct the screening process with dignity and respect.""

Allen also sent along TSA policy statements on Civil Rights, the screening of children and on ""pat downs."" The policy regarding children reads in part: ""Security officers will approach children gently and treat them with respect. If a child becomes uncomfortable or upset, security officers will consult parents about the best way to relieve the child's concern.""

Our ruling

The state Democratic Party’s disavowal of Clayton is but one indication of his lack of credibility. This kind of baseless statement is yet another. The TSA does not mandate that any of its screeners ""grope"" children in any ""zone."" Clayton is making a ridiculous, reckless claim, and for that we give this statement a Pants On Fire!",/factchecks/2012/aug/13/mark-clayton/disavowed-democratic-senate-primary-winner-claims-/
"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'New Jersey Democratic State Committee']","
Mitt Romney’s tax cut proposal blasted by New Jersey Democrats for using $2,000 middle-class tax hike to cover $5 trillion in tax cuts for the rich
","
Millionaires and billionaires could see trillions in tax cuts paid for by the middle class if Mitt Romney gets his way, New Jersey Democrats claim.

Just as President Barack Obama has done in a recent campaign ad, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee has latched onto a new study from the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center. The study says that under the presumptive Republican presidential candidate’s proposals, wealthy taxpayers pay fewer taxes and middle- and lower-income taxpayers pay more.

""The non-partisan organization found that Romney would raise taxes on the average middle class family by $2,000 to pay for $5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires,"" the committee said in an Aug. 1 news release.

The Democrats are right about the $2,000 tax hike on the average middle-class family, but they’re wrong in citing ""$5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires."" Those wealthy taxpayers would get a tax break, but not that much.

First, let’s explain the purpose behind the study.

Romney has proposed various tax cuts, including a 20 percent reduction in all federal income tax rates. But Romney’s plan also allows certain tax benefits for low-income households to expire.

Those changes would mean lower taxes at most income levels -- but that’s before the candidate’s plan is paid for. The Romney campaign has not specified how the plan would offset that tax revenue loss, but the Tax Policy Center study gives it a shot.

In short, those tax cuts would require eliminating or reducing certain tax deductions and write-offs, according to the study. Those items include mortgage interest deductions and education-related tax credits.

Still, for wealthy taxpayers, the cost of losing those tax loopholes is less than the money gained from the tax cuts. That’s why they’re left with a net tax break.

But for middle- and lower-income folks, it’s the other way around. They stand to lose more in tax loopholes than gain by the tax cuts, leaving them with a greater tax bill at the end of the day.

So, the Democrats’ claim accurately makes that overall point, but wrongly compares the $2,000 and $5 trillion figures. Think of it as an apples-to-oranges comparison.

After factoring in eliminating or reducing the tax loopholes, the average tax hike in 2015 would be about $2,000 for taxpayers making less than $200,000 a year, who also have children.

But the $5 trillion represents the potential tax cuts over a 10-year period before you account for eliminating or reducing those loopholes. Higher-income taxpayers would end up with a net tax break, but the total savings would be far less than $5 trillion.

Here’s the number Democrats should have cited: taxpayers with incomes exceeding $1 million, on average, would get a roughly $87,000 net tax break in 2015. Take away those tax loopholes, and wealthy taxpayers would still get that amount.

It’s also worth noting that Democrats are wrong to suggest only ""millionaires and billionaires"" would benefit from Romney’s plan.

Those wealthy taxpayers would receive the greatest net tax savings, but other average taxpayers making more than $200,000 would benefit as well. For instance, taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000, on average, would receive a net tax break of roughly $1,800.

Our ruling

In a news release, the committee claimed the Tax Policy Center ""found that Romney would raise taxes on the average middle class family by $2,000 to pay for $5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.""

But those two figures don’t relate to one another. The $2,000 tax hike accounts for eliminating or reducing the tax deductions and write-offs that pay for Romney’s plan, but the $5 trillion does not. The more appropriate comparison would be the average net tax break of about $87,000 for those wealthy taxpayers.

Still, the Democrats’ overall point is correct: the study shows that high-income taxpayers would receive a tax break, while middle- and lower-income taxpayers pay higher taxes.

We rate the statement Half True.

"['Tennessee', 'Education', 'Lottery', 'Dolores Gresham']","
Education chair Gresham said she didn’t push bill she sponsored to raise eligibility standards for Hope Scholarships
","
The Tennessee Education Lottery Corp. released its fiscal year 2011-12 results on July 16, reporting record sales and record proceeds for education. The Commercial Appeal called state Sen. Dolores Gresham, R-Somerville, for her reaction because she sponsored the bill this year to raise the eligibility standards for Tennessee’s lottery-funded Hope Scholarships.

We weren’t surprised that Gresham, the chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee, was pleased with the lottery’s financial news – a $30 million increase for education over the previous year, far more than needed to cover the projected deficits. ""Their success means success for students who earn lottery scholarships,"" she said.  

But we were surprised when the senator told the newspaper that she hadn’t pushed the bill that would have made it tougher for high school students to win the full $4,000 per year basic Hope Scholarship. ""I didn’t try to push anything,"" said Gresham, whose district is about 30 miles east of Memphis. ""The bill died. That’s not even an issue.""

Gresham was sponsor of the bill in the Senate and argued for its approval in two separate Senate committees and on the Senate floor, where it was approved in a partisan vote April 16. The bill later failed to become law when the House sponsor withdrew it on April 30, citing record lottery revenues. In March, we examined Sen. Gresham’s statement that the lottery reserve fund could sustain possible lottery-scholarship program deficits for ""only"" a few more years more and ruled it False.

The policy contained in the bill was recommended last December by the Senate Lottery Stabilization Task Force, which Gresham chaired. The Tennessee Higher Education Commission had estimated the change would eliminate projected deficits in the program by cutting in half the Hope Scholarships for 5,200 to 6,600 new students per year. The bill also would have increased by $10 million per year state funding for the Tennessee Student Assistance grants, a separate scholarship program whose aid is entirely need-based. That provision would have served about 5,700 more students, with annual grants averaging $1,800 each. Gresham had also sponsored a bill in 2011 that would have raised qualification standards for all Hope recipients, but it never reached the Senate floor.

We wondered how a lawmaker could say she didn’t ""push"" a bill when she was its sponsor, argued on several occasions for its passage, resisted efforts to block its passage and led it to approval in the Senate, so we emailed Gresham to ask for clarification. Senate Republican Caucus press secretary Darlene Schlicher responded, after speaking with Gresham, with a statement:

""This sounds like a quibble over semantics. Sen. Gresham sponsored and advocated for
this piece of legislation in her role as Lottery Scholarship Stabilization Task Force Chairman. No one disputes this. What Chairman Gresham took issue with was the implication by the reporter that she had attempted to twist arms or exert undue influence on the bill. She did not. Chairman Gresham did her job as a Task Force chairman and sponsor. Period.""

Some background is in order. The task force’s reason for being really dates back to fiscal year 2009, when the Tennessee Lottery had its first and only year-to-year decline in proceeds since its 2004 launch. It was the first time the program ran a deficit, and to close the books that year, the scholarship program took about $9.3 million from its huge $400 million-plus reserve fund.

Last summer, Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey appointed a task force of senators and higher education officials to examine the issue. It concluded that deficits of up to $17 million to $20 million a year would occur in the short term, before falling considerably by 2020 if no changes were made. The panel recommended tightening eligibility requirements so that students entering college in 2015 must have a high school grade-point average of at least 3.0 and at least a 21 on the ACT to qualify for the basic $4,000 per year Hope Scholarship. Since the program began, students qualified by achieving one of the two standards – either a 3.0 high school GPA or a minimum 21 ACT score. Under the task force plan, students who scored one of the two standards but not both would receive a $2,000 annual scholarship.

But even as the task force was working last autumn, the lottery was racking up record sales monthly. In fact, the lottery has been on a roll since the 2009 decline, rebounding in 2010 to a record level outstripping 2008’s pre-recession earnings. It set another record in 2011 and again in fiscal year 2012, yielding $323 million for education – up from $292 million the previous year. Thus, the projected annual deficit did not occur, and the lottery reserve fund still has over $400 million in it.

As chairman of the task force, Gresham sponsored the task force’s recommendations in the form of Senate Bill 2514. Some examples of her advocacy:

--Gresham argued for passage in a 51-minute discussion in the Senate Education Committee on Feb. 15, over the objections of Sen. Andy Berke, D-Chattanooga.
--On Feb. 29, the Education Committee heard an update on lottery revenues from lottery executives, who reported that proceeds for education in the first seven months of the fiscal year were already $10 million ahead of the previous year and said they believed they could sustain at least that level into the future. Gresham told reporters after the meeting that she ""absolutely"" planned to proceed with the bill.
--On March 7, after 21 minutes of talk, the Education Committee approved an oral amendment by Gresham that said the new eligibility standards would not go into effect in 2015 as the bill required if the lottery’s education proceeds were up at least $10 million annually over the next three years.
--On March 20, Gresham presented the bill in the Senate Finance Committee, which discussed it for 22 minutes and then deferred a vote to the following week.
--On March 27, the Finance Committee discussed the bill for 38 minutes before sending it to the Senate floor.. Gresham discussed the amendment again and emphasized that it meant only that the lottery had to generate $10 million more this year than last year, $10 million plus $1 the following year and $10 million plus $2 the following year.
--On April 16, the bill was debated for 46 minutes on the Senate floor before winning approval on a 20-10 vote, with all Republicans favoring it and all but four Democrats opposing it. Gresham made her most vocal arguments for the bill here, against specific arguments raised by Democratic Sens. Berke, Jim Kyle (Memphis) and Roy Herron (Dresden). Gresham moved an amendment on the bill and tabled another.  

Our ruling  
It may be a quibble over semantics, but we think when the record shows that a state Senate committee chairwoman sponsored a bill, argued for its passage through two separate committee, tabled amendments offered by opponents and led it to passage on the Senate floor, that qualifies as trying to push for a bill. On the Senate floor, only one other member even spoke in favor of the bill in the entire 45-minute floor debate. We rule this statement False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/12/dolores-gresham/education-chair-gresham-said-she-didnt-push-bill-s/
"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Health Care', 'Government Regulation', 'Public Health', 'States', 'Mike Stenhouse']","
R.I. Center for Freedom and Prosperity CEO Mike Stenhouse says Rhode Island has the most health-insurance mandates in U.S.
","
As part of its laundry list of what's wrong with Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, a conservative think tank that focuses on tax policy and business climate, has a report card that gives the state poor grades on a variety of measures.

Chief Executive Officer Mike Stenhouse, who formerly ran the Ocean State Policy Research Institute, invoked those comparisons in a July 29, 2012, Providence Journal commentary that urged residents to take action. He cited problems such as high unemployment, bad business climate, dangerously high pension liabilities.

He also talked about health care, saying, ""We have the most burdensome level of health-insurance mandates in the nation, yet the Chafee administration is pushing us towards even more government control of our personal health-care decisions.""

In his commentary, he didn't specify how he defined burdensome. But in a subsequent e-mail, he made it clear: ""Given that we see mandates as burden, and given that R.I. has the highest number of mandates, yes, I stand by my quote that R.I. has the most burdensome level of health-insurance mandates.""

We know of several such mandates. They cover everything from expensive infertility treatments and hearing aids to Lyme disease treatment and wigs for people undergoing chemotherapy.

We’re not going to weigh in on whether such mandates are burdensome or not. That’s a matter of opinion. But we can analyze how many health-care mandates we have in Rhode Island and how that compares nationally. As we found out, it depends on who is counting and how they do it.

A question of categories

The source for Stenhouse's assessment was a 50-page report, ""Health Insurance Mandates in the States 2010,"" by the Council for Affordable Health Insurance, an association of insurance carriers.

The report looked at 136 mandate categories in each state, from requirements that adopted children be covered by an insurance policy (44 states) to requirements that policies cover HIV testing and/or treatment (10 states).

When we contacted the council, Victoria Craig Bunce, its research and policy director, said, ""we send out data to the [state] each year and they review it for accuracy.""

The office of Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller confirmed that it supplied data on the mandates to the council, and that it gave a positive response to 69 out of the 136 categories. But not everyone categorizes the mandates the same way.

Koller's office sent us a May 2012 report done for his office by KeriAnn Wells, of the University of California at Berkeley. Part of the report documents 24 mandates in Rhode Island law, not 69.

A comparison of the two reports revealed that the council’s number is higher because it uses more categories, such as listing mammograms and pap smears separately. The mandates on its list also include whether insurance plans must cover services from practitioners such as psychologists and nurse practitioners, and whether persons such as adopted children must be covered. The Wells list doesn't tally those categories.

The advantage to using the council’s data is that it uses the same method for all the states, allowing a comparison across the country.

According to the council’s count, Rhode Island ranks first with 69 mandates. Maryland is second with 67, followed by Minnesota, Texas and Connecticut.

But then we found another source that gave a different story.

The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association has its own 2011 state-by-state count of mandates. Its list indicates that Rhode Island is 17th, with 43 such mandates.

In short, the ranking depends on who has done it.

Proof of burden

So are all these mandates burdensome, as Stenhouse says?

Stenhouse explained in an e-mail that the mandates are a problem because ""mandates generally raise the cost of health insurance products, making it less affordable for those who do pay. [It's] a cost burden for employers and consumers, both.""

In addition to increasing costs, ""mandates also mean that some people will pay for insurance protection for services they would never utilize,"" he said in his e-mail. ""In the end, we believe it is best if the consumer, not the government, chooses what coverage any specific individual should have.""

Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, acknowledged that ""every time health insurance covers more, it's going to cost more.""

""However, it's important to pool risks so we all pay the same when we're healthy and we all have the same protection when we get sick. But insurance doesn't do that today,"" she said. ""There's a lot of cherry-picking going on"" as companies try to sign up the healthiest customers, leaving the sick to buy policies that become disproportionately expensive.

Mandates bring some equity to the system, she said.

One final note: After our analysis of the 2010 CAHI report, Stenhouse sent us an updated mandates list from the organization. In its 2011 survey, Rhode Island was tied in the top spot with Virginia with 70 mandates each.

Our ruling

Mike Stenhouse of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity said Rhode Island has ""the most burdensome level of health-insurance mandates in the nation."" 
We'll leave it to others to decide whether laws requiring health insurers to cover things such as mental health problems, infertility and wigs for people who have lost their hair during chemotherapy create a burden Rhode Island needs to correct.

Although Stenhouse cites a national study that lists Rhode Island as being in first place in 2010 -- and tied for first in 2011 -- a Blue Cross tally shows that Rhode Island is in 17th place, not even in the top third nationally.

We rate his statement as Half True.

"['Education', 'Texas', 'Gail  Collins']","
Gail Collins says Texas GOP platform calls for schools to stop teaching “critical thinking”
","New York Times columnist Gail Collins’ latest book, ""As Texas Goes,"" takes the state to task for, well, being Texas. And her Aug. 1, 2012, column did pretty much the same.

Casting the nomination of Ted Cruz for U.S. Senate as a harbinger of doom, Collins wrote that Texas ""does tend to treasure the extreme"" in politics, saying, ""The current Republican state platform calls for an end to the teaching of ‘critical thinking’ in public schools.""

Collins is actually a bit late to this party: Major liberal websites launched assaults on this part of the 2012 platform (adopted June 8) as early as June 26, and Comedy Central’s ""Colbert Report"" satirized it July 17.

Mainstream media weighed in, too. A July 9 Washington Post blog entry was headlined ""Texas GOP rejects ‘critical thinking’ skills. Really."" Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts wrote July 21: ""The Texas GOP has set itself explicitly against teaching children to be critical thinkers.""

Austin American-Statesman opinion columnist Ken Herman reported July 21 that the party’s deputy executive director, Chris Elam, told him the platform subcommittee did not intend to indicate that the party opposed critical thinking skills.

We began our research by trying to contact Collins but did not hear from her. Her column gives no information about her claim beyond that single sentence.

We pulled the complete wording of the ""Knowledge-Based Education"" plank from the 2012 platform:
  We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority. 
Next, we contacted Elam, who told us by email that party chairman Steve Munisteri had given a good explanation in a July 24 interview with Austin’s KVUE-TV.

Munisteri told KVUE, ""The platform plank is against a specific type of teaching called 'outcome-based education.'

""The reason why critical thinking is mentioned is some places try to disguise the program of outcome-based education and just re-label it as 'critical thinking.' ""

That’s supported by the wording in the platform.

Following the lead of a July 6, 2012, Chronicle of Higher Education blog post on the Texas platform fracas, we looked back to the 2010 platform. Its ""Knowledge-Based Education"" plank said, ""The primary purpose of public schools is to teach critical thinking skills, reading, writing, arithmetic, phonics, history, science, and character … We oppose Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and similar programs.""

Both platforms support critical thinking when it comes to ""controversial theories"" such as evolution, which ""should be taught as challengeable scientific theories ... Teachers and students should be able to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these theories openly and without fear of retribution or discrimination of any kind.""

Next, we set out to see if we could determine whether opposing outcome-based education is also, de facto, opposing critical thinking in the larger sense.

The debate over outcome-based education caught fire in the 1990s as outcome-based curricula were installed in U.S. school districts. In the Lexis newspaper archive and on the web, we saw a dozen news stories and opinion pieces from as many states -- Texas included -- describing public concern about the new approach.

Opponents said the outcome-based approach was antithetical to critical thinking. They claimed it ""dumbed down"" curricula and influenced students to adopt liberal attitudes because the ""outcome"" of their studies was predetermined by academia.

Supporters claimed it encouraged -- in fact, taught -- critical thinking. Rather than testing students on facts learned by rote memorization, they said, it required children to demonstrate that they had learned to analyze the material.

So what the heck is it? The news stories we read indicate outcome-based education takes different forms nearly everywhere it’s applied. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram gave a description in an Oct. 30, 1996, news story about opposition to OBE-like elements in the state’s planned education overhaul:
  Under outcome-based education, academic and personal goals are set for students before they can graduate. The program stresses that children are not allowed to fail, so they might be given the same test or report over and over until they do the work satisfactorily. It also may eliminate traditional grades, competitive student assessments and distinct subjects and grade levels.   Methods of implementing outcome-based education include awarding group grades instead of individual grades and eliminating honors programs.     The ""founding father"" of OBE, education reformer William Spady, gave an example in an interview for the December 1992/January 1993 issue of Educational Leadership magazine, published by ASCD (formerly the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development).

Asked whether an outcome might be ""The student will be able to list the five causes of the Civil War,"" Spady replied: ""No, sorry; that is not an exit outcome. But, ‘Identify and explain the fundamental causes and consequences of the Civil War’ would be an enabling outcome worth pursuing en route to some larger exit outcome.""

Today, a divide remains between the ""OBE teaches kids to think"" side and the ""OBE suppresses thinking"" side.

We didn’t find allusions to ""critical thinking skills"" being used as a code phrase for OBE, but did note that a Feb. 15, 1994, news story in the Dallas Morning News said some educators were avoiding the name ""outcomes-based education"":
    Because of the controversy, many educators are going to great lengths to avoid being associated with outcomes-based education.   ""We've always had outcomes,"" said state school board member Diane Patrick. But ""we'd be foolish to call it outcomes-based education right now. That would be very unwise."" 
Our ruling

As Collins says, the Texas GOP platform does state that the party opposes ""critical thinking."" But Collins leaves out some important context. The platform makes it clear that its opposition is centered on one type of education model: outcome-based education.

That’s just the kind of situation addressed in PolitiFact’s definition of Half True: ""The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""

By those lights, Collins’ statement is Half True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/11/gail-collins/gail-collins-says-texas-gop-platform-calls-schools/
"['Oregon', 'City Budget', 'County Budget', 'Multnomah County Library Foundation']","
Would a library taxing district come at no cost to Portland's budget?
","
Multnomah County leaders decided last week to put a library taxing district on the November ballot -- but even before then it had been a topic of much discussion.

A Willamette Week article in mid-July looked at a report from the city of Portland noting that a district would come at a cost to the city’s budget. The weekly called the report a shot across ""Multnomah County’s bow."" About a week later, the Library Foundation, which helps secure private support for the Multnomah County Library, shot back in a newsletter to supporters.

""The City of Portland benefits greatly from our strong library system. That's why it's hard to understand why city leaders would consider opposing an effort that would so clearly help thousands of children, families, seniors and job-seekers, at no direct cost to the city budget.""

Basically, the foundation said the exact opposite of what Portland’s Office of Management and Finance had said. A few days later -- three business days to be exact -- the foundation attempted a clarification:

""In our communication last week, we mentioned the effects of a library district on the City of Portland. For clarification, a library district would increase the city's property tax compression by $7 million. City and county finances, and our tax structure, are complex and the actions of each jurisdiction often impact the other.""

Now, sometimes a correction is enough to prompt PolitiFact Oregon to drop a subject, but we thought that even with the clarification from the foundation, the issue was confusing enough to warrant a ruling. Since most reporters in The Oregonian newsroom don’t know what tax compression means, we’d imagine the folks receiving the newsletter were similarly confused.

With that in mind, we went back to the first statement -- that the district would come at "" no direct cost to the city budget.""

In order to understand the issue of tax compression we called Caryn Brooks, Portland Mayor Sam Adams’ spokeswoman. Tax compression, she said, is about as confusing as it gets. She offered us two things: A report that looked into how the district would affect compression and the number of Josh Harwood, the city economist who wrote it.

We gave the report a quick read through, but try as we might, we found it pretty hard to understand. So, we gave up and called Harwood.

The first thing we needed -- and no doubt you’ll need, too -- is some background. Thanks to Measure 5, a certain percentage of properties in Oregon have a limit on how much they can be taxed.

Now, because of that limit, certain taxes take priority over others. Permanent levies -- those going to the city, county and Port of Portland, for example -- get their take first. If there is still money left to pay out before the cap, then it gets directed to local option levies, which is what the library gets now.

As it happens, some properties don’t pay anything to the libraries because they’re tapped out before the library system can get its share.

However, if the library district levy goes through, that all changes. The library will be able to grab its slice of the tax pie at the same time as the other permanent levies, essentially chipping away at what certain properties pay out to the county and the city.

According to Harwood’s report, which bases its numbers on figures from the county, that’ll mean the city collects about $9.5 million less in property taxes. That reduction, in turn, means about a $7 million reduction in the city’s general fund for the 2013-14 budget period.

The city’s budget isn’t the only area that would see cuts, however. The Portland Children’s Levy, which goes toward a number of services for the city’s children, would also see a $1 million reduction.

The county would also see a hit, but as Harwood points out in his analysis, the county is already putting cash into the library system. If the library district were to pass, the county could feasibly redirect those funds to other budgetary areas, essentially coming out ahead.

We spoke with Merris Sumrall, the Library Foundation’s CEO, as well as Liz Kaufman, who is helping advise on the possible push for a district. Both said that the initial e-mail was sent out in good faith and corrected soon after. The reference to ""tax compression"" in the follow-up was simply an effort to use the language that the budget officer had used.

Moreover, Sumrall noted that she had sent a letter to Mayor Adams and the city commissioners the following day to apologize for the possible confusion and promised a clarification, which she then followed through with.

As Sumrall noted -- both when we spoke to her and in the corrected newsletter -- city and county leaders are discussing possible solutions. Still, there doesn’t seem to be any debate that, with things as they are now, the city will ultimately have less money to work with should a library district pass.

In the original e-mail, the Library Foundation asserted that the district would come at ""no direct cost"" to the city budget. It’s true, the city would not have to pay for the library directly, but a district would mean the city has $7 million less to work with. The comment was clarified, but it still left many with the wrong impression.

Group linked to Dwight Bullard says Ron Saunders “made the choice to stand with Rick Scott”
","
Nothing says kiss of death in a Democratic primary like a candidate looking cozy with Republican Gov. Rick Scott. And that’s what a recent mailer attacking state Rep. Ron Saunders does in a competitive South Florida state Senate battle.

The mailer shows a cartoon image of Saunders, the House’s Democratic minority leader from Key West, grinning and shaking hands with Scott as if they are best buds.

""As a state representative, Ron Saunders made the choice to stand with Rick Scott. Now he’s asking you to send him back to Tallahassee as your state senator. When you see Ron Saunders, tell him that supporting Rick Scott was the wrong choice.""

The mailer also states that Saunders ""has helped"" Scott to:

• ""Take money from public schools by expanding vouchers""

• ""Make college less accessible by restricting Bright Futures scholarships""

• ""Give extra tax breaks to the wealthiest Floridians while so many families are struggling""

Saunders is running in a crowded Democratic state Senate primary that includes state Rep. Dwight Bullard of Miami. Bullard comes from a political dynasty: His mother Larcenia Bullard is a state senator and his dad Edward is a former state legislator. The newly drawn District 39 spans Miami-Dade, Monroe, Collier and Hendry counties.

The mailer was sent by Tomorrow’s Vision of Florida, an electioneering communication organization formed by Edward and Larcenia Bullard in July. We made multiple attempts to reach Dwight, Edward and Larcenia Bullard and did not hear back.

For this article, we will check if Saunders voted as the mailer claims. And we will also explore whether those votes mean Saunders ""made the choice to stand with Rick Scott.""

""Take money from public schools by expanding vouchers""

The mailer cites two votes for this claim.

• SB 2126: This 2010 bill made changes to Florida’s Tax Credit Scholarship program, which allows corporate donors to fund private-school scholarships for poor children in return for tax breaks. It passed the House 95-23 on April 8, 2010 -- months before Scott was elected governor. Saunders voted with the majority in favor, while Rep. Dwight Bullard voted against it. Gov. Charlie Crist approved the bill, which expanded the program by increasing the pool of eligible families and raising the cap on tax credits.

• HB 859: This 2012 bill also made some changes to the same tax credit program, by again increasing the cap and removing the requirement that foster care students meet certain income requirements. Saunders voted in favor with the majority when it passed the house 92-24 on March 7, 2012, and it became law.

Rep. Dwight Bullard voted no on this bill. A note of irony here: Sen. Larcenia Bullard voted yes in the majority when this passed the Senate. She’s now vice president of the committee criticizing Saunders for voting the same way.

With the tax credits, the state doesn’t technically write the check: A business writes a check to a nonprofit for the scholarship and then the business gets a tax credit -- money that would have otherwise gone to state coffers, including some for education.

Saunders said the scholarships, which he supports, cost less than the per pupil funding for public schools, so he argues that it saves money. The Collins Center for Public Policy concluded in a 2007 report that the tax credit program ""did not have a negative impact upon K-12 General Fund Revenues for public education"" and saved the difference between the value of the scholarship and the value of K-12 per pupil revenue.

""Make college less accessible by restricting Bright Futures scholarships""

The mailer cites one vote, on HB 5201. This postsecondary education funding bill included several changes for Bright Futures, the college scholarships designed to keep students at Florida schools.

Among the changes were reducing the scholarship by $1 per credit hour and tightening eligibility requirements in an effort to save money amid a budget shortfall. The bill passed the house 93-26 on April 30, 2010 -- a few months before Scott was elected governor. It passed the Senate and Crist approved it. But here’s the interesting part: Both Saunders and Bullard voted no.

""Give extra tax breaks to the wealthiest Floridians while so many families are struggling""

The mailer cites two votes:

• HB 913: This bill passed April 6, 2010, a few months before Scott was elected governor. This bill gave a tax break for the purchase of airplanes by fractional owners. There were approximately 385 Florida owners of fractional airplane interests in 2006. This passed the House 109-7 with Saunders voting ""yes"" with the majority, and Rep. Dwight Bullard voting no. What made it into law was an economic development bill, SB 1752, that included the aircraft provision and that passed the House and Senate unanimously.

• HB 7185: This vote made some changes related to corporate income taxes. It passed the Senate unanimously on May 3, 2011, and then two days later passed the house 110-5. Saunders voted in the majority -- as did Bullard. (About a week earlier they split their vote on a version of the bill, with Saunders voting yes and Bullard no.) The bill updates the Florida Income Tax Code to reflect changes made by Congress. Florida businesses with taxable income of less than $25,000 will not have to pay any tax, staff analysis stated. The Tampa Bay Times wrote that the bill resulted in a tax break of $1,100 a year on average for 15,000 small businesses as first step in effort to cut the state's annual $2 billion corporate tax.

Neither of these bills were partisan in nature or unique to Scott’s agenda; both passed with overwhelming majorities in both chambers.

Saunders response

The biggest weapon in this mailer is the overall theme of telling Democratic primary voters that Saunders stands with Scott and helped him achieve legislative victories.

That message isn’t true, Saunders argued. As the Democratic leader, it's Saunders job to bash Scott’s proposals, as he did in his responses to Scott’s State of the State addresses in 2011 and 2012.

Saunders also said that he -- and Bullard -- were recognized by the liberal group Progress Florida as being among the 27 ""middle class champions"" in 2012. These champions voted against bills that would hurt the middle class including ""Gov. Scott's anti-middle class budget (which) continues to dramatically underfund Florida's public schools,"" Progress Florida wrote.

 Our ruling

An electioneering communication organization headed by state Rep. Dwight Bullard’s father said that one of his son’s opponents, State Rep. Ron Saunders ""has helped Gov. Rick Scott."" Let’s review their evidence for each one:

""Take money from public schools by expanding vouchers"": This is the only part of the mailer that comes anywhere close to truth. The mailer cites two votes Saunders took to expand tax credits. But the mailer omits any explanation about the minimal impact on public school funding.

 ""Make college less accessible by restricting Bright Futures scholarships"": The mailer cites a vote that trimmed Bright Futures, which Saunders voted against. So the mailer fails to support this argument.

 ""Give extra tax breaks to the wealthiest Floridians while so many families are struggling"": Saunders voted to provide a tax credit for people who share airplanes, but this was a very narrow tax break for a tiny group of people. He also voted to reduce the state’s corporate income taxes.

What is most misleading about this ad is the broader message that Saunders made a choice to ""stand"" with Scott. Did Saunders vote for some bills that Scott signed into law? Yep -- but that doesn’t mean he supports Scott’s overall agenda. It’s a ridiculous idea that the Democratic minority leader is ""supporting"" Scott and ""helped"" the Republican governor in any concrete way.

It is that overall message here and the images of Saunders and Scott shaking hands -- not the nitty gritty votes in small print -- that will catch voters’ eyes. For that misleading characterization, and the criticisms we noted about the bills cited, we rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/10/tomorrows-vision-florida/group-linked-state-rep-dwight-bullard-says-state-r/

Senate rival Tommy Thompson backs ""Obamacare,"" says it can't be repealed, fellow GOP candidate Eric Hovde says
","
With days remaining before the four-way Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat, Eric Hovde released a radio ad that hits Tommy Thompson on federal health reform -- or in partisan parlance, ""Obamacare.""

The July 26, 2012 radio ad, similar to a TV ad Hovde released Aug. 6, 2012, complains that Thompson is ""slinging mud,"" distorting Hovde’s record and ""hiding some things.""

It then addresses President Barack Obama's federal health care reform law, using sound bites from Thompson and Obama to back a three-part claim:

""Thompson says he favors Obama’s health care mandate.""

""Obama thanked Thompson for supporting ‘Obamacare.’""

""Thompson says we can't repeal ‘Obamacare.’""

Candidates often use their opponents’ ""own words"" to make claims against them. So, how do the three parts of Hovde’s claim score out?

Mandate

Hovde uses the present tense to claim Thompson favors a key provision of the reform law: a mandate requiring nearly all individuals to have health insurance.

But the Thompson comment used in the ad -- and cited by Hovde campaign spokesman Sean Lansing as evidence -- was made during a University of Texas speech Thompson gave in 2007.

Asked about states requiring residents to have health insurance, Thompson said: ""I, for one, believe the mandate for health insurance is all right."" That’s the sound bite Hovde uses in his ad.

But in 2007, Obama wasn’t even in office, so Thompson couldn’t have been referring to ""Obamacare.""

Moreover, Thompson is campaigning now against the mandate and calling for the repeal Obama’s reform law in total.

(A note: We did rate as False a claim by Thompson that he never supported an individual mandate. As we noted, Thompson made the 2007 comment in favor of the concept and a similar one in 2006. But those statements don’t reflect his current position.)

Thanks

On the second part of Hovde’s claim -- that Obama thanked Thompson for supporting ""Obamacare"" -- Hovde implies that Thompson endorsed Obama’s reform law. But the picture isn’t that clear.

Lansing cited an address the president made to the nation in October 2009 as health care reform legislation was moving through Congress.

We touched on it in rating Half True an August 2011 claim by Club for Growth, a national anti-tax group, that Thompson supported ""Obamacare."" As we noted in that item, Thompson expressed both support and opposition to the health care reform legislation that eventually became law.

In his address, Obama said the U.S. Senate Finance Committee’s version of health care reform would soon be merged with reform bills produced by other congressional committees. He also said Thompson was among Republicans who ""came out in support of reform."" That’s part of the Obama sound bite Hovde uses in his ad.

But Obama didn’t thank Thompson for anything, as Hovde’s ad states, much less thank him for backing his particular reform plan. He cited Thompson’s general support for health care reform, a position Thompson has reiterated during the campaign.

Repeal

In stating that Thompson ""says we can't repeal 'Obamacare,'"" Hovde again uses the present tense.

But for evidence, Lansing cited a TV interview Thompson did in November 2010, which we also touched on in rating the Club for Growth claim. The Thompson sound bite Hovde uses is: ""When it's all said and done, you're not going to be able to repeal health care.""

The full Thompson statement was: ""When it's all said and done, you're not going to be able to repeal health care because President Obama is not going to sign it and they don't have enough votes to override a veto. So why push a cart up hill when you know it's not going to be able to get to the top?""

Like the individual mandate part of Hovde's claim, this piece is highly misleading because it relies on an outdated statement from Thompson.

Indeed, the 2010 statement was an assessment on the political realities of the time, not whether the reform law could ever be repealed. Thompson is campaigning by saying that if elected, he would be the ""51st vote"" in the Senate to do so.

Our rating

In claiming Thomson supports ""Obama’s health care mandate"" and that Thompson ""says we can't repeal ""Obamacare,"" Hovde uses outdated statements that falsely portray Thompson’s current positions.

And Hovde falsely claims that Obama thanked Thompson for supporting ""Obamacare,"" when the president was citing Thompson’s support of reform in general.

In GOP Wisconsin Senate primary, Tommy Thompson chastises rival Eric Hovde, claims he's voted ""every year""
","
When the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel disclosed that political newcomer Eric Hovde had voted in only two of 11 elections between 2004 and 2011, his opponents in the Aug. 14, 2012 Republican primary for U.S. Senate pounced.

""The first time he's going to vote for the U.S. Senate is for himself in Wisconsin,"" Tommy Thompson said of Hovde, a Wisconsin native who lived in Washington, D.C. for 24 years before returning to the state in late 2011.

Thompson declared in the July 22, 2012 article: ""I have voted every year in Wisconsin.""

Since Thompson has spent quite a bit of time in Washington himself over the past decade, including as former secretary of Health and Human Services, we wondered about his voting record.

On the campaign trail, the former governor has repeatedly said he has maintained his residence in Madison since joining President George W. Bush's Cabinet in 2001 and later going to work for a Washington legal and lobbying firm.

The Madison city clerk was not able to provide us a list of all elections that Thompson could have voted in. The office instead referred us to a list of elections kept by the Dane County clerk.

Thompson’s voting

The Madison clerk did provide us with Thompson's voting record; we also checked it against the Wisconsin Government Accountabilty Board’s searchable database. Both sets of records date back to the fall 2002 primary elections and they are identical, in terms of which elections Thompson voted in.

Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir pointed out to us that the state board says its database for records from 2005 and earlier may not be complete. But board spokesman Reid Magney told us that doesn’t relate to whether a person voted at all. Rather, some earlier records simply don’t indicate whether a person who voted did so at the polls or by absentee ballot.

Here are the elections Thompson did not vote in, along with some of the contested races that were on each ballot:

2003: February primary and April general -- state Supreme Court, Dane County circuit judge, Madison mayor. The April ballot also included statewide referendum on the right to hunt and fish.

2005: February primary -- state schools superintendent; April general -- schools superintendent and Dane County circuit judge. Also on the April ballot was a statewide referendum on four-year terms for certain county offices.

2006: February spring primary -- Madison Metropolitan School Board, Dane County Board of Supervisors; April spring general -- school board, Dane County circuit judge; November fall general -- governor (Democrat incumbent Jim Doyle defeated Republican Mark Green), U.S. senator (Democrat incumbent Herb Kohl defeating Republican Robert Lorge), state attorney general and others.

2010: February spring primary -- state court of appeals judge; April general -- appeals judge, county supervisor.

2012: May recall primary -- Gov. Scott Walker was opposed by protest candidate Arthur Kohl-Riggs.

So, the records show that, since fall 2002, Thompson did not vote in 10 elections -- five primaries and five general elections in five different years.

Asked to respond, Nemoir said in an email that Thompson ""makes all efforts to vote and the results provided by the (city) clerk do not take into consideration what was actually on the ballot in terms of contested elections and seemingly fail to represent his participation in the electoral process.""

But he offered no evidence of any inaccuracies in Thompson’s voting record. And even if there is an error in the record -- say, for the 2006 general election for governor -- it’s clear that Thompson skipped a number of elections over a number of years.

Our rating

Thompson said: ""I have voted every year in Wisconsin.""

Records show that since fall 2002, he missed voting in elections in five different years.

We rate his statement False. 
Aug. 13, 2012 -- a footnote: Folks who heard Thompson's claim might have thought he meant he had voted in every election. The record shows he did not vote in every election. And to be clear, he missed voting entirely in 2003 and 2005 (there were two statewide elections both years).  ",/factchecks/2012/aug/10/tommy-thompson/gop-wisconsin-senate-primary-tommy-thompson-chasti/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Message Machine 2012', 'American Principles in Action']","
Has Barack Obama deported more people than any other president in U.S. history?
","A group known as American Principles in Action is running an ad targeting Hispanic voters in Nevada, trying to weaken their support for President Barack Obama.

""Don’t be fooled by President Obama’s words,"" the narrator says. ""He’s not committed to immigrants. He only wants our vote. With the election on the line, he offers our undocumented youth a temporary solution that cheats them of legal status. Why didn’t he keep his promise to push immigration reform? Instead, Obama has deported more people than any other president in this country's history. With friends like these, who needs enemies?""

The group behind the ad, American Principles in Action is an affiliate of the American Principles Project, a group founded by conservative scholar Robert George of Princeton University. The group’s staff member responsible for Latino issues is Alfonso Aguilar, the former chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship under President George W. Bush.

But while the group is independent of the campaign, the ad’s message helps Romney.

Nevada is a key battleground state that Obama won in 2008 and which he’s eager to win again. Latinos are a significant voting bloc there and in other swing states that Obama won in 2008, such as Colorado and New Mexico. Polls this year have shown that Latinos heavily support Obama over Mitt Romney, in part because Romney took a tough line against illegal immigration during the GOP primaries.

So Obama’s critics would like to shrink his lead among Latino voters, particularly in key states, either by bringing them over to Romney’s side or at least by making them less enthusiastic about Obama.

The ad first dismisses Obama’s proposal in June to temporarily halt deportations of young people, saying it ""cheats them of legal status."" It then says Obama ""has deported more people than any other president in this country's history.""

Given the rhetoric that sometimes criticizes Obama for being weak on illegal immigration, we wondered if that was true. We found it was, for the most part.

According to current figures from Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- the federal agency responsible for deportations -- Obama has removed 1.4 million people during his 42 months in office so far. Technically, that's fewer than under George W. Bush, whose cumulative total was 2 million. But Bush’s number covers eight full years, which doesn’t allow an apples-to-apples comparison.

If you instead compare the two presidents’ monthly averages, it works out to 32,886 for Obama and 20,964 for Bush, putting Obama clearly in the lead. Bill Clinton is far behind with 869,676 total and 9,059 per month. All previous occupants of the White House going back to 1892 fell well short of the level of the three most recent presidents.

We wondered whether there might have been a surge of undocumented immigrants that explained the increase, but there wasn’t. During the first two years of Obama’s tenure, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated the illegal immigrant population nationwide at 11.2 million, compared to an average during Bush’s eight-year tenure of 10.6 million. And illegal immigration actually peaked late in Bush’s second term, at which point the recession hit and the numbers declined under Obama. Such patterns do not explain the 57 percent bump in monthly deportations that we found under Obama. We should also note that if Obama doesn't win a second term, he will almost certainly finish his term trailing George W.  Bush in deportations, which would make inaccurate the claim that Obama has ""deported more people than any other president in this country's history."" Still, the ad has a point in noting a significant uptick in deportations under Obama. We asked five immigration specialists -- Columbia University historian Mae M. Ngai, University of Albany historian Carl Bon Tempo, Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian, University of California (Davis) law school dean Kevin R. Johnson and University of San Francisco law professor Bill Hing -- whether they thought the ad’s numerical claim was basically accurate, and they all agreed.

Bon Tempo cautioned that some variations in data quality make long-term comparisons somewhat dicey. Still, he added that ""it does seem that deportations are on the rise, and markedly so.""

Boosting the number of deportations in recent years are a program dating to the Bush years that targets ""fugitive"" aliens, as well as a program known as Secure Communities, under which federal immigration authorities are kept apprised of people who are fingerprinted at the state and local level. Hing, a critic of the program, says it has ""gone way too far, sweeping up many crime victims, witnesses, arrestees whose charges are later dropped, and minor offenders.""

The American Civil Liberties Union has gone even further, with legislative counsel Joanne Lin saying that Obama’s enforcement policies overall have left a ""wake of devastation in Latino communities across the nation,"" according to the Los Angeles Times.

Obama has not been shy about touting his immigration-enforcement credentials, though he’s usually careful to say he’s prioritizing resources by focusing on deporting criminals rather than law-abiding people.

For instance, during the speech in which he offered the youth non-deportation proposal, Obama said, ""In the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system, what we’ve tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places. … We focused and used discretion about whom to prosecute, focusing on criminals who endanger our communities rather than students who are earning their education. And today, deportation of criminals is up 80 percent. We've improved on that discretion carefully and thoughtfully.""

Ngai, the Columbia historian, perceives Obama’s tough enforcement policy as a tactical move.

""My interpretation is that the Obama administration decided to be tough on ‘criminal’ aliens in order to get support for legalization of undocumented immigrants with no criminal record,"" Ngai said.

Of course, Romney is widely considered to be taking a harder line on illegal immigration than Obama. According to his website’s statement on immigration policy, Romney opposes both ""amnesty"" and ""all ‘magnets’ that entice illegal immigrants to come to our country. As governor, he vetoed in-state tuition benefits for illegal immigrants and opposed driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants.""

Our ruling

Technically, the ad isn’t correct to say that Barack Obama ""has deported more people than any other president in this country's history,"" since George W. Bush cumulatively deported more over his full eight-year term -- and since Bush would remain ahead of Obama if Mitt Romney wins the presidency in November. However, we -- and the experts we interviewed -- agree that the ad is right to note a significant jump in deportations under Obama. Measured by the monthly frequency of deportation, Obama’s numbers are significantly higher than Bush’s were, even as the estimated population of illegal immigrants was falling. We rate the claim Half True.  ",/factchecks/2012/aug/10/american-principles-action/has-barack-obama-deported-more-people-any-other-pr/
"['Wisconsin', 'Eric Hovde']","
Eric Hovde says Tommy Thompson is “a big corporate lobbyist”
","
On the U.S. Senate campaign trail, one of the four Republican candidates answers to ""Governor"" but most often just plain ""Tommy.""

Just don’t call Tommy Thompson a lobbyist.

Republican rival candidate Eric Hovde and Democrats have rankled Thompson with the label ""corporate lobbyist.""

It’s a pointed reference to Thompson’s lucrative private-sector affiliation with dozens of health and other companies that have benefitted from the connections and experience Thompson gained in Washington, D.C. Some of the companies deal with industry regulators that Thompson oversaw as Secretary of Health and Human Services during the George W. Bush administration.

In January 2012,  the Journal Sentinel reported Thompson’s net worth has reached roughly $13 million, much of in the seven years since he left government and began a career as corporate consultant and advisor, executive, investor and speaker.

Thompson says the ""corporate lobbyist"" label is flat out false.

But Hovde, in a July 26, 2012 interview with Jerry Bader on WTAQ-AM in Green Bay, pressed the claim, even saying Thompson was ""lobbying during the middle of the campaign.""

Is Hovde right? Even during the campaign?

Hovde makes three points in support of his statement: Thompson’s employment at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in Washington, D.C.; a media report on Thompson contacting a North Carolina lawmaker; and a campaign-donation report that listed Thompson’s occupation as ""lobbyist.""

Washington firm

Hovde correctly calls Akin Gump a ""lobbying firm"" -- it’s considered a Washington lobbying powerhouse. But it’s also an international law firm, and Thompson, an attorney, was listed as a partner before he left in January 2012 to campaign for U.S. Senate.

Some Akin Gump partners are registered lobbyists while others, such as Thompson, are not registered to lobby, according to public databases of federal lobbyists.

Thompson points to his unregistered status as proof he’s not a lobbyist.

But does that mean Thompson doesn’t lobby federal officials? Not by itself.

Federal law requires individuals to register as lobbyists if they have more than one lobbying contact in a three-month period while representing a client. The work must make up at least 20 percent of the lobbyist’s work for a client.

Thompson, then, could limit such contacts, put his influence to work, and still fly beneath the rules.

""We have at least 3,000 unregistered lobbyists, and the number is probably far higher than that,"" said Howard Marlowe, a lobbying firm president and head of the American League of Lobbyists, who spoke in general and not specifically about Thompson.

So, Hovde proves nothing by pointing to Thompson’s employer and didn’t point to a single lobbying incident. Thompson’s defense, meanwhile, is a point in his favor but does not close the case.

Telephone call

Hovde referred us to a May 2012 Bloomberg news account -- confirmed by Thompson -- in which the former governor called the speaker of the North Carolina state House of Representatives about a state bill toughening regulations on controversial dental management companies.

Private-equity firms have invested heavily in such firms, and Thompson has consulted with several private-equity firms, leading to speculation he was lobbying against the bill -- and right in the midst of the Senate race.

But the North Carolina lawmaker, Thom Tillis, says he and Thompson never connected. Thompson told us he called not on behalf of a paying client, but a ""friend of a friend"" -- whose name he could not recall -- who wanted to know when the bill would be considered.

So, at best that part of the claim is murky.

Campaign report

Finally, there’s the matter of U.S. Sen. John Hoeven (R-North Dakota) listing Thompson as a ""lobbyist"" on a 2010 campaign report showing a $1,000 donation from Thompson. There is a document showing that in Federal Election Commission records.

Thompson’s campaign says Thompson didn’t list himself that way, suggesting that Hoeven’s campaign erroneously wrote in that occupation. Hoeven’s campaign did not get back to us.

The big picture

We could not find any media references that labeled Thompson a lobbyist.

One Thompson affiliation that drew our attention was his role as chairman of an advisory board at Constella Group, a North Carolina medical research firm.

Constella’s CEO has said Thompson was brought on to ""connect"" the company with U.S. and foreign governments and advise it on growth strategies. Constella then agreed to hire Akin Gump -- but not Thompson specifically -- as its lobbyist, the Journal Sentinel reported in 2007.

That’s getting closer to what a lobbyist does, but Thompson told us nothing he did for Constella constituted lobbying, and we found no evidence otherwise.

In Washington, the kind of work Thompson does is often described as either a ""strategic advice"" consultant or a ""rainmaker"" whose influence and connections bring work to his firm.

Bill Broydrick, a veteran lobbyist in Wisconsin and Washington, put it this way: ""A consultant’s responsibility is to give his or her client their best professional advice, and that is not lobbying. That’s telling people how they should lobby.""

Indeed, Thompson has told reporters that he does work with a lobbyist at Akin Gump who lobbies for health care clients. An Akin Gump spokesman told us: ""Gov. Thompson was a strategic adviser in Akin Gump’s health care practice, and did not engage in any activity that required him to register as a lobbyist.""

Thompson’s situation reminds us somewhat of the debate during the GOP presidential primary over Newt Gingrich’s statement that he ""never lobbied under any circumstance"" for Freddie Mac, a mortgage company giant connected to the federal government.

Gingrich acknowledged that Freddie Mac hired his consulting group but he said it was only for strategic advice and broadening contacts among conservatives, not lobbying.

In rating Gingrich’s claim Half True, PolitiFact National said he was technically correct but took pains to avoid being subject to the lobbying rules and use his influence as an adviser.

Thompson appears to have taken similar pains. He told us Akin Gump wanted him to register as a lobbyist, but he refused.

He is far less definitive when asked directly if he has ever contacted a legislator on behalf of any corporate client to urge action on a bill. He first told us he didn’t think he had, but then said couched it to say he couldn’t say for sure.

Not exactly a denial.

Our conclusion

Hovde claims Thompson was a corporate lobbyist and has even lobbied during the current campaign.

By the official definition, Hovde is off. Thompson is not a registered lobbyist and the the only significant evidence of direct contact with an elected official is the North Carolina example.

On the other hand, it’s clear that Thompson has sold his influence and connections to firms to whom it would benefit on Capitol Hill, but did so in a way -- as a consultant -- to avoid having to register.

As with the Gingrich claim, we rate this one Half True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/10/eric-hovde/eric-hovde-says-tommy-thompson-big-corporate-lobby/

GOP Senate candidate Eric Hovde didn't pay property taxes until he was sued, rival Tommy Thompson says

Tommy Thompson and Eric Hovde continue bashing each other ahead of the Aug. 14, 2012 Republican primary for a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat.

In a TV ad released Aug. 3, 2012, the former governor says Hovde is ""nothing like us."" Then he makes several attacks on the political newcomer, including this one:

""Hovde refused to pay his property taxes until he was taken to court.""

Let’s take a look.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on the matter a few weeks before the ad began airing. In 2002, the City of Madison sued a Hovde family firm and other property owners over property taxes. After a judge ruled against Hovde’s firm, the firm settled the case in 2006 by paying the city $22,500 of the $35,900 the city had sought in court.

Asked for evidence to support the claim in the TV ad, Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir provided documents related to the lawsuit.

That included a May 2002 letter from the city to Hovde’s firm that notes the basis for its action against the firm regarding one of its land parcels:

""In 1996, the Wisconsin Legislature provided for the assessment of agricultural land based on its ‘use’ rather than its ‘market’ value. The goal was to keep land in agricultural use by reducing the property tax burden.  A property tax penalty was created for converting agricultural land to another use.""

In other words, land that was being farmed would be assessed for property tax purposes based on its value as farmland, not on its value as property that could be developed. The difference, City of Madison treasurer Dave Gawenda told us, was key for farmland that borders developing areas. The property tax bill for land classified as farmland would easily be less than half of what it would be if the land were assessed based on its potential for development, he said.

The letter to Hovde’s firm went on to order the firm to pay a $431 penalty for that particular parcel, given that the parcel was ""changed from agricultural usage because the land was left fallow.""

So, for all the parcels involved in the lawsuit, Hovde’s firm had been paying lower property taxes based on the properties being classified for farming rather than some other type of usage, and the city was seeking penalties because the land wasn’t being used for farming.

In December 2004, after the case against Hovde was consolidated with similar cases, Dane County Circuit Judge Michael Nowakowski issued the ruling that led to the settlement paid by Hovde’s firm. Siding with the city, the judge said the state law was intended to give farmers tax relief in order to preserve farmland, not as a ""handout or windfall to the owners of agricultural land.""

Rather than going to trial, Hovde settled the case by paying a portion of the penalties the city sought.

Hovde’s response

When the Journal Sentinel article was published in July 2012, Hovde said he was unaware of the case until reporters told him about it, while his campaign spokesman, Sean Lansing, said Hovde ""fought city hall over a tax structure that multiple businesses thought was unfair.""

When we asked Lansing to respond to Thompson’s claim, he reiterated the point about fighting city hall. He also said Hovde hadn’t refused to pay property taxes, but paid the settlement over the penalties after losing the court ruling.

Hovde himself addressed the matter in two radio interviews.

On Aug. 7, 2012, Hovde told conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee that the city, ""even though we owned farmland, they wanted to assess the value at a fully developed property level."" He equated the dispute to a homeowner contesting the assessed value of a home.

The next day, Hovde told the morning show on WIBA-AM in Madison that ""we ended up reaching a settlement. Every tax dollar was paid. I’ve paid every tax my whole life.""

Our rating

Thompson stated: ""Hovde refused to pay his property taxes until he was taken to court.""

Hovde’s firm didn’t refuse to pay property taxes, per se. But it did refuse to pay -- until losing a ruling in court -- penalties that were assessed for having the benefit of paying lower taxes without actually farming land, as required.

"['Oregon', 'Social Security', 'Peter DeFazio']","
Does Art Robinson want to end Social Security through attrition?
","
Republican Art Robinson got a hefty boost from out-of-state GOP interests when he challenged U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., for the state’s 4th Congressional District in 2010. The two men are in a rematch this fall.

DeFazio’s campaign recently issued a press release, accusing the chemist from Cave Junction of trying to moderate what DeFazio considers extremist views on public schools, nuclear waste and Social Security.

""Despite his attempt to recast himself as Social Security’s great defender in 2012, Art Robinson has repeatedly called Social Security a ‘Ponzi Scheme’ including as recently as December 2011,"" states the DeFazio release. ""And he has said in speeches and interviews that programs like Social Security and Medicare should be ended by attrition.""

The press release accompanies an online ad that likens Robinson to Mr. Rogers, but not in a kindly, cardigan-sporting way. ""It’s a nutty day in his neighborhood,"" the voiceover sings as the camera hovers over a diorama of streets and houses.

""And here he said Social Security should be ended through attrition,"" the voiceover continues. These phrases show up on screen: ""These entitlement programs need to be ended …"" and ""... they have to be ended by attrition."" Robinson is heard speaking these words in the ad. The words ""Social Security Ended"" appear on screen later in the ad.

So what gives? Does Robinson want to end Social Security? By attrition? Is he backpedaling? Does he want to freak out frail senior citizens? We’re only sort of kidding on that last question because that’s what the DeFazio campaign is saying with its press release and ad.

Most people know Social Security as the federal program that workers and their employers pay into over the course of the employee’s work life; the person then gets monthly stipends based on age of retirement and pay. The program also pays for people with disabilities and survivors of retirees. (Both Social Security and Medicare face long-term financial challenges and lawmakers have been urged to fix problems with both programs so there will be enough money for future recipients.)

Robinson, not surprisingly, argues that DeFazio is wrong to say -- and to say only -- that he would end programs such as Social Security.  ""I have consistently called for increases in Social Security payments,"" Robinson writes in his new book, ""Common Sense in 2012.""

""I have pointed out that Social Security payments have lagged badly behind price increases. They must be increased to catch up. The federal budget must be balanced, but not by short-changing seniors for benefits they have paid for and counted on.""

He sounds very senior-friendly there. DeFazio’s people contend this is a prime example of Robinson backtracking from previous statements -- to end Social Security -- that were not as senior-friendly.

Let’s take a breath and go back to the original interview on which the web ad is based in part. Luckily we didn’t have to hunt too long because it’s posted on the ""Who is Art Robinson?"" website paid for by DeFazio. In the nearly 90-second long clip, Robinson says that we need to change the Social Security system because we’re digging ourselves into a hole:

""We should change our ways so that we don't incur any further liabilities under entitlements. In other words, these entitlement programs need to be ended, but they can’t be ended by violating the contracts of the people who have already contracted with the government, they have to be ended by attrition. You have to stop taking on new people in the entitlements and let time pass and gradually by attrition cancel them.""

Even here, you can see that Robinson cares about the contract that government has with Social Security recipients; in other words, he doesn’t want to abandon them. Workers, after all, have paid into the system. A review of previous campaign statements shows that Robinson has consistently called for increasing payments to recipients and making sure the contract with recipients is honored.

In an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, Robinson stood by the totality of his position on Social Security and said he hasn’t changed his views. He said he wrote what he did in his book because he was tired of DeFazio picking on only one part of his views -- the part most likely to alarm seniors. PolitiFact Oregon can sympathize, although the 2012 book is pretty heavy on wanting to save seniors and doesn’t mention the word attrition once.

We’re not going to rule on whether ending Social Security by attrition is feasible or flawed. We’re not going to rule on whether Robinson is trying to have it both ways, by calling for an end to the current system while increasing payments to current recipients. Those are issues for voters.

We will rule on the accuracy of DeFazio’s claim that Robinson wants to end Social Security ""by attrition."" Robinson has called for an end by attrition and continues to say we should end the current program by attrition, to be replaced by another system, whether it’s private or mixed with a public program.

But we think it’s also important to point out that Robinson has consistently called upon the government to honor its obligations to Social Security recipients.

Rob Turner says property appraiser's budget is $1 million less than when he took office
","
Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Rob Turner was cruising toward re-election with nothing remarkable to taint his 16-year tenure -- until a former human resources director filed a discrimination claim against him for sending her pornographic emails, that is.

Turner fired her, and the incident drew calls for him to resign, as well as a challenge in the Republican primary from state Sen. Ronda Storms.

Turner’s main defense in this contest is that he’s good at his job and has saved taxpayers money.

""Our budget is $1 million less today than when I took office 16 years ago,"" he wrote in answers to questions from the Tampa Bay Times.

Given the rate of inflation and the vast expansion in property development in Hillsborough since 1996, we wondered if that could possibly be true.

The office

Turner, who defeated Democrat Ron Alderman in 1996, hasn’t made many waves since taking office, which assigns values to the county’s properties so that local governments can assess how much their owners should pay in taxes each year. Despite Alderman’s reputation for alleged cronyism and visiting bars during work hours, Turner’s reputation was for reducing his workforce and keeping spending levels reasonable.

Among the changes in the office in the last 16 years are updating administrative services, purchasing technology that allows workers to perform appraisals with fewer staff, reducing the office’s vehicle fleet from 72 vehicles to 40 and a steady reduction in full-time employees from 178 in 1996 to 130 today.

The key claim here, however, is the annual budget.

Here’s how the process works: The appraiser’s office proposes a budget each year and submits it to the state Department of Revenue. The department applies a nonpolitical cost analysis to those numbers, and then usually approves a little more or a little less than what is requested, a difference that may be as negligible as a few hundred dollars. The department then tells the county tax collector how much money to disburse from ad valorem taxes. The county commission is notified, but it doesn’t get a say in the budget.

The budget numbers

The first budget Turner was responsible for was for the 1997-98 fiscal year, totalling $11.8 million. Over the years, Turner gradually reduced staff, resulting in the current workforce of 130. He says with pride that none of those positions were lost due to layoffs, and his office confirmed the staff reductions were achieved through retirements, voluntary resignations and employees changing jobs.

This budget dipped slightly the first few years, reaching a low of $8.9 million for 2000-01. The budget then increased steadily for several years, reaching a peak of $13.1 million in 2008-2009. This is for reasons ranging from computer upgrades to salary raises to the real estate boom, which disproportionately affected Florida as a whole. During this time, the number of parcels requiring appraisal in Hillsborough County went from about 380,000 in 1999 to more than 525,000, the office says.

The budget then began a steady decline, due to staff departures, a four-year wage freeze and the onset of the Great Recession, which brought a decrease in property values -- and ad valorem taxes along with it. The following fiscal year, 2009-10, the budget was $12.45 million. In 2010-11, it was $11.6 million. Last year it was $11 million.

During every year we examined, the amount of actual expenditures never exceeded the office’s approved budget.

The 2012-13 budget for Turner’s office is yet again lower, with the state approving expenditures of $10.7 million. This is the basis for Turner’s claim of his budget being $1 million less than when he took office. The difference between his first approved budget for 1997-98 and the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins in October, is $1,079,585, to be exact. This is a drop of about 9 percent since 1996.

Turner leaves out the fact that his office’s budget swelled along with the housing boom before deflating with the recent recession. But given the boom and bust in property values, the increase in the number of assessed properties, and inflation, this is not an unreasonable fluctuation, especially considering the peak in 2008-09 was only 10.5 percent higher than when he took office in 1996. Since that peak, the budget decreased $2.3 million.

The ruling

Despite the distractions, Turner is running on his record of being able to perform his duties for four consecutive terms. Among his most salient qualifications, he says, is that his office cut $1 million from the budget compared to 16 years ago.

The numbers show the office’s budget did increase steadily through Florida’s boom years, but only by a relatively small amount. Its annual spending plan is now smaller than when Turner took office in 1996 -- by $1,079,585.

Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine says task force cracking down on human trafficking is the first of its kind in Central Ohio
","
In this partisan election year, Statehouse Democrats and Republicans were able to come together on a significant piece of legislation further cracking down on human trafficking. Only about a year earlier, Ohio finally joined 44 other states with laws specifically addressing a crime akin to modern-day slavery.

Human trafficking is the act of forcing an individual into acts of labor. The type of human trafficking that has received the most attention in Ohio is sex trafficking — in most cases, men forcing girls or young women to be sex slaves. A 2010 state report from former Attorney General Richard Cordray concluded that just over 1,000 American-born children are forced to become sex slaves each year in Ohio.

That report by Cordray’s Ohio Trafficking in Persons Study Commission grabbed the attention of lawmakers, who rebuffed suggestions by the Ohio Prosecutors Association that existing laws were sufficient to address the problem.

In fact, many law enforcement groups said they were already diligently watching for and investigating human trafficking incidents. And previous attorneys general and other elected officials have studied the issue and called for tougher laws.

So it was surprising for PolitiFact Ohio to hear current Attorney General Mike DeWine recently claim that he was the first person to appoint a criminal task force to investigate human trafficking in the Columbus region, the state’s most populated area.

""This is the first task force of its kind in Central Ohio,"" DeWine boasted in an Aug. 2 news release announcing the indictment of four Chillicothe, Ohio residents in a case brought by his Central Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force.

There are already such task forces in Cleveland and Toledo that have been active for years — law enforcement collaborations with city, county, state and federal officials. In fact, Toledo recently was rated as the fourth-worst city for human trafficking in the country.

DeWine’s task force is mainly made up of Columbus police officers but also includes officials from the attorney general’s investigative unit, a suburban Columbus police department, the FBI and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Law enforcement agencies in Central Ohio have long investigated human trafficking, without officially calling themselves a task force. Because this crime often involves bringing victims across state lines and even from other countries, it often takes a more collaborative effort with federal officials to make these charges stick.

Columbus police have ""done that work for a number of years and we've had some partners, but we haven't called it a task force. It’s just been guys that wanted to get the job done and came together and did it,"" said Columbus Police Lt. Mark Lang, who is director of DeWine's trafficking task force.


Some will recall that Cordray, a Democrat, appointed a commission that studied the issue and he then strongly supported a bill to strengthen laws against human trafficking. And Republican Gov. John Kasich in March signed an executive order forming his own Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force (not to be confused with DeWine’s Central Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force).

But while Kasich’s task force is based in Central Ohio, the governor’s unit is not a criminal investigative operation. Instead, it is primarily a group that studied how deeply rooted human trafficking is in Ohio and issued a report of its findings this summer that had conclusions and figures similar to Cordray’s report two years earlier. DeWine also has a commission studying this issue, which just released a report analyzing sex trafficking in Ohio.

Given that DeWine’s task force is a law enforcement investigative unit armed with a tougher state law, we believe he is safe in claiming that his is the first such task force in Central Ohio.

But for some, it might be a matter of semantics — a commission versus a task force versus a law enforcement collaboration without a name. DeWine certainly isn’t the first public official to shed light on this problem and look for solutions, so his boast might be misinterpreted. Additional information is needed for clarification.

Broun: U.N. treaty likely to lead to international gun registry
","
U.S. Rep. Paul Broun wants you to reach for your checkbook. A Second Amendment rights group needs money to keep the United Nations from coming for your guns.

The Athens Republican made his pitch in a YouTube video posted by the National Association for Gun Rights.

""If passed by the U.N. and ratified by the U.S. Senate, the U.N. Small Arms Treaty would almost certainly force the United States to … create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation,"" Broun said during the video posted July 10.

Treaty negotiations fell apart in late July, but advocates are hopeful that a version will pass soon.

We therefore took a closer look.

PolitiFact Georgia asked Broun for more information, but his spokeswoman refused repeated requests for comment.

We soldiered on. PolitiFact Georgia interviewed gun rights experts, especially those who, like Broun, are critical of gun control. We also consulted past PolitiFact coverage of the arms treaty.

The U.N. has mulled over a treaty to regulate the global arms trade for years. Backers say it would curtail mass killings and terrorism, and keep dictators from killing their own people.

(Small arms are not the treaty’s sole focus, as Broun’s description suggests. Conventional weapons, including guns, missiles and attack helicopters, are.)

The George W. Bush administration rebuffed the effort, but the Obama administration said in 2009 that it is open to negotiations.

In 2010, PolitiFact National evaluated a claim that under the treaty, ""all U.S. citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments.""

In the unlikely event that the president and two-thirds of the Senate agreed to a treaty that bans guns and requires their confiscation, long-standing Supreme Court precedent would make it unenforceable, it said in ruling the claim False.

In May, PolitiFact Texas tested a claim that ""Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are negotiating with the United Nations about doing a treaty that will ban the use of firearms.""

It ruled Pants on Fire because an administration official recently said the U.S. will not back a treaty that infringes on the Second Amendment.

So ""full-scale gun confiscation"" in the U.S. is out of the picture. What about an international gun registry?

Gun control critics pointed us to a July 26 draft posted on the website of a pro-disarmament group.

Article 2 states that each party ""shall establish or update, as appropriate, and maintain a national control list"" that would include battle tanks, attack helicopters and guns, among other things.

""Even the most limited reading of the treaty suggests that, while it would not create an international registry of all guns, it seeks to create one of all imported guns,"" said Ted Bromund, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank.

But no treaty language establishes a worldwide registry of individuals who own guns or dealers who sell to customers in their own countries.

In fact, the draft affirms the ""sovereign right and responsibility of any State to regulate and control transfers of conventional arms that take place exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional systems.""

Prior General Assembly resolutions contain similar language.

Official U.N. statements emphasize that a treaty would regulate international import, export and transfers of conventional arms only.

""Nobody wants to control the transfer of weapons inside a country,"" said Tom Collina, the research director of the Arms Control Association.

Of course, this version of the treaty failed in U.N. negotiations. Even if it had succeeded, U.S. ratification would be unlikely, our anti-gun control experts agreed.

Still, we opted to take Broun’s statement further. He posits an alternate political reality where leaders ratify a treaty that could lead the U.S. to create a registry to track -- and ultimately confiscate -- guns.

PolitiFact Georgia asked legal experts whether one would be constitutional.

They gave differing opinions. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue.

Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, thinks registries would pass constitutional muster because they don’t ""materially interfere with the ability to keep guns for self-defense.""

Dave Kopel, a legal expert with the pro-free market Independence Institute, called registration a ""gray area, legally speaking.""  A future court could overturn Second Amendment precedent, Kopel said.   

""Like so much else in constitutional law, the answer is ‘it depends,’ "" said Brannon P. Denning, a professor at Samford University’s Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham.

How do we rule?

A draft of the U.N. treaty would require the U.S. to report information on international arms sales only -- not domestic sales.  

But ""full-scale gun confiscation"" would not be constitutional. A domestic registry may not be.  

This means that even in the unlikely event that the U.N. creates a treaty that provides for domestic registries and the U.S. Senate ratifies it, it would not ""almost certainly force"" the U.S. to create one.

Broun’s statement contains the tiniest sliver of truth. The treaty would track international gun sales. But his claim makes it sound like the U.N. will keep a registry of all gun owners across the world. That’s a bizarre distortion of the facts.

His claim is False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/10/paul-broun/broun-un-treaty-likely-lead-international-gun-regi/

Barack Obama says most Americans pay a higher tax rate than Mitt Romney
","
A new ad from President Barack Obama’s campaign continues the drumbeat that Mitt Romney is a privileged rich guy who isn't paying his fair share of taxes. 
""You work hard, stretch every penny,"" a narrator says. ""But chances are, you pay a higher tax rate than him: Mitt Romney made $20 million in 2010, but paid only 14 percent in taxes — probably less than you."" 
We wondered whether it’s accurate to say that Romney ""paid only 14 percent in taxes — probably less than you."" 
The 14 percent figure checks out. The 2010 tax return released by Romney and his wife, Ann, showed $3,009,766 in federal income tax paid on $21,661,344 in adjusted gross income -- an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent. 
But what do ordinary Americans pay? 
If you just look at income taxes, Obama is incorrect. Here are the average effective tax rates for Americans in different slices of the income spectrum, according to a study by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. These figures show that many people, particularly at the lower end of the income scale, actually have negative rates because they get back more from the government than they paid in taxes. 
Bottom fifth of earners: -12.3 percent
Second-to-bottom fifth: -4.2 percent
Middle fifth: 4.1 percent
Second-highest fifth: 8.2 percent
Highest fifth: 17.3 percent 
Because these percentages are average tax rates for broad income brackets, we don't know precisely how many Americans paid more than Romney’s 14 percent effective tax rate. Still, we can make an educated guess that perhaps 20 percent to 30 percent of taxpayers exceeded Romney’s tax rate for income taxes alone. That’s far from most, making the ad’s claim incorrect. 
However, there’s another way to calculate it: Adding in payroll taxes. Payroll taxes fund Social Security and Medicare, with half paid by the employee and half by the employer. Social Security taxes are 6.2 percent of an employee’s first $110,100 of salary, while Medicare taxes are 1.45 percent of their entire salary. Because self-employed people pay the employer’s half too, and because employees of a company are assumed to be paying the employer’s share indirectly through lower wages, tax analysts typically include both halves when calculating the employee’s tax burden. 
Counting only income taxes, as we did above, ignores a large chunk of what most people pay in federal taxes. In fact, for all but the top one-fifth of earners, the combination of employee and employer payroll taxes actually exceeds income tax payments, according to the same Tax Policy Center study. 
We should note one obstacle: We don’t know exactly how much Romney paid in payroll taxes. However, based on the amount and types of income listed on his tax return, even a generous estimate wouldn’t budge his overall tax rate much above 14 percent, so we think it's reasonable to make this kind of calculation. 
So what happens when you add payroll taxes to income taxes? Obama's ad is accurate. Here's the breakdown when you include income taxes and both sides of the payroll tax (the parts paid for by employee and employer): 
Bottom fifth of earners: 1 percent
Second-to-bottom fifth:  7.8 percent
Middle fifth: 15.5 percent
Second-highest fifth: 18.7 percent
Highest fifth: 24.3 percent 
Once again, we can’t know exactly what percentage of Americans paid a higher effective tax rate than Romney's 14 percent, but the top two ranges, plus a significant share of the middle group, most likely did. So probably more than half exceeded Romney’s rate, making the Obama ad accurate. 
Even though this method validates the Obama ad, it’s worth noting that -- contrary to the ad’s invocation of Americans who ""stretch every penny"" -- it’s actually the wealthiest half of Americans, not those with low or middle incomes, whose tax rates end up exceeding Romney’s. 
At the same time, we should also note that Romney’s 14 percent tax rate is quite a bit lower than the average tax rate for those in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of U.S. taxpayers -- those who earn roughly $2.2 million in cash income and up. Their average tax rate for income taxes alone was 23.6 percent. For income tax plus payroll tax, it was 24.7 percent. 
Our ruling 
There are two main ways to make this calculation, and they lead to opposite conclusions. While we believe that including payroll taxes in the calculation offers a more accurate picture of what the American public pays the IRS, it's also true that the Obama ad didn't specify which measurement it was using, and in fact used a figure for Romney -- 14 percent -- that was based on income taxes alone. On balance, then, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/09/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-most-americans-pay-higher-tax-ra/

Pro-Mike Weinstein group says Aaron Bean voted to give tuition breaks to illegal immigrants
","
Looking for a way to attack a fellow Republican in a hard-fought primary contest? How about a 2005 vote on illegal immigration?

Aaron Bean, a former House member, is challenging Rep. Mike Weinstein for the redrawn state Senate seat that covers residents outside of Jacksonville and all of Nassau County. The primary is Aug. 14.

A pro-Weinstein group, Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics, launched the attack with a commercial saying, ""Bean voted for in-state tuition breaks for illegal immigrants.""

""That’s right. Bean voted to give illegal immigrants in-state tuition breaks, a policy supported by liberals like Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi and opposed by conservatives like Rick Scott and Mike Weinstein,"" the ad says. ""Aaron Bean: Wrong on illegal immigration. Wrong for Jacksonville.""

An outraged Bean responded in an interview with Rich Jones of Jacksonville radio station WOKV.

""It’s disappointing when they don’t tell the truth,"" Bean said. ""Just this week, they’re making just crazy claims that Aaron Bean is in favor of illegal aliens getting reduced tuition, and nothing, Rich, could be further from the truth. Never have supported that, never will support that. But that’s the claim that the other side is making in our race, and that’s just crazy.""

Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics blasted missives to the Florida Times-Union and Miami Herald that questioned Bean’s recollection of the vote. In a written statement, Bean’s spokeswoman tried to quell the drama by saying Bean did not believe the legislation extended benefits to illegal immigrants.

""To avoid any future confusion let me be clear, Aaron Bean did not support extending any benefits to illegal immigrants,"" spokeswoman Sarah Bascom said. ""He did not then, and he does not now.""

The emphatic denials led to another commercial from Floridians for Truth and Ethics in Politics. The group, an electioneering communication organization chaired by Republican consultant Mike Hanna, accused Bean of lying about the tuition discounts for illegal immigrants and of voting two years later to give illegal aliens health insurance subsidies.

With so much back-and-forth, we wanted to dive into the Senate District 4 race and examine the claim that started it all: ""Aaron Bean voted for in-state tuition breaks for illegal immigrants.""

Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics (a mouthful) is not directly part of Weinstein’s campaign, but it has received all of its money this cycle from a fundraising group controlled by Weinstein, reported the Florida Times-Union.

The ad cites a bill from the 2005 legislative session as backup for its claim that Bean voted to give illegal immigrants in-state tuition rates. The proposal, HCB 6005, was a combination of several education-oriented bills, and Bean signed on as a cosponsor.

Among the proposal’s offerings: creating a program to offer discounted computers and Internet access for students; expanding the capacity of Florida nursing programs; and allowing community colleges to offer some baccalaureate degree programs.

One part (originating from H 119, which Bean did not co-sponsor) would have allowed for certain undocumented students to apply for in-state college tuition rates.

Those students would have had to fulfill the following requirements, according to a nonpartisan House analysis:

• Lived in Florida with a parent for at least three consecutive years immediately before receiving a diploma from a Florida high school
• Enrolled and registered in a community college or state university
• Given the institution a sworn affidavit stating he or she will apply for permanent U.S. residency
• Submitted an application for the exemption

The out-of-state tuition exemption would have been available only to the state’s top 2,000 highest performing undocumented students.

""People think that students are asking for scholarships. They don’t realize that it means the students that have lived in the state and graduated from our high schools are paying more,"" said Karen Woodall, executive director of the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy. ""It’s not a handout.""

The measure passed the House by a whopping 113-2 vote. House Republicans who voted yes that day include Sen. Marco Rubio, current Speaker Dean Cannon, Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll and U.S. Reps. David Rivera and Sandy Adams. Oh, and Aaron Bean.

The Senate did not take up the measure. Current Senate President Mike Haridopolos took a hard-line approach back then, telling the Tampa Tribune ""If you get an in-state tuition rate, it's 75 percent off. That 75 doesn't come out of thin air. It comes from hard-working Floridians and taxpayers … They have proven to be outstanding workers. They work hard and help our economy run, but there are rules. Illegal is illegal.""

In an interview with the Times-Union, Bean reportedly said he did not know the provision was part of the 100-page bill.

""The bill did a lot of things,"" Bean said, according to an Aug. 3 Times-Union story. ""If I knew there was the tuition thing in there, I would not have voted for it."" 
We can't let Bean off so easy. Yes, the final combined bill was 100 pages and spanned many education topics. But all Bean had to do was read the bill analysis, published on April 27, 2012, the day after the combined bill was filed. The analysis shows the big bill clearly incorporated the language of HB 119 and outlined the requirements for undocumented students to receive in-state tuition rates. 
Our ruling

Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics says ""Bean voted for in-state tuition breaks for illegal immigrants.""

It's true that in 2005, Bean voted for a wide-ranging House bill that would have allowed up to 2,000 undocumented students to receive in-state tuition rates. 
But only some undocumented students would have received the in-state tuition rates -- specifically, high-achieving students who lived in Florida and graduated from Florida high schools.

Whether Bean meant to vote for the bill is a different story. Sometimes legislators sneak provisions into bills at the last minute that go unnoticed. We don't see any evidence that happened here. Bean is responsible for knowing what is inside the bills that earn his votes, even if they are long.

This claim is accurate but needs a little clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/09/floridians-ethics-and-truth-politics/pro-weinstein-group-says-aaron-bean-voted-give-tui/
