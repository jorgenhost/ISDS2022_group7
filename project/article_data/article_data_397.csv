Yes, from American Evita to The Very Unofficial Hillary Clinton Coloring Book
","
Hillary Clinton has been good for the book business.
 
She's sold lots of her own books ($10.5-million in royalties from 2000-2007, according to her tax returns), and she has inspired dozens more by her friends and enemies.
 
At a forum on faith issues in Grantham, Pa., on April 13, 2008, Clinton was asked about her comments that she had felt the presence of the Holy Spirit. She replied that since she was young, she had felt the presence of God many times.
 
She added, ""You know, I am someone who has talked a lot about my life. You know more about my life than you know about nearly anybody else's, about 60 books' worth, some of which are, you know, frankly, a little bit off-base.""
 
She has mentioned the 60-book figure several times before. We wondered if she was right.
 
We don't normally rely on Wikipedia as a primary source for PolitiFact because it's open-to-all-editors approach raises questions about its accuracy, but we found it has the most complete list of Clinton books. It conveniently separates them into volumes by Clinton herself, as well as those that take an anti-Clinton and pro-Clinton approach.
 
From Clinton herself there is

It Takes a Village

and

Living History,

not to mention her senior honors thesis, ""There Is Only the Fight..."": An Analysis of the Alinsky Model."" The pro-Clinton books include

The Case for Hillary Clinton

and

Hillary's Turn: Inside Her Improbable, Victorious Senate Campaign.

 
The anti-Clinton market must be considerably more lucrative because it has four times the pro-Clinton offerings. The anti-Clinton books include

Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House,


Can She be Stopped?

and

Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House.

 
The ""mostly neutral"" books include Carl Bernstein's

A Woman in Charge

and Judith Warner's

Hillary Clinton: The Inside Story.

We also found some intriguing scholarly studies:

The Rhetorical Construction of the Female Politician in Newspapers: How National Newspapers Portrayed Katherine Harris and Hillary Clinton During Controversial Times

and

Hillary Rodham Clinton as 'Madonna': The Role of Metaphor and Oxymoron in Image Restoration.

 
We checked the count on WorldCat.org, an online catalog of books. We only counted books in English, which meant we excluded

Hillary Clinton: die machtigste Frau der Welt,

and we skipped

The Hillary Clinton Voodoo Kit: Stick It to Her, Before She Sticks It to You!

because it sounded more novelty item than literature.
 
Our WorldCat search came up with 48 books. Wikipedia's list was more complete: 69 books if you include the scholarly studies, 58 if you don't.
 
So Clinton was in the ballpark. We rate her statement True.

A 9/11 denier? Yup
","
Discussing global threats and whether it's wise to directly engage Iran in talks on matters such as its nuclear program, Sen. Hillary Clinton during the April 16 Democratic debate ruled out meeting with Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
 
As she criticized the Bush administration for failing to deter Iran from pursuing its nuclear program, Clinton said Ahmadinejad's most recent inflammatory remarks would make it impossible for her to speak with him directly.
 
""I certainly would not meet with Ahmadinejad because even again today he made light of 9/11, and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died,"" Clinton said.
 
Ahmadinejad, who has a history of provocative statements on such things, including saying the Holocaust was a fake, did indeed, question the U.S. version of the events of 9/11 on three occasions in just over a week. He said U.S. claims about being attacked were a pretext for military action against Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
""Four or five years ago a suspect event took place in New York,"" Ahmadinejad said in an April 16 speech in the holy city of Qom that was broadcast live on state television, according to Agence France Presse. ""A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed, whose names were never published. Under this pretext they (the United States) attacked Afghanistan and Iraq and since then a million people have been killed.""
 
Ahmadinejad first expressed his doubts about the attacks on April 8 at a ceremony in the holy city of Qom celebrating Iran's nuclear program, which U.S. officials worry could be used to make weapons. He questioned how aircraft could have evaded radar and intelligence and crashed into the twin towers undetected.
 
Ahmadinejad repeated his doubts the next day at a speech at a Shiite holy shrine in the city of Mashhad, according to press accounts.
 
Iran condemned the attacks soon after they occurred. The government at the time was headed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
 
Ahmadeinejad has been given to bellicose pronouncement in the past and provoked a global outcry when he described the Holocaust as a myth. During his controversial visit to the United States in September 2007, Ahmadinejad, when asked about the death penalty Iran imposed on homosexuals, denied there were homosexuals in Iran.
 
He has repeatedly called for Israel's destruction.
 
On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intention to change the international order, Agence France Presse reported.
 
""We have two missions,"" Ahmadinejad proclaimed. ""To construct Iran and change the global situation. It is impossible to reach the summits of progress without changing the corrupt and unjust order of the world.""
 
Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and intended to expand energy supplies for a growing population.
 
The statement may be startling, but it's true. Clinton accurately summarized Ahmadeinejad's recent comments about 9/11. We judge her statement to be True.

Income inequality is on the rise
","At the Democratic debate in Philadelphia, Barack Obama made a case that working families need more help because they're facing harder economic times.
 
""We're seeing greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s,"" Obama said.
 
Obama is making a broad point here, but several sources support him.
 
The U.S. Census compiles data on income distribution on a year-to-year basis. Since 1967, it's clear that the top 5 percent of all households are capturing a growing share of the nation's aggregate income.
 
From 1917 to 1998, the income share of the top 10 percent dropped and then began rising again, following a U-shaped curve, according to a historical analysis of U.S. tax returns by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez published in 2003 in the

Quarterly Journal of Economics

.
 
Piketty and Saez found that economic inequality grew further by 2005. That year, the top 1 percent of Americans — people with incomes of more than $348,000 — received their largest share of national income since 1928.
 
Critics may argue whether this change in income distribution is significant or not, or what it's underlying causes are. Earlier in this campaign, Hillary Clinton argued that

George W. Bush was to blame, a statement we found only Half-True

. But the numbers show that income inequality is at a record high since the 1920s, so we find Obama's statement to be True.

Not the same old Bush plan
","In remarks at the Associated Press annual meeting on April 14, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama took a shot at Sen. John McCain's plans for Social Security.
 
""He's promising four more years of an administration that will push for the privatization of Social Security — a plan that would gamble away people's retirement on the stock market; a plan that was already rejected by Democrats and Republicans under George Bush.""
 
The truth is, so far McCain isn't promising much of anything concrete when it comes to Social Security. While on the campaign trail, he has hammered at the need for ""straight talk"" about a system that is going broke, but he has been short on details about what he would do, except to say that with bipartisan negotiations he thinks he can fix the program's projected bankruptcy in 2041 without raising taxes.
 
McCain's campaign Web site states that McCain supports ""supplementing"" the current Social Security system with personal investment accounts — ""but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept.""
 
This approach appears to rule out a plan like the previous Bush plan, which would have diverted some Social Security payroll taxes to fund private investment accounts controlled by individual workers.
 
That's a bit of a change for McCain, who in his presidential bid in 2000 proposed an option for workers to invest at least 20 percent of their Social Security payroll taxes in private accounts.
 
In 2005, McCain stumped alongside President Bush when Bush pitched a plan to let workers born after 1950 to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts invested in stocks and bonds. In exchange, workers would have had to accept a cut in the traditional Social Security benefit.
This time around, McCain is staying fairly vague about details of his plans.
 
In a Q&A; with the

Wall Street Journal

, published on March 3, 2008, McCain was asked why he had changed his plan from one that would use some payroll taxes to create Social Security private accounts to one that talks about accounts as ""supplements"" to Social Security.
 
""Actually,"" McCain responded, ""I'm totally in favor of personal savings accounts and I think they are an important opportunity for young workers.""
 
McCain's chief economic aide, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, told the

Wall Street Journal

in March 2008 that ""McCain intends to keep Social Security solvent by reducing the growth in benefits over the coming decades to match projected growth in payroll tax revenues. Among the options are extending the retirement age to 68 and reducing cost-of-living adjustments, but the campaign hasn't made any final decisions yet.""
 
John Rother, policy director at AARP, said he, too, has spoken with Holtz-Eakin and understands McCain's plan to be ""sort of an in-between system"" compared to his earlier efforts.
 
""I think there's a lot of unresolved questions,"" Rother said. ""It's not clear how he plans to fund the 401(k) program or how everyone would take advantage of it. I am hoping Sen. McCain will have a chance to define things better going forward.""
 
There's a lot we don't know about how McCain would deal with the financial problems in Social Security, but we know enough to say that Obama's statement that McCain's plan is the same as the Bush plan isn't accurate. Obama's statement suggests that McCain would entirely supplant the Social Security system with private investment accounts, but the Republican's campaign statements so far talk about using private accounts to ""supplement"" Social Security benefits.
 
For these reasons, we rate Obama's characterization of McCain's plans to reform Social Security as False.

Obama's more right than he knows
","Illinois Sen. Barack Obama recently confronted the issue of equal rights for gays and lesbians with some history about his life.
 
""I'm the product of a mixed marriage that would have been illegal in 12 states when I was born,"" he told TheAdvocate.com.
 
Obama made the remark during a wide-ranging interview about issues affecting the gay, bisexual and transgender community with a Web site for gay and lesbian readers. Obama said his perspective about rights for same-sex couples is shaped by the broader political and historical context of his upbringing.
 
Such laws were more widepsread than Obama realizes. At the time of his birth Aug. 4, 1961, 22 states banned interracial marriages, not 12.
 
(For those counting: Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.)
 
But it was never an issue for his white American mother and black Kenyan father, who lived in Hawaii. The island state is one of only nine that never declared these marriages illegal.
 
At one time or another, laws against miscegenation were active in close to 40 states. In 1967, when the U.S. Supreme Court declared the bans unconstitutional in the landmark

Loving vs. Virginia

ruling, 16 states were still enforcing them, said Peter Wallenstein, a Virginia Tech history professor and pre-eminent scholar on the subject.
 
Wallenstein said that although his number is off, Obama's point is still striking a chord with younger supporters who ""can't imagine there was ever a time"" when mixed marriages were illegal.
 
We can't give Obama a straight-up true because his number is way off, but his larger point, that many states prohibited interracial marriage in the early 1960s, is correct.

Public financing includes spending limits
","Barack Obama is still trying to lock up the Democratic nomination, but he's consistently been beating rivals Hillary Clinton and John McCain in one critical area: fundraising.
 
Through Feb. 29, 2008, Obama raised $184-million, compared with Clinton's $129-million and McCain's $55-million, according to an analysis by the Campaign Finance Institute based on public filings.
 
Much of Obama's money has come from small donors. (See a statement we checked earlier

about Obama's small donors here

.) About 41 percent has come from individual donors giving increments of $200 or less, according to the institute's analysis. (Compare that with Clinton at 26 percent and McCain at 13 percent.)
 
Obama has touted those small donors as evidence that his candidacy is changing traditional models of campaign finance.
 
""We have created a parallel public financing system where the American people decide if they want to support a campaign they can get on the Internet and finance it,'' Obama said at a fundraiser on April 8, 2008, in Washington, D.C. ""And they will have as much access and influence over the course and direction of our campaign that has traditionally reserved for the wealthy and the powerful.""
 
His claim that he's created a ""parallel public financing system"" might be a harmless boast, except that Obama's views on public financing have been a matter of significant debate. Early in his campaign he had said he would use the public financing system in his run for president, but after he took off as a candidate and fundraiser, his statements about that have been less clear. His fundraising skill has made it likely that he could raise more money for his campaign than would be available to him through the public financing system. (We covered whether

Obama promised to get public financing or not here

.)
 
So, when Obama says he's running the equivalent of a publicly financed campaign, that's a statement worth checking.
 
First, a brief explanation of public financing: In the primary election, candidates who choose to take public financing agree to spending limits on a state-by-state basis and then receive money from the government that matches the small donations they receive.
 
In the general election, public financing gives the major party candidates about $84.1-million in public money to spend however they like. There is no required match for the candidates to raise. But once the money is spent, that's it for the candidates' campaigns.
 
It's important to remember that the above rules apply only to the presidential candidates' campaigns. The parties and outside groups are also spending money separately; and different rules apply to these groups.
 
The public financing system was established in the wake of the Watergate scandal as a means of diminishing the role of money in politics. But it appears to be breaking down: The first candidate to opt out of public financing for the primaries was John B. Connally in 1980. In 2004, George W. Bush, John Kerry and Howard Dean opted out. In fact, taking public money for primaries is now a sign of weakness: In early 2008 when John Edwards decided to take public financing, critics said it showed he couldn't compete with Clinton and Obama's fundraising.
 
The general election has been another matter, however. No general election candidate has opted out of public financing since the current system started. It remains to be seen whether the eventual Democratic candidate will opt out or not. If Obama secures the nomination, it seems likely that his army of small donors could propel him over the $84.1-million mark.
 
So does a robust network of small donors constitute a ""parallel public financing system""?
 
Only somewhat, said the election experts we asked.
 
The best way that Obama's fundraising mimics public financing is that such a significant proportion of his money comes from small donors. Most public financing strategies have a goal of encouraging small donors to become involved in the process through matching funds.
 
But the other aspect of public financing is limiting spending.
 
""I certainly don't blame him for not taking public financing, but to say it's the functional equivalent of public financing, even as an aspirational statement, you can only say that in terms of his broad donor base, not on the expenditure side,"" said Kenneth Gross, an expert on campaign finance election law who has represented both Democrats and Republicans.
 
Gary Kalman, the federal legislative director for the nonpartisan public interest group U.S. PIRG, agreed that it's not quite the same thing as public financing.
 
""It is important to acknowledge that one of the more exciting things coming out of this campaign is the increase in small donors,"" Kalman said. ""But it's not completely analogous to the public financing system. The public should still be fighting for the elimination of special interest money from the system through better public financing.""
 
The public financing laws needs a tune-up, Kalman said, by increasing the spending limits and providing extra funds (so-called ""fair fight funds"") to candidates whose opponents opt out of the system.
 
Obama's small donor network has implications beyond money, said Michael J. Malbin of the Campaign Finance Institute. These donors tend to put up yard signs, attend events and knock on doors.
 
""It's not the same thing as public financing, but I wouldn't get hung up about that,"" Malbin said. ""In a sense, calling it a 'parallel public financing system' undersells the importance of the small donor revolution.""
 
We agree that Obama's network of small donors does imitate an important goal of public financing of encouraging political participation of small donors. But Obama omits the spending limits that public financing has and exaggerates his own donor network. His group of small donors be may positive for democracy, but it does not equate to public financing system. For this reason we find his statement that he has created a ""parallel public financing system"" to be only Half True.

The bill has no such spending requirement
","A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen. Barack Obama in an attempt to portray him as someone who would be ""the most left-wing president in our nation's history.""
 
The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further ""the homosexual agenda"" to being soft on the war against terrorists.
 
Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson.
 
One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, warns that Obama sponsored legislation that commits the United States to drastically increasing foreign aid.
 
""Among his pet projects is a bill he sponsored called the Global Poverty Act, which would commit the U.S. to spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on foreign aid,"" the article on the group's Web site says. ""Over 13 years, that will amount to a whopping $845-billion increase over current foreign-aid spending! Get your checkbooks ready!""
 
The Global Poverty Act, introduced by Obama on Dec. 7, 2007 — along with Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel and Democrat Maria Cantwell — would ""require the president to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to further the United States foreign policy objective of promoting the reduction of global poverty, the elimination of extreme global poverty, and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of reducing by one-half the proportion of people worldwide, between 1990 and 2015, who live on less than $1 per day.""
 
Focus on the Family takes that statement to mean the bill would adopt all of the United Nations' Millenium Project recommendations, one of which is that high-income countries like the United States should increase their foreign aid to 0.7 percent of gross national income by 2015. (According to the Millenium Project Web page, in 2004, total aid from the industrialized countries totaled $78.6-billion — or about 0.25% of their collective GNP. The United States, the report states, donated 0.16 percent of its gross national income.)
 
Minnery said his group's interpretation of the legislation originated with an article by Cliff Kincaid for Accuracy in Media on Feb. 12, 2008. That story reached a much wider audience when Rush Limbaugh parroted Kincaid's claim on his nationally syndicated radio show.
 
But according to staff members for several of the legislators pushing the bill, Kincaid misread the legislation.
 
The act adopts only the first recommendation from the U.N. Millenium Project, the one that requires countries to develop strategies to halve by 2015 the number of people who live in extreme poverty, on less than $1 per day.
 
So the claim that the Global Poverty Act would commit the United States to spending 0.7 percent of its gross national product on foreign aid?
 
""That's just not factual,"" said Jordan Stark, press secretary for U.S. Sen. Chuck Hagel. Again, a Republican.
 
""The bill simply requires the president to develop and implement a U.S.-determined strategy to reduce global poverty and does not mandate any new spending,"" Stark said.
 
But don't just take his word for it. The Congressional Budget Office on March 28, 2008, estimated the cost of implementing the bill would be less than $1-million per year.
 
According to the CBO report, the bill would require the president to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to reduce global poverty, including ""more effective forms of development assistance, coordination of efforts with other countries and international organizations, and continuation of existing initiatives to reduce poverty and disease in developing countries."" It also would require the State Department to prepare several reports. But, ""enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or receipts.""
 
Now, maybe the president decides that in order to address extreme global poverty the United States ought to kick in more. But the president would not be tied to any dollar figure in this bill.
 
The statement — which began with Kincaid and was repeated by Focus on the Family Action — is False.

The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further ""the homosexual agenda"" to being soft on the war against terrorists.
 
Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson.
 
One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, states: ""Then there's his support for teaching schoolchildren — in 2nd grade, no less — about homosexual relationships.""
 
This is a reference to a question that was asked in a Democratic debate in New Hampshire in September 2007. During the debate, Allison King of New England Cable News talked about a controversial fairy tale about a prince who marries another prince that was taught to a second-grade class in Massachusetts. The Dutch tale, called

King and King,

is about a prince whose mother pressures him to find a princess but who ends up falling in love with and marrying a princess' brother.
 
Two parents filed a lawsuit, saying they were upset that a book with homosexual themes was taught to their 7-year-olds without alerting them first. The lawsuit was dismissed.
 
King asked if the Democratic candidates would be comfortable having the story read to their children as part of their school curriculum.
 
The question was first put to Sen. John Edwards, who responded, ""Yes, absolutely.""
 
Edwards went on to say that he wants his children to understand the discrimination that gay and lesbian couples face.
 
Asked how he felt about it, Obama responded, ""You know, I feel very similar to John. You know, the fact is my 9-year-old and my 6-year-old I think are already aware that there are same-sex couples. My wife and I have talked about it. One of the things I want to communicate to my children is not to be afraid of people who are different, because there have been times in our history where I was considered different, or Bill Richardson was considered different.
 
""And one of the things I think the next president has to do is to stop fanning people's fears. If we spend all our time feeding the American people fear and conflict and division, then they become fearful and conflicted and divided.
 
""And if we feed them hope and we feed them reason and tolerance, then they will become tolerant and reasonable and hopeful.""
 
Minnery said that means Obama supports teaching about homosexuality in elementary schools.
 
""That's obviously the agenda of that book,"" Minnery said. ""If you assent to teaching that book, you assent to that agenda. It's the same thing. They didn't say, 'I'm no longer speaking as a Democratic candidate.' ""
 
Obama's campaign did not respond to questions about the Focus on the Family Action statement. But there's nothing in Obama's stated education platform that speaks to any initiative to require or encourage teaching second-graders about homosexuality.
 
In fact, the question in the debate was whether the candidates would be comfortable if that book was taught to their child in school. Obama said he would be okay with it. Focus on the Family's statement is a stretch at best. We rate the statement Barely True.

The budget resolution isn't that clear
","With so much time between primaries, political junkies have to take their fun where they can find it. Thankfully, Sen. John McCain's campaign Web site has come up with an interactive widget — it describes it as a poll — that asks online visitors to guess how much ""the Democrats' budget resolution (would) raise America's tax bill.""
 
Never mind that most Americans have probably never heard of a ""budget resolution,"" the annual document that lawmakers draw up to use as blueprints for future spending. McCain is seeking to fortify his own credentials as a fiscal conservative while also portraying the party of his rivals as reckless spenders.
 
McCain's Web site gives visitors four choices with which to gauge Democratic profligacy: zero, $500-million, $200-billion or $500-billion. Pick any one, click the ""submit"" bar at the bottom, and a screen appears advising the responder that the correct answer is $500-billion. It also asks visitors to sign an online petition ""to support a restoring fiscal sanity"" (sic) by giving their names, e-mail addresses and zip codes.
 
McCain might be making himself out to be a voice of fiscal sanity, but even casual budget wonks will find the poll misleading.
 
First, budget resolutions don't have the force of law; the majority party uses them both to make a political statement and to set nonbinding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution will raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. The documents cannot change tax law.
 
So, what about the $500-billion figure? This also is misleading, because the fiscal 2009 budget resolutions the House and Senate adopted in March don't have line items on tax proposals. The Democrats who wrote them assume that many of President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will expire at the end of 2010 — a development that would bring more revenue into the government's coffers and perhaps help the Democrats make good on their pledge to balance the budget by 2012.
 
We asked the McCain campaign where they got the $500-billion figure and they did not respond. But it's the same amount that other Republicans have used, noting that it's the difference between revenue calculations done with the tax cuts expiring and with the tax cuts being extended. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, did five-year revenue projections that assumed all of the Bush tax cuts were allowed to expire, and those revenue estimates are close to what the budget resolutions project for the same time frame.
 
This is what Republicans use as evidence that Democrats want to eliminate all of those tax cuts. We see the logic, but other facts need to be taken into account.
 
Those same Democratic lawmakers who wrote the budget resolution also support extending at least some of the tax cuts that have helped lower- and middle-income taxpayers. In fact, during the full Senate debate on the chamber's resolution, lawmakers adopted an amendment by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., that would extend the child tax credit, marriage-penalty relief provisions and other components in the 2001 tax package.
 
Democrats say they haven't yet made final decisions on which tax cuts will stay and which will go, and they maintain those tax cuts that are extended will be offset by tax increases elsewhere or by spending cuts. In other words, the budget resolution doesn't provide enough specifics to know the net effect on taxes, up or down.
 
It's all part of the dodgy nature of budget politics, but the fact remains that budget resolutions do not contain enough specific language for anyone to calculate a particular tax increase. For McCain to claim it's $500-billion is False.

Obama not driving force
","
In a renewed attempt to cement his credentials as an agent of change who's not beholden to special interests, Sen. Barack Obama highlighted his role in the 2007 congressional ethics debate in one of three TV ads he aired in advance of Pennsylvania's April 22 Democratic primary.
 
The ad, called ""Toughest,"" first aired on March 21. It depicts Obama as the protagonist of the overhaul of lobbying and ethics rules that became law last August after Democratic leaders made it a top priority following the 2006 midterm election that returned them to power. ""He took on special interests and won, passing the toughest ethics law yet,"" an announcer intones, over still pictures of Obama interspersed with snippets of headlines and quotes from coverage of the debate from the

Chicago Tribune

and

Washington Post.

Obama has boasted about his accomplishments on ethics reform before;

we've ruled that he overstated his influence on the legislation in the past.

In addition,

we have examined his legislative record

.
 
This new ad both exaggerates the role Obama played in the debate and fails to put the new ethics law in context.
 
First, a little background. The lobbying and ethics overhaul was born in the aftermath of the Jack Abramoff political corruption scandal, which triggered calls for change in the legislative process. The new legislation was designed to give the public more information about the work of lobbyists and their political fundraising efforts while slowing down the revolving door from Capitol Hill to K Street, the heart of Washington's lobbying industry.
 
The most noteworthy provisions require more reporting about the way lobbyists bundle contributions to presidential and congressional campaigns, and double to two years the ""cooling off"" period between the time a lawmaker leaves office and when he or she may lobby members of Congress or their employees. (A similar prohibition was put in place on senior executive branch personnel, up to the vice president.) The new law also requires the disclosure of members' so-called earmarks or spending requests in legislation.
 
While it's true that Obama played an important role in the debate, credit for passing the law really goes to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who devised the procedural approach to finalizing the package and, in the process, did an end-run around holdout Republicans.
 
Reid and Pelosi informally negotiated a compromise package, then had the House call up and pass an amended version of a Senate ethics bill, which the Senate then cleared and sent to President Bush. Obama had little to do with these machinations, which, to be fair, are usually the preserve of senior party leaders and committee chairmen, who control each chamber's agenda.
 
Obama did join with Republicans who wanted stronger rules for disclosing earmarks in spending bills. He tried to set an example for his colleagues by releasing a lengthy list of funding requests he asked to be included in annual appropriations bills. In fact, Obama's advocacy is believed to have emboldened some other Democrats to vote for the Republican provision that was approved.
 
Obama also successfully collaborated with Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., on a provision that required senators to make full reimbursement for the market rate of corporate jet flights. Under old rules, senators flying on a corporate jet reimbursed their benefactors for the cost of a first-class commercial flight on the same route. In some cases, that meant paying $2,000 for a private jet flight that actually may have cost upwards of $20,000 per seat. The proposal was incorporated into a broader package of reforms.
 
Obama might take credit for staring down special interests and winning on those two issues.
 
But he failed in another effort to create an independent ethics counsel to probe allegations against senators. Under the proposal, such an investigator could not bring charges against a lawmaker but would turn over probe results to the Senate Ethics Committee for a disposition. The idea did not go over well with many veteran lawmakers and institutionalists, who bristled at the concept that an outsider would be involved in investigating a chamber that prides itself in its self-policing tradition.
 
As for Obama's claim that the 2007 statute is the ""toughest ethics law yet,"" it's a phrase he takes directly from an editorial that appeared in the

Washington Post,

though it's hard to tell if the editorial is referring to the law as historically significant or simply the best proposal to come out of Congress during that session.
 
Many experts say the jury remains out, and that it will be up to regulatory bodies such as the Federal Election Commission to decide how stringently to enforce the new rules. While the law may have been the most all-encompassing package of ethics changes since the post-Watergate reforms, it has to be viewed in the context of the seemingly never-ending pattern of scandal and reform that pervades Washington.
 
Each round of new rules begets new problems. Consider that the political action committees (PACs) that exert such influence today came into being after Congress limited contributions from individuals, unions and corporations in the 1970s.
 
This latest ethics law mimicked the intent and scope of a 1978 law – enacted after President Richard Nixon was driven from office by Watergate and after Congress was rocked by a pair of ethics scandals involving defense contractors and the South Korean government – that mandated annual financial disclosure forms. And in 1989, Congress used a revamping of the congressional pay raise process to to ban public speaking fees for House members and gradually reduce them for senators. The law also prohibited lawmakers from keeping excess campaign funds when they left office and ban members of Congress from lobbying in the legislative branch for a year after leaving office.
 
Then in the early 1990s, Republicans used public disgust over scandals involving the House bank and post office to indict the Democratic majority as the party of corruption and win a landslide in the 1994 elections. GOP leaders resisted major changes in law, however, until rank-and-file members from both parties pressed for enactment of a lobbyist registration requirement and House and Senate resolutions restricting gifts.
 
The ad cites a

Washington Post

editorial that calls the 2007 law ""the strongest ethics legislation to emerge from Congress yet."" And the editorial credits Reid as the key player, with help from Feingold and Obama.
 
Still, Obama exaggerates his role in the ethics debate, and his depiction of the 2007 lobbying and ethics overhaul omits significant historical context. We rule his claim to be Half-True.

Not at night, not one time, not ...
","
(Published April 11, 2008)
 
Bill Clinton has been stumping nonstop for his wife, touting her accomplishments and defending her.
 
But the former president at times appears to be marching to his own drummer. At a campaign stop on April 10, 2008, in Boonville, Ind., he mused on Hillary Clinton's false account of facing sniper fire on a trip to Bosnia, an incident the candidate would surely prefer to put behind her. And in defending her error, he made even more misstatements of his own.
 
As reported by NBC News' Mike Memoli, Bill Clinton said: ""A lot of the way this whole campaign has been covered has amused me. But there was a lot of fulminating because Hillary, one time late at night when she was exhausted, misstated and immediately apologized for it, what happened to her in Bosnia in 1995. Did y'all see all that? Oh, they blew it up.""
 
There are several factual errors here; let's take them one at a time.
 
First, it was not ""late at night.""
 
Hillary Clinton made the remarks that got her in trouble on March 17, 2008, before a speech on Iraq when she reminisced about her trip to Bosnia as first lady: ""I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.""
 
The speech was scheduled for 9 a.m. The campaign Web site shows that she begins the speech with, ""Good morning.""
 
She also didn't make the remark one time. She said it previously on the campaign trail in Iowa. The

Des Moines Register

reported her saying on Dec. 30, 2007, ""We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire. I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac there.""
 
She also didn't apologize ""immediately."" She said she misspoke a week later, after the video showing her landing in a calm, orderly fashion had circulated on the Internet and news stories were written about it.
 
Finally, the trip took place in 1996, not 1995.
 
We asked the Clinton campaign about Bill's comments. ""Senator Clinton appreciates her husband standing up for her, but this was her mistake and she takes responsibility for it,"" said a campaign spokesman.
 
In making her case for president, Clinton has regularly pointed to her expertise in foreign policy, noting that she visited more than 80 countries while she was first lady. It's true that she visited a lot of countries, and many of those visits were more substantive than critics want to admit. (

See our story documenting her travels here

.)
 
But we found she also embellished her accomplishments to the point of factual inaccuracy. We found her statements about

China

and

Northern Ireland to be Half-True

, her statement on

Kosovo refugees to be Barely True

, and her statement on

Bosnia to be Pants on Fire wrong.

 
Bill Clinton has implied that the media is biased and covers his wife too harshly. In Boonville, he seemed to lament that unfairness by warning, ""And some of them, when they're 60, they'll forget something when they're tired at 11 at night, too.""
 
It seems bizarre that the former president would defend his wife's misstatements with even more of his own, but that appears to be the case. We find his rewriting of campaign history to merit his very own Pants on Fire ruling.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Hillary Clinton']","
He had it wrapped up in March
","Sen. Hillary Clinton is using her husband's journey to the presidency in 1992 as an example of why her presidential race is not over.
 
In a March 24, 2008, interview with the editorial board of the

Philadelphia Daily News,

she said:
 
""I just think it's a very dynamic process, and all these people haven't voted — most importantly Pennsylvania hasn't voted, so why do people want to shut it down? My husband didn't wrap up the nomination until June . . . — elections are dynamic.""
 
Clinton is right that her husband didn't have the delegates needed for the nomination until June 1992. But her claim lacks context that makes the two races an unfair comparison.
 
After losing early contests, Bill Clinton emerged in 1992 to battle former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas and former California Gov. Jerry Brown. Clinton swept the Southern states on Super Tuesday — March 10 compared to Feb. 5 this year — then took Michigan and Illinois on March 17 for a decisive victory.
 
The late March primaries left him with 942 delegates, a commanding lead with more than twice the number of his closest opponent, Tsongas, who suspended his campaign that week.
 
Hillary Clinton is technically right that it wasn't until the June 2 primaries in Ohio, New Jersey, Alabama, California, Montana and New Mexico that Bill Clinton clinched the nomination. Before the night was out, he had surpassed the 2,145 delegates needed. But after March, there was little doubt that he would become the nominee.
 
A similar thing happened this year on the Republican side of the race. Arizona Sen. John McCain claimed front-runner status after winning Florida's primary on Jan. 29, 2008. The following week, his main rival, Mitt Romney, dropped out after Super Tuesday made McCain's lead hard to overcome.
 
That made McCain the presumed nominee, in February. But the race wasn't wrapped up until he passed the 1,191 delegate mark on March 4 with victories in Texas, Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont.
 
The other difference this election season is that states have front-loaded their primaries to have a bigger say in who becomes president. This year's first test — the Iowa caucus — was Jan. 3, 2008. In 1992, it was Feb. 10. The first primary in 1992 was Feb. 18, when New Hampshire chose Tsongas. By that date this year, voters in 22 states and the District of Columbia had already cast ballots in primary elections.
 
All of which makes it even more surprising that the 2008 Democratic race is stretching into summer.
 
Clinton is trying to argue that past primary races have been competitive for as long as this one. But more recent elections have had clear early leaders. Sen. John Kerry secured the Democratic nomination by early March 2004. In 2000, both George W. Bush and Al Gore had wrapped up their parties' nominations by mid March.
 
So while Clinton is right that her husband's nomination process stretched until June, she doesn't account for his insurmountable lead long before then and the vast difference in election schedules when she makes her comparison.
 
We rule her statement Barely True.

Absences wrecked his rating
","The left-leaning organization MoveOn.org targeted Sen. John McCain in an e-mail to supporters, listing ""10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't).""
 
The list attacks McCain on a host of issues that include his policies, personal wealth and personality.
 
The final item attacks McCain for his record on the environment.
 
""He positions himself as proenvironment, but he scored a zero — yes, zero — from the League of Conservation Voters last year,"" the e-mail states.
 
McCain says he supports the environment. His campaign Web site brags: ""Along with his commitment to clean air and water, and to conserving open space, he has been a leader on the issue of global warming with the courage to call the nation to action on an issue we can no longer afford to ignore.""
 
It's also true that the League of Conservation Voters gave McCain a score of zero on its 2007 Congressional scorecard, placing him among eight senators who got doughnuts.
 
But there is a mitigating reason McCain got a zero. Of the 15 votes the league graded, McCain was absent for every vote — yes, every vote.
 
The other bottom-ranking senators actively voted against the league's agenda. Five voted against the league's preferred position on all 15 votes, and two voted against the league's position on 14 votes.
 
To find out if McCain really is the bottom of the barrel on the environment, we called David Jenkins of Republicans for Environmental Protection, who served on the league's scorecard advisory committee. Jenkins said McCain's record on the environment is significantly better than the league's scorecard shows, and his organization endorsed McCain for president in October 2007, during the Republican primary.
 
""If someone wanted to make the case that, as a senator, you should be there for votes, well, you could make that case,"" Jenkins said. ""But to say that it says something about his environmental positions is disingenuous.""
 
(We looked at another, similar controversy over

using missed votes to rate McCain's environmental record; read that story here

.)
 
The Republicans for Environmental Protection does its own scorecard, but McCain didn't do so great on that one, getting only 36 points on a 100 point scale. (The group's rankings are a little more complicated because they also award bonus points for ""leadership positions""; it's even possible to receive a score higher than 100.)
 
Despite McCain's low ratings, Jenkins considers him one of the three most reliable Republican senators on environmental issues. (The other two Jenkins named are Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine.)
 
MoveOn's words about McCain's environmental record are literally true — because he's missed so many votes. As we noted in our previous item, his average score with the group between 2001 and 2006 was 44.3, but the e-mail gives the impression that McCain is rock-bottom on environmental issues. We rate this charge by Moveon.org to be Half True.

"['National', 'Welfare', 'Jay Carney']","
Carney says Romney favored welfare forever legislation
","
The White House has come out swinging against false charges from Mitt Romney that President Barack Obama is dropping work requirements for people who receive public assistance.

In a tough television ad, the Romney campaign claims Obama wants to dismantle welfare reform so that recipients don’t have to work or seek job training. ""They just send you your welfare check,"" the ad says.

We found the ad’s claim wrong and inflammatory, and rated it Pants On Fire.

In the meantime, White House spokesman Jay Carney called the ad ""categorically false"" and ""blatantly dishonest.""

Then he added this:

""Now, the ad is particularly outrageous as Gov. Romney himself, with 28 other Republican governors, supported policies that would have eliminated the time limits in the welfare reform law and allowed people to stay on welfare forever,"" Carney said.

The notion that 29 Republican governors ever favored legislation allowing lifetime memberships on welfare struck us as stunning, to say the least. This called for a fact-check.

First, some background

Both controversies are about Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the modern federal welfare program. TANF, as it’s called, limits how long families can receive aid, and it requires recipients to eventually go to work. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people off welfare and and into the workforce.

In July 2012, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services put out a memo saying that the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states ""of the Secretary’s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families.""
   
The memo specified several times that any states seeking waivers must show that employment will grow under their pilot programs.

But Romney’s campaign, as well as several other leading conservatives, characterized the plan as ""gutting welfare reform"" by opening the door to greatly relaxed standards for what qualifies as work.

Carney’s response

In addition to Romney’s claim being untruthful, the Obama campaign and the White House say it’s hypocritical. They point to a 2005 letter that Romney and 28 other Republican governors signed in support of legislation to extend the welfare reform law.

The governors wrote that an extension was needed so they could effectively implement TANF block grants in their states, and they emphasized the positive aspects of a bill being considered in the Senate known as the PRIDE Act. Those included a stable funding stream, support for abstinence education, child care and, mostly notably ""state flexibility.""

""The Senate bill provides states with the flexibility to manage their TANF programs effectively and serve low-income populations. Increased waiver authority, allowable work activities, availability of partial work credit and the ability to coordinate state programs are all important aspects of moving recipients from welfare to work,"" the letter states.

That sounds an awful lot like what the Obama administration has outlined in its memo about state waivers.

But Carney went a step further, claiming that Romney ""supported policies that would have eliminated the time limits in the welfare reform law and allowed people to stay on welfare forever.""

The White House pointed us to a provision of the PRIDE Act allowing waivers of ""any requirement applicable to the program."" The bill listed several exclusions from what could be waived. The list does not specifically prohibit time limits from being waived.

So the White House is basing its claim on Romney’s support for a law that did not explicitly prohibit the possibility of lifetime welfare benefits. But nothing in the bill eliminates those limits outright, and drawing that direct connection is a huge and unsubstantiated leap of logic. We reviewed news coverage of the bill as well as academic analyses of it, and found no discussion at all of time limits being waived.

Jill Kozeny, spokeswoman for Sen. Charles Grassley, told PolitiFact the bill would not have permitted time extensions. Grassley, R-Iowa, was the bill's sponsor.

Ron Haskins, a fellow with the centrist Brookings Institution who helped draft versions of the 1996 reform law as a congressional staffer, added that if a state sought any major relaxing of time limits, it would be unlikely to get approved at the federal level.

""You could ask for some waiver that would say something like, you could have 50 percent of your caseload on for 10 years or more. I don’t think any secretary would grant that, but you could ask for it,"" Haskins said.

Beyond that, Romney displayed no intention of seeking any such waiver. The same year he signed the letter, he was battling the Democratic-led legislature in Massachusetts. As governor, he sought a plan that would have roughly doubled the number of welfare recipients in Massachusetts who were required to work. His plan, according to the Boston Globe, eliminated ""exemptions for pregnant women in the third trimester, mothers with children between 1 and 2 years old, and about 5,600 people who are considered disabled under state standards but not under federal ones.""

More importantly, Romney’s plan also imposed a five-year lifetime limit for receiving benefits. At the time, Massachusetts families could only receive benefits for two years in any five-year period.

Our ruling

Carney said that Romney ""supported policies that would have eliminated the time limits in the welfare reform law and allowed people to stay on welfare forever.""

The claim stems from Romney’s support for a federal bill reauthorizing TANF, which allowed for certain waivers but did not specifically prohibit waivers of the time limit that people could stay on welfare.

But the bill itself and numerous discussions of it indicate that time limits were simply not an issue. Carney’s claim takes the absence of a mention of them and turns it inside out to accuse Romney of supporting ""welfare forever"" policies. It’s a distortion that makes something out of nothing. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/09/jay-carney/carney-says-romney-favored-welfare-forever-legisla/

Pro-Obama group blames Romney in woman's death
","
An ad from a pro-Obama super PAC suggests that Mitt Romney is responsible for a woman's death.

The TV ad  by Priorities USA Action has Joe Soptic, who has been used in Obama campaign ads, telling the story of what happened to his wife after Mitt Romney’s company, Bain Capital, closed the GST Steel plant where Soptic worked until 2001. 

On the screen are these words: ""Mitt Romney and Bain Capital made millions for themselves and then closed this steel plant.""

Soptic says ""I lost my health care.  And my family lost their health care.

And a short time after that my wife became ill.I don’t know how long she was sick.  And I think maybe she didn’t say anything because she knew we couldn’t afford the insurance.

And then one day she became ill and I took her up to the Jackson County Hospital and admitted her for pneumonia and that’s when they found the cancer. And by then, it was Stage 4. There was nothing they could do for her. And she passed away in 22 days.""

Without ever saying so directly, the ad leaves a very clear impression that Romney’s actions led to the premature death of Soptic’s wife. This is a powerful emotional attack on Romney and leads us to ask, do Romney and Bain Capital bear responsibility for Joe Soptic’s loss?

Bill Burton, a former Obama aide who is the head of Priorities USA Action, appeared on CNN to defend the ad on Aug. 8, 2012, and denied that the ad suggests that Romney is responsible for the early death of Soptic’s wife. 

""We would never make that case,"" Burton said.

But we find that preposterous. The force of the ad’s narrative is inescapable. The story begins with the plant closing and ends with a woman’s death. And there are problems with the sequence it presents.

The tale of GST Steel

This is not the first time Romney’s opponents have focused on the demise of GST Steel. Last  spring, an Obama ad said that after Romney and Bain bought the struggling firm, they loaded it with debt, took millions in profits and then shut it down. PolitiFact rated that ad Mostly True.

With Romney at the helm, Bain purchased GST Steel in 1993 for $75 million, and renamed it GS Technologies Inc.

GS Technologies announced plans to spend $98 million modernizing the Kansas City plant where Soptic worked and in 1995, issued $125 million in bonds to pay for a merger with another wire rod maker in South Carolina. Plans were put in place to take the company public, but other problems intervened.

In April 1997, the company faced its first labor strike in 40 years. The walkout stretched over 10 weeks, becoming bitter, divisive and sometimes violent. Then prices for electricity and natural gas skyrocketed. A power bill in September 1998 was more than double what it had been in 1997, a costly increase because the plant depended so heavily on electrical equipment.

Meanwhile, a flood of cheap steel imports drove down prices in the late ‘90s, the company reported. In 1998, it worked with other steel companies and United Steelworkers of America to petition the government for limits on wire rod imports.

In 2001, GS Technologies filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11.

The former GST Steel plant shut down and about 750 workers lost their jobs and their health insurance. By this point, Romney was running the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and from all indications, played no direct role in the final decision to close the Kansas City plant.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Bain had more than doubled its money on the deal, pocketing some $26 million.

Is Romney responsible?

The latest ad hammers Romney for causing long term misery in Kansas City, Mo., where GST Steel was located.

The misery of layoffs is indisputable, as are the profits Bain and Romney accumulated. It is in the nature of a free-market economy that within a single business deal, some people can walk away poor while a few others walk away wealthy.

But it is not so clear that Bain’s actions alone brought the plant down. Rising costs and cheap steel products from Asia left many American steel fabricators uncompetitive. GST Steel was far from the only firm to go belly up.

We asked Priorities USA Action if the plant would have survived under any circumstances. They told us that no one knows for sure but it didn’t help when Bain took millions out of the company.

Joe Soptic said in the ad that when the plant closed, ""my family lost their health care."" Yet Soptic’s wife had insurance for about a year or two after that through her own employer, according to CNN, a fact that Burton's group acknowledges.

Soptic said, ""A short time after that (the closing of the plant), my wife became ill."" But that's collapsing the time frame. The illness took place in 2006, some five years after Soptic lost his job, according to POLITICO.

The connection between Soptic’s job, his wife’s lack of insurance and her illness is complicated. She had no insurance because a shoulder injury caused her to leave a job that provided coverage. That was the immediate reason for her being uninsured, not the plant closure.

As for the impact of not having insurance, there is a large body of evidence that shows a strong relationship between a lack of health insurance and premature death. A 2009 report from the Institute of Medicine assessed scores of studies on this topic. Among its conclusions: Uninsured adults are more likely than insured adults to be diagnosed at an advanced stage of cancer. That might fit with the story of Soptic’s wife, but we don’t know the medical details of her case.

Surprisingly, the Romney camp itself said that the lack of health insurance might have played a role.  Spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in a Fox News interview that ""if people had been in Massachusetts, under Governor Romney’s health care plan, they would have had health care.""

Other fact-checkers have examined the ad and found little if any evidence to support the suggestion that Romney is to blame. FactCheck.org called it misleading. CNN said it was ""not accurate."" Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post FactChecker, gave it four Pinocchios saying it ""stretches the bounds of common sense and decency."" 

On a side note, the ad’s emotional message and the questions raised about its accuracy prompted the Obama campaign to distance itself from the ad. Asked if the campaign thought it was appropriate for a third-party group to tie Romney to the death of a woman, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the Obama team had ""no involvement with any ads that are done by Priorities USA.  We don’t have any knowledge of the story of the family.""

That reply struck some as implausible. The Obama campaign had featured Soptic in a previous ad and campaign officials had participated in a briefing with reporters where Soptic had talked about his wife.

Our ruling

The ad from Priorities USA Action offers one man’s story to suggest the investment practices of Romney and Bain Capital led to the early death of his wife.

We believe Romney bears responsibility for the general practices of Bain Capital and the record is clear that in Kansas City, Bain profited while many people suffered. But there is little to support the ad's innuendo that Bain is responsible for the early death of the steel worker’s wife.

The cancer came several years after he lost his job and her lack of coverage was not due solely to her husband losing his health insurance.

We don’t know if the steel mill would have survived given overseas competition. It’s possible that Bain might have extended the life of the firm. And even the makers of the ad agree that it would be wrong to say Romney is responsible for the woman’s early death. 

The ad uses innuendo for a serious allegation, but there's no proof directly linking the death to Bain. We rate the claim False.

TV ad says Bill Nelson supported cutting Medicare by $500 billion to fund new government programs
","
An attack ad by a conservative outside spending group blames Sen. Bill Nelson for cutting billions from Medicare by voting for the Affordable Care Act. The ad is getting plenty of airplay, despite PolitiFact repeatedly finding the ad’s claims untrue.  (We swear, our feelings aren’t hurt.)

So what exactly is wrong with the claim in American Commitment’s commercial this time?

In the ad, which is titled ""Facts,"" a narrator intones that ""Nelson’s health care vote imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class, cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs, and millions could lose their current coverage.""

American Commitment told PolitiFact they refused to work with us, citing previous Truth-O-Meter rulings with which they didn’t agree. Nelson’s lawyers in May asked Florida television stations to not air a commercial from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that made similar claims. The stations refused.

For this item, we’ll skip the tax increase claim (which we’ve called Pants on Fire) or the loss of coverage (which we’ve called False), but will focus on the $500 billion in cuts.

This is a standard conservative talking point after the passage of the president’s health care bill, focusing on a $500 billion reduction in projected spending that is an integral part of the federal health care law. These reductions include the amount of annual increases health care providers would receive from Medicare, administrative changes and alterations to Medicare Advantage.

The difference, PolitiFact has repeatedly ruled, is that these don’t represent cuts, but rather an attempt to curtail future Medicare spending. The program is still projected to grow, the Congressional Budget Office predicts, just at a slower rate under the so-called Obamacare guidelines.

Those savings, which the commercial says are being taken to fund ""other government programs,"" are alterations to the way health coverage is paid for. One of those ways is to increase the scope of Medicaid. Another is to expand coverage of prevention services. A third is to help cover the Medicare Part D ""doughnut hole"" for prescription drugs.

Nelson was among the 60 votes in favor of the bill on Dec. 24, 2009, providing the cloture needed to prevent the bill from being filibustered. That has drawn the ire of the bill’s opponents and conservative groups like American Commitment, which have charged all 59 Democrats and Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders all cast the ""deciding vote"" -- yet another claim we’ve ruled False, because several other senators’ votes were much more crucial.

 The ruling

American Commitment claims Bill Nelson voted to slash $500 billion from Medicare to fund other programs. Our previous rulings have shown that there is no vast well of money already allocated that is being cut, and the programs being funded are a part of government health care services, of which Medicare is the largest.

Yet again, we rate this claim as Mostly False.

Would proposed ban target only Oregon commercial gillnetters, leave Washington fishermen free to use gillnets on the Columbia?
","
Oregon Ballot Measure 81 would prohibit the use of gillnets by nontribal commercial fishermen in the Oregon side of the Columbia River. Advocates of the ban say the outdated nets kill all sorts of fish, including protected native salmon.

Opponents, however, say the measure is nothing but a power grab by sports fishermen, who want more fish bites. Brenda Wall is on the board of Salmon for All, an organization that represents gillnetters. In a guest column published in The Oregonian, she argues that the ban  would allow Washington fisheries to continue to use gillnets in the Columbia River, but not Oregon fisheries.

""This ban will only apply to Oregon commercial fishermen. Washington commercial fishermen would still be allowed to use gill nets on the Columbia River,"" she writes.  

This prompted a query from a reader to PolitiFact Oregon: ""Is it true that the measure restricts Oregon fishermen on the same river where Washington fishermen would not be restricted?"" Great question. (Readers, send us more questions!) We’d like to add another question to that: Would a ban, if approved by Oregon voters, only apply to Oregon fishermen but exempt Washington fishermen?

To explain the answers to these questions, we need to give readers a quick rundown of how fish runs work in the Columbia River.

Oregon and Washington have concurrent jurisdiction over the Columbia, which forms much of the border between the two. Nontribal commercial gillnetting is authorized in the 140-mile stretch west of Bonneville Dam to the Pacific Ocean. For the most part, the physical boundary between Oregon and Washington is sliced down the middle of the river. But as you move westward toward the mouth of the river, maps clearly show that more of the Columbia is within the Oregon state line.

However, fish don’t respect state lines, so the two states work together to manage for endangered species. Washington and Oregon together decide when to allow sports and commercial fishermen to fish on the river. Washington issues licenses and permits to its people, and Oregon issues licenses and permits to its people and the two states recognize the validity of the other’s licenses and permits in their part of the river. This is all highly regulated and tightly coordinated.

The ballot measure aims to amend Oregon Revised Statutes 508.775 to read: (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of the commercial fishing laws, it is unlawful for an individual to use a gillnet or tangle net to take salmon, steelhead or other fish in the inland waters of the state of Oregon. (new language is in italics, bold.)

So let’s say Oregon voters approve Ballot Measure 81 in November. Would the ban apply only to Oregon commercial fishermen, and not Washington commercial fishermen, in Oregon’s side of the river? No, state law applies equally to all. Would a gillnetting ban mean that Washington commercial fishermen could continue to use gillnets on the Columbia River? Yes, an Oregon ban has no authority in waters outside Oregon. Washington fishermen could continue to use gillnets on their side of the river. We could have split regulation down the river.

""This doesn’t apply to Washington,"" said Rick Hargrave, a spokesman for Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. ""Washington commercial gillnetters can continue to do their thing in Washington waters.""  

Guy Norman, regional director for Washington’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, says the goal always is concurrent regulation. ""However, if we are unable to attain concurrent regulation, for one reason or another, then each state reserves the right to set regulations within their respective boundaries,"" he said.

Certainly this ballot measure would upend the idea of reciprocity between the states. How that plays out, nobody knows yet.

For example, will Washington state allow Oregon fishermen to use gillnets in Washington water? Will Washington follow Oregon in prohibiting gillnets? Those are policy questions for Washington to address. Likewise, we don’t know the logistics of how enforcement might be carried out.

PolitiFact Oregon can’t rule on how Washington might respond should the measure be approved, because those decisions haven’t been made. But we can rule on what the measure says it will do, and there’s no real argument from the two campaign sides: Ballot Measure 81 prohibits the use of gillnets in the inland waters of the state of Oregon.

The point made by Brenda Wall is that the measure does nothing to prevent Washington commercial fishermen from using gillnets on their side of the river. The ""Stop Gillnets Now"" campaign objects to the assessment because Wall gives the impression that Washington fishermen can continue to use gillnets throughout the Columbia, when they wouldn’t. They would be limited to their side of the river.

It is not accurate to say that the Oregon ban would apply only to Oregon commercial fishermen. It is accurate to say that Washington commercial fishermen can continue to use gillnets in the Columbia -- so long as they stick to their side of the river.

One part of the statement is true and the other part is not true. We split the statement -- like the Columbia River -- down the middle and rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/09/salmon-all/would-proposed-ban-target-only-oregon-commercial-g/

Heather Fiorentino said Kurt Browning ""allowed 1,800 illegal voters to register in Florida""
","
In the run up to Tuesday's primary election, Pasco schools superintendent Heather Fiorentino sent out a campaign mailer aiming to distinguish herself from challenger Kurt Browning. 
Fiorentino, who has trailed Browning in campaign contributions and endorsements, for the second time attacked the former two-time Florida secretary of state as a ""double dipper"" and a former Democrat. She also rolled out a new contention, that Browning ""allowed 1,800 illegal voters to register in Florida"" during his tenure. 
Browning scoffed at the claim, which includes a number of alleged noncitizen voters we'd never seen before. We set out in search of her facts. 
• • • 
In early 2011, while Browning was secretary of state, the Division of Elections learned the Department of Motor Vehicles maintained a database that categorized driver's license holders as citizens and noncitizens, spokesman Chris Cate said. (Cate worked at the time for Browning; he and his wife have since donated $50 to Browning's campaign.) 
After a discussion with Gov. Rick Scott, Browning decided to take a closer look at just how many noncitizens might be registered to vote. Officials took the driver's license database and compared it to the state voter registration list. 
The first pass-through generated 180,000 names of potential noncitizen voters, a number that was widely reported by the news media. But Browning was skeptical of that figure: The data was crunched by DMV, not his own department. And he suspected it included some people who obtained their citizenship and registered to vote after they got their last driver's license. The driver's license database might not reflect their current citizenship status. 
A later effort whittled the list down to 2,600 names, including about 1,400 verified matches from the first list and 1,200 people who get annual driver's licenses because they are on work or student visas. That list went to county elections supervisors to review. 
Those supervisors did their due diligence, giving the voters in question an opportunity to respond. Some voters quickly returned documents verifying their citizenship. 
Pasco County Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley said of the 13 names he received, ""more than half were actually U.S. citizens."" One woman was improperly flagged when her records were mistaken for someone else's, Corley said. 
After finding flaws in its methodology, the Department of State told supervisors of elections to stop using the list of 2,600 names. 
""We consider that number obsolete now,"" Cate said. The state is working out an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to better identify noncitizens and compare that list to the voter rolls. 
As for Fiorentino's flier: ""I don't know where they would come up with a number of 1,800,"" Cate said. 
Fiorentino acknowledged her flier contained a typo: She meant to use the original 180,000 figure. 
""I was kinder than it should have been,"" she said. 
• • • 
The question then turns to whether Browning ""allowed"" all — or any — of those voters to register. 
The secretary of state is Florida's chief election officer. His responsibilities include creating and administering a statewide voter registration system. ""The secretary may delegate voter registration duties and records maintenance activities to voter registration officials,"" Florida statute states. 
Those officials include county supervisors of elections, whose powers include accepting voter registration applications and updating the statewide voter registration system. 
""It is the supervisor who is activating the voters,"" Cate explained. 
From that perspective, Browning did not have a hand in the registration. 
He also was secretary of state from 2006-10, and again from 2011-12. The voter list under review included registrations from years outside his terms. 
• • • 
Fiorentino said she was aware the 180,000 number represented ""all the people"" initially tagged. She argued that Browning allowed illegal voters to remain on the rolls even after several elections supervisors, including Corley, raised red flags in 2011. 
""He did nothing,"" she said. ""I call that allowing."" 
Browning emphasized that supervisors of election are responsible for voter registration. ""I didn't register those voters,"" he said. He added that he had no firm number of illegal voters but that he tried as secretary of state to identify them so local elections officials could address them. ""She doesn't understand how the law works,"" Browning said. 
Our ruling 
Fiorentino accused Browning of ""allowing 1,800 illegal voters to register in Florida."" 
Her number is wrong. The state's initial list of 180,000 names never identified voters as illegal, but rather created a starting point for further verification. The state later stopped using the list, deeming the data unreliable. 
The secretary of state does not register voters in Florida, nor does he have the authority to remove them from the rolls. That's the job of county elections supervisors. And Browning was not secretary of state during the entire time the people on that list registered to vote. 
Fiorentino played fast and loose with her claim in an effort to discredit her opponent on election eve.

Upendra Chivukula claims Leonard Lance was “not for guns” in 2008
","
U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance was elected to Congress, then took a hard right turn on his position on gun control, according to Upendra Chivukula, a Democratic state Assemblyman who hopes to unseat Lance in November. 
""One of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns,"" Chivukula said in an Aug. 5 interview with the liberal blog Blue Jersey. ""Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks, which is mostly dangerous for the people who are visiting the national park.""

Lance, a former state senator, has faced criticism for shedding more moderate views since he was sworn in to the House of Representatives in 2009. So here, PolitiFact New Jersey wondered if Lance (R-7th Dist.) was ""not for guns"" in 2008 but then said, ""you can carry concealed weapons in national parks.""

The congressman’s position on the latter half of that claim is clear: he supports it. In May 2009, Lance voted to repeal the ban on visitors possessing firearms on federal public land, as long as gun owners comply with the laws of the state where the park is located.

Lance touts that vote on his campaign website in a section on Second Amendment rights.

But was Lance ""not for guns"" just a year prior to that vote, in 2008? That’s a broad, unsupported claim that suggests Lance opposed firearms and then reversed his position.

We found no evidence that Lance advocated against guns.

Joey Novick, Chivukula’s campaign manager, pointed us to a survey from Project Vote Smart, a nonpartisan group that tracks where candidates stand on key issues, to support Chivukula’s claim.

In 2007 -- as Lance was vying for another term in the New Jersey Senate -- he filled out the survey, which asks candidates to note which positions they would support in a number of areas if elected.

In a section labeled ""gun issues,"" Lance indicated he would ""maintain and strengthen the enforcement of existing state restrictions on the purchase and possession of guns."" He also noted his support to ""require a license for gun possession.""

But that doesn’t prove Lance was ""not for guns,"" only that he supported enforcing New Jersey’s current laws.  

Todd Mitchell, Lance’s chief of staff, said that Lance has always been a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, pointing to a number of ""pro-gun"" votes during his time as a state legislator. Also, Mitchell noted that in 2007 the state chapter of the NRA endorsed Lance’s re-election bid.

""This is a feeble attempt by the Chivukula campaign to distract voters from Upendra's dismal fiscal record as a member of the Democratic leadership in Trenton,"" Mitchell said.

Novick said Chivukula’s overall point was that in ""many issues––including guns and Second Amendment issues, Leonard Lance has moved to extreme positions that are more right wing.""

Our ruling

Chivukula said ""one of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns. Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks.""

There’s an element of truth to this claim: Lance voted to repeal a ban on carrying weapons in national parks in 2009, as long as the gun owner complies with the laws of the state where the park is located.

But to suggest Lance flip-flopped in taking that position is misleading.

The survey Chivukula’s campaign cited shows Lance, as a state legislator, favored enforcing New Jersey’s current laws. To say Lance was ""not for guns"" is wrong.

We rate this statement Mostly False.

Opponents of Ohio redistricting issue say politicians could still be included in proposed redistricting process
","
People, not politicians.

That’s the campaign slogan of Voters First Ohio, the union-backed group behind the Nov. 6 ballot measure to establish a new ""citizens commission"" to draw Ohio’s congressional and legislative districts – a task, under current law, assigned to elected officials.

The current system is rigged, according to Voters First, because politicians in charge of drawing the lines are motivated only by political gain.

The results are gerrymandered districts designed to corral voters who support the party that controls the redistricting process. Last year, for example, majority Republicans established boundaries that favored them, giving them an edge come election-time.

But opponents of the ballot measure say the proposed solution – and Voters First’s campaign message – is misleading because it doesn’t really remove politicians from the process.

""The proponents are not being straightforward when they promote their scheme,"" a spokesman for the opposition group Protect Your Vote Ohio said in an Aug. 1 press release. ""Thousands of politicians from across Ohio – along with their relatives, employees and friends – are still eligible to serve.""

This statement raised PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity. Would the new system remove politicians from the redistricting process?

First, we looked at a summary of the proposed constitutional amendment that was filed with the Ohio attorney general’s office. The summary, which Attorney General Mike DeWine ruled is an accurate reflection of the amendment, describes the new commission that would oversee the map-drawing process.

The 12-member commission would be responsible for approving new maps that outline Ohio’s legislative and congressional districts.

The commission would adopt a plan based on four criteria – keeping communities whole, achieving competitiveness, maintaining compactness and having districts with leanings reflecting how Ohioans actually have voted.

Before we delve into the commission’s makeup and whether politicians are allowed, let’s summarize the current redistricting process.

State lawmakers have the job of drawing the boundaries for Ohio’s 16 congressional districts. When one party controls both the House and the Senate – as the GOP does now – the minority party has little to no say in how the lines are drawn.

Last year, taking cues from a top aide to U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, GOP lawmakers approved a map that favors Republican candidates in 12 of the 16 districts.

The state apportionment board approves the map of Ohio’s legislative districts. The board is composed of the governor, state auditor, secretary of state and two lawmakers from opposite parties. Republicans also controlled this board last year because they occupied all the statewide offices on the board.

There is no question politicians control the current redistricting process. But what about the new, proposed process?

It turns out politicians can serve on that commission too – powerful ones, even.

The proposed amendment includes a long list of people ineligible to serve on the commission, including state and federal elected officials, their family members, well-heeled campaign donors, lobbyists, political consultants and others.

But local elected officials and their family members could still serve on the commission. That means the Cuyahoga County executive, Cleveland’s mayor or any other local politician would be eligible for the citizens commission created by the Voters First proposal.

However, the commission wouldn’t be dominated by one party. The amendment calls for the panel to be split equally among Democrats, Republicans and independents or third-party members.

Voters First chairwoman Catherine Turcer acknowledged that local elected officials could serve on the commission. A local elected official, however, could be barred from the commission based on other exclusions, such as being a political party official.

""It seemed too broad to eliminate every mayor,"" Turcer said. ""It seemed unfair to say none of the local folks could somehow participate.""

Turcer later said in an email: ""Voters First has repeatedly stated that we are talking about politicians who rig the system to protect themselves and their political cronies. Local elected officials do not draw their own district lines and are not rigging the system. State and federal elected officials or politicians face an inherent conflict of interest when it comes to crafting their own district lines. It makes sense to remove them.""

However, the potential inclusion of local politicians makes the Voters First campaign slogan, ""People, not politicians,"" ring a little hollow. 
Protect Your Vote Ohio was correct when it said thousands of politicians would be eligible to serve. Ohio  has 88 counties, 1,308 townships, 247 cities and 691 villages, according to census data on the website of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. The state also has hundreds of school  boards. Each of these municipalities and boards can have several elected officials each.

Still, the amendment would remove the state and federal politicians who up to this point have controlled the process and reaped the benefits. That’s an important point of clarification.

"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Social Security', 'Allen West']","
West says more people went on Social Security Disability Insurance in June than jobs created
","U.S. Rep. Allen West, a Florida Republican, was in Rhode Island last weekend on a fundraising trip.

During a radio interview Aug. 1 on WHJJ’s ""The Helen Glover Show,"" Glover turned the conversation toward a topic West has talked about often in recent months: the correlation between the number of people exhausting their unemployment benefits and new recipients of Social Security Disability benefits.

""It’s unconscionable to think that in the month of June, the federal government [reported] 80,000 new jobs created but the little fact that no one is talking about is that we have 85,000 people go on Social Security Disability the same month.""

Said West: ""So we actually had more people go on Social Security Disability -- which is different from Social Security -- than the 80,000 jobs that were created.""

""What we are doing is just making more people economically dependent on government,"" said West, ""instead of having the right economic policies to make people economically free.""

West, a first-term congressman, is known for making provocative remarks. In April 2012 he garnered headlines when he said ""about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party"" were communists -- a reference, he said, to the liberal-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus, which the Communist Party has publicly referred to as its ally.

PolitiFact Florida gave that statement a Pants on Fire rating, saying West was using a guilt-by-association rationale and had failed to prove that any member of Congress was a communist.

We wondered whether he was on more solid ground in his claim about Social Security Disability. We asked his office for his backup, but they never responded. Then we began our own research.

We discovered that West got his numbers right. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 80,000 new jobs were created in June. And the Social Security Administration reported that 84,766 people were new beneficiaries of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) that same month.

(Since January, employment growth has averaged about 151,000 new jobs a month, the labor bureau reports. Over that same period, an average of 82,560 people per month went on SSDI.)

SSDI is a federal program funded by workers’ payroll taxes, just like Social Security retirement. To be eligible, workers must qualify as physically or mentally disabled and must have also paid some of those Social Security taxes during their employment.

Stephen C. Goss, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, has said that in every recession since the 1970s, the number of people applying for Social Security Disability has increased as their unemployment benefits expire.

In a talk in April before the National Academy of Social Insurance, in Washington, D.C.,  Goss explained the trend as a ""temporary phenomenon for a cyclic economic downturn.""

""The [current] recession resulted in a lot of people becoming unemployed ... and when people become unemployed they seek a way of continuing to have income. And people who can qualify for our disabled worker benefits, of course, go ahead and apply. So we did have an increase in the number of applications.""

David H. Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  who has served on the President’s Council on Economic Advisers, said in an e-mail:  ""I do not see this as a political issue."" It is well-known that ""when economic times are bad, many more people turn to SSDI out of desperation....

""The growth of SSDI is a long-standing problem and the recession has made it worse,"" Autor said. ""The comparison between the two numbers (SSDI awards and jobs) is depressing.""

By the end of last year, more than 8.5 million Americans were receiving SSDI, roughly 1 million more than when the Great Recession began in December 2007, according to the Social Security Administration.

Included in that figure were 35,905 disabled workers in Rhode Island receiving on average $1,115 a month, not counting the smaller state supplement they also receive.

That growth is expected to continue; several studies have predicted that SSDI could run out of money by 2018.

The Obama administration referred to the program’s costs when it argued for extending unemployment benefits last fall, saying in a December 2011 report: ""workers on SSDI rarely return to the labor force, resulting in a loss to society of the economic contribution those workers could have made. Thus, keeping the long-term unemployed in the labor force should be a priority.""

Our ruling

Rep. Allen West said that the number of people who became recipients of Social Security Disability in June (85,000) was higher than the number of jobs created that month (80,000). West quoted the numbers accurately.  We rate his statement  True.

GOP candidate for US Senate Hovde claims Obamacare levies 10 years of taxes for 6 years of benefits
","
The U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the federal health care reform law didn’t slow down efforts by Republicans to block the measure -- or at least heap criticism on it while campaigning.

In a July 29, 2012 interview on WISN-TV with host Mike Gousha, U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde  joined the chorus of critics and said the law would ""help bankrupt the country."" Hovde said he disagreed with assessments from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that repeal of the bill would add to the federal deficit.

""Let's go back and show how Nancy Pelosi and President Obama said that over the next decade, ‘Obamacare’ will save us money,"" said Hovde, who is running against three other Republicans in the Aug. 14, 2012 primary. ""What they did is they factored in 10 years worth of tax revenue and only six and half years worth of expenses. ""

Those numbers sound familiar.

Indeed, the ""10 years and six"" claim has been a common refrain by Republicans and has been looked at a number of times by our PolitiFact partners.

When we asked Hovde’s campaign for backup, they referred us to several articles that make the same point about the health care law:

""Congressional Democrats delayed these provisions in order to show only six years of spending under the plan in the original 10-year budget window (from FY2010-19) used by CBO at the time the law was enacted,"" said a July 11, 2012 statement from Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee, as reported in the conservative Weekly Standard.

Basically, the supporting evidence simply re-states the claim. So we took our own look.

The health care law took effect in 2010, and taxes began then to support the measure. Key  parts of the bill don’t kick in until 2014.

In an item about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, PolitiFact National noted that the 10-year aspect of the claim was correct.

The item read, in part:: ""The CBO said this about the health care law back in 2010: It lowers the deficit, by about $124 billion over 10 years. And in 2011, when Republicans offered a bill to repeal the health care law, the CBO said that increased the deficit, by about $210 billion over 10 years.""

That estimate was updated in July 2012, when the CBO said the law would cost $84 billion less than it had previously predicted.

On Jan. 6, 2011, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virg., made virtually the same claim as Hovde, saying the law ""offset 6 years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases"" and it was Half True.

PolitiFact Virginia noted: ""Cantor’s argument that the ‘benefits’ don’t kick in until 2014 is true if you’re looking at the biggest provisions of the law. But many other, smaller provisions to boost coverage have already taken effect."" Those include small business tax credits, coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, assistance for early retirees and coverage for dependents until they’re age 26. Also, not all of the taxes kicked in immediately.

On March 1, 2011, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said the law has ""six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue."" PolitiFact Virginia also rated Cuccinelli’s claim Half True.

""The bill is is a bit front-loaded. About 10 percent of the taxes for health care reform will be levied in the first four years to pay for an estimated 1 percent of cost,"" it wrote. ""But Cuccinelli is flat wrong to say health care reform offers no benefits before 2014.""

So, yes, the taxing began in 2010, and key parts of it don’t kick in until 2014. But, like so many claims, it’s not as simple as that. Some benefits already kicked in, and some of the taxes don’t take effect until later.

Our rating

Hovde repeats a claim that’s been a routine part of the GOP attack on Obamacare: that there are 10 years of taxes charged for six years of benefits. It’s true that the tax money began to come in starting in 2010. But it’s false that the benefits don’t kick in until 2014. There are numerous parts of the bill that have already taken effect.

Hovde joins the crowd who have made the same claim. It’s Half True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/08/eric-hovde/gop-candidate-us-senate-hovde-claims-obamacare-lev/

Mitt Romney says 90 percent of cities saw unemployment rise in June
","
In an ad titled ""It's Just Not Getting Better,"" Mitt Romney takes aim at President Barack Obama’s handling of the economy.

""In June, jobless ranks were higher in nearly 90 percent of U.S. cities,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""In July, unemployment went up again. And the president is running out of time. Under Obama’s economy, it’s just not getting better. Mitt Romney has a plan for a stronger middle class. Under the Romney plan, more jobs and more take-home pay. It’s a plan that works for America.""

We wondered whether it was really true that ""in June, jobless ranks were higher in nearly 90 percent of U.S. cities.""

The article the ad relied on

We found the article the ad cited as its source, an Aug. 1, 2012, Associated Press report. We immediately noticed that the ad had ignored some caution signs that were clearly presented in the story. Here’s what AP wrote:

""Unemployment rates rose in nearly 90 percent of large U.S. cities in June, partly because many young people graduated from school with no firm job prospects.

""Many of the cities with significant increases in their rates have large universities, where students have begun searching for jobs in recent months. Unlike the national figures, the metro unemployment data isn't seasonally adjusted for such changes.

""The Labor Department says unemployment rates rose in 332 large metro areas. They fell in 29 and were unchanged in 11. That's worse than in May, when rates rose in 255 cities.""

The article confirms that the number used in the ad is correct, and the numbers were worse when compared to the change between April and May. However, it’s also clear that by using that number on its own, the ad is ignoring some crucial context.

Between May and June, many high school and college students graduate, inflating the June unemployment numbers. A statistical process called seasonal adjustment corrects for such fluctuations, but as the article stated, the numbers quoted are not seasonally adjusted.

As the Romney campaign noted when we asked for comment, post-college unemployment is a significant issue in today’s recession. But there’s a difference between acknowledging the harm of unusually high levels of post-graduation unemployment and letting a sudden influx of new job-seekers in June skew the numbers.

Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, told PolitiFact that the unadjusted unemployment rate has jumped from May to June in every single year over the last three decades. But once you seasonally adjust the numbers, many of those increases disappear entirely.

So, if you rely only on non-seasonally adjusted figures, then you have to believe that the labor market ""has deteriorated in every single June that a Republican has occupied the White House, too"" Burtless said.

(PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

What would the seasonally adjusted numbers look like?

So is there a better way to look at the data? We asked Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, to walk us through some alternative calculations.

First, we did the same calculation as the AP reported on, with one change: We used seasonally adjusted numbers. We found that just under 45 percent of the nearly 400 metro areas had a higher unemployment rate in June than they did in May. That’s half the 90 percent rate cited in Romney’s ad.

Next, we asked her to do the same calculation, but limit it to just the 50 biggest cities, to eliminate from the list such small locales as Lewiston, Idaho; Palm Coast, Fla.; Danville, Ill.; Elmira, N.Y.; Kokomo, Ind.; and Longview, Wash. This time, the percentage of metro areas with rising unemployment fell to about 35 percent, or just over one-third the percentage cited in the ad.

We also ran the numbers a different way, using a longer time period that diminishes the high volatility inherent in month-to-month comparisons. (While the AP story was clear about the time frame, the ad is not, and viewers wouldn’t know about the timing details without reading the story.)

If you compare the figures for June 2011 to June 2012, just 7 percent to 8 percent of metro areas saw an increase in unemployment over the previous year -- almost the exact opposite conclusion as the one cited in Romney’s ad.

Our rating

The ad claims that ""in June, jobless ranks were higher in nearly 90 percent of U.S. cities."" The Romney campaign has many grim employment statistics it can legitimately cite in an ad such as this, but using this particular statistic is misleading.

The data the campaign relied on was not seasonally adjusted, so unemployment levels were exaggerated by the sudden graduation of high school and college students -- a caveat that was specifically noted high up in the story that the ad cited as its source.

As it turns out, even the highest seasonally adjusted calculation we made is just half the size of the 90 percent cited in the ad. And excluding volatile month-to-month figures by looking at a full year-long comparison actually leads to the exact opposite conclusion from the one drawn in the ad: Better than 90 percent of metro areas saw unemployment drop, not rise, over the previous year.

Barack Obama says Mitt Romney opposes contraception mandate and would cut Planned Parenthood funding
","Barack Obama's campaign must see an opportunity to peel support among women voters away from Mitt Romney because it is running its second ad in two weeks attacking Romney for his stand on reproductive issues. The latest television commercial features two women, Dawn and Alex, talking about Romney. Dawn: ""I think Mitt Romney’s really out of touch on women’s health issues.""

Alex: ""This is not the 1950s. Contraception is so important. It’s about a woman being able to make decisions."" (As she speaks, a picture of Romney appears beside the words ""Opposes requiring employers to cover contraception."")

Dawn: ""I don’t remember anyone as extreme as Romney.""

Romney event video: ""I’ll cut off funding for Planned Parenthood.""

Alex: ""I don’t think Mitt Romney can understand the mindset of someone who has to go to Planned Parenthood.""

Romney interview video: ""Planned Parenthood. We’re going to get rid of that.""

Dawn: ""I think Mitt Romney would definitely drag us back.""

The ad is airing in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. Given that PolitiFact recently found the Obama campaign exaggerated other claims about Romney on abortion, we thought it would be worthwhile to check the claim that Romney opposes requiring employers to cover contraception and would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.

The contraceptive mandate

Romney’s stance on contraceptive coverage became clear during the Republican primaries. Early this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision of the health care law that requires all employers except religious ones to provide birth-control services without any out-of-pocket costs.

In the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their ""beliefs or moral convictions."" At the time, the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like.

A few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a Boston radio interviewer ""Of course I support the Blunt amendment."" CNSNews.com, a conservative news service, seeking clarity, wrote about putting the question directly to the Romney campaign.

""Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety — as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do — so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a ‘moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization’ will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?""

Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: ""Yes--Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety.""

In April, Romney reiterated his opposition to the current rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, ""As president, I will abolish it.""

We conclude from those comments that Romney would not just abolish the requirements for religious organizations, but for any employer that had a moral or religious objection.

When the new Obama ad first ran, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul called it a ""false ad,"" but her statement did not provide specifics and the Romney campaign did not respond to our inquiries.

Planned Parenthood

Planned Parenthood, a national network of clinics that provide a range of health services including abortion, has been in the crosshairs of social conservatives for a long time. The federal government pays Planned Parenthood about $75 million a year to offer cancer screenings, breast exams and other care to lower income women. That money cannot be spent on abortion services.

But conservatives argue that the federal dollars free up money which the organization uses to underwrite the cost of doing abortions. Mitt Romney has linked that concern to his effort to reduce the deficit.  

Asked by a Missouri interviewer what he would cut, Romney gave some examples. ""Of course you get rid of Obamacare,"" Romney said. ""That’s the easy one. But there are others. Planned Parenthood. We’re going to get rid of that. The subsidy for Amtrak. We would eliminate that.""

We should note that the latest Obama ad edits Romney’s words down to ""Planned Parenthood.  We’re going to get rid of that."" This might give the impression that Romney plans to do away with Planned Parenthood, an interpretation that forced the Romney campaign to clarify what he meant when he first made the statement in mid-March. Campaign officials said he would eliminate the federal payments to Planned Parenthood but would not be getting rid of the organization. Planned Parenthood is a private entity with a total budget of about $1.1 billion, an amount much larger than the direct federal payment.

Romney has repeated his plan to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood many times. He said it in a letter to voters that was published in Life News, a self-described pro-life news service. On his website, he goes further and says he will eliminate all family planning funds under the Public Health Service Act. That program, Title X, costs about $300 million and was created in 1970 under the Nixon administration.

Our Ruling

The Obama campaign ad said that Mitt Romney opposes requiring employers to cover contraception and would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.

Romney has said he would abolish the contraceptive coverage requirement and he has said repeatedly that he would eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

In GOP Wisconsin Senate primary, Mark Neumann says that in 4 years in House, he never voted to raise taxes
","
Wisconsin Republican Mark Neumann has repeatedly cast himself as more conservative than his three opponents in the Aug. 14, 2012 U.S. Senate primary -- and he often cites his record on taxes as evidence.

On the tax reform page of his campaign website, Neumann declares he is ""the only candidate who has never supported a tax increase.""

On another page, he says that during his two terms in the House of Representatives in the 1990s, he ""repeatedly voted for lower taxes — never raising taxes.""

And a host of anti-tax groups have given him awards.

But congressmen cast many votes.

When it comes to Neumann’s claim that he never voted to raise taxes during his four years in Congress, at least two bills he voted for -- the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act -- raise questions.

As the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office notes, the two were companion measures that President Bill Clinton signed into law on Aug. 5, 1997. Together they cut taxes by $370 billion, mostly through tax credits for families with children, and raised other taxes, primarily on cigarettes and air travel, by $130 billion.

That’s a net tax reduction of $240 billion -- which the budget office pointed out was the first major reduction in federal taxes since the early 1980s.  

But, obviously, $130 billion in tax increases isn’t small change, either.

In response, Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander said:

""Neumann has always, always, always said he is fine making changes to our tax structure as long as the overall impact is the same or lower taxes.""

But that’s not the statement we’re testing. The claim was an absolute.

Our rating

Neumann said he never voted for a tax increase.

But looking at just two of the major bills he supported, although they contained $370 billion in tax decreases, they also contained $130 billion in tax increases.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich says the drought has left 90 percent of the state’s topsoil too dry for crops
","Ohio Gov. John Kasich may not know much about planting crops, but he knows how to pick an audience. When the GOP governor was looking for a place on July 25 to announce the state's plans to ask the federal government to declare a drought emergency in Ohio, he headed for the Ohio State Fair.

Before a farming crowd at the fairgrounds in Columbus, Kasich portrayed the drought's impact in fairly stark terms, calling it ""devastating"" to Ohio's number one industry. After mentioning that a majority of Ohio's crops are rated either poor or very poor, Kasich asserted that nearly all of the topsoil in Ohio was in terrible shape. ""Ninety percent of the topsoil has inadequate moisture to grow crops,"" Kasich said.

While the drought had brought declarations of emergency  to more than two dozen states across the country, was the soil in the Buckeye State really in that poor of shape? Or was the governor exaggerating the problem? We slipped on a pair of overalls down at PolitiFact Ohio headquarters and started digging.

Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said the governor's July 25 statement was based on a weekly crop weather report produced by the National Agricultural Statistics Service, which is a branch of the United States Department of Agriculture. The crop weather report for July 23 rated the topsoil moisture in four categories, from short to surplus. The report said that topsoil moisture was rated at 53 percent very short, 37 percent short, 10 percent adequate and zero percent surplus.

The report notes that ""there has been more rain this week, some areas throughout the state report 1-2 days of rain; however topsoil moisture is still far below normal conditions.""

Trying to find out more about how the reports are produced, we reached Richard Snead, an agricultural statistician with the Ohio Field Office for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Snead said the soil reports are the average of about 100 weekly reports forwarded from the Farm Service Agency, National Resources Conservation Agency and Ohio State University agricultural extension agents out checking soil conditions in Ohio fields every week.

The four categories in the report have specific definitions, with ""short"" being defined as dry soil where plant growth would be curtailed. Meanwhile, ""very short"" means growth has been stopped and there are visible signs of stress in the plants, Snead explained. In the very short conditions, the plants would suffer ""irreparable damage"" if the conditions continued, he said.

A check of the weekly reports for three preceding weeks of July show that throughout the month the ""very short"" and ""short"" categories combined to account for between 88 and 94 percent of the ratings. That means that the weekly report cited by Kasich clearly was not an aberration.
But are the weekly USDA reports the best measurement of soil conditions in Ohio? We checked with one of the leading crop-watchers in the state, Harold Watters, an assistant professor at OSU.

""It is dry, and the driest we have been in a very long time, drier than 1988,"" wrote Watters, an OSU Extension Field Agronomist, in an email response to PolitiFact.
Watters said the governor's assessment based on the July 23 report is ""pretty close"" to accurate.

""I read the weekly crop reports and visit fields across western Ohio and am confident they are pretty close,"" Watters wrote. ""We have been well below average on rainfall since very early summer. Does that mean we have inadequate soil moisture to grow a normal crop? Absolutely.""
In the email, Watters did allow that the reporting process for soil conditions is subjective ""so we cannot say they are entirely accurate and people’s emotions get involved when we are under this much stress in the crops across Ohio.""

So where does that leave our agrarian-minded governor as we harvest our crop of facts?

While an argument could be made that the weekly crop weather report shows only that 90 percent of the Ohio topsoil is inadequate to grow ""normal"" crops, we think it’s clear that’s what Kasich meant in his remarks, even though he didn't use the word normal.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Fran Millar']","
Did lawmaker get a good grade on education claim?
","
For the first time in more than a decade, federal officials say, local school systems are contributing a larger percentage of public education funding than state governments.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the change in a news article and in its Get Schooled blog.

One state lawmaker who plays a key role in education spending insisted that Georgia has not shirked its responsibility to its students. Education spending on children from kindergarten to the 12th grade has not dramatically declined in recent years, said Fran Millar, chairman of the Georgia Senate’s Education and Youth Committee.

""State revenue has gone down across the board,"" said Millar, a Republican state senator from Dunwoody. ""We have reduced funding for education the least. They’ve suffered the least cuts.""

A PolitiFact Georgia reader asked us to examine Millar’s statement. We, too, wondered whether Millar had correctly done his homework on this point. Has the state cut education spending to a lesser degree than other parts of state government?

Millar told us he was referring to the percentage of spending on education, since it is such a large portion of state spending. Georgia’s current 12-month spending plan for k-12 education is about $7.2 billion. Georgia’s current fiscal year budget is about $19 billion. The state of Georgia manages its money on a 12-month timetable that begins July 1 and ends June 30. 

Millar added in an email and during a telephone interview to emphasize his point that the state had not made drastic cuts in education spending.

""It’s the least-touched major area"" in terms of cuts, Millar said.

A few days after we started to examine Millar’s statement, the AJC reported that Gov. Nathan Deal and his budget staff have asked departments to come up with an additional $553 million in budget cuts by the 2014 budget cycle. The major portion of public school funding is exempt, the AJC reported.

The senator said he was thinking about the years since Deal took office or Sonny Perdue’s last year as governor when he made his claim to the AJC. He said spending may have even increased during those years. We followed his suggestion of examining data from the Georgia Office of Planning and Budget to calculate recent state spending.

PolitiFact Georgia looked at state spending since Deal took office in 2011 and from 2009, the year after the Great Recession began making an impact on state and local budgets.

Here’s the breakdown on education spending in recent fiscal years:

FY 2009:    $8.20 billion.
FY 2010:    $6.59 billion.
FY 2011:    $7.07 billion.
FY 2012:    $6.97 billion.
FY 2013:    $7.17 billion.

We found several state agencies with a smaller percentage of budget cuts. We considered what Millar said about the sizable chunk of money spent on k-12 education and focused on departments with large budgets.

PolitiFact Georgia examined spending among the 10 departments with the largest current budgets, including four with current budgets greater than $1 billion. The K-12 budget is still about 20 times greater than technical colleges, the department with the 10th-largest budget.

First, let’s look at spending since Deal took office. The Education Department’s budget rose by slightly more than 1 percent between FY 2011 and the current budget. Not a great deal of change there and not a decrease.

What about the two most recently completed budget cycles? Between FY 2011 and FY 2012, the Education Department’s budget declined by slightly more than 1 percent. Of the 10 departments with the largest budgets, that was the smallest decrease. Five departments had budget increases, some as high as about 15 percent, as was the case for the Department of Community Health.

Let’s examine spending since the recession. Since FY 2009, the Education Department’s budget declined by 12.5 percent. Of those with billion-dollar budgets, the Corrections Department was the only one with a smaller decrease, which was about 3 percent. Two other departments with large budgets -- transportation and technical colleges -- also had smaller percentage decreases of 8.5 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively. Again, there were some departments with budget increases. 

Millar countered that the state had no choice but to increase spending in some areas, such as the Department of Community Health, which oversees Georgia’s Medicaid program. State officials estimate they’ll have to spend about $4 billion in coming years to comply with the federal health care law.

Millar maintained he had a good argument, despite the spending increases for departments and smaller budget cuts in other areas.

""On balance, if you look at the numbers, I still think it’s a fair statement,"" the senator said of his initial statement.

So where does this leave us?

Millar’s larger point is that the state has not made major cuts in education spending in comparison with other larger departments since Deal took office. 

The 1 percent cut in education spending between FY 2011 and FY 2012 was the smallest among 10 of Georgia’s largest departments and among those with billion-dollar budgets, which supports Millar’s quote in the AJC. Millar’s argument loses some steam when examining spending between FY 2009 and now. We found a few larger departments with smaller percentage cuts than education. Additionally, there are some large departments with budget increases. 

Millar’s quote is accurate on some levels, but there are some details we found that lower his grade-point average on this statement. We rate the senator’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/08/fran-millar/did-lawmaker-get-good-grade-education-claim/
"['National', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Welfare', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Barack Obama’s plan for welfare reform: ""They just send you your check.""
","Forget, for a moment, tax cuts and the fiscal cliff. Mitt Romney wants to talk about welfare.

A Romney ad opens with a picture of President Bill Clinton signing the 1996 landmark welfare reform act, which shifted the program from indefinite government assistance to one based on steering people toward employment and self-reliance.

The words ""unprecedented success"" flash on the screen. Clinton and a bipartisan Congress, a narrator says, ""helped end welfare as we know it by requiring work for welfare.""

A leather-gloved laborer wipes sweat from his forehead.

""But on July 12,"" the ad continues, ""President Obama quietly announced a plan to gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements. Under Obama’s plan, you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check, and ‘welfare to work’ goes back to being plain old welfare.""

The July 12 announcement, made by the the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, allows states to try different ways of meeting the work requirements of the federal law. Does it really mean ""they just send you your welfare check""? We decided to look further.

The HHS memo

Since 1996, welfare has been administered through block grants to states through a program called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. TANF, as it’s called, limits how long families can get aid and requires recipients to eventually go to work. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people off welfare and and into the workforce.

A memo from George Sheldon, the acting assistant secretary at HHS, said the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states ""of the Secretary’s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families.""

The memo outlined, using the jargon of a federal bureaucracy, the kinds of waivers that would be considered. It suggested projects that ""improve collaboration with the workforce and/or post-secondary education systems"" and ""demonstrate strategies for more effectively serving individuals with disabilities,"" to give two examples.

What does all that mean?

""If you can do a better job connecting people to work, we would consider waiving certain parts of the performance measures and use alternate measures,"" is how Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, translated the memo’s point. (The center supports the plan.)

Schott, who studies welfare policy, said TANF sets guidelines for what activities may count toward meeting the law’s work requirements: jobs, job training, internships or school, to name a few. Beyond that, it puts restrictions on how many hours a welfare client may spend at school, or how many consecutive months they can attend before that activity no longer counts toward the work requirement.

The result: ""States are running less-effective programs than they might be, because they are so driven by performance measurement as it’s set forth in the federal law,"" Schott said.

The waivers, then, would allow for flexibility. For example, someone with a special-needs child might require different work arrangements than are currently allowed. Or a person who needs to improve his or her English skills might need more time to take classes.

""It’s really about the underlying program,"" Schott said. ""The real starting place is: What’s the most effective program to get this person to work?""

Romney’s assertion

In a memo released along with the ad, the Romney campaign says the change ""undermines the very premise of welfare reform. It is an insult to Americans on welfare who are looking for an opportunity to build better lives for themselves. And it is a kick in the gut to the millions of hard-working middle-class taxpayers struggling in today’s economy, working more for less but always preferring self-sufficiency to a government handout.""

Obama, it says, ""hopes states will consider approaches that remove work participation rate requirements all together.""

The HHS letter contains no such language. In several places, it says only proposals from states that ""improve employment outcomes"" will be considered.

It’s important to note, however, that the waivers would not just be a change on paper. Schott said it’s possible that waivers will allow states to get credit under the work requirement for things that don’t count currently. That possibility has critics of the proposal up in arms. Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it could ultimately allow ""state bureaucrats"" to count activities that aren't really work. We should point out that those concerns are at odds with the policy's stated goal of encouraging employment.

The Romney campaign also contends that HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is not legally allowed to waive the existing work requirements. Rector argues that the part of the law allowing waivers does not cover TANF work provisions.

""Critically, this section, as well as most other TANF requirements, is deliberately not listed... its provisions cannot be waived,"" Rector wrote in a July 12 column in the National Review.

We think that’s a noteworthy point, but it’s one that a court will have to settle.

Our ruling

Romney’s ad says, ""Under Obama’s plan (for welfare), you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check.""

That's a drastic distortion of the planned changes to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. By granting waivers to states, the Obama administration is seeking to make welfare-to-work efforts more successful, not end them. What’s more, the waivers would apply to individually evaluated pilot programs -- HHS is not proposing a blanket, national change to welfare law.

The ad tries to connect the dots to reach this zinger: ""They just send you your welfare check."" The HHS memo in no way advocates that practice. In fact, it says the new policy is ""designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families.""

The ad’s claim is not accurate, and it inflames old resentments about able-bodied adults sitting around collecting public assistance. Pants on Fire!  ",/factchecks/2012/aug/07/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obamas-plan-abandons-tenet/

Mitt Romney says Barack Obama rejects Jerusalem as capital of Israel
","
A 30-second ad from Mitt Romney’s campaign paints two starkly different portraits of the two presidential candidates’ positions on Israel.

Barack Obama: a president who has not visited the Jewish state. Mitt Romney: a friend who cherishes America’s friendship with the ally.

""Who shares your values?"" a narrator asks as an image of Obama appears. ""As president, Barack Obama has never visited Israel and refuses to recognize Jerusalem as its capital.""

Romney, the ad continues, ""will be a different kind of president who stands by our allies. He knows America holds a deep and cherished relationship with Israel.""

It ends with clips of Romney speaking in front of the Old City and praying at the Western Wall.

In separate fact-checks we’ll look at the ad’s claims about Obama’s record on visiting Israel. Here, we consider his position on the city of Jerusalem.

Capital question

In the decades-long conflict between Jews and Palestinians, both sides stake a claim on Jerusalem and consider it their capital and a holy site. So even though Jerusalem is the Israeli seat of government and its capital city in every traditional sense, the official position often involves some tip-toeing. Formally, the United States does not recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem.

The CIA, on its World Factbook website, lists Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, with a footnote stating ""Israel proclaimed Jerusalem as its capital in 1950, but the U.S., like all other countries, maintains its Embassy in Tel Aviv."" The U.S. Department of State posts similar language.

During the 2008 campaign, candidate Obama declared that ""Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided.""

The remark pleased the pro-Israel lobby, which had been somewhat skeptical of him. But it also served as an early lesson in the delicacy of diplomacy, particularly when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Arab groups took offense, and the campaign had to do some damage control. ""It's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations,"" Obama said in the wake.

For his part, Republican rival John McCain weighed in, agreeing ""Jerusalem is undivided. Jerusalem is the capital.""

""And,"" he added, according to the New York Times, ""we should move our embassy to Jerusalem,"" from Tel Aviv, ""before anything else happens. The subject of Jerusalem itself will be addressed in negotiations by the Israeli government and people.""

Therein lies a long-running point of contention: the location of the U.S. embassy.

As our peers at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker column noted, the Republican Party platform has long included a pledge to move the embassy to Jerusalem. But that’s never happened, even when a Republican was in the White House.

How wide is the gap between campaign rhetoric and official policy? During a press briefing on July 26, 2012, White House spokesman Jay Carney twice dodged the question when asked directly what the capital of Israel is.

He replied only that ""our position hasn’t changed"" and ""you know the answer.""

This is the evidence Romney’s campaign pointed to when we asked for backup to the ad.

Our ruling

The ad says Obama ""refuses to recognize Jerusalem"" as the capital of Israel.

As a candidate, Obama identified Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But as president since then, he has shied away from making statements that could be perceived as taking sides in the ongoing peace process. That’s not so much a refusal on his part but a continuation of the line taken before him by previous presidents. Formally, the United States does not recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. Both the state department and CIA under his administration note Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, with a footnote attached.

Romney’s ad portrays Obama’s position as a betrayal of an ally. That’s misleading. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/07/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-rejects-jerusalem-capital-israel/

Mitt Romney says Barack Obama has not visited Israel as president
","
Following a trip in which he said Israel was blessed by the hand of providence, Mitt Romney is out with an ad questioning President Barack Obama’s allegiance to the Jewish state.

""Who shares your values?"" a narrator asks as an image of Obama appears. ""As president, Barack Obama has never visited Israel and refuses to recognize Jerusalem as its capital.""

Romney, the ad continues, ""will be a different kind of president who stands by our allies. He knows America holds a deep and cherished relationship with Israel.""

The ad closes with clips of Romney giving a speech in front of the Old City and praying at the Western Wall.

In another fact-check, we’ll look at the ad’s claims about Obama’s record on Jerusalem as the nation's capital.

Here, we ask, has the president been there?

 Before he moved to the White House

As an Illinois senator, Obama made his first visit to Israel in January of 2006. In 2008, while running for president, he returned on a multi-nation trip to Israel, Jordan, Germany, France and Britain. That trip, like Romney’s this year, was designed to bolster his foreign policy credentials.

At the time, Obama declared America a friend of Israel and said we ""must always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself.""

But Romney’s ad specified that Obama has not been to Israel ""as president,"" and that assertion is correct.

As it turns out, that’s not unusual.

Our colleagues at the Washington Post’s Fact-Checker column delved into the archives of the historian’s office at the U.S. State Department. According to those records, seven of the last 11 presidents (dating back to Harry Truman who was in the White House when Israel was established) never visited Israel.

The Obama campaign, when we asked for a response, pointed out that Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were among those who never went to Israel. Democratic Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were the only ones to visit during their first term. George W. Bush went to Israel twice during his last year in office.

That historical context is noteworthy: A majority of the last 11 presidents did not visit Israel. But the Romney ad’s claim is still accurate. We rate it True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/07/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-has-not-visited-israel-president/
