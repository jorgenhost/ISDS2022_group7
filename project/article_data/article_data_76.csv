McCain spoke up early
","A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays the Arizona senator as a leader in the fight against global warming.
 
The ad begins with fast-paced music and horns honking. It shows black-and-white scenes of crowded freeways, smokestacks belching and a glacier collapsing.
 
""John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago,"" the narrator says.
 
The stark black-and-white scenes are replaced by more pleasant color footage of a wind turbine against a bright blue sky and water flowing through a dam.
 
""Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment.""
 
With images such as a newspaper headline that says ""McCain climate views clash with GOP,"" the ad portrays McCain as an independent voice on climate change.
 
Indeed, the

Congressional Record

shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that.
 
On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights.
 
When he introduced the bill, McCain called it ""the first comprehensive piece of legislation"" in capping emissions.
 
""The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.""
 
By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change.
 
Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in ""educating the Senate"" about how government could respond to global warming.
 
""It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House,"" Roy said.
 
He called McCain ""a huge leader on this issue in the Senate.""
 
And so we find McCain's statement to be True.

No proof Rezko saved Obama money on home
 ","It didn't take long for the Republican Party to pounce after Antoin ""Tony"" Rezko, a prominent former fundraiser for Sen. Barack Obama, was convicted on June 4, 2008, on federal charges of fraud and money laundering as part of Illinois' pay-to-play politics.
 
The very day of the conviction, the Republican National Committee crafted a news release titled, ""Obama Must Answer Questions so the American People Can Decide.""
 
One of those questions: ""Did Obama know that Tony Rezko was saving him $300,000 on the purchase of his home?""
 
By asking if Obama knew about it, the question presumes the claim is true: that Rezko did, in fact, save Obama $300,000 on the purchase of his home.
 
Now it's true that Obama paid $300,000 less than the asking price for a century-old mansion that he and his wife, Michelle, purchased from a Chicago doctor in 2005 for $1.65-million.
 
And on the same day the Obamas closed on their house, Rezko's wife, Rita Rezko, bought a vacant lot next door from the same seller for $625,000, the full asking price. Obama said it was his understanding that there was another offer besides the Rezkos' for the vacant lot at or near the asking price, thereby setting the market.
 
The Obama campaign has posted an e-mail from the seller, Frederic Wondisford, confirming that Obama's offer on the house was the best one. In the letter, the seller says he rejected two lower offers from the Obamas before the two sides finally settled at $1.65-million.
 
The seller also confirmed that he did not offer or give the Obamas a discount on the house price on the basis of the price offered and accepted on the adjacent vacant lot purchased by Rezko's wife.
 
Lastly, Wondisford confirmed that it was he who insisted the closing for the two properties be completed on the same day.
 
Donna Schwan, with MetroPro Realty, which listed both the house and the vacant lot, recalled that there were several offers on both the house and the lot, though she could not remember the amount of those other offers and said she has since discarded the offer sheets.
 
""The most important thing to the sellers was to close on the same day,"" Schwan said, as they did not want one of the properties to sit unsold, alone.
 
The sellers also required the buyers to put off the closing until June 15, after their children had gotten out of school.
 
The fact that the Rezkos agreed to purchase the vacant lot on that date in mid June, ""could have been to their (the Obamas') advantage, absolutely,"" Schwan said.
 
""Each was contingent on the other selling,"" she said.
 
""Whoever was willing to close on that date, if they made a reasonable offer, that's who they went with,"" Schwan said.
 
One could certainly argue that the Rezkos' purchase, and their flexibility on the closing date, helped assure that the Obamas' offer was accepted. The real estate agent made clear that getting the two properties sold at the same time was a priority for the seller.
 
But that's still a long way from saying the Rezkos saved the Obamas $300,000. The GOP offers no proof that the price paid by the Obamas was anything other than a matter of negotiation, or that the Obamas would have had to pay $300,000 more if not for the Rezkos' purchase. In fact, the seller specifically confirmed that the Obamas' offer of $1.65-million was the best offer he received on the house. Further, the seller confirmed that he did not offer the Obamas a discount on the price of the house ""on the basis of or in relation to the price offered and accepted on the lot.""
 
Having the Rezkos as flexible buyers on the vacant lot might have helped the Obamas get the house they had been trying to buy, but there's just nothing to support the GOP claim that the Rezkos saved the Obamas $300,000. We say False.

It sure looks like pork
","Sen. John McCain has a well-deserved reputation in Washington as a pork-buster. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee regularly castigates colleagues when they insert language in spending bills forcing taxpayers everywhere to pay for projects only of interest to a select few.
 
In a recent e-mail to reporters, Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, tries to paint McCain as a hypocrite, pointing out that in 2006, McCain co-sponsored legislation with fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl ""that asked for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona named in honor of William Rehnquist, the former U.S. Supreme Court chief justice."" In essence, Obama argued, McCain had ""lobbied for (a) $10-million pork project.""
 
The

New York Times,

which wrote about the bill in February 2006, reported that some saw it at the time as a pork-barrel project. Reporter Carl Hulse wrote that ""while the goal"" of a Rehnquist center ""may be laudable,"" critics were calling it ""a classic case of lawmakers' trying to funnel money directly to a home-state institution for a project that should find financing elsewhere.""
 
Aides to McCain told Hulse the difference between McCain's proposal and the projects McCain so often derides as ""pork,"" lies in the way the project was pursued. Pork projects, the aides argued, are attached to massive spending bills with little or no debate. McCain's proposal was introduced as a standalone bill that could only advance with some measure of debate. In the end, McCain's bill never got out of committee.
 
That's a fair point, but even McCain allies told the

New York Times

that it was the type of project that should be funded at the local level, or with private funds. ""If it doesn't meet the technical term of earmark, it would probably meet the public idea of one,"" Pete Sepp, a vice president at the National Taxpayers Union, said at the time.
 
We see McCain's point that pork projects are earmarks for funding that are attached with little or no debate to spending bills. McCain has long said the big objection to such projects is as much about the short-cut process for for approving them as it is about the value of the projects being funded.
 
But another important aspect of a pork project is its parochial nature. Pork projects are typically only of interest to people in a particular region, and those people, pork-busters like McCain usually argue, should be the ones to pay for it.
 
The latter is what's at stake in the request for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona, even if it is named after the late U.S. chief justice. For a purist on spending like McCain, it's hard to argue this wasn't a parochial, pork-barrel project. As a result, we find Obama's charge Mostly True.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'John McCain']","
Obama not No. 1 in other ratings
","Using a well-proven strategy from the Republican playbook, Sen. John McCain has been asserting that Sen. Barack Obama is a liberal.
 
""In just a few years in office, Sen. Obama has accumulated the most liberal voting record in the Senate,"" McCain said in a speech in New Orleans.
 
Republican candidates often brand their Democratic opponents as liberals to portray them as lefties who favor big government and high taxes. Linguists who study political rhetoric say Republicans have been so effective at giving the word a negative connotation that many Democrats won't call themselves liberals. They prefer ""progressives.""
 
Still, many political scientists and journalists use the term to represent the Democratic extreme of the political spectrum, and

National Journal,

a nonpartisan political magazine, uses a liberal-conservative scale for its annual rating of congressional votes.
 
The magazine's editors and reporters choose key votes on major issues and those that they believe exhibit a split between liberals and conservatives and then calculate how often senators and House members vote each way. They calculate the liberal/conservative votes in three areas — economic, social issues and foreign policy — and then average them for a composite score. The annual rankings generate some publicity for the magazine, especially in election years. In 2004, the magazine said the most liberal senator was Sen. John Kerry, who became the Democratic nominee for president.
 
On Jan. 31, 2008, five days before the Super Tuesday primaries,

National Journal

published an article headlined ""Obama: Most Liberal Senator in 2007."" The article said Obama had missed 33 of the 99 votes that were rated but that it was enough for a calculation. The magazine said McCain was not rated because he missed more than half the votes in the economic and foreign-policy categories.
 
Since Obama's rating was announced, McCain and other Republicans have frequently cited it to criticize Obama. Rep. Dan Boren, a Democrat from Oklahoma, cited the rating last week in explaining why he was not supporting Obama.
 
Yet other ratings don't show Obama as the Senate's top lefty.
 
He wasn't the top liberal in his two other years in the U.S. Senate according to

National Journal

. He was 10th-most liberal in 2006 and 16th in 2005.
 
The McCain campaign also cites a 2006 rating by the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action that gave Obama 95 percent, which the campaign noted was the same as Kerry and Sen. Barbara Boxer.
 
But there's a little sleight of hand in that one. Although the McCain campaign is correct that Obama earned a 95 percent rating that year for voting the way ADA wanted, there were 10 senators who got more liberal scores than Obama, including Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Richard Durbin of Illinois. (In the latest ADA rating, for 2007, Obama missed five of the 20 votes the group scored, so he received a 75 percent rating. But he voted the way ADA wanted on each of the 15 votes he attended.)
 
Voteview.com, a site created by political scientists that plots lawmakers on a liberal-conservative scale based on their voting patterns, calculated there were nine senators more liberal than Obama in the current Congress, including Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
 
""Obama is a liberal, but he's not the most liberal,"" said Keith Poole, a University of California-San Diego professor who runs the site.
 
Ratings from

Congressional Quarterly

don't measure liberal/conservative votes, but they show Obama is not quite as partisan as other senators.
 
In CQ's calculation of party unity, which measures how often members vote with their party on bills where Republicans and Democrats split, Obama got a 97 percent rating last year. Ten Democrats had higher scores.
 
On votes where President Bush indicated his position, CQ found Obama supported the Republican president 40 percent of the time in 2007, which put Obama in the middle of the pack for Democrats. He supported Bush 49 percent the previous year.
 
If McCain had made a more general statement about Obama's ideology, he could have been more accurate. But McCain's statement that Obama ""has accumulated the most liberal voting record"" suggests it is a cumulative rating for all of Obama's time in the Senate. But in fact, it is true for only

one

rating for

one

year. Measurements for other years and by other groups show Obama is not the No. 1 liberal — in some cases, far from No. 1. So we find McCain's statement to be Barely True.

"['National', 'Bankruptcy', 'Barack Obama']","
No exemptions for debtors
","Trying to portray his opponent as insensitive to the plight of debt-laden Americans, Sen. Barack Obama used a June 11, 2008, speech to highlight Sen. John McCain's support for a 2005 law that made it more difficult for personal bankruptcy filers to escape debts that they could repay. Specifically, he noted McCain's opposition to an effort to exempt from the law individuals whose medical expenses pushed them into bankruptcy.
 
""John McCain has been part of the problem,"" Obama said. ""When he had the chance to help families avoid falling into debt, John McCain sided with the credit card companies. When he had the chance to protect teenagers and college students from deceptive credit card practices, he sided with the credit card companies. And when I fought against the credit card industry's bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to climb out of debt, he supported it — and he even opposed exempting families who were only in bankruptcy because of medical expenses they couldn't pay.""
 
The attack line revives many Democratic criticisms of the 2005 measure, which created a means test designed to force more consumers to file under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, instead of Chapter 7. Under Chapter 7, individuals could have much of their debt erased, while Chapter 13 requires debtors to enter into court-ordered plans to repay their debts over several years.
 
The legislation was a huge priority of the financial service industry, which mounted an eight-year lobbying effort to get it enacted. But Democrats, then in the minority of the House and Senate, branded it a ""sweetheart deal"" for credit card companies and argued it would force qualified bankruptcy filers to pay higher attorneys' fees and face more paperwork.
 
As the bill approached a final vote in the Senate at the end of February 2005, Democrats led by Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois threw up a series of roadblocks in the form of amendments designed to exempt certain groups from the means test, including long-term caregivers and victims of identity theft. Each was shot down by the Republican majority, which was eager to send a ""clean"" bill to the House, where GOP leaders had made it clear they would not vote on legislation laden with amendments.
 
One amendment offered by Kennedy would exempt debtors if their financial problems were caused by medical expenses. All 54 Republicans in the chamber, including McCain, voted against the measure, which was rejected 39-58. Obama joined 37 other Democrats and Vermont Independent James M. Jeffords in voting for it.
 
In fairness, McCain did not play a prominent role in this debate. And the vote on Kennedy's amendment was not an especially dramatic moment in the life of the bankruptcy law; there was more attention focused on high-profile votes on amendments to raise the minimum wage and to prevent violent protesters from escaping court-ordered fines or judgments by filing for bankruptcy protection.
 
Still, a vote is a vote, and in a year where candidates are trying to show empathy for economically stressed Americans, votes like this are likely to carry strong symbolism. Because Obama correctly cites McCain's vote on an effort to narrow the bankruptcy law's reach, we judge his statement True.

'Privatization' gets 'personal'
","Democrats jumped on a comment that Sen. John McCain made at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on June 12, 2008. ""I am not for quote 'privatization of Social Security.' I never have been, never will be,"" McCain said in answer to a voter question. The Democratic National Committee quickly spliced that video onto file video of McCain on C-Span. ""Without privatization, I don't see how you can possibly over time make sure that young Americans are able to receive Social Security benefits,"" he said in 2004. The 26-second spot wraps up with a photo of McCain and George W. Bush, and audio of a crowd shouting ""Four more years!"" Seems like an obvious flip-flop, right? Not so fast. The DNC ad truncates McCain's remarks at the 2008 town hall. The  Nashua  (N.H.)  Telegram  reported the following exchange: ""Amherst Democratic activist John Mendolusky engaged McCain in a sharp but respectful exchange over Social Security reform. 'You stated you are in favor of private accounts which really is privatization of Social Security,' Mendolusky began. 'Why would you have workers risk their nest eggs on the roulette wheels of Wall Street?' 'I am not for quote ""privatization"" of Social Security. I never have been, never will be. That is a great buzzword for an attack,' McCain shot back. 'Workers should have the right to put their own taxes, their own money into an account. If they don't want to, don't do it.'"" McCain's rejection of the word privatization goes back to President George W. Bush's 2005 push to allow workers to divert a portion of the program's payroll taxes to personal investment accounts. The thinking was that private accounts would give younger workers the ability to manage their retirement nest eggs without government interference and it would keep the system solvent. McCain supported Bush's plan, going so far as to accompany the president on a series of town hall meetings in March 2005. It was around this time that Bush and his party decided that most people didn't like the idea of ""privatizing"" Social Security. Pollsters found that if you didn't call Bush's plan ""privatization"" but instead called it ""personal accounts,"" you could increase support for the plan significantly — even though it was the same plan. So Bush and his supporters stopped referring to the plan as privatization and started calling it ""personal accounts."" Bush complained that privatization was a ""trick word"" designed to ""scare people."" Hence the 2004 video of McCain talking about ""privatization"" contrasted with 2008 video rejecting the term. Not that the new terminology worked. Personal accounts didn't get very far legislatively, and the initiative went down as one of Bush's biggest defeats in domestic policy. So what is McCain proposing for Social Security if he's elected?  We looked at this question previously  and found that McCain has offered only a broad outline for the program. His Web site says he wants to supplement the current system with personal accounts but adds the accounts will not be a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept. It also notes McCain wants to work with Democrats on a Social Security plan but is prepared to go it alone if they don't want to play. The full context of McCain's comment at the town hall meeting, which the DNC was happy to leave on the cutting room floor, shows McCain thinks that voluntary personal accounts do not amount to privatization of Social Security. He reiterated that position on the campaign trail the day after the New Hampshire town hall meeting. ""I will not privatize Social Security, and it's not true when I'm accused of that,"" McCain said. ""But I would like for younger workers, younger workers only, to have an opportunity to take a few of their tax dollars, and maybe put it into an account with their name on it. That's their money. ... And we will make sure that present-day retirees, I will commit, have the benefits that they have earned."" This makes answering the Democrats' implicit claim that McCain favored privatization a little tricky. On a certain level, the video speaks for itself. If by privatization you mean George Bush's plan, then McCain clearly did favor it. But Bush himself didn't like the term privatization and felt that it was misleading. McCain clearly believes he can offer personal accounts while keeping the rest of Social Security intact and rejects the privatization label. For all of these reasons, we find the DNC's claim to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AF4800>],/factchecks/2008/jun/13/democratic-national-committee/privatization-gets-personal/
"['National', 'Bush Administration', 'Natural Disasters ', 'John McCain']","
With two notable exceptions
","One of the ways Sen. John McCain is trying to put distance between himself and President Bush is by criticizing the administration's response to Hurricane Katrina. But to pull it off, he's having to sidestep politically sensitive votes he took in 2005 and 2006 to limit Democrats' ability to investigate federal response to the disaster. At a press conference in Baton Rouge, La., on June 4, 2008, the presumptive Republican nominee was asked why he twice opposed creation of an independent commission to probe such issues as the government's role and the impact of the storm. McCain responded that he had backed every probe into the disaster. ""I've supported every investigation (into Hurricane Katrina) and ways of finding out how — what caused the tragedy,"" McCain replied. ""I've met with people on the ground. I've met with the governor."" But McCain twice joined other Senate Republicans to beat back Democratic efforts led by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton to launch an independent probe that could have embarrassed the administration. Those efforts came at a time of particularly bitter recriminations over the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, while the White House was refusing to release certain documents or to make senior officials available for sworn testimony before Congress, citing the confidentiality of executive branch communications. In the GOP-controlled Senate, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee had launched a probe of the federal role in hurricane preparedness and its response. Republican leaders expressed faith in the bipartisan investigation and derided Democratic efforts to charter an independent commission to conduct a parallel inquiry. An aide to then-Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., called amendments to establish an independent Katrina commission ""taxpayer-funded flatulence that would just waste time and money to distract from the inquiry already well under way in the Senate."" On Sept. 14, 2005, McCain and 53 other Senate Republicans rejected an effort by Clinton to establish the commission by attaching an amendment to a spending bill. Republicans said the move violated Senate rules, by attempting to legislate policy via a spending bill. Less than five months later, on Feb. 2, 2006, McCain joined with 52 Senate Republicans in a vote to kill a Clinton effort to attach a similar amendment to a tax bill. The Republicans countered Clinton's proposal by offering to create a bipartisan congressional committee consisting of senators and representatives to examine the hurricane response, but Democrats rejected the idea. Sen. Barack Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee each pounced on McCain's gaffe, sending e-mails providing the dates and vote numbers of the two Senate votes. ""John McCain seems perfectly comfortable misleading the American people rather than telling them the truth,"" said DNC spokeswoman Karen Finney. McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said the Arizona senator was not familiar with the votes referenced in the question at the press conference, and was referring to his support for the Senate Homeland Security Committee investigation that was ongoing while Clinton offered her amendment. He issued a statement chastising Obama for launching ""tired negative attacks."" As for McCain's claim that he met with ""people on the ground"" and then-Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco, his campaign would not provide information to back it up. But in March 2006, McCain was among the first senators to visit stricken districts of New Orleans, partly at the behest of the community activist group Women of the Storm, and he subsequently called for expanded funding to rebuild portions of the city. Media accounts of the visit state he was briefed by civic and business leaders and Army Corps of Engineers officials. Though there are no accounts of McCain and Blanco meeting, McCain and Louisiana state officials did consult on hurricane-related matters, such as in late 2006, when he was a player in unsuccessful House-Senate negotiations over a water resources bill that took up how much oversight to apply to future Army Corps of Engineers projects. McCain clearly showed empathy over the government's response to the disaster and the scope of the damage. But he overlooked his participation in two outright Senate rejections of Democratic efforts to establish an independent Katrina commission, so we rate his claim Barely True.     
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A353280>],/factchecks/2008/jun/11/john-mccain/with-two-notable-exceptions/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'John McCain']","
Two wrongs don't make a right
","Sen. Barack Obama will be a record-breaking tax hiker, Sen. John McCain alleged on June 10.
 
He was speaking to the National Small Business Summit in Washington, D.C. Both he and Obama would bring change, McCain said.
 
""The question is what kind of change,"" said the Arizona senator. ""Will we go back to the policies of the '60s and '70s that have failed? Or will we go forward? Will we enact the largest single tax increase since the Second World War as my opponent proposes, or will we keep taxes low — low for families and employers?""
 
That echoed a charge he had leveled a couple months earlier against Obama and then-candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton at Carnegie Mellon University. ""By allowing many of the current low tax rates to expire, they would impose — overnight — the single largest tax increase since the Second World War,"" McCain said.
 
This claim is dubious from the get-go. Although tax revenue would go up under Obama's tax plan, one could argue that he's actually proposing a tax cut.
 
Let us explain: President Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 came with what are called ""sunsets,"" or scheduled expiration dates. Bush has asked Congress several times to make the cuts permanent, but Congress has thus far declined to do so. As the law stands today, the cuts will expire by 2011 and taxes will go back up.
 
Obama wants to allow some of the cuts — specifically those on incomes over $250,000 — to expire. But he wants to keep the cuts on lower incomes, and reduce taxes even further on some of the lowest earners.
 
Obama's plan, according to a June 11 analysis by the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, would generate $2.7-trillion less over 10 years than the government would collect if it allowed Bush's cuts to expire on schedule.
 
So calling it a tax increase might not be considered fair. There's no disputing that taxes will rise, but the question of who's responsible for that tax increase is another matter entirely. At PolitiFact, we've concluded, as have others, that it's unfair to call Obama's plan a tax increase merely because it doesn't change existing tax law to keep rates low. We think about it this way: The reason taxes will increase is because of tax policy signed into law not by Obama, but by somebody else.
 
Obama's plan doesn't call for raising taxes.
 
""It's not accurate,"" said Leonard Burman, co-director of the center. ""He's actually proposing a tax cut.""
 
Still, it's true that tax revenue would go up under Obama's plan. Revenue would be $1.1-trillion more over the next 10 years under Obama's plan than it would be if the government extended Bush's tax cuts. And the effect of Obama's policy on the economy would be that of a tax increase.
 
So let's indulge McCain for a minute, and call it a tax increase.
 
Now — how big an increase would it be?
 
Let's take one particular year, since past tax increases have been measured over one year. And let's pick 2012, since all of Obama's proposed changes to current policy would be phased in by then.
 
The Tax Policy Center — which is a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., that both liberal and conservative economists consider credible — estimated that under Obama's plan tax revenue in 2012 would be $70.2-billion greater than it would be if Bush's tax cuts were extended. That's just an estimate — the Obama campaign hasn't spelled out every detail of its tax plan — but it's the best one available at this point, several experts said.
 
So how does a $70.2-billion increase compare to other tax increases since World War II? The best source for information on the sizes of past tax increases, several economists told us, is a paper by Jerry Tempalski of the U.S. Treasury Department, ""Revenue Effects of Major Tax Bills,"" updated in 2006. He said the best way to gauge the size of a tax increase is to compare it to the overall size of the economy, otherwise known as the Gross Domestic Product.
 
The $70.2-billion increase under a President Obama is .40 percent of the projected GDP for 2012 ($17.5-trillion). That would be just the ninth-largest increase since World War II, not the largest.
However, there are other ways to measure the size of tax increases. Tempalski said the second-best way is by its size in dollars, adjusted for inflation. He compared the historical increases by putting them in 1992 dollars. Obama's $70.2-billion increase in 2012 would be $40.5-billion in 1992 dollars, according to the Congressional Budget Office. By that measure, it would be the second-largest increase since World War II. The Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968, passed under Lyndon Johnson to reduce a deficit swelled by the Vietnam War, yielded a tax increase of $55.3-billion in 1992 dollars.
 
So based on what is known so far about Obama's plan, it would not be the largest since World War II by either of the two best measures. Moreover, Obama's proposal does not constitute a tax increase in the traditional sense, since taxes would be lower under his plan than they would under current law. We find McCain's statement to be False.

""After just three years in the Senate, Barack Obama demonstrates his poor grasp of basic economic principles,"" a narrator says.

The ad is right that Obama wants to raise the capital gains tax. He has said he wants to raise it as part of an overall strategy of asking wealthy people to pay more taxes. Depending on the circumstances, he would raise it no higher than 28 percent, the current rate for the top income-tax bracket.
 
But would raising the capital gains tax hurt the middle class? We conclude the answer is largely no: Only a small percentage of middle-class taxpayers pay capital gains taxes, no more than 11 percent. On the other hand, among higher-income taxpayers, about 51 percent pay the capital gains taxes.
 
Walk with us into a thicket of data from the Internal Revenue Service (C'mon ... It'll be fun!) and we'll show you how we came to these conclusions.
 
We looked at data from 2005, the most recent year for which the IRS has released detailed data.
 
First, we had to decide which taxpayers are ""middle class."" Based on the data brackets, we counted everyone who reported income of less than $200,000, which we think is fairly generous to the RNC's point.
 
Two categories of income are subject to capital gains taxes: taxable net gains and capital gains distributions (typically profits from mutual funds that are not part of a retirement plan). A taxpayer can report income in one or both categories, although most file in the first category. We're counting both categories as different taxpayers because we can't know how many people report income in both categories. For this reason, our numbers are going to be slight overestimates. Again, this will favor the RNC's point.
 
Next, we added up the number of taxpayers who reported income in those two categories, so we could find out how many taxpayers were subject to capital gains taxes in 2005.
 
Among tax filers making $200,000 or less, about 14.3-million of 130.8-million filers reported income subject to capital gains taxes. That's about 11 percent.
 
Among tax filers making more than $200,000, about 1.8-million of 3.6-million filers reported income subject to capital gains taxes. That's about 51 percent.
 
So only 11 percent of what we're calling middle-class people report capital gains, while 51 percent of wealthier people report it.
 
If we removed people reporting income of less than $25,000, that percent would drop to 8.5 percent. And if we also decided we were too generous with our definition of middle class, and only counted people making under $100,000, that percentage would drop further, to 6 percent.
 
""The capital gains tax largely affects very high-income people,"" said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., which both liberal and conservative economists consider credible.
 
The ad then says the tax will hurt 100-million Americans who own stocks, a claim we looked at previously. We found that raising capital gains taxes

would not directly affect most working people saving for retirement

. Tax-exempt retirement accounts like 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are not subject to capital gains taxes. Most home sales are not subject to the capital gains tax either,

an issue we've written about previously

.
 
The ad says that Obama's plan to raise capital gains taxes ""hurts the middle class,"" but it's hard to see how that's true of a tax that directly affects — at most — 11 percent of a very generous definition of the middle class. Are there a few middle-class people who pay the tax? Sure. But on the whole, capital gains taxes are disproportionately paid by higher-income brackets. We find the RNC's claim to be Barely True.

Obama didn't write that

One quote stands out as totally false.
 
""I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race.""
 
We read the book, and thought this line sounded out of place. To be doubly sure, we purchased an electronic edition of the book via ebooks.com, and searched for the words solace, grievance or animosity. We were not able to find the sentence, or anything close to the sentence, in Obama's book.
 
The quote is actually lifted from an article in the

American Conservative.

Author Steve Sailer wrote a detailed analysis of

Dreams from My Father,

describing the narrator as ""a humor-impaired Holden Caulfield whose preppie angst is fueled by racial regret"" but also praising it as ""an impressive book"" with an ""elegant, carefully wrought prose style.""
 
The ""grievance"" quote comes from the following passage:
 
""In reality, Obama provides a disturbing test of the best-case scenario of whether America can indeed move beyond race. He inherited his father's penetrating intelligence; was raised mostly by his loving liberal white grandparents in multiracial, laid-back Hawaii, where America's normal race rules never applied; and received a superb private school education. And yet, at least through age 33 when he wrote

Dreams from My Father

, he found solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against his mother's race.""
 
But those are Sailer's words, not Obama's. It's an arguable point whether it's a fair characterization of the views expressed in Obama's book. The bottom line is an e-mailer somewhere took the sentence, rewrote it, and passed it off as Obama's words. For this reason, we rate this statement Pants on Fire!

The e-mails states, ""From The Audacity of Hope: 'I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.' ""
 
The quote comes from page 261 of the paperback edition of

The Audacity of Hope.

In the full passage, Obama talks about speaking in front of audiences of immigrants, and how he often tells them that they embody the American dream.
 
But he wrote that when he speaks to audiences of Pakistani and Arab-Americans, their message to him has a more urgent quality.
 
""(T)he stories of detentions and FBI questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging. They have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly; they need specific assurances that their citizenship really means something, that America has learned the right lessons from the Japanese internments during World War II, and that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.""
 
Obama doesn't mention Muslims here at all; he's clearly talking about U.S. citizens of Arab and Pakistani descent.
 
Also, the e-mail says Obama would ""stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction,"" implying he made a statement to that effect. But it's clear in reading the text that the words actually represent a question Obama is being asked by his audiences: ""they need specific assurances ... that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.""
 
Though Obama doesn't say so explicitly, he gives the impression his answer is yes.
 
The e-mail distorts Obama's quote and misrepresents who he was talking about, lumping together an entire religion when he was talking to two groups of people in the context of discrimination. It's a significant alteration to the meaning of what Obama said, and we find it to be False.

"['National', 'Military', 'John McCain']","
Navy's record unblemished
","In making his pitch for more nuclear power plants as one way to address global warming, Sen. John McCain is fond of citing a military statistic.
 
""My friends, the U.S. Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them and we've never had an accident,"" McCain said in Nashville, Tenn., on June 2, 2008. ""That's because we have well-trained and capable people.""
 
Indeed, the U.S. Navy turned to nuclear power in the 1950s to make its submarines faster and able to stay submerged longer. They are also quieter, more stealth. Since commissioning the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS

Nautilus

, in 1954, the Navy has steamed 139-million miles around the world on various nuclear-powered vessels. Currently, there are 102 nuclear reactors aboard 80 Navy combat vessels, mainly submarines and aircraft carriers.
 
""We have never had an accident or release of radioactivity which has had an adverse effect on human health or the environment,"" said Lukas McMichael, a public affairs officer for Naval Reactors, the U.S. government office that oversees the operation of the Navy's nuclear propulsion program. ""His (McCain's) statement is correct.""
 
Now, two nuclear subs still sit on the Atlantic floor, having sunk in the 1960s.
 
The first to go down was the USS

Thresher

in April 1963 during deep-diving tests 200 miles off the coast of Cape Cod. All 129 officers, crewmen and military and civilian technicians aboard were killed.
 
The USS

Scorpion

submarine went down about 400 miles southwest of the Azores in May 1968. All 99 crewmen aboard died.
 
While there is some disagreement about the cause of the accidents, neither went down as a result of problems with the nuclear reactors.
 
The Navy has done some environmental monitoring over the years of the ocean floor around where the subs sank, and has determined there has been no significant impact to the environment. The low levels of radioactivity close to the submarines, McMichael said, were no different than the background levels of radioactivity found anywhere on the ocean floor.
 
While environmental and nuclear watchdog groups agree with McCain's statement about the Navy's accident-free record, many take issue with its significance as it relates to expanding the number of commercial nuclear power plants in the United States.
 
""The Navy, they train their people well,"" said Kurt Zwally, National Wildlife Federation global warming solutions manager. ""The Navy's safety record is admirable. But there is a different safety record with plants in the U.S.""
 
Edwin Lyman, a senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C., said commercial nuclear power plants have at times been run haphazardly and sloppily.
 
The Navy is one thing, Lyman said. ""Are they going to be able to run the commercial sector with that kind of discipline? I doubt it.""
 
The Navy's good safety culture is certainly one reason for its success, said Thomas B. Cochran, senior scientist in the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. But there are other reasons. The Navy's reactors are much smaller and more robust than reactors used commercially. They are designed for combat and to take jolts from being in a submarine. So the comparison isn't entirely fair, he said.
 
In short, while there is debate about the relevance of McCain's statistic, McCain is right when he says there have been no reactor accidents aboard the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered vessels. We rate his statement True.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'John McCain']","
McCain overstates good news out of Iraq
","At a town hall event in Nashville, Tenn., Sen. John McCain told the crowd that casualties and deaths in the Iraq war had reached a new low.
 
""So the war in Iraq has been long and hard and tough and the sacrifice that's been made by brave young Americans has broken all of our hearts,"" McCain said June 2, 2008. ""And we know that the war was terribly mismanaged for nearly four years. And I stood up and was called disloyal by Republicans and attacked by Democrats, Republicans and others because I said that strategy didn't work. And I advocated this new strategy (the troop surge), which obviously, according to news reports that casualties and deaths are, are at its lowest point since literally the beginning, and the success is remarkable.""
 
Indeed, there were 19 military deaths related to Operation Iraqi Freedom in May 2008, fewer than any previous month of the war, according to

casualty reports

issued by the Defense Department. We also checked with two independent organizations that track military deaths,

Iraq Coalition Casualty Count

and

GlobalSecurity.org

. The former agreed there were 19 deaths in May; the latter had it at 20, but that included a soldier on leave from Iraq who died in a car accident in Chicago.
 
The month with the next-fewest deaths was February 2004, when 21 military personnel died, according to the Defense Department.
 
So McCain was correct about deaths. But what about casualties?
 
Dictionaries define ""casualty"" as a member of the armed forces lost to service through death, wounds, injury, sickness, internment or capture. The military's monthly

casualty reports

, however, include only those lost to service through death and combat-related wounds. Statistics on noncombat injuries and illnesses are not available because the military's medical stations are not required to report them, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Les Melnyk said.
 
We stuck to the military's definition of a casualty, because it keeps the statistics, and found McCain to be incorrect. There were 214 U.S. casualties in May 2008. In three prior months of the war, there were fewer: February 2004 (171), May 2003 (92) and June 2003 (177).
 
By ""casualties,"" McCain also might have meant those wounded in action, excluding deaths. By that standard as well he was off — the 195 wounded in May 2008 exceeded the number in February 2004 (150), January 2004 (187), August 2003 (181), June 2003 (147) and May 2003 (55), according to the Defense Department.
 
McCain left himself wiggle room by attributing the claim to ""news accounts."" However, we could find no news account prior to McCain's statement that said casualties in May were a new low for the war.
 
It's possible that when McCain said ""casualties"" he was referring to war-related deaths of Iraqis, another common measure of how the war is going. He may have seen one of the many

news reports

that said Iraqi deaths were down sharply in May. But as far as we could find, no news organization or independent group reported that the number of Iraqi deaths in May was a record low for the war.

Iraq Coalition Casualty Count's total

was 506, which exceeded the number of Iraqi deaths in both March and April of 2005 (the site does not have monthly statistics prior to 2005). No U.S. government agency tracks Iraqi deaths, Melnyk said.
 
So by any reasonable measure, McCain was wrong to say casualties were at their lowest point since the beginning of the war. But he was right to make that claim about U.S. military deaths. We rate his claim Half True.

"['Criminal Justice', 'State Budget', 'Missouri', 'Nicole Galloway']","
Galloway’s watchdog-bragging claim is mostly on point
","When Mike Parson announced his bid to stay in the governor’s seat, Auditor Nicole Galloway had been officially in the running for almost a month. Galloway cited her accomplishments in her Aug. 12 video candidacy announcement: ""I’m a CPA and a Certified Fraud Examiner. It’s my job to be an independent watchdog for taxpayers. To shine a light on government waste, and I found lots of it. Uncovering $350 million in waste and fraud; it led to 40 criminal charges against both Republicans and Democrats."" Sounds like a lot. We decided to take a closer look at the Democrat’s statement that her office has uncovered $350 million in ""waste and fraud"" and that the discoveries resulted in 40 criminal counts against officials on both sides of the aisle. When we contacted Galloway’s campaign, a staff member cited the 2018 annual report produced by the auditor’s office. That report is compiled from a running list of audits conducted across the state. The $350 million figure showed up in the report, as did 38 of the alleged criminal counts brought as a result of Galloway’s audits. The campaign showed in news releases additional counts brought after the annual report. Her office’s press secretary, Steph Deidrick, provided a year-by-year breakdown. It adds up to $356 million from May 2015 to the end of 2018. Deidrick also provided a chart the office uses to track the number of criminal counts brought as a result of audit findings. The chart listed 19 individuals and tallied up the criminal counts brought against each person; Galloway’s office identified a total of 45 criminal counts, including those filed after the 2018 report. There are 551 audit reports available on the auditor’s website from Galloway’s first full month as auditor in May 2015 to the end of 2018. These reports were used to calculate the total ""waste and fraud"" Galloway said her office uncovered. We spot-checked individual reports. We also turned to industry professionals to help us understand the terminology. Sarah Hofmann, spokeswoman of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, explained that within the industry, fraud is a legal term that encompasses deliberate acts that aim to deprive someone of ""property or money by guile, deception or other unfair means."" Boone County Auditor June Pitchford emphasized that fraud ""generally has an element of illegality"" or deception, while waste can simply be the result of poor management or a lack of due diligence. For this reason, Hofmann said the distinction Galloway made in her claim that the $350 million was a total of waste and fraud was important. Hofmann said government organizations, in particular, often have ""redundancies, or just places that they’re losing money."" One example of the fraudulent behavior Galloway uncovered comes from the 2017 audit of Putnam County Memorial Hospital, which uncovered about $92 million in fraudulent lab billing practices. Galloway said the hospital was essentially a shell company. Hofmann said that shell companies are common examples of fraud known as ""asset misappropriation,"" meaning this $92 million billing scheme would be part of Galloway’s total. Galloway’s claim that her audits have led to 40 criminal counts against Republicans and Democrats ultimately holds up, though it lacks some important context. We used Missouri Casenet, a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Missouri, a PDF of charges filed and media accounts to look into the criminal counts brought against the people Galloway indicated in her total. Our research determined that a total of 52 criminal counts were brought against 19 people as a result of audits from Galloway’s office. Receiving stolen property was the most common criminal charge, with 37 counts. The other charges varied, but included counts of forgery, violations of ethics rules by elected officials and stealing of various amounts. To check the claim that criminal counts were brought against Republicans and Democrats, we called the cities and counties whose officials faced criminal charges and asked if the offices they held are partisan. In most cases, the offices are nonpartisan. Of the 19 individuals charged, only four were elected officials who ran as a Republican or Democrat. Three of those charged were Democrats, and only one was a Republican. The other 15 individuals – or about 79 percent of those charged – were hired employees, nonpartisan appointees or held nonpartisan elected offices. Galloway said her office ""uncover(ed) $350 million in waste and fraud; it led to 40 criminal charges against both Republicans and Democrats."" Knowledgeable professionals agree that Auditor Galloway uncovers ""waste and fraud,"" and individual examples of what Galloway has uncovered in her years as auditor indicate the $350 million total is reasonable. Galloway’s audits have resulted in over 50 criminal charges, making her claim of 40 criminal counts accurate. However, while the last part of the claim is technically true – charges have been brought against three Democrats and one Republican official – only four of the 19 individuals charged held partisan offices. For this reason, her claim lacks important context.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A42EC40>],/factchecks/2019/sep/20/nicole-galloway/galloways-watchdog-bragging-claim-mostly-point/
"['Elections', 'Voter ID Laws', 'Wisconsin', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton way off, again, on Wisconsin voter ID
","Hillary Clinton just can’t quit Wisconsin. Or, more specifically, can’t quit blaming its voting system for her 2016 electoral defeat. The former Democratic presidential candidate has repeatedly criticized the state’s voter ID law, which was in place for the first time in the election that pitted Clinton against Republican Donald Trump. And she’s repeatedly found herself at odds with the facts. In May 2017, Clinton claimed that 200,000 Wisconsinites ""were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote."" We rated that Mostly False. In March 2019, she then claimed that ""somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls (in 2016) because of the color of their skin"" and other factors. That was even farther from the truth and drew a Pants on Fire rating. Clinton returned to the topic again Sept. 17, 2019, in a speech at George Washington University. She listed reasons ""you can win the popular vote and you can lose the Electoral College,"" starting with what she called voter suppression. ""Experts estimate that anywhere from 27,000 to 200,000 Wisconsin citizen voters, predominantly in Milwaukee, were turned away from the polls,"" Clinton said. ""That’s a lot of potential voters. They showed up, but maybe they didn’t have the correct form of identification. Maybe the name on their driver’s license included a middle name or an initial that wasn’t on their voter registration. But officials made every excuse in the book to prevent certain people from voting in that election."" That’s a lot of people to be ""turned away"" from polling places. So let’s recap this. Again. Spoiler alert: Clinton’s numbers still aren’t anywhere close to accurate. Clinton’s team didn’t respond to our request for evidence, but the vastly different numbers she cites — 27,000 and 200,000 — roughly reflect two analyses that examined voter ID impact in the 2016 election. Even the low end of that range, if true, could have made a huge difference. Clinton lost Wisconsin by about 22,000 votes out of about 2.8 million cast. Wisconsin flipped to the Republican side — a key reason Trump won the election. A May 2017 report commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama, looked at changes in voter turnout and connected them to changes in voter ID law. They said turnout increased by 1.3% from 2012 to 2016 in states with no change to voter ID laws, but dropped in Wisconsin by 3.3%. If Wisconsin’s turnout had instead risen by 1.3%, Priorities USA estimated that would generate 200,000 more votes. The analysis called these the ""theoretical 200,000 lost voters."" But that’s very different than tallying specific people ""turned away"" from the polls, as Clinton claimed. In any case, the 200,000 has its own problems. Experts we’ve quoted in past fact checks said it’s not reasonable to attribute all the changes in turnout to the voter ID law when general enthusiasm — including for Clinton’s candidacy — and other factors doubtless played a role. The University of Wisconsin conducted a study that could be what Clinton relied on for the low end of the range. It involved a survey of 293 registered voters who didn’t vote in Dane and Milwaukee counties in the 2016 election. The study estimated a total 12,000 registrants were affected by the ID requirement in those two counties. But its findings don’t at all match how Clinton phrased her claim, according to the author. ""Our measure captures people who both say they were turned away but also people who didn’t even bother because they didn’t think they could vote,"" Kenneth R. Mayer, a professor of American Politics at UW told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Our estimate is that it’s plausible to think that the voter ID law reduced overall turnout somewhere in the range of 1% in these counties, but that doesn’t get you anywhere close to (Clinton’s) numbers.""  A news release announcing the study also noted most of the respondents who said they did not vote because they lacked ID ""actually possessed a qualifying form of ID."" That makes it even more ridiculous to group those people into the ""turned away"" category as Clinton did, since they would not in fact have been turned away based on ID if they went to the polls. Mayer said he saw anecdotal reports of people being turned away, and the UW study asked people if that happened to them. The study reported 1.4% of those surveyed said they were told at a polling place their ID was inadequate. That would be four out of the 293. ""It was small enough that we regarded it as not material to the overall conclusion,"" Mayer said. Firmer numbers are hard to come by. The Wisconsin Elections Commission reported 821 ID-related provisional ballots were cast statewide in the 2016 election. Those are people who showed up without proper ID but cast a vote anyhow. If the person follows up to provide the correct ID by the Friday following the election, the ballot then counts. Not everyone who showed up without ID would cast such a ballot, of course. But it’s one measure of how often ID issues surfaced at the polls. Mayer said we simply don’t know how many people were turned away. But he said Clinton’s number isn’t realistic. ""There is no possibility that (200,000) happened, because that would have been on the order of 60 people per polling place,"" he said, referencing the state’s roughly 3,500 polling locations. Will Flanders, research director at the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, has criticized the UW survey for having a small sample size and focusing only on Democratic strongholds, among other elements. He said that makes Clinton’s exaggeration of the study’s findings even more extreme. ""Given the problematic nature of that (UW) estimate, estimates that are larger than that are even more out of the realm of reasonable possibility,"" Flanders told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Clinton said between 27,000 and 200,000 Wisconsinites were ""turned away"" from the polls in 2016 due to lack of proper identification. But studies examining voter ID here say nothing of the sort. They looked broadly at how voter turnout changed — which includes the far larger number who simply stayed away. Experts say there is no reliable number for how many were physically turned away, but the existing work leaves no doubt it’s far short of the range cited by Clinton. This is the third time we have rated claims from Clinton on the Wisconsin turnout. She’s no closer on this one than the last one. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097459E00>],/factchecks/2019/sep/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrong-again-wisconsin-voter-id/

Trump retweets false claim that Ilhan Omar partied on 9/11 anniversary
","  President Donald Trump retweeted a post that falsely claimed U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was out partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.  The allegation came via a video posted by conservative comedian Terrence Williams, who falsely declared that Omar ""partied on the anniversary of 9/11.""  In his video, Williams weighed in on footage of Omar dancing in a crowd to the song ""Truth Hurts"" by Lizzo. But the tape of Omar dancing wasn’t filmed on Sept. 11.  It actually came from an event hosted two days later, on Sept. 13, by Omar and four other first-term congresswomen who are members of the Congressional Black Caucus.  The footage of Omar dancing was first posted to Twitter on the night of the event by Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a political action committee. ""Can someone name something better than @IlhanMN dancing to @lizzo?"" Green wrote. ""Because I can’t think of anything.""  Can someone name something better than @IlhanMN dancing to @lizzo?

Three days after the event, on Sept. 16, Williams uploaded his own video in a tweet that claimed Omar, a Muslim, ""partied on the anniversary of 9/11."" ""What in the world were you celebrating on the anniversary of 9/11?"" Williams said in the video, which showed the recording of Omar, according to FactCheck.org. ""You were seriously partying on the anniversary of 9/11?

IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party! https://t.co/aQFEygSa4D Omar responded roughly two hours later.  ""This is from a CBC event we hosted this weekend to celebrate black women in Congress,"" she wrote. ""The president of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk. What is Twitter doing to combat this misinformation?""  This is from a CBC event we hosted this weekend to celebrate black women in Congress.The President of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk.What is Twitter doing to combat this misinformation? https://t.co/XdkRVrU7mZ Williams’ claim was quickly debunked by journalists and fact-checkers, and Omar tweeted a few more times about Trump spreading it. She also retweeted a petition from Green’s political action committee urging Twitter to suspend Trump’s account until he removes his tweet. The video has since been removed from Williams’ Twitter and Facebook accounts. But Williams, who did not respond to a request for comment, doubled down on his criticisms of Omar, calling in a series of tweets for her to be impeached for labeling Trump a racist. (Members of Congress can be expelled by their respective chamber, but they cannot be impeached.)  For his part, Trump tweeted about Williams twice more the same morning he shared the attack on Omar. In August, he also retweeted a video in which Williams suggested without evidence that Bill and Hillary Clinton were behind the death of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.    Trump has spread falsehoods related to Omar before, wrongly claiming in July that she was ""speaking about how wonderful al-Qaeda is."" Omar drew criticism from some quarters in March for saying ""some people did something"" in reference to the attacks on the World Trade Center. The Trump campaign declined to comment.

Illinois population loss is Wisconsin's gain
","Since when did Wisconsin become a magnet for residents from its neighbors to the south? According to Mark J. Perry, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, Wisconsin’s economy and strong job market are driving people from Illinois to move here. ""Wisconsin is currently seeing an influx of new residents, Illinois is seeing an outflux,"" Perry said on 1130 WISN’s Jay Weber Show on June 28, 2019, suggesting it’s because of Wisconsin’s low unemployment rate and job openings. Perry’s claim comes from a study he conducted for the Badger Institute, a conservative think tank, titled ""Leaving Illinois for Wisconsin: An analysis of the accelerating outbound migration across the border to the Badger State.""  We’ve seen the Cubs gear at Miller Park, but figured most of those fans were just visiting.  How many Illinoisians are trading the Land of Lincoln for the Badger State?  And does his claim account for Wisconsinites who are moving south of the border?  We decided to take a look. How the study was conducted To conduct the study, Perry used numbers from the Census Bureau’s annual reports of  inbound and outbound migration for each state.  ""All of that is publicly available data and information that I just got from various government sources,"" Perry told PolitiFact Wisconsin.  The Wisconsin/Illinois study was part of a wider study Perry conducted on nationwide migration patterns. To find data for the state-to-state migration flows, the Census Bureau asks respondents about everyone age 1 year and over and whether they lived in the same residence a year ago. If the person lived somewhere else, they are asked to say where they moved from.  In 2017, when all migration is considered, Wisconsin had 112,519 move in and 113,492 move out, a net loss of less than 1,000 people. (Of course, there are other factors in overall population changes -- births and deaths). Looking strictly at migration changes, Wisconsin’s net outflow of 973 people in 2017 puts the state  around the middle of the pack. All told, there were 21 states that lost more people to migration that year.  Florida saw the biggest boost via net migration, adding 118,890, while New York took the biggest hit with 167,328 more leaving than coming. Wisconsin vs. Illinois The picture changes for Wisconsin when you look strictly at Illinois -- there a big gap emerges. According to the Census Bureau’s most recent data from 2017, Illinois had a population of almost 12.7 million, compared to Wisconsin’s 5.7 million. In 2017, 26,963 people moved from Illinois to Wisconsin, according to the census bureau’s migration data. Meanwhile, 12,274 moved from Wisconsin to Illinois. That means Wisconsin picked up a net 14,689 people from Illinois in 2017 alone. (To be sure, there are a lot more people in Illinois who may be on the move. The state has more than twice the population of Wisconsin.) That means 297,812 people left Illinois for Wisconsin between 2006 to 2017 and 181,419 left Wisconsin for Illinois in the same time period. That leaves a net flow of 116,393, which matches Perry’s study. And his claim. Researching the process We also asked researchers who have worked on similar migration studies how they go about conducting a study using these kind of numbers. Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the CATO Institute, who conducted his own study on interstate migration, used census numbers and Internal Revenue Service numbers for the process. For Perry’s study, Edwards said the question should remain in whether Wisconsin is really as strong of a location in attracting business when it also has a steady outflow. ""The data is accurate,"" Edwards said. ""The flows are accurate. The debate really is why people are moving."" Our rating Perry claimed ""Wisconsin is currently seeing an influx of new residents, Illinois is seeing an outflux."" He indicated he was speaking about the flow between the two states, with Wisconsin picking up a net 116,000 residents from Illinois between 2006 and 2017. But a caveat is in order: Listeners could be left with the idea Wisconsin is booming in this regard. In reality, when all states and locations are taken in, Wisconsin ranks in the middle of the pack, based on the most recent numbers, from 2017. Our definition for Mostly True is ""The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000002809781B840>],/factchecks/2019/sep/19/mark-perry/illinois-population-loss-wisconsins-gain/

Did Elizabeth Warren get $400,000 for teaching one class at Harvard?
","Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has vowed to tackle the college affordability crisis if elected president by forgiving student loan debts and making tuition-free college a reality. But a misleading image circulating social media seems to suggest that Warren is partially responsible for the soaring college prices she’s pledging to trim down. The image, which we found online and on Twitter and Facebook, shows a quote attributed to Katie Pavlich, editor of Townhall.com, a conservative news website.  The quote reads: ""As Elizabeth Warren closes the night with complaints about cost of college for students, just remember she was paid $400,000 to teach one class."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We traced the quote back to Pavlich, who tweeted it on July 30 during the Democratic primary debates in Detroit. But we wondered whether the substance of her claim was accurate.  As Elizabeth Warren closes the night with complaints about cost of college for students, just remember she was paid $400,000 to teach one class. In short, we found that Warren did make more than $400,000 for her work at Harvard Law School over a two-year span. But it’s wrong to suggest that all she did was teach one class, and the claim leaves out important context about the other work Warren was doing at that time. Pavlich did not respond to a request for comment, but a quick Google search turned up a handful of news reports from 2012 detailing the financial disclosure forms Warren released as part of her first bid for the Senate in Massachusetts. According to those filings, Warren earned $429,981 in salary from Harvard during 2010 and 2011. She also made money from book royalties and consulting fees. Warren spent roughly two decades lecturing at Harvard Law School, where students recognized her with multiple teaching awards, according to the university’s faculty directory. She taught commercial law as a visiting professor for a year before accepting a tenured position in 1995. Generally speaking, university professors — especially at major research institutions like Harvard — are hired not only to teach, but also to do research and be campus leaders.  In fact, a 2017 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that, for university professors, ""salaries are determined principally by research output and associated reputation,"" rather than the number of students the professor teaches. Harvard Law School declined to comment, but the university pays professors more than most research universities, with the average salary for full-time professors being $226,394 in 2017, $203,699 in 2011 and $194,136 in 2010, per the Chronicle of Higher Education. Recent tax filings show that Warren’s husband, also a Harvard law professor, earned $402,897 in 2018. According to an archived version of Harvard Law School’s course catalog, Warren taught one class on empirical analysis during the 2010 spring semester, and local and university news reports indicate that she also taught another class on contracts during the 2011 fall semester.  In September 2010, former President Barack Obama tapped Warren to temporarily oversee the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency set up in the wake of the financial crisis to protect consumers from financial tricks.  Warren left Harvard to fill this role and did not return to campus until July 2011, meaning she was unavailable to teach during the 2010 fall and 2011 spring semesters.  In a statement to PolitiFact, the Warren campaign noted how Warren taught multiple classes during most other semesters. For example, she taught four classes during the 2006-07 academic year, three in 2007-08, and three in 2008-09.  But even if Warren taught fewer classes than usual in 2010 and 2011, saying she ""was paid $400,000 to teach one class"" discounts the research she produced that year and in years previous. In 2010, for example, she contributed a chapter to a book on government regulation. It also ignores the fact that Warren stepped aside from teaching for the entire 2010-11 academic year to advise the Obama administration as an expert on bankruptcy. A viral image said Warren ""was paid $400,000 to teach one class."" Warren earned more than $400,000 for her work as a Harvard Law School professor in 2010 and 2011. Across those two years, she taught two classes, not one. She also left Harvard during the 2010-2011 academic year to advise the government. Plus, her $400,000 salary would have reflected not only her work in the classroom, but also her reputation, her contributions to Harvard as a researcher and her many years at the university.

Biden says Obama ended workplace raids of immigrants. That's Half True
","Joe Biden has responded to criticism of immigration policies enacted during his time as vice president by attacking President Donald Trump’s record, claiming that Trump’s polarizing strategies did not happen when Biden was second-in-command. During the Sept. 12 Democratic presidential debate, Biden said the Obama administration ""didn't lock people up in cages."" We rated that False. Biden that night also tweeted: ""The Obama-Biden Administration did not conduct workplace raids — in fact, it ended them."" (Immigration agents last month detained nearly 700 immigrants at seven chicken processing plants in Mississippi.) The Obama-Biden Administration did not conduct workplace raids—in fact, it ended them. #DemDebate Is it true that Barack Obama’s administration did not carry out workplace raids, but rather ended them? Biden is partially correct.  Obama ended the large-scale arrests of immigrants at their workplaces, prioritizing instead the prosecutions of employers who hired unauthorized workers. But some immigrants were still arrested when agents showed up to workplaces to execute search warrant against employers. Immigration law prohibits employers from knowingly hiring people who are not legally authorized to work. Employers are required to verify employees’ identities and work eligibility, and to complete and retain related verification forms known as I-9. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, enforces provisions of the law through ""worksite enforcement"" operations. ""Raid"" is the colloquial word used when ICE arrests a large number of people at a workplace or elsewhere. During President George W. Bush’s second term in office, ICE agents arrested hundreds of immigrants at a time, often in factories and meat processing plants. One of the most high-profile raids happened in 2008 at a meatpacking plant in Iowa, when agents descended in helicopters and arrested nearly 400 workers. In April 2009, about three months into Obama’s first term, ICE announced a new focus on the criminal prosecution of employers who knowingly hired workers illegally in the country. Arresting and removing workers alone was insufficient, an ICE memo said, and focusing on employers would target the root causes of illegal immigration. The agency also said it would continue to arrest and deport unauthorized workers encountered during operations. Instead of conducting massive raids at worksites, ICE under Obama focused on audits of employers’ I-9 forms to determine if they complied with immigration law. ICE followed-up some cases with onsite law enforcement. Media reports in 2010 and 2011 said the ICE audits became known as ""silent raids,"" often leading to employees being fired once their employers were notified by ICE of irregularities on the I-9 forms. (ICE gives employers time to correct any errors on the forms.) Government data on worksite enforcement operations shows that the number of individuals arrested on immigration law violation charges declined after Obama took office. ICE spokesman Paul Prince told PolitiFact that the arrest data didn’t exclusively mean that that many people were arrested on site, though it could be the case in some instances. (For instance, someone might have been arrested elsewhere, but stemming from the findings of the workplace investigation.) A June 2015 report from the Congressional Research Service said that it was unclear why there was an overall decrease from 2008 to 2014 in worksite arrests for immigration charges and criminal charges, ""but they may reflect, to some degree, ICE’s stated renewed focus on employers."" Given the data on immigrants arrested in worksite enforcement operations, Biden is wrong to claim that there were zero ""workplace raids,"" said Rey Koslowski, an expert on immigration and associate professor at the University at Albany, State University of New York. But Biden is correct in that the Obama administration ended the Bush administration’s practice of maximizing the number of employees arrested during workplace raids, often in the hundreds at a time, while failing to prosecute many of their employers, Koslowski said. The Obama administration shifted to targeting employers (though unauthorized workers present during operations were also arrested), he said. After the August arrests of nearly 700 people in Mississippi, John Sandweg, a former ICE acting director during the Obama administration, told NPR that during their ""employer-centric focus,"" they ""were not going to waste resources apprehending people who are showing up for work unless those individuals had ... some indication that they posed a public safety threat."" Prince, the ICE spokesman, said that ICE’s strategy ""continues to focus on the criminal prosecution of employers who knowingly break the law and on the use of I-9 audits and civil fines to encourage compliance with the law."" Biden said, ""The Obama-Biden Administration did not conduct workplace raids—in fact, it ended them."" The Obama administration ended the practice of large-scale raids in which hundreds of immigrants were arrested at a time. Obama prioritized the prosecution of employers who knowingly hired unauthorized workers. This was done through increased audits of I-9 forms. But that doesn’t mean there were no onsite operations. In some cases, workers were arrested when ICE agents executed search warrants. Biden’s claim is partially accurate.

Does Beto O'Rourke's 'criminal record' mean he can't buy a gun?
","Democrat Beto O’Rourke doubled down on his pitch to institute a mandatory gun buyback program for assault-style weapons during the third debate of the presidential primary in Houston. ""Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,"" O’Rourke said at the debate. "" We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore."" His comments were met with boisterous applause from the audience at Texas Southern University and he was on the receiving end of a threatening remark from a state lawmaker in Texas. They also sparked a questionable Facebook post, shared the day after the debate. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post included a popular meme that is derived from stills of Drake’s 2015 music video for ""Hotline Bling."" The meme traditionally features two images of the singer and corresponding text generated by the poster. The idea is to make it appear as though Drake is shunning the first phrase, but welcoming the second. In the post in question, the first phrase is: ""Beto O’Rourke wants to confiscate the guns because he’s a liberal."" The second, which Drake seems to signal his approval of, reads: ""Beto O’Rourke wants to confiscate guns because he can’t buy one himself due to his criminal record."" The text of the post says: ""That burglary and DWI will get you every time."" We’ve looked at O’Rourke’s arrest record in the past, but is he ineligible to purchase a gun, as the post suggests? Both DWI, burglary arrests were dismissed O’Rourke was arrested twice in the 1990s — for, what he describes as, jumping a fence on the campus at the University of Texas at El Paso and for driving while intoxicated. He was first arrested in May 1995 on the UTEP campus for attempted forcible entry, according to a copy of the police report provided by O’Rourke’s campaign in 2018. The charge fell under the burglary portion of the state penal code, section 30.02. O’Rourke told the El Paso Times in 2005 that UTEP ""decided not to press charges"" and a LexisNexis background check of O’Rourke shows that the Class B misdemeanor was dismissed. In September 1998, O’Rourke was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated in Anthony, a small town outside El Paso. A witness told police officers that they observed O’Rourke driving at a high speed before losing control of his car and striking a truck, according to a police report of the incident. O’Rourke then attempted to drive away, but the witness stopped him, according to the report. Law enforcement arrived and arrested O’Rourke, recording that he scored a 0.136 and 0.134 on a breathalyzer test, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. O’Rourke was charged with a misdemeanor DWI, but the charge was dismissed after he completed a misdemeanor diversion program in 1999. In summary: O’Rourke was arrested for two separate misdemeanors in the 1990s, including one for a DWI. Both cases were dismissed. O’Rourke could purchase a gun There is no requirement for a person to have a permit or license to purchase rifles and shotguns or handguns in Texas, O’Rourke’s home state. As long as a purchaser is older than 18 and, in certain cases, passes a background check, the person can legally purchase a firearm without a permit. (A permit is required to carry a handgun in public.) Licensed-gun dealers are required by federal law to conduct a background check for an individual seeking to purchase a gun if that person does not have a license to carry. But private sellers do not have the same requirement. Federal and state laws in Texas prevent a person from purchasing and possessing a gun if they have previously been convicted of a felony or convicted of certain misdemeanors related to domestic assault. Certain people with a history of mental illness are also barred from purchasing a gun. O’Rourke would be able to purchase a gun, since he was not convicted of burglary or of driving while intoxicated — both charges were dismissed. Even if he had been convicted, neither charge would prevent him from legally purchasing and possessing a firearm today, since they were both misdemeanor offenses unrelated to domestic violence and were resolved more than five years ago. O’Rourke could also obtain a gun license Misdemeanor DWI offenses play a more significant role when it comes to obtaining a license to carry in Texas. State law allows for people, not including those in the prohibited categories outlined above, to possess a handgun in their home or in their car without a license to carry. People can also carry rifles and shotguns in public without a permit. In order to purchase a gun without a background check and to carry a handgun in public, a person must obtain a license to carry from the state. Requirements for obtaining such a license are more stringent than those for simply purchasing a gun. Most important in O’Rourke’s case is a requirement that a person is not currently facing charges for ""a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense"" and a requirement that an individual ""has not, in the five years preceding the date of application, been convicted of a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense."" The law also states that a person is not eligible to receive a license to carry if the person has been ""convicted two times within the 10-year period preceding the date on which the person applies for a license of an offense of the grade of Class B misdemeanor or greater that involves the use of alcohol or a controlled substance as a statutory element of the offense."" O’Rourke was arrested on a burglary charge in 1995, a misdemeanor offense that was dismissed. He was arrested for DWI in 1998, a misdemeanor offense that also was dismissed after he completed a diversion program. Neither arrest, taken separately or together, would prevent him from obtaining a license to carry a gun under Texas law. ""He has no convictions on his record, so there is zero collateral consequence, vis-à-vis his ability to get a gun license,"" said Steve Toland, an Austin-based defense attorney who handles DWI cases. The Texas Department of Public Safety, which administers the licensing program, lists answers to frequently asked questions on its website, including one about how dismissed charges affect eligibility. ""If charges were dismissed without prosecution, then they are not disqualifying,"" the post reads. If O’Rourke’s misdemeanor DWI had not been dismissed and he had been convicted, he would still be eligible to apply for a gun license today, since more than five years have passed. Had O’Rourke applied for a license after his arrests, when the charges were still pending, he would not have been eligible for a gun license. But since he was not convicted of either charge, he would have been eligible for a license once his cases had been dismissed. Our Ruling A Facebook post circulating after the Democratic debate said that O’Rourke can’t buy a gun ""due to his criminal record."" O’Rourke was arrested for two misdemeanors in the 1990s — for burglary and DWI. Both cases were dismissed and he was not convicted of either charge. O'Rourke could have passed a gun-purchase background check and obtained a license to carry once the charges were dismissed. Even if he had been convicted of these charges, he still could purchase a gun today. We rate this claim False.

Barrett overshoots on claim about Milwaukee tax rates
","Citing stagnant revenue from the state and an increasing financial pinch, Milwaukee-area leaders are pushing the state to sign off on a 1% county sales tax. The move, which could bring in as much as $160 million per year, would raise the sales tax in Milwaukee County to 6.5%. Officials want to introduce a binding referendum allowing residents to decide on the tax increase themselves, but in Wisconsin the Republican-controlled Legislature must also sign off on the plan. So people like Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, must make the case to both voters and political opponents why this tax hike is needed. Here is what he said in doing so on WISN-TV’s ""UpFront."" ""In many, many other states, you’ve got different treatment for the largest metropolitan area,"" Barrett said in his Sept. 15, 2019 appearance. ""We are, the last time I checked, the only city in this country with a population of over 400,000 that doesn’t have either a sales tax or a local income tax. We are just hamstrung because of the rules of the state."" So Barrett is making the general case that Milwaukee has less flexibility than its peers, while specifically claiming no other city of its size gets by without a local tax of some kind. We’ll examine both of those. The first element of Barrett’s claim is that Milwaukee doesn’t have the same options for raising tax revenue as other large cities. For more than a century, Wisconsin has used state income and sales taxes to provide aid — called shared revenue — to local governments, while generally not allowing local governments to levy those taxes themselves, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, a nonpartisan research group. The main exception is a half-cent ""piggyback"" sales tax counties are allowed to levy on the same items taxed by the state. Other exceptions include stadium districts. The current sales tax throughout Milwaukee County is 5.6%, which includes a 5% state sales tax, a 0.5% county sales tax (since 1991) and a 0.1% stadium tax for Miller Park (since 1996). The stadium tax is expected to end by next year. Many other states don’t have such an oversight requirement, giving local government the freedom to make independent decisions on tax increases. Some examples: In Hillsborough County, Florida, which includes Tampa, voters passed two referendums in late 2018 that raised sales taxes by 1.5 cents on the dollar for transportation and schools. The Albuquerque City Council voted in 2018 to impose a three-eighths cent tax, raising about $52 million per year. The large Hennepin and Ramsey counties around the Twin Cities voted to levy a half-cent sales tax for transportation in 2017, raising about $100 million annually between the two counties. But not all states have such a system. The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation, reports 37 states allow local governments to impose their own general sales taxes. Wisconsin is tricky to categorize.  Counties may choose to adopt the 0.5% county sales tax, but not all of them do. The state Department of Revenue reports Manitowoc, Menominee, Outagamie, Racine, Waukesha and Winnebago counties have no county sales tax. The Tax Policy Center lists Wisconsin among the states that allow local sales taxes. But a  2017 report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum (then the Public Policy Forum) listed Wisconsin among the states with no local sales tax power, since only counties have that ability and it’s capped at 0.5%. That policy forum report noted this has caused increasing problems in Milwaukee: ""Wisconsin’s strong state aid historically has compensated for the lack of local revenue diversity. However, cutbacks in shared revenue have diminished this program’s purchasing power and required Milwaukee to lean heavily on increased property taxes and fees to offset the impact."" A 2019 policy forum report said stagnant shared revenue combined with state caps on property taxes has led to mounting questions about ""whether local officials can sustain appropriate service levels in areas such as public safety, streets, libraries and parks."" This brings us to Barrett’s more specific claim — that Milwaukee is the only city of 400,000 or more in the nation without a local sales or income tax. The 2017 report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum compared Milwaukee to 38 peer cities around the country. They reported 30 of those cities had a general local sales tax, and the remaining eight each drew revenue from a ""selective sales taxes and/or other forms of taxation besides the property tax."" That report excluded cities like Indianapolis and Boston from the comparison since they have different funding mechanisms than Milwaukee. Indianapolis performs some typical county functions, and Boston has school district funds pass through its budget. We asked Barrett’s office for details on where his claim originated, and they forwarded us to Jeff Fleming, a spokesman for the Milwaukee Department of City Development. He said Barrett’s claim was based on that policy forum report. But Barrett referred to cities by size, not to the limited peer group in the study. And that makes a difference. Boston has a population well over 400,000 and does not have a local sales tax or income tax, according to an August 2019 report from the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning. We’ll assume Barrett was referring to cities that don’t levy their own local sales tax, since otherwise Milwaukee wouldn’t meet his criteria given that city residents are subject to the county’s local sales tax. And in that case other cities join Boston on the list of exceptions to Barrett’s claim. Indianapolis does not levy its own sales or income tax, but Marion County imposes a local income tax there, according to the Tax Foundation. And Portland, Oregon, has no city-issued sales or income tax, but residents there pay an income tax to a regional transportation district. Barrett said Milwaukee faces unusual taxing challenges and is ""the only city in this country with a population of over 400,000 that does not have a sales tax or local income tax."" Barrett is essentially on target with the general claim that Milwaukee is in the minority nationally. Wisconsin is one of about a dozen states that authorizes cities to assess only property taxes — not sales or income taxes. But his core statistical claim is wrong. Several other cities larger than 400,000 do not impose their own sales or income tax. We define Half True this way: ""The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000002809703A400>],/factchecks/2019/sep/18/tom-barrett/barrett-overshoots-claim-about-milwaukee-tax-rates/

Tim Hugo misstates Dan Helmer's position on private health insurance
","Tim Hugo, the last-standing Republican state delegate in Northern Virginia, is telling voters that Democratic challenger Dan Helmer wants to abolish private health insurance. Hugo has made the claim in at least four campaign mailings in the 40th House District, which spans portions of Fairfax and Prince William Counties. Here’s a sampling: ""While my opponent believes in abolishing our health care system entirely and replacing it with a plan that will cost taxpayers trillions of dollars, I believe we can make improvements to our current system while protecting private insurance,"" Hugo wrote in a Sept. 10 letter. ""Dan Helmer wants to END PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"" Hugo says in big brown letters on a glossy mailer. ""Dan Helmer supports abolishing our private health care insurance and creating a massive government-run system,"" says another mailer with a caricature of a shrunken Helmer behind a podium. ""Now, (Helmer) wants to completely abolish our private health care system and replace it with a big, expensive government-controlled system that taxpayers like us will have to pay,"" Hugo says in another mailer that calls Helmer ""extremist."" A website run by the fundraising Friends of Tim Hugo says, ""Dan supports a (medical insurance) plan that would cost taxpayers trillions of dollars. And if that’s not bad enough, Dan’s plan would also take away people’s private insurance."" We fact-checked Hugo’s repeated claim. Hugo, in one of his mailers, says his source is a May 2018 ad by Helmer when he ran unsuccessfully for Democratic nomination for 10th Congressional District seat. Helmer finished fourth in a six-person primary won by Jennifer Wexton, who went on to win the general election. ""I’m for a Medicare-for-All option,"" Helmer says in the ad. The bottom of the screen says ""DAN HELMER MEDICARE FOR ALL."" Unlike the audio, the word ""option"" is missing. GOP strategist Garren Shipley sent us an email for Hugo’s campaign, saying a ""Medicare-for-All option"" is equivalent to abolishing private insurance. Let’s define the terms: Medicare  Medicare is a national health insurance program that covers Americans 65 or older and a few other groups with disabilities or specific diseases. In 2018, it provided health coverage for 59.9 million people, about 52 million them senior citizens. Medicare for All Medicare for All would replace the current health insurance system with a single, government-run program that would cover  all Americans. Employers would be barred from offering competing insurance. Medicare for All is a signature issue in the presidential race of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. He’s proposed a generous plan that would cover hospital visits, primary care, medical devices, lab services, maternity care, prescriptions as well as vision and dental care. It would not subject consumers to any out-of-pocket costs, except a copay on prescriptions. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget has not estimated the cost of Sanders’ proposal or less-generous single-payer plans. The Mercatus Center, a libertarian research organization affiliated with George Mason University, estimates Sanders’ plan would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years and wouldn’t be paid for even if income and corporate taxes were doubled. The Urban Institute, a more liberal-leaning academic center in Washington, looked at Sanders’ plan in 2016 and predicted it would add $32 trillion over the decade. The Institute estimated that state and local governments would save $4.1 trillion over 10 years, and that households and businesses would see about $21.9 trillion in savings. Public option Public option plans would give middle and upper-income working adults a choice: They could remain privately insured, or buy into a new government-run program that would use the network of Medicare providers and costs.  There are at least four public options bills lingering in Congress, including one - called Medicare X -  cosponsored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. The CBO has not done cost analyses of the bills.  Supporters say Medicare X would at least break even because the bill requires that premiums ""cover the full actuarial cost of offering such a plan, including administrative costs."" A 2013 CBO study concluded a similar program would reduce federal deficits by $158 billion over 10 years. Helmer’s record Researching Helmer, we found eight instances where Helmer either said, or was reported to have said that he supported a Medicare-for-All  option. In contrast, we found only one instance where he more broadly stated Medicare-for-All (without option). That was in the print in the TV ad Hugo cites. And remember, at the same time those words appeared, Helmer was saying in the ad that he supported a public option. In addition to Helmer’s spoken words in the commercial, we found three articles in The Washington Post , one by ABC News, and one in The McLean Connection saying Helmer supported a Medicare-for-All option. Helmer wrote an op-ed in The Winchester Star pledging, ""I will fight to ensure every American has access to health care by supporting a Medicare-for-All option that allows any American who doesn’t have or doesn’t like their insurance to opt in to Medicare."" He made a nearly identical statement at a candidates forum.   Ballotpedia wrote in 2018,"" On his campaign website, Helmer listed gun safety, expanding the Affordable Care Act to include a Medicare for All option, and job creation as some of his policy priorities."" Hugo’s Justification How does Hugo turn Helmer’s repeated calls for health insurance options into a call for ending private medical insurance? By making a very literal argument. Shipley said there’s no such thing as a Medicare-for-All option - it’s a contradiction in terms. He said Medicare for All inherently means there’s a single insurance provider - the government - and there can be no option. Shipley noted that ""public option"" is the correct term for offering a choice between private or government-run health insurance, and Helmer never used those words. ""If Helmer supported a public option plan, he would have said he supported a public option, or ‘Medicare X,’ as proposed by Tim Kaine,"" Shipley said. ""But he didn’t. He said ‘Medicare for All.’"" Our ruling Hugo says Helmer wants to abolish private health insurance. Helmer repeatedly said in a 2018 campaign that he supports a ""Medicare-for -All option"" that ""allows Americans who doesn’t have or doesn’t like his insurance to opt into Medicare."" In other words, private insurance would continue to exist. But Helmer used imprecise language that Hugo exploits with a semantic argument. Since Medicare for All means the government would be the sole health insurance provider, Hugo says it can’t have a private insurance option. Ergo, Helmer wants to end private insurance, according to Hugo’s campaign. Had Helmer used the proper term - public option - Hugo’s logic would have evaporated. But his poor phrasing left him open to interpretation, and Hugo has taken the liberty to misleadingly create a position for Helmer. We rate Hugo’s statement Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809746AD80>],/factchecks/2019/sep/18/tim-hugo/tim-hugo-misstates-dan-helmers-position-private-he/

Report backs Blunt claim of $2 billion increase for trade deal with Mexico, Canada
","Congress reconvened in September to deliberate the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. The trade agreement, known as USMCA, has been a hot topic among farmers and politicians over the past year. In an Aug. 13 Facebook post, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt endorsed the agreement: ""U.S. agricultural & food exports are expected to increase more than $2 billion annually under #USMCA. This trade deal is a win for America’s farmers, ranchers, and businesses."" A spokesperson for Blunt said the number came from a report by the U.S. International Trade Commission, which says the agreement would increase ""exports by $2.2 billion (1.1 percent) when fully implemented."" Billions sounds like a lot. The 1.1%, not so much. We decided to look into this claim. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is a trade deal that would replace NAFTA. Mexico ratified the new agreement in June. In Canada, Parliament introduced the bill in May but has insisted on going through the ratification process in tandem with the U.S. The trick is this: The window for Canada’s ratification is getting smaller, as its federal election is Oct. 21. If the U.S. Congress does not move quickly enough and Canada doesn’t ratify before Sept. 15, it will have to reintroduce the agreement to the next Parliament. Meanwhile, House Democrats control the agreement’s fate in Congress. Some call the new deal NAFTA 2.0. One of the big changes to agriculture is dairy. Under the agreement, Canada would increase quotas on dairy and remove restrictions on cheese, said Jonathan Doh, professor at Villanova University School of Business. But there weren't any other major changes in the agriculture portion from the original NAFTA, according to Pat Westhoff, Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute director. The deal, if passed, would take effect early 2020. Missouri exports its agriculture all across the world, but the state’s top partners are Canada and Mexico. In 2017, Missouri’s top agriculture exports were corn and soybeans. Missouri corn ranked No. 6 and soybeans No. 8 in the U.S. in exports, according to state data from the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service. Dairy is not listed in the state’s top agricultural exports. ""It’s important to Missouri to have a strong trade agreement with those countries because about two-thirds of our exports from Missouri go to those two countries,"" said Eric Bohl, Missouri Farm Bureau director of public affairs and advocacy. ""Canada is our No. 1 export partner. Mexico is our No. 2 export partner."" Although Doh said the increase was significant, Westhoff said that the 1.1% projected increase is very marginal, in part because dairy is the only agriculture product with a major change. The United States International Trade Commission does not break down the numbers by state. Blunt said in a Facebook post, ""U.S. agricultural & food exports are expected to increase more than $2 billion annually under #USMCA."" The consensus is that the USMCA could increase trade exports by $2.2 billion annually, but that tells only part of the story. The increase is just 1.1% nationally, and probably less for Missouri because the state produces so little dairy. Still, this claim is correct, so we rate this statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976F6500>],/factchecks/2019/sep/17/roy-blunt/report-backs-blunt-claim-2-billion-increase-trade-/

NC Democrats not at 9/11 event during GOP budget vote
","North Carolina Republicans held a controversial vote on Sept. 11. Months earlier, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper had vetoed a GOP-authored state budget proposal. So, when Republican House Speaker Tim Moore noticed that many Democrats were absent that morning, he shocked political opponents by holding a vote to override Cooper’s veto. News of the vote spread across the internet like a bad game of telephone. Key details of the vote went missing, or were exaggerated. ""Republicans in North Carolina used a 9/11 memorial to trick Democrats into missing a key vote,"" the NowThis news service, which has 2.4 million Twitter followers, tweeted that day. The tweet was later shared by Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic U.S. senator from Massachusetts who’s running for president. She has 3.2 million followers. ""What happened today is beyond unacceptable. Calling a surprise vote on the budget — at the same time that many members were at 9/11 memorial services —is flat-out wrong,"" NC Rep. Chaz Beasley, a Mecklenburg County Democrat, tweeted. Beasley paraphrased reporting by WTVD. The Washington Post tweeted a misleading headline, too: ""North Carolina Republicans overrode a budget veto while Democrats were at a 9/11 ceremony."" While the News & Observer’s story and headline — NC House overrides budget veto in surprise vote with almost half of lawmakers absent — were accurate, the Raleigh-based newspaper posted a partly erroneous caption on Instagram: ""Most Democrats were absent for 9/11 ceremonies and were told there would be no vote during the morning session."" But these claims about the budget vote on Sept. 11 all get one thing wrong: Most Democrats weren’t at a 9/11 memorial service. PolitiFact NC, which has had a reporter covering the story since the Sept. 11 vote, found only one House Democrat who said he was at a 9/11 event. That Democrat is Rep. Garland Pierce, who said he attended a 9/11 memorial event in Raeford. No other Democrat has come forward — not after Speaker Moore slammed what he called ""fake news,"" and not after PolitiFact NC reached out to Rep. Darren Jackson, the House minority leader, to ask if other Democrats attended a 9/11 event. Schedule confusion Most Democrats skipped the Sept. 11 morning session because they believed it would be a non-voting session, Jackson said in a press conference last week. The budget was on the House calendar. But Jackson says Rep. David Lewis of Harnett County, a top Republican, told him there’d be no votes that morning. Lewis denies Jackson’s claim. He has acknowledged texting a WRAL reporter to tell her he thought there would be no votes during the Wednesday morning session. But Lewis claims he didn’t relay that prediction to legislators. Some corrections made Beasley, a Mecklenburg County Democrat who’s running for lieutenant governor, later corrected his claim. ""One correction: at least one member, Garland Pierce, was attending a 9/11 memorial service, as was the Governor. The article originally noted that some members were, but it has since been updated. I hate that this budget fight has distracted from the true focus of 9/11,"" he tweeted later, sharing the WTVD story that had been updated. The N&O corrected its Instagram post. The Washington Post also tweeted a clarification: ""An earlier version of this article overly generalized the reason for Democrats’ absence from the General Assembly session.

Don't be duped by bogus audit of charitable groups
","With the call out for donations to help Bahamians recover from Hurricane Dorian’s devastating hit, an old graphic showed up on Facebook again. It’s a table that purports to show the charities that are ""the good guys,"" and those that play people for suckers, paying lavish salaries to their CEOs and spending a puny percentage to actually help people. Among its key claims for good charities, it says the head of the Salvation Army makes only $13,000 a year, and the chief of Ronald McDonald Houses is paid nothing at all.  Among the credited purported bad guys, the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, better known as UNICEF, gets bad marks for paying its CEO $1.2 million, spending 14% of its money on programs, and giving its CEO a Rolls Royce to use. The March of Dimes is second on the list, paying its CEO $450,000 and putting just 10% into programs. This post, which was published on Facebook on Sept. 6, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Here’s the graphic:  This table appeared in 2015, and some of its numbers might have been more accurate then. But fast-forward to 2019 and, by and large, the charities it warns about make much better use of their charitable donations today than the chart suggests. And most of them don’t pay their CEOs as much as this claims. We focused on the organizations that were labeled as bad places for donations, as well as the claims of uncompensated CEOs. Let’s take those claims one by one. According to the post, the head of the Christian charity Salvation Army drew only $13,000 in annual compensation. It’s not clear whether this is supposed to refer to the international leader of the London-based organization, whose title is general of the Salvation Army, or the top executive of the U.S. branch. Either way, that figure looks to be off by a wide margin. The U.S. branch’s 2018 report identified the current top executive — known as the ""national commander"" — as David Hudson. The annual report did not disclose his salary. But a Better Business Bureau review of the charity from August 2018 said Hudson’s predecessor, David Jeffrey, earned an annual salary of $140,201 — well above what the post claimed. For tax purposes, the Salvation Army is akin to a church, and thus does not have to file a Form 990, the financial disclosure form that nonprofit organizations file annually with the Internal Revenue Service. We did not hear back when we reached out to the charity to ask about executive compensation.   As a percent of its total expenses, the Salvation Army spends 82% on charitable services, according to a 2017 Forbes profile of the organization. The social media post placed that percent higher, at 93%. The viral post is correct: The president and CEO of Ronald McDonald House Charities, Sheila Musolino, is uncompensated, according to its latest federal filing. The viral post’s depiction of the charity is a hair too high. It claims that $0.90 of every dollar spent goes towards helping the families of sick children. The organization’s 2017 annual report claims $0.87. A 2018 review by the group Charity Navigator puts the number closer to $0.86. This part of the claim is completely wrong: In 2017, UNICEF USA, the American branch of the global organization overseen by the United Nations, paid its president Caryl Stern $582,961, not $1.2 million as the meme claims. Even after adding in the value of other compensation, Stern makes $665,879, a bit over half of the number in the table. As for the amount that gets spent on actual programs, of the $598 million it raised in 2018, it spent over $490 million on programs. That’s 82%, or about six times higher than the 14% figure in the meme. Charity Navigator gave it a financial rating of 77.5. And about that Rolls Royce Stern allegedly has at her use? That’s a myth, debunked by Snopes two years ago. A mixed bag: The post undershoots on the CEO pay and is off by a factor of seven on the program side. The March of Dimes is all about making sure babies are born healthy. Out of its roughly $150 million yearly budget, it makes grants, supports research centers and produces a lot of educational materials for expecting mothers. According to its latest 990 filing, it paid its president Stacey Stewart a total of $534,000 in 2017. The viral post listed CEO pay at $495,000. But the post also said the March of Dimes only spent 10% on programming. The real number is at least 74% of contributions, based on the 990 filing. Charity Navigator gives it a financial rating of 62.14, and reports that 75% of all expenses went toward programs. The Facebook post falsely claims that the charitable organization United Way dedicates only 9% of its expenses to the needy. That’s far from the truth. Based on the organization’s 2017 annual report, the most conservative reading shows 79% of expenses went toward helping people. Forbes, put the figure around 86%, based on 2018 financial data. A Charity Navigator report from May 2019 rates the organization’s efficiency even higher, finding the charity sent nearly 94% percent of its total expenses to delivering programs and services.  As for executive compensation, the viral list’s figure of $1.02 million lowballed the CEO’s actual salary. According to United Way, CEO Brian Gallagher made $1.66 million in 2017.  The humanitarian relief charity is more efficient than the post gives it credit for, but how much more is unclear, because of the way the Red Cross reports on its operations. The Red Cross has come under fire in recent years for its claims about how much of its expenses go toward charity. As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact-check, ProPublica and NPR in 2014 reported that the Red Cross repeatedly misled the public when it said 91% of every donated dollar went to provide services. The hitch is, the Red Cross collects and sells a lot of blood. That has a large and positive impact on the organization’s bottom line. No one argues it’s a needed service, but it isn’t the same as the disaster relief for which the Red Cross is equally well known. The NPR-ProPublica investigation found that fundraising absorbed, on average, 17% of every donated dollar. That alone would deliver an efficiency of 83%, but the investigation said that was too high because the 83% included an unknown amount of administrative overhead.  The viral graphic also inflated the salary of American Red Cross CEO Gail J. McGovern. The viral post claimed the top exec drew a $1.03 million annual salary. In fact, the organization’s most recent public disclosure form shows McGovern made around $686,000. Goodwill Industries is purportedly tied for last on the viral list, in terms of efficiency. The graphic claims falsely that the organization steers only 8% of its expenses toward charitable programs. But that’s completely bogus.  According to a Forbes review, the charity — known for its thrift stores — dedicates 89% of its spending on programs to help people overcome barriers to employment, and other related services. Its most recent 990 listed former CEO Jim Gibbons’ earnings around $717,000 in 2017 — not $2.3 million, as the post claimed.  A final note: Not even the man who posted this vouched for it. He wrote, ""I can not speak to the veracity of this document, but since it comes at a time where the information is needed, I decided to post it."" Give the man points for candor, but as a rule, if you don’t know that something is accurate, don’t share it. A recent Facebook post recirculated an outdated table that divided well-known charities into those that spent donations wisely and those that did not. Most of the numbers in the table were not just wrong, they were wildly wrong. The data inflated CEO salaries and lowballed the share of money going to charitable programs by factors ranging from two to 10. In a couple of cases, the numbers were correct or nearly correct, but those were the rare exceptions. We rate this Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F2A200>],/factchecks/2019/sep/17/blog-posting/dont-be-duped-bogus-audit-charitable-groups/
"['Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Health Check', 'Christy Harrison']","
Obesity stigma and yo-yo dieting, not BMI, are behind chronic health conditions, dietitian claims
","In a recent New York Times opinion column, dietitian Christy Harrison, an ""intuitive eating coach"" and author, responded to a fellow clinician who had questioned some of her thoughts on the link between being overweight and developing other medical conditions. Harrison noted that although most health professionals have been taught that higher body mass index (BMI) causes poor health outcomes, she wrote, ""unfortunately, that just isn’t true."" She added: ""We have a host of issues associated with high B.M.I.s. But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes."" We decided to investigate the point she was making, which is at the center of a larger, often-heated debate about whether it is possible to be overweight and healthy at the same time — a perspective advocated by the ""Health at Every Size"" movement, of which Harrison is a part. With nearly 72% of U.S. adults considered overweight or obese, this is a pressing issue. When we reached out to Harrison to find out the basis of her statement, she responded quickly, citing two papers as her main sources. The first, a 2011 piece published in the Nutrition Journal, argues it might be better to shift away from weight-loss efforts to improving health in other ways that are weight-neutral. Its lead author, Linda Bacon, a professor at the University of California-Davis, wrote ""Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight,"" a 2010 book embraced by ""fat acceptance"" advocates. It addresses Harrison’s first point with this: ""While it is well established that obesity is associated with increased risk for many diseases, causation is less well-established."" The other paper, a 2014 piece in the Journal of Obesity, makes similar arguments. Causation, correlation, association: Let’s unpack that There is an old saw used by most statisticians: Correlation does not equal causation. But what does that mean? Let’s use a fake example: Some people have trouble seeing at night. Turns out all those people ate carrots. Ergo, there could be a correlation between people who ate carrots and those who experienced night vision problems. That doesn't prove anything else, though, such as causation. Correlation is necessary when trying to determine causation, but doesn’t prove it.   ""Epidemiological studies never show causation, only association,"" said Dr. Samuel Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. To establish cause, epidemiologists need more evidence.  The best way, considered the ""gold standard,"" is to randomly assign people to one group or another ― feeding one group carrots and withholding carrots from the other. Researchers would then monitor any difference in how many people develop night vision problems. That’s nifty, but not always possible or ethical. One could not, for example, randomly assign some people to a group and then cause them to become overweight.   Instead, researchers use different types of studies, such as those that compare groups of people who already have the characteristic — say, carrot eating or being overweight — with those who don’t to see if patterns emerge. They use methods to control for things that might affect the results, such as age, gender, income level, whether a person smokes and other factors. Then they can estimate how strong of an association or correlation they see. With smoking and lung cancer, very strong associations were seen, leading to the conclusion that, yes, smoking causes lung cancer. But does excess weight cause other health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, sleep apnea or joint problems? ""With the case of weight, the associations are much weaker,"" said Kendrin Sonneville, assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. So on this point, Henderson’s statement holds up. Current scientific research supports a correlation between being overweight and suffering poor health outcomes, but it does not definitively establish causation. But others, especially clinicians, say there is little doubt that being overweight strongly raises the risk of developing such health problems. ""This isn’t up for debate,"" said Dr. Harold Bays, chief science officer for the Obesity Medicine Association, which represents practitioners who treat overweight patients. ""The overwhelming amount of clinical and scientific data supports obesity as a disease, both as a direct and indirect contributor to a large number of adverse metabolic and other health consequences,"" he said. A 2018 Endocrine Society scientific statement, for example, looked across many studies of overweight and obesity, concluding that the two contribute to ""type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, some cancers, kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, gout, osteoarthritis, and hepatobiliary disease, among others."" Then things get murky. Bays and the other experts agreed that some people who are overweight might not develop other conditions. ""It is absolutely true that not all cases of diabetes, hypertension, cancer and fatty liver are due to obesity,"" said Bays. They acknowledged that people who fall into the category of being obese or overweight may even appear healthy metabolically — at least for a while. But there’s also a caution. ""If you say, ‘Wait a minute, is their blood sugar where we want it … aren’t their triglycerides a little high and what about their blood pressure?’ And that’s not even to mention pain to the joints or sleep apnea,"" Bays said. ""When you drill down, very few people would truly meet the criteria of being metabolically healthy but obese, and if you follow them for five or 10 years, now the majority are going to have something."" What about stigma? There’s been less research around Harrison’s second point: that most, if not all, of the diseases associated with being obese or overweight are caused instead by the stigma heavy people face, or the yo-yo effect of dieting, losing weight and then gaining it back again, in regular cycles. She pointed to research included in the paper by Bacon reporting that weight cycling could lead to hypertension, or high blood pressure. The research, however, found associations though not specific causation. Similarly, in another study Harrison provided, people who reported weight discrimination ― 6% of the sample studied — had twice the risk of physiological stress over nearly 10 years. Such stress can be associated with Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, the study said. But most of those we spoke with strongly disputed the sweeping statement that so many chronic conditions can be caused by stigma and weight cycling. While those two things can factor into health problems, they are not responsible for most of the health outcomes seen by her patients, said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine physician and an assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Stanford also takes issue with advocates who promote the idea that being overweight isn’t a big health risk factor. ""The Health at Every Size movement goes against what we know about obesity as a disease,"" Stanford said. ""Their aim in that movement is to not learn the science."" Our ruling Harrison said the notion that a higher BMI causes poor health outcomes ""just isn’t true"" ― adding that ""we have a host of issues associated with high BMIs. But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes."" On a strict reading of the science, she has a point. It is very difficult to prove definitively what causes disease, and showing ""correlation"" is a different finding than causation. However, she appears to apply this standard selectively, using it both to undermine the relationship between high BMI and poor health outcomes, and as evidence of how weight cycling and stigma are linked to certain chronic health conditions.  But in the case of obesity, researchers in multiple studies nationally and worldwide have shown definite links between being overweight and developing diseases, such as diabetes, and conditions, such as painful joints. There is far less evidence for the role that weight stigma and yo-yo dieting has in the development of those medical problems, although the experts urge continuing research into those questions. We rate Harrison’s statement as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096ECE980>],/factchecks/2019/sep/17/christy-harrison/obesity-stigma-and-yo-yo-dieting-not-bmi-behind-ch/

A Chicago cop didn’t shoot a teen for sneaking into a gym – he bought him a membership
","A Facebook post that claims a Chicago police officer shot a teenager ""53 times"" for sneaking into a gym is a malicious distortion of what actually happened. In reality, the police officer helped the teen buy a gym membership. The Facebook post, which displays a photograph of the officer and his full name, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The real story originated in August 2017, according to the Chicago Tribune, when a teen around 15 years old was warned that if he continued to sneak onto the basketball court of the XSport Fitness facility in Skokie, Ill., just north of Chicago, the police would be called. The gym’s staff eventually alerted the Skokie Police Department after the boy attempted to get in again. Valenti responded, and when he found out the teen had a membership that expired after his mother couldn’t afford it anymore, ""he offered to pay $150 out of his own pocket, asking fitness center workers how much membership time that would buy for the boy,"" the Tribune reported.  It covered up to about four months, but after the gym’s corporate office found out about the situation, they said the $150 would go toward a two-year membership, instead, with the gym picking up the rest of the cost. The false Facebook post includes Valenti’s full name and photo and appears to be the same photo published by the Tribune. In the post’s caption, it’s obvious the original text was erased and the part that says he ""shot him 53 times"" was inserted, as the text size and style doesn’t visually match up with the rest of the sentence. We rate this Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D86B40>],/factchecks/2019/sep/16/facebook-posts/chicago-cop-didnt-shoot-teen-sneaking-gym-he-bough/
