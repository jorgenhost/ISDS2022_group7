No evidence that military “ready to act” on Arizona ballot review
","A GOP-orchestrated review of 2020 election ballots in Maricopa County continues to generate speculative falsehoods on social media.  ""Military ready to act on audit results!"" in Arizona, the text on a June 29 Facebook post reads.  The text accompanies a 10-minute pro-Trump video in which the narrator makes no mention of the military but praises the review of the Arizona ballots. ""This stuff is coming out and showing what actually happened with the 2020 election. So, this is what's happening but the deep state on the other hand, they are panicking,"" the narrator said, adding ""The storm is on its way."" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The text on the post leaves the impression that a military unit is preparing or has been asked to take some action when the results of the Maricopa audit are released. But we found no evidence of that.  The statement on Facebook was posted as the monthslong review of 2.1 million ballots cast in the 2020 presidential election was winding down in Maricopa, the state’s largest county. The ballot review was organized by state Senate Republicans, with encouragement from former President Donald Trump. Election experts, including Republicans, have criticized the ballot review as partisan and amateurish and said it doesn’t follow typical auditing standards. The state Senate is expected to release the findings later this summer, but experts have said the results can’t be trusted. Regardless of the findings, the election results showing that Joe Biden beat Donald Trump will stand, as certified by state officials. The reference to the military in the Facebook post is vague about what group is standing ""ready."" But spokespersons for state and federal units said their agencies are not involved in responding to the Maricopa ballot review. ""There is no role for the U.S. military in determining the outcome of elections, and we are not involved in reviewing ballots in Arizona,"" Jason Waggoner, a spokesperson for the U.S. Army, told PolitiFact.  David Nunn, spokesperson for the Arizona National Guard, told PolitiFact that the Guard ""has not received any requests to support the Arizona audit."" The role of the Guard is to respond to requests from other government agencies in times of emergency, such as wildfires, the pandemic or civil unrest. So the Guard could be called on if such an emergency arises. But there is no evidence that the Guard has any active plans to respond to the ballot review.  Sophia Solis, a spokesperson for the Arizona Secretary of State’s office, said the office was not aware of any military preparation or involvement. A spokesperson for the audit, Randy Pullen, also said he was not aware of any plans involving the military. A Facebook post accompanying a video about a ballot review in Arizona’s Maricopa County said the military is ""ready to act on audit results!""  The post contained no evidence to back up that claim, and we couldn’t find any either. Spokespersons for the Arizona National Guard and the U.S. Army said their agencies are not involved with the review of the ballots in Maricopa.  We rate this statement False.  RELATED: Trump falsely implies Arizona audit has exposed fraud RELATED: Trump lost.

In attack on Bill Barr, Trump repeats falsehood about 2020 election
","In an excerpt for his upcoming book, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl recounts interviewing Bill Barr, the U.S. attorney general who fell out of favor with former President Donald Trump.  Before the election, Barr echoed Trump’s falsehood that voting by mail was associated with ""substantial fraud."" After the election, however, Barr told the Associated Press he had not seen fraud on a scale that would invalidate Joe Biden’s victory. Barr’s ""conclusion sent a definitive message that the effort to overturn the election was without merit,"" Karl wrote in an excerpt published in The Atlantic June 27. That same day, Trump issued a statement claiming that Barr ""failed to investigate election fraud, and really let down the American people."" Barr and other Republicans ""are being used in order to try to convince people that the election was legitimate when so many incredible facts have now come out to show conclusively that it wasn’t,"" said a Trump statement issued by his Save America political action committee. A Facebook post sharing Trump’s statement was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Trump pushed a false argument of a stolen election even before Election Day in November. Trump is still wrong in claiming that ""facts have now come out to show conclusively"" that the 2020 election was illegitimate.  No evidence has emerged to reverse the election results in any state. ""Any such evidence would be earth-shattering,"" said Matthew Weil, an election expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""And the fact it hasn’t materialized more than six months after the voting stopped indicates that the election was legitimate and secure."" Trump’s PAC did not respond to a request for comment, but his statement included as evidence allegations about fraud in swing states. Here’s a sampling of those allegations, along with the facts and context: ""101,789 ‘obsolete’ voters on the rolls in Georgia, including 18,486 dead people."" Trump is distorting Georgia’s plan for routine cleanup of voter rolls. Under federal law, states need to update their voter rolls, and they often do so in odd-numbered years. Most of the people flagged for removal in Georgia have moved, and some have died. The state’s top election official said ""there was no record"" that any of the dead individuals cast a ballot in the 2020 or January runoff elections. ""Nearly 200,000 illegal ‘indefinitely confined’ votes in Wisconsin’ violated Voter ID law."" This is a misrepresentation of the facts. A Wisconsin law allows voters to declare themselves as ""indefinitely confined"" and then cast an absentee ballot without providing a photo ID. ""‘Massive’ chain of custody problems with drop boxes in Georgia, missing hundreds of thousands of records for months after the election."" This debunked claim stems from a report by Georgia Star News, a pro-Trump publication, that requested chain of custody forms that show the movement of ballots in the state. Fulton County didn’t provide all the forms to Georgia Star News, but later provided almost all the forms to Georgia Public Broadcasting, an NPR affiliate. The most recent evidence affirming that the 2020 election was legitimate came from Republicans in Michigan, a state that Trump won in 2016 and lost in 2020. ""The committee found no evidence of widespread or systemic fraud in Michigan's prosecution of the 2020 election,"" said a June report by the Michigan Senate Oversight Committee, chaired by a Republican. ""Citizens should be confident the results represent the true results of the ballots cast by the people of Michigan."" The 55-page report debunks multiple claims of election fraud or irregularities pushed by Trump. State and local government officials elsewhere also have defended the integrity of the election in their states. Nationwide, election officials, including some in Trump’s administration, affirmed that the 2020 election was ""the most secure in American history.""  Nationwide, about 90 judges ruled against Trump or his allies in election cases, including 38 judges appointed by Republican presidents, according to a  Washington Post analysis. ""Not one court found any fraud that could come close to altering the outcome in any state,"" David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, told PolitiFact. There were more audits of paper ballots after the 2020 election than after any other election, Becker said. Georgia, for example, counted its ballots three times, three different ways, with observers from both parties, and all audits confirmed that Biden won, Becker said. In Arizona, state Senate Republicans organized a review of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County. Those findings are expected this summer. But election experts have criticized the review as partisan and amateurish. The Maricopa County review ""does not meet the standards of a proper election recount or audit,"" said an evaluation of the ballot review by Trey Grayson, former Republican Kentucky secretary of state, and Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist.  They concluded that ""because it lacks the essential elements of a bona fide post-election analysis, the review currently underway in Maricopa County will not produce findings that should be trusted.""  The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors — four of whose five members are Republicans — called the review a ""circus."" They said the county’s election was ""free and fair and conducted by the elections department with integrity and honor."" Trump said, ""facts have now come out to show conclusively"" that the 2020 presidential election wasn’t legitimate. No such facts have emerged. Trump’s claims are based on distortions and mischaracterizations. His claims of a rigged election started even before the results were known. The election was legitimate, as affirmed by experts on elections, including Republicans, and officials who served in Trump’s administration, as well as local and state bodies that certified the results. Multiple audits and court cases also have reached the same conclusion.  We rate Trump’s statement Pants on Fire!

No evidence for post about funeral directors seeing deaths among vaccinated people
","A recent Instagram post claims, without evidence, that funeral directors have spoken out and said that the only people they see dying are those who got the COVID-19 vaccine. ""Funeral Homes are saying the only ones dying are those taking the vaccine,"" reads the image shared by an account that embraces conspiracy theories. ""They did not see a rise in deaths or funerals until January through March of this year when the shot was rolled out."" The Instagram post claims to be informed by 10 funeral directors, who also said ""hospitals are virtually empty"" and ""no one is dying of covid."" The post includes the text of an article published by Beforeitsnews.com, a website where anyone can post an article. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) In an email to PolitiFact, a spokesperson from the National Funeral Directors Association said she was unaware of any funeral directors making this claim. The Instagram post is misleading in many ways. People die for many reasons, even if they have been vaccinated against COVID-19. But it’s rare for people who have been vaccinated to die of COVID-19. ""Considering that more than 85% of the population aged 65+ have received at least one dose of the vaccine, it is no surprise that most of the people that funeral directors are seeing have been vaccinated,"" said CDC spokesperson Jeff Lancashire in an email to PolitiFact. ""The vaccine only protects against COVID-19 and does not prevent people from dying of other causes."" CDC data shows that COVID-19 deaths have fallen substantially since large-scale vaccination efforts began at the start of this year. Infection after vaccination, called breakthrough infection, does occur. But these cases are infrequent, and rarely result in death. The Associated Press reported that unvaccinated people account for nearly all U.S. COVID-19 deaths. Using data it obtained from the CDC, the AP found that people who were fully vaccinated accounted for 150 out of 18,000 COVID-19 deaths in May, or 0.8%. (A few states aren’t gathering or reporting breakthrough infection data to the CDC.) Publicly available CDC data, which runs through April 30, shows that out of the 101 million people fully vaccinated, roughly 10,262 became infected, putting the breakthrough infection rate at 0.01%; 160 of the patients died, accounting for about 2% of the breakthrough cases, or 0.00016% of the vaccinated population. So the post’s claim that COVID-19 deaths are occurring largely among vaccinated people is false. The claim that deaths rose between January and March because of vaccination efforts is also untrue. According to the CDC, deaths from COVID-19 peaked at 25,737 during the week of Jan. 9, and they have been decreasing ever since. We’ve fact-checked several claims about the vaccines themselves causing deaths and found them to be unsupported. These claims typically cite numbers from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, a federal database that collects reports of adverse events, including deaths, that occur after vaccination. But the government agencies that run the database caution that the reports are unverified and can't be used on their own to determine whether a vaccine caused an adverse event. Through June 21, with more than 318 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines administered, VAERS had received 5,479 reports of deaths, the CDC said. ""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,"" the CDC said. ""However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS, a rare and serious adverse event — blood clots with low platelets — which has caused deaths."" As of June 21, the CDC said, 12 million doses of the single-shot J&J vaccine had been administered, and the CDC and FDA had identified 36 confirmed reports of people who developed TTS after receiving the shot. COVID-19 has killed more than 601,000 people in the U.S., according to the CDC. Survey results show that for the most part, funeral directors support vaccination. Jessica Koth, spokesperson for the National Funeral Directors Association, shared a portion of a member survey conducted by the association that showed 83% of almost 500 funeral directors were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. An Instagram post claimed that funeral directors have said ""the only ones dying are from the vaccine."" An official from the National Funeral Directors Association had not heard anyone make this claim. The claim emerged from a website where anyone can post articles. CDC data shows that deaths from COVID-19 are occurring predominantly among unvaccinated people, and have fallen dramatically since mass vaccination efforts began earlier this year.

Image suggesting John McAfee stored files at collapsed Fla. condo tower is fake
","Conspiracy theories quickly swirled around the death of technology entrepreneur John McAfee in a Barcelona prison where he was awaiting extradition to the U.S. on tax evasion charges. Spain’s El País newspaper reported that McAfee, who developed the first commercial antivirus software for computers in the 1980s, had committed suicide, citing police sources. His lawyer told Reuters that the 75-year-old British-American took his own life out of despair.  But rumors linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory — whose followers believe Democrats and celebrities are involved in an underground child-trafficking ring — suggested it was not suicide, but part of a cover-up. QAnon adherents often seize on major news stories to promote their beliefs. A June 25 Instagram post appears to link McAfee’s death on June 23 with another major news event, the collapse of a condominium building near Miami the next day. But the post uses a fabricated image to make that connection. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) McAfee, a technology entrepreneur and advocate of cryptocurrency, had a long-running battle with the U.S. government over taxation. In January 2019 he said he had not paid taxes for years and considered himself to be fleeing the IRS. In a June 2019 tweet, McAfee claimed to have ""31+"" terabytes of ""incriminating data"" about government corruption and threatened to release it if he was ever arrested. He was arrested in Spain in October 2020 at the request of U.S. authorities. The Instagram post leaves the impression that the data McAfee claimed to have in 2019 may have been destroyed in the Florida building collapse. It included images of a pair of tweets. One of them claimed McAfee owned a condo in the building, and cited the second tweet. That tweet, purportedly written June 8 from McAfee’s account, said: ""If anything ever happens to me, please know that the 31TB of files I have are located on hard drives in my condo near 88th Street and Collins Avenue just north of Miami Beach."" The intersection named in the image is the same as the site of the building collapse.  But the June 8 tweet appears to be fabricated. There’s no June 8 tweet about those records on the timeline for McAfee’s verified Twitter account, @officialmcafee. And there’s no evidence he owned a condo in the building or had any other connection to it. McAfee sent out two tweets on June 8, but neither made reference to computer files or a condo, according to an account analysis. We found no such tweet with a Twitter advanced search or on an AllMyTweets search. We rate the post False.

Social media posts falsely link British Airways pilot deaths to vaccine
","A social media post twisted a real-life story about the deaths of four British Airways pilots by making an unfounded connection to COVID-19 vaccines.  A June 21 Facebook post, now deleted, claimed, ""Airlines begin to ban vaccinated people after pilots die due to vaccine."" The comment under the post said, ""4 jabbed British Airways pilots die in one week. However, the airline denies any link to the jab."" A similar Instagram post claimed that in a single week, four British Airways pilots and one Delta pilot died and a Canadian pilot became unconscious on the runway. It also claims that these events were linked to the vaccine.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.) The claim about the British Airways pilots has been debunked by Snopes, Lead Stories and Reuters. The pilots did die, but not all in one week, and not because of the vaccine.  British Airways dismissed a link to COVID-19 vaccinations.  ""Sadly four members of our pilot community passed away recently. Our thoughts are with their family and friends,"" the airline wrote on Twitter on June 17. ""However, there is no truth whatsoever in the claims speculating that the four deaths are linked.""  The airline did not disclose the pilots’ names. Three of the pilots were identified by Snopes and other outlets: Capt. Nicholas Synnott, Senior First Officer Edward Brice-Bennett, and Senior First Officer Grant Mercer. PolitiFact was unable to learn the name of the fourth pilot. None of the news coverage about those pilots mentions vaccines. Synnott died in June. He contracted COVID-19 in March 2020 while working in Texas, and he spent eight months receiving care  at UT Health and Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston. His return to England in December 2020 generated several news stories.  Brice-Bennett died on June 2. A local newspaper, the New Valley News, said he was found unconscious in a mountain-biking bike park in Tidworth in southern England. Forty-five minutes later, the newspaper reported, paramedics pronounced him dead. An autopsy found that he had internal abdominal bleeding, the paper’s website said. Mercer died on May 4. Snopes reported that his death has no connection to a COVID-19 vaccine. His memorial page was raising money for ""the send-off he deserves."" The page said it would donate any money received over the fundraising goal to a suicide prevention organization.  The International Air Transport Association, the airline industry’s trade group, said it is not aware of any airlines banning vaccinated passengers or considering it. This echoes what we found in another fact-check of a similar claim.  ""We advocate that people who have been vaccinated should be free to travel without restriction,"" the association told PolitiFact. A Facebook user claimed that four British Airways pilots’ deaths were linked to the COVID-19 vaccine and suggested that airlines are banning vaccinated people from traveling.

Olympics ban athletes from all forms of political expression, not just Black Lives Matter support
","Protests by athletes during sporting events have long been a point of contention in the public eye; some detractors say athletes should stick to sports, while supporters say they should be able to use their platform to spread awareness of an issue. Ahead of this year’s Olympics, scheduled to begin July 23, a Facebook post claims Japan has prohibited athletes from making any political expression during the Tokyo Summer Games, including wearing clothing that says ""Black Lives Matter."" ""Japan has banned all BLM apparel from the Olympics,"" the June 20 post reads. ""No one can kneel or raise fists during the anthems either. I'm proud of Japan."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is wrong in that it isn’t up to the host country to set what rules athletes have to follow while participating in the games. Instead, that’s the responsibility of the International Olympic Committee. However, the IOC has a provision in its charter, called Rule 50, which prohibits athletes from making any sort of political expression, particularly on medal podiums, in the field of play, and at opening and closing ceremonies. The rule does not target a particular movement or ideology. The rule states: ""No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas."" A version of Rule 50 has been in place in the IOC's charter since at least 1975. Examples of prohibited expressions include displaying any form of political messaging on a person’s attire and making any gesture that could be seen as political, such as kneeling or a raised fist. The IOC did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment regarding Black Lives Matter apparel at the Olympics. The focus at the Olympic Games should be on athletes’ performances, sport and international unity, and ""it is a fundamental principle that sport is neutral and must be separate from political, religious or any other type of  interference,"" said Rule 50 guidelines developed by the IOC Athletes’ Commission. Rule 50 has been under scrutiny for several years, and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee recently sought to have the rule amended amid a growing wave of American athletes publicly taking up social justice causes, the Washington Post reported. The IOC reviewed the rule and announced in April it would not be changed.   Olympics officials will allow athletes in Tokyo to wear clothing with more general messaging, like ""inclusion,"" ""peace,"" ""equality"" and ""respect,"" according to the Associated Press. The IOC also has said there will be opportunities for athletes ""to express their views"" — during press conferences, interviews, team meetings, and on social media. Acts of political expression by athletes at the Olympics is nothing new and happened as early as the 1906 Athens Games, when a track and field athlete named Peter O’Connor waved a pro-Irish flag while representing Great Britain, according to the BBC. The most well-known example of an Olympian using the global event to make a political statement may have been at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, when U.S. athletes John Carlos and Tommie Smith bowed their heads and raised gloved fists during a medal ceremony at the height of the Black Power movement. The IOC at the time called their display ""a deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the Olympic spirit"" and expelled Carlos and Smith from the games. A Facebook post claims, ""Japan has banned all (Black Lives Matter) apparel from the Olympics. No one can kneel or raise fists during the anthems either."" The post is partly accurate. The IOC, not a host country, sets the rules athletes have to follow. Apparel that says Black Lives Matter may be seen as a form of political expression, and  Olympic officials for decades have had a rule prohibiting any form of political expression. Kneeling or raising a fist are forms of prohibited political expression. The IOC’s rule does not specifically target Black Lives Matter, or any one ideology or movement.

No, southern Illinois’ Prairie State is not the nation’s ‘cleanest’ coal plant
","As Republican operatives were dropping U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis's name as the next potential rival to run against Gov. J.B. Pritzker, the GOP congressman was in southern Illinois visiting a coal plant that could get shut down if the governor gets his way. Davis used the visit to criticize the governor’s support for a sweeping energy plan that could shutter every coal-fired power plant in Illinois by 2035, an idea many opponents lambast as one that will kill jobs and hike rates. Davis called on Pritzker, a Democrat, to spare the Prairie State Energy Campus in Marissa, located south of East St. Louis. The plant provides power to municipalities in eight states, including a swath of Davis’ 13th Congressional District. ""The municipally owned Prairie State power plant is the cleanest coal-fired power plant in the nation,"" he said during his June 18 visit. ""The company is actively pursuing and adopting additional carbon sequestration and storage and emissions-reducing technologies, and they should receive support from state and federal agencies for their efforts."" One of Prairie State Energy Campus’ two power units was selected in 2019 as the site of a U.S. Department of Energy-backed carbon capture research project slated for completion at the end of 2021. But federal data show the plant has been one of the nation’s 10 biggest emitters of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, a fact recently highlighted by the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune. While experts say there are multiple ways to evaluate which coal plants are the ""cleanest"" beyond total CO2 emissions — which tend to single out the power plants producing the most electricity — Prairie State ranked nowhere near the top based on any of the yardsticks we found to measure it. Davis’ office did not respond to calls or emails requesting comment. Defining how ""clean"" a coal plant is depends on whom you ask — and when, according to experts. ""‘Clean coal’ has been this sort of amorphous term that has meant whatever people want it to mean, and it's changed over time,"" said Daniel Cohan, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University. Before climate change gained significant attention, Cohan and other experts said, coal plants were generally judged by their emission of regulated air pollutants causing smog and acid rain such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Amid growing concern over climate change, however, experts said there’s a case for including CO2 emissions in the conversation about which plants are the ""cleanest."" To compare Prairie State’s emissions against other power plants, Cohan pointed us to data published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency showing how much of a given gas or pollutant power plants emit per unit of electricity they generate. In 2019, the latest year for which this data was available, Prairie State Generating Station ranked 169th of 306 coal plants in the nation with EPA data for CO2 emission rates. Its ranking for its SO2 emission rate was roughly the same. Prairie State performed better when it came to its NOx emission rate — placing 37th — but still nowhere near the top. ""By no means is this a clean power plant,"" Cohan said, referencing the EPA data. ""It’s still a substantial contributor to air pollution and climate change."" Calling Prairie State the cleanest coal plant in the country, he added, ""would be absurd."" Emily Grubert, an energy systems researcher and professor at Georgia Tech, agreed. ""It’s not the cleanest by any reasonable metric,"" she said. Davis said the Prairie State power plant is ""the cleanest"" coal-fired power plant in the nation. His office did not respond to our inquiry asking for evidence to back that up. Experts told us there are multiple metrics by which to assess how ""clean"" a coal plant is, but federal data shows Prairie State does not come out at or near the top on any of them.

No, the black and white flag for police solidarity does not violate flag code
","A Facebook post showing a side-by-side comparison of the American flag and a flag used to express support for police officers refers to the latter as a ""gang symbol,"" and implies it violates the U.S. Flag Code. The non-U.S. flag resembles the American flag, except it bears black and white stripes with the stars affixed to a black background. A blue stripe runs through the center. The post incorrectly cites section 176 (located in Title 36) as the portion of the code that it claims the black and white flag violates.  ""The flag should never have placed on it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture or drawing of any nature (including discoloration),"" the post continued.  The June 14 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Peter Ansoff is president of the North American Vexillological Association, an organization that bills itself as the ""world’s largest organization of flag enthusiasts and scholars."" Vexillology is the study of flags. Ansoff told PolitiFact in a phone interview that there are two key discrepancies with the post. The first, he said, was that the post notes the incorrect administrative citation for the actual flag code. It should be Section 8 (in Title 4). While the Flag Code used to be under Title 36, it was re-codified in 1998, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Facebook post fails to observe this change. The second discrepancy Ansoff pointed out is that the Facebook post tacks on the words ""including discoloration."" Discoloration is not prohibited by the flag code, as the Facebook post claims. So as far as the code is concerned, the black and white flag with the blue stripe in the middle is not in violation. Additionally, Ansoff told PolitiFact that the blue, white and black flag in the post is not technically an American flag. Ansoff pointed to the first section of the code which stipulated that the ""the flag of the United States shall be 13 horizontal stripes, alternate red and white; and the union of the flag shall be forty-eight stars, white in a blue field."" (New states have been added since then, bringing the number of stars to 50.) ""So one could argue that the so-called ‘gang symbol’ isn't really an American flag in the meaning of the code itself,"" he said. ""It looks a little bit like it, but it's not an American flag as far as the flag code is concerned."" A Facebook post claims that the flag expressing support for police officers violates the U.S. Flag Code. According to the U.S. Flag Code, the black and white flag with the blue stripe in the center is not an official version of the American flag. The post suggests that the police support flag includes discoloration. ""Discoloration"" is not listed in the flag code as a violation.

Joe Biden gets history wrong on the Second Amendment limiting gun ownership
","President Joe Biden’s plan to curb rising violence relies on several steps: more aid to local police departments, expanding job programs for young adults, more violence intervention programs, and tougher measures to shut down gun sellers who break federal laws. ""Rogue gun dealers feel like they can get away with selling guns to people who aren’t legally allowed to own them,"" Biden said June 23. ""There has always been the ability to limit — rationally limit the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own it."" And, Biden said, that power was rooted in history. ""The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed, limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own,"" Biden said. ""You couldn’t buy a cannon."" We reached out to the White House and received no comment, but Biden’s statement is not accurate history. During the campaign, Biden made a similar claim about cannons in the Revolutionary War and who could own them. We rated that False.  This time, on top of that, Biden misrepresents what the Second Amendment says.

""The Second Amendment places no limits on individual ownership of cannon, or any other arms,"" Reynolds said. There have been many court cases to resolve whether the amendment confers an individual right to bear arms. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it does.  Setting aside ongoing disagreements over that ruling, Fordham University law professor Nicholas Johnson said, ""The amendment limited government action, not people."" ""The first federal gun control law does not appear until the 20th century,"" Johnson said. That law, the National Firearms Act, came in 1934 when machine guns were the weapon of choice of Prohibition Era gangsters. (The law was drafted before Prohibition ended in 1933.) When U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings made the case for the law before the House Ways and Means Committee, he based it on the government’s power to tax and regulate interstate commerce, not the Second Amendment. ""If we made a statute absolutely forbidding any human being to have a machine gun, you might say there is some constitutional question involved,"" Cummings said April 16, 1934. ""But when you say ‘We will tax the machine gun’ and when you say that ‘the absence of a license showing payment of the tax has been made indicates that a crime has been perpetrated,’ you are easily within the law."" From the way Biden put it, the Second Amendment regulated weapons. The more immediate driver in 1787 was the desire to keep the federal government in check. The framers of the Constitution agreed that a federal government might need a standing army. But coming out from under one despot, they wanted to avoid creating another. This was something that Federalists and Anti-Federalists could agree on, wrote Valparaiso law professor David Vandercoy. ""Both believed the greatest danger to the new republic was tyrannical government and that the ultimate check on tyranny was an armed population,"" Vandercoy wrote in 1994. There were some state and local laws after the Second Amendment was adopted in 1792 that limited firearms. The most sweeping ones barred Black people, free or enslaved, from owning them.  A 1792 Virginia law, for example, said, ""No Negro or mulatto whatsoever shall keep or carry any gun, powder, shot, club or other weapon whatsoever.""  Historian Saul Cornell at Fordham found other laws aimed at controlling certain groups. Some banned gun ownership by people who backed the British. Others targeted Native Americans.  Cornell also pointed to a 1795 Massachusetts law that mainly targeted rioters but gave local authorities broad latitude to arrest people who carried firearms. ""The (National Rifle Association) will call out Biden, correctly, that there were no modern style gun control laws in the Founding era because there was little interpersonal gun violence among persons of European origin,"" Cornell said. ""Gun control groups will correctly say that a variety of robust regulations existed at the time of the Second Amendment and that the Founders feared anarchy as much as tyranny."" Cornell argues that for about the first 50 years after passage of the Second Amendment, gun technology was limited. The issues of crime and safety that drive the modern debate, he said, didn’t begin to emerge until manufacturers began producing reliable, affordable guns in greater volume. Biden said that from the start, the Second Amendment ""limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own."" The Second Amendment limited government power, not the rights of individuals. Laws at the time that limited firearm ownership were primarily racist, aimed at controlling Black people and Native Americans.  Broadly, gun regulation came decades after passage of the Second Amendment when gun technology changed. The first national gun regulation law did not rely on the Second Amendment. We rate Biden’s claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jun/25/joe-biden/joe-biden-gets-history-wrong-second-amendment-limi/

Scientists developing mRNA vaccines before outbreak isn’t evidence COVID-19 pandemic was created
","Alarmist articles are circulating online claiming that newly revealed ""secret documents"" show that the U.S. government had coronavirus vaccine candidates from Moderna in development weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus proves that the pandemic was planned. ""DOCUMENTS: U.S. Gov't Sent ‘mRNA Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates’ to University Researchers WEEKS BEFORE ‘COVID’ Outbreak in China! How did they know . . . Unless they caused it?"" reads the headline of an article on HalTurnerRadioShow.com. Another article on a website called GreatGameIndia.com claimed: ""Secret Docs Reveal Moderna Sent Coronavirus Vaccine To North Carolina University Weeks Before Pandemic."" The articles were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The documents show a researcher transfer agreement for Moderna vaccine candidates for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, known as MERS-CoV, according to the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases. The agreement was executed on Dec. 16, 2019 —  roughly two weeks before the first SARS-CoV-2 case was detected in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. These ""secret documents"" have been publicly available since at least June 2020. They do not indicate the U.S. government caused or created the ongoing pandemic. Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s and researchers have identified seven that can infect people. For years, well before the identification of SARS-CoV-2, researchers have been studying ways to develop vaccines against coronaviruses, particularly because coronaviruses are known to have a high probability of causing pandemics. As part of a larger confidentiality agreement between the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Moderna ""mRNA coronavirus vaccines candidates"" were transferred for animal testing to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Multiple researchers signed the agreement between Dec. 12-16, 2019.  The confidentiality agreement stipulated that mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates would be developed and jointly owned by the two parties. The contract was not specific to the SARS-CoV-2, as it was signed before the new virus had been sequenced. The agreement was amended in February 2020 to add mRNA vaccine candidates for other emerging viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.  ""NIAID scientists selected MERS-CoV as a ‘prototype pathogen’ to study for vaccine development with the intention that the approach could be generalized for vaccines against viruses within the same virus family,"" an NIAID spokesperson told PolitiFact.  Scientists and collaborators had already created stabilized coronavirus spike proteins (which the viruses use to enter cells and mRNA vaccines use to create antibody responses) before SARS-CoV-2 was identified. Once the virus’ sequence was publicly shared in early 2020, the same approach was then applied to developing vaccine candidates for COVID-19. NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center and Moderna have collaborated on pandemic preparedness and vaccine research since 2017, the NIAID said, and entered into a formal research collaboration agreement in May 2019 for vaccine candidates for MERS-CoV and Nipah virus. Articles suggest the U.S. government created the pandemic because its scientists sent mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates to other researchers before the COVID-19 outbreak.  This is a misrepresentation of the facts and is not evidence that the government is responsible for the cause of the pandemic. The vaccine candidates were for a coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, not for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. NIAID researchers have been working on developing vaccines for coronaviruses, which consist of hundreds of viruses, for several years.

No cause yet for condo collapse near Miami, no evidence Ivanka Trump targeted

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The day after the collapse, with search-and-rescue efforts still under way, officials said they did not know the cause of the collapse and that it would be some time before an investigation can try to find the cause. The Champlain Towers South, a 12-story condo building constructed in 1981 in Surfside, a town northeast of Miami, partially collapsed early on the morning of June 24. At a media briefing the next afternoon, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said four people had died and 159 remained unaccounted for, but that the numbers were fluid. She said that although search-and-rescue efforts continue, structural engineers eventually would investigate what might have caused the collapse. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also made it clear that it would take some time before an investigation of a possible cause can be fully undertaken. He said: ""We need a definitive explanation for how this could have happened, and that’s an explanation that needs to be an accurate explanation, it’s an explanation that we don’t want to get wrong, obviously, but at the same time I do think it’s important that it’s timely."" Engineering and architectural experts told the New York Times it could take a long time to determine the cause of the collapse, but that possibilities include corroded components, an undermined foundation, or defects in the construction or design. Shimon Wdowinski, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Florida International University in Miami, said the building showed signs of land subsidence — a gradual settling or sudden sinking of the Earth’s surface — in the 1990s, according to space-based radar data he analyzed. But land subsidence alone likely would not cause a building’s collapse, he said. Several engineering experts suggested a number of factors could have played a role, including saltwater corroding the concrete and potentially weakening beams that hold up the structure, the Miami Herald reported. Scientists have long noted the risk of building on the shifting sands of a barrier island such as Miami Beach, especially with rising sea levels, NBC News reported. That may not be the reason for this collapse, but it remains an engineering challenge in the region, the network said. According to news reports, the Miami home of Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both of whom served as White House aides under Donald Trump, is a block away from the building that collapsed.

New Florida law doesn't require university students, faculty and staff to register political views

""Ron DeathSantis just signed legislation requiring students, faculty and staff at Florida’s public universities and colleges to register their political views with the state.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The headline says: ""Florida students required to register political views with the state to promote ‘intellectual diversity’."" That story is about HB 233, specifically the requirement in the bill that the State Board of Education and the Board of Governors must ""select or create an objective, nonpartisan, and statistically valid survey to be used by each institution which considers the extent to which competing ideas and perspectives are presented and members of the college community, including students, faculty, and staff, feel free to express their beliefs and viewpoints on campus and in the classroom.""  Education authorities must require the annual assessment from state colleges and universities, according to the bill. Spokespeople for the Board of Governors and the Florida Department of Education told PolitiFact that the survey has not yet been developed. The bill does not address what questions will be asked, whether student and faculty participation in the survey is mandatory, or if the responses will be anonymous.    Cheryl Etters, interim communications director for the education department, said the surveys will be voluntary and won’t ask about individuals’ political beliefs.  ""It’s merely going to ask whether they feel they can express their political viewpoints and opinions in their college classrooms,"" Etters said. ""The idea is to get at ‘Do they feel safe expressing their own viewpoint in college?’""  No one will be required to register their political views with the state, she said.  Jason Mahon, deputy communications director for Gov. Ron DeSantis, told us that the survey would ""need a valid sample, but there is not an expectation that every Florida student or professor would even need to participate."" The legislation also does not require ""knowing the identity of the respondent,"" he said. Sen. Ray Rodrigues, the Republican who sponsored the bill, pointed PolitiFact to similar surveys at the University of Colorado and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that he said inspired the Florida legislation.  The Colorado survey asked respondents about their political affiliation and political philosophy, and the North Carolina survey asked respondents about their political leanings. Both universities said the results were anonymous. North Carolina also encouraged students to take the survey with a $10 gift card. Critics of Florida’s new law, which goes into effect on July 1, continue to voice fears about how it will be implemented, including the concern that it would have a chilling effect on free speech. A researcher for the Florida Education Association told the Miami Herald in April that she worried it would ""force a fearful self-consciousness that is not as much about learning and debate as about appearances and playing into an outside audience."" The Tampa Bay Times reported that, speaking about the survey, DeSantis and Rodrigues ""suggested that budget cuts could be looming if universities and colleges are found to be ‘indoctrinating’ students."" Our ruling DeSantis recently signed legislation requiring public colleges and universities to survey ""intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity"" to gauge in part how comfortable students, faculty and staff feel sharing their beliefs in classrooms. The survey hasn’t been created yet, so we don’t know what it will ask students, faculty and staff at these institutions. But a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Education told us it will be voluntary and won’t ask about individuals’ political beliefs, though surveys in other states that lawmakers have cited as inspiration for the bill do.  But, as written, the law doesn’t require public college and university students, faculty and staff to register their political views with the state.  We rate the post False.",/factchecks/2021/jun/25/viral-image/new-florida-law-requires-public-universities-surve/

The post on Instagram, which also appeared on Twitter, states: ""mRNA technology has been around for decades. It had never gone past animal trials due to catastrophic side effects, including death. This technology was never 'fixed’. Now mankind is being pressured to take it, with assurances that it is safe and effective. That is bulls---."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook. The two vaccines that use mRNA technology, one made by Moderna and the other by Pfizer-BioNTech, were tested in tens of thousands of humans. They have been administered to more than 177 million people in the U.S. and have been shown to be safe and effective. The messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology used to create the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech shots dates to the 1990s, though this is the first time it has been used in widely disseminated vaccines.  These two mRNA vaccines use the human body’s natural immune response to their advantage. The shots give cells the directions for how to make a harmless  spike protein. Such spike proteins are found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19 — and it is these proteins that the virus uses to bind to cells. The immune system of a person who receives the mRNA vaccine then spots the unknown protein and makes antibodies to fight it.  The third vaccine used in the U.S., by Johnson & Johnson, is different. Instead of RNA, it uses a disabled adenovirus to deliver instructions to produce the coronavirus’ spike proteins and activate the immune system.  The mRNA technology previously was tested against other viruses like influenza; Moderna began its testing in 2015. In 2018, Pfizer and BioNTech announced a partnership to start developing an mRNA vaccine to prevent influenza. The various development efforts shifted to creating an mRNA vaccine for the coronavirus when the pandemic hit.  The testing of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was done on tens of thousands of people. Pfizer and Moderna got approval to test their shots on animals while simultaneously running Phase I trials on humans, prior to the vaccines getting emergency use authorization from the FDA in December 2020 for distribution to the general public.  More than 177 million people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, with minimal complications reported despite the massive sample size. Among people who are fully vaccinated, the mRNA vaccines reduce the risk of COVID-19, including severe illness, by 90% or more, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  While a number of claims have been made suggesting that the vaccine is unsafe or has resulted in dangerous side-effects, PolitiFact has found that most of them stem from incomplete use of data contained in a federal database known as Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. The database is a critical tool for researchers, but a breeding ground for misinformation about vaccine after-effects. Anyone can submit a report, and the reports are widely accessible. But the reports are not verified. ""Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem,"" the CDC says. ""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."".  Serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare but can occur. For example, CDC and FDA have confirmed 393 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis — inflammation of the heart — in people after mRNA vaccination. A widely circulated social media post claimed that the mRNA technology in COVID-19 vaccines was never tested in humans, ""now mankind is being pressured to take it, with assurances that it is safe and effective."" The two predominant COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., Moderna and Pfizer, use mRNA technology and were tested in tens of thousands of humans before they were authorized.

Viral video targeting Obama features an array of doctored photos and conspiracy theories

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reviewed Time covers from 2008, when Obama was elected, to date and found no cover matching the image in the video.  The video goes on to share more fake images of the president among unfounded claims.  About 17 seconds into the video, one photo has been edited to show Obama wearing a turban while standing next to Osama bin Laden. In the original image, released by Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in February 2008, Obama was dressed as a Somali elder by Sheikh Mahmed Hassan, who is standing next to Obama during his visit to northeastern Kenya.  The next image in the video shows former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Clinton and Obama all posing separately with bin Laden. We’ve already fact-checked those photos — they’re fake.  About 45 seconds into the video, an image of Obama and Clinton appears with this text: ""They paid a foreign government to falsify information, than lied to the courts to spy and overthrow Trump. Democrats lied and impeached Trump to hide their crimes.""  This touches on other claims we’ve already checked.  After Trump won the Republican nomination, the Democratic National Committee hired an opposition firm called Fusion GPS to collect information on him. Fusion GPS then hired former British spy Christopher Steele to produce memos on Trump’s ties to Russia. He wrote a dossier that included salacious but unverified claims about Trump.  In September 2019, House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry on grounds that Trump illegally used his position as president to solicit help from a foreign government to damage his political opponent. We have a timeline of the impeachment proceedings, from 2013 through late 2019, here.  About a minute and 11 seconds into the video, a photo of Obama appears with the names ""Jean Paul Ludwig"" and ""Barry Soetoro"" and a Social Security number. These refer to inaccurate claims that Obama’s real name is Barry Soetoro and that Obama has illegally been using the Social Security number of a dead man, Ludwig.  The video also uses imagery and slogans associated with the wide-ranging QAanon conspiracy, which asserts without evidence that Trump is fighting against a deep-state cabal of pedophiles seeking to overthrow the president. About a minute and 45 seconds in, it claims that Obama helped ""plan a coup"" and that he should ""pay the price"" for treason.  After that, another fake image appears, showing Obama kissing David Cameron, Britain’s former prime minister.  Later in the video, a photo of former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama appears and perpetuates the conspiracy theory that mass shootings in the United States are orchestrated by the government to achieve its policy agenda.  ""Trump is sending us all to Gitmo for life,"" Clinton appears to be saying in the image.  ""Let’s plan another mass shooting,"" Bush says.  ""We can’t,"" Obama responds, ""all the restaurants and theaters are closed.""  Toward the end of the video, yet another doctored image appears.

Voters, not clerks, decided who was on ""indefinitely confined"" list
","A number of old election controversies are roaring back to life amid the Wisconsin recount, including the question of votes cast by indefinitely confined voters. Voters who declare themselves in that category — and under state law it’s up to the voter — are able to cast an absentee ballot without having to provide a copy of a photo ID, which is otherwise required for voters. After President Donald Trump lost Wisconsin by 20,600 votes, his campaign requested a recount in Milwaukee and Dane counties — Democratic strongholds and the state’s two largest counties. On Nov. 20, 2020, Trump attorneys sought to discard any ballot from a voter who declared themselves indefinitely confined in Dane County.  The county’s Board of Canvassers denied that request, but it was expected to also resurface in the Milwaukee County recount and later in court. State Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, R-New Berlin, raised a similar objection in a Nov. 9 statement, with an additional accusation. His release talked about the need for confidence in election outcomes and asserted ""a great number of irregularities have taken place leading up to and including this past Election Day that have breached the trust of the electorate.""  (For the record, election officials have reported no such irregularities, and a canvass has since confirmed the size of Trump’s loss to Democrat Joe Biden.) Sanfelippo then said this: ""Clerks in Milwaukee and Dane Counties colluded to (add) nearly 250,000 individuals to the ‘Indefinitely Confined’ voter list."" Sanfelippo is effectively making two claims: That clerks added 250,000 people to this list and that they colluded in doing so. We’ll examine both elements. The crux of the controversy is who exactly can claim to be indefinitely confined, as we sit in the middle of an ongoing pandemic. The issue surfaced when Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell sent an email March 25, 2020, to the municipal clerks in his county saying this: ""During this emergency and based on the Governors Stay at Home order I am declaring all Dane County voters may indicate as needed that they are indefinitely confined due to illness.  This declaration will make it easier for Dane County voters to participate in this election by mail in these difficult times."" McDonell then shared that email with every county clerk in the state. Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson released a statement the same day saying voters there could do likewise. On March 27, the Wisconsin Elections Commission met and provided more detailed guidance on indefinitely confined status. The two key points: Designation of indefinitely confined status is for each individual voter to make based upon their current circumstance. It does not require permanent or total inability to travel outside of the residence. The designation is appropriate for electors who are indefinitely confined because of age, physical illness or infirmity or are disabled for an indefinite period. Indefinitely confined status shall not be used by electors simply as a means to avoid the photo ID requirement without regard to whether they are indefinitely confined because of age, physical illness, infirmity or disability.  Christenson then issued revised advice, saying, ""It is very important to note that 'indefinite confinement' based only upon the Governor’s Safer at Home Emergency Order cannot be used to legally avoid the photo ID requirement."" Also on March 27, the Republican Party went to court to block the Dane County advice that the stay-at-home order allowed anyone to claim they were indefinitely confined. Four days later the Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with the GOP. In a statement responding to that ruling, McDonell said, ""My intent at all times was to protect the safety of seniors afraid to leave their homes due to this pandemic."" He said he simply attempted to follow guidelines from the commission. McDonell noted that letters were also sent to all voters who claimed that status in May, confirming whether they remained indefinitely confined. The indefinitely confined voter concept originates in a section of state statute that says this: ""An elector who is indefinitely confined because of age, physical illness or infirmity or is disabled for an indefinite period may by signing a statement to that effect require that an absentee ballot be sent to the elector automatically for every election. The application form and instructions shall be prescribed by the commission, and furnished upon request to any elector by each municipality. The envelope containing the absentee ballot shall be clearly marked as not forwardable. If any elector is no longer indefinitely confined, the elector shall so notify the municipal clerk."" In others words, it’s up to the voter. The elections commission makes this explicitly clear in a May 13, 2020, memo, saying ""all changes to status must be made in writing and by the voter’s request."" It noted clerks don’t have the power to remove anyone from the indefinitely confined list either, unless the voter requests it. So Sanfelippo’s claim about clerks adding voters to the list is misleading at best in that it implies decision-making power lies with clerks. Local clerks simply record the decisions made by voters. Sanfelippo and his staff did not return a phone call or emails seeking evidence for his claim, or information on where the 250,000 number came from. That figure may have been drawn from a MacIver Institute report that said about 250,000 people were listed as indefinitely confined in the days before the Nov. 3 election, including many who registered as such after the April election. Reid Magney, spokesman for the elections commission, said about 215,000 ballots were returned in the Nov. 3 election from voters listed as indefinitely confined. Since Sanfelippo didn’t respond to our requests for comment, we also don’t know exactly what he was referring to as collusion. McDonell said he was confused by the allegation. ""I guess I am not sure what is meant by collusion. I let all the county clerks in the state know what I was telling my municipal clerks, including Milwaukee,"" he said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Merriam-Webster defines collusion as a ""secret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purpose."" That’s a high bar to clear for Sanfelippo. There’s a big difference between a secret agreement for deceitful purposes and the communication we know of — an email that included not just two clerks but every clerk in the state. A March 26, 2020, memo from the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau said it would be appropriate, consistent with elections commission guidance and ""simply a matter of public outreach"" for clerks to encourage people who are legitimately unable to vote in person to claim that indefinitely confined status, ""assuming the clerks make a good faith effort to determine if the voter understands his or her declaration."" Sanfelippo said, ""Clerks in Milwaukee and Dane Counties colluded to (add) nearly 250,000 individuals to the ‘Indefinitely Confined’ voter list."" Each element of this claim runs into issues. Clerks don’t determine who is on the list as this implies, they simply record which voters list themselves this way. They don’t even have the authority to remove someone from it. And we’ve seen no evidence of the boldest element of this claim, that some kind of collusion was involved. The two clerks did communicate, but as part of a larger group email. For our fact checks, the burden of proof is on the speaker, who refused to provide any evidence. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/nov/21/joe-sanfelippo/voters-not-clerks-decided-who-was-indefinitely-con/

Fact-checking Sidney Powell’s claim that 450,000 ballots in key states were marked only for Biden
","Former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell has been waging a war against the legitimacy of the 2020 election, appearing on several conservative TV programs with unsubstantiated claims of nefarious activity that she says unfairly threw the election for President-elect Joe Biden. On Nov. 8, Powell, who served as an attorney for former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn, appeared on Maria Bartiromo’s Sunday morning Fox News show and said that Democrats are fraudulently creating ballots that exist only for Biden:  ""We have identified at least 450,000 ballots in the key states that miraculously only have a mark for Joe Biden on them, and no other candidate.""  The fact that many voters voted for Biden but not for candidates in other races, Powell argued, was problematic and indicative of fraud. Bartiromo breaks down the 450,000 figure to five states, saying to Powell: ""You say it’s 98,000 ballots in Pennsylvania, 80,000 to 90,000 in Georgia, another 42,000 in Arizona, 69,000 to 115,000 in Michigan and 62,000 in Wisconsin."" The numbers do add up to approximately 450,000 votes and appear to have originated in a Nov. 7 tweet by the editor of a conservative news website called The National Pulse.  But this omits the context that undervoting, a practice where voters mark their choice for one race but skip making selections in other races down the ballot, is not a new or shocking phenomenon. It occurs in every election. More than 24 million people voted in the election in the states that Bartiromo cites, making the 450,000 people who Powell says apparently voted for Biden and skipped the rest of the ballot less than 2%. We weren’t able to verify the exact figures Bartiromo and Powell cited. We attempted to contact Powell about how she arrived at those numbers, but did not hear back. But using the New York Times elections data on Nov. 20, we did find that there were nearly 450,000 more votes cast for president in those five states than there were for the down-ballot U.S. House of Representatives races: 124,390 more votes in Pennsylvania; 117,458 more in Georgia; 31,123 more in Arizona; 115,717 more in Michigan; and 61,125 more in Wisconsin. We don’t have data showing that all those votes were cast only for Biden, though. PolitiFact also reached out to top election officials in each of the states. The Michigan Secretary of State’s Office told us that the number is ""easily disproven by looking at unofficial vote totals, either on our state website or individual county ones.""  Arizona and Wisconsin officials both said they don’t have official statewide results yet, and are currently accepting canvass results from its respective counties. There is nothing fraudulent about people voting for president or other offices at the top of the ballot and then skipping over offices further down the ballot, said Barry Burden, a political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""This kind of ballot roll-off is entirely understandable and occurs in every election. There is nothing at all ‘miraculous’ about some voters only being interested in voting for president,"" Burden said. ""Roll-off is most common when down ballot races are uncompetitive, but it happens even when those races are closely contested."" He pointed to Pennsylvania’s highly competitive 2016 U.S. Senate race as an example. The presidential race attracted 6.12 million votes in the battleground state, but the Senate race tallied 64,000 fewer votes. The Federal Election Commission provides vote totals for past elections that include tables that show how many voters made selections for the Senate, the House of Representatives and, when applicable, the president. In 2016, for example, 136,669,276 people voted for president. About 5 million fewer — 131,652,452 — voted for a member of the U.S. House. In past presidential elections, in almost every state cited in Powell’s claim, certified elections data shows there have been several thousand more votes for president than for other races down the ballot. (An exception is Michigan in 2012, when there were more votes for the U.S. house than for president.)  Some voters aren’t given a chance to vote for a senator, but every voter does have the opportunity to vote for a member of the House. Here is a look at the undervote numbers between presidential races and House races in each state in prior presidential election years: ""Those who are falsely claiming potential fraud because of 450,000 ballots marked only for Biden need to report how many ballots they found marked only for Trump and no other candidate; it would likely be a similarly high number,"" Speel said. Election data experts also told PolitiFact that the rate of undervotes matters more than Powell’s number in a comparison of different elections. Charles Stewart, a political science professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, tweeted about this on Nov. 6. Tabulation results for early and election day voting, Stewart said, showed an undervote rate of 0.39% for both Biden and Trump. ""Thus far there's no evidence of unusual numbers of over or under votes, and indeed, it looks significantly lower than in 2016,"" Stewart wrote. Powell said at least ""450,000 ballots in the key states that miraculously only have a mark for Joe Biden on them, and no other candidate."" We could not confirm that figure, but it does seem in line with the difference between the numbers of total votes cast in the presidential race and those cast in the down ballot House races in those states. We don’t see evidence that all of these votes were for Biden, however. Powell presented this unremarkable undervoting statistic as evidence of fraud. Her statement fails to provide the key context that the practice of undervoting is common and does not indicate ballots have been fraudulently manufactured. We rate this False.

Giuliani cites affidavit with crucial errors in press conference
","During a Nov. 19 press conference, Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer representing President Donald Trump, charged that many precincts in Michigan — a key state won by his Democratic opponent, President-elect Joe Biden — recorded more votes than actual voters.  In Michigan, he said, ""we have over-votes in numerous precincts of 150%, 200% and 300%.""  Giuliani’s source for these percentages was an affidavit authored by Russell Ramsland, a security consultant and former Republican congressional candidate. The document alleges that anomalies in the vote count indicate that Michigan election results were ""manipulated."" ""There were at least 19 precincts where the Presidential Votes Cast compared to the Estimated Voters based on Reported Statistics exceeded 100%,"" the affidavit reads. The document then goes on to list the 19 precincts, shown in this screenshot:  But there’s a problem, and it’s a big one: All 19 of the precincts cited in the affidavit are actually located in Minnesota, not Michigan.  A separate part of the affidavit focuses on Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit. Of 47 Wayne County precincts, the document lists 25 that allegedly showed 100% turnout. Here’s that portion of the document:  This portion of the document isn’t accurate either: None of the 25 precincts listed are actually in Wayne County. Like the 19 precincts cited above, each is located in Minnesota.  Powerline, a conservative blog, was the first to report that the affidavit cited Minnesota rather than Michigan voting jurisdictions. (A possible explanation is Michigan’s postal abbreviation is MI, while Minnesota’s is MN.) Other media outlets confirmed these discrepancies. Voters wait to cast their votes on Nov. 3, 2020, at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. (AP) When we checked data from the office of the Minnesota secretary of state, we found no support for the affidavit’s conclusions. In the five townships cited as having the largest number of over-votes, the number of votes on election day was smaller than the number of registered voters.  For example, the affidavit cites Minnesota’s Benville Township as having 350% voter turnout, which would be by far the largest over-voting rate alleged in the document. Both Giuliani and Trump lawyer Sidney Powell cited the 350% figure in the Nov. 19 press conference.  However, according to the Minnesota Secretary of State’s election data, 63 people voted in the township, and 71 were registered to vote, a turnout rate of 89%.  The Washington Post, which cross-checked numbers from the five precincts alleged to have the highest number of over-votes, found that the Ramsland affidavit overestimated the numbers in all five precincts.  Risikat Adesaogun, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Secretary of State’s office, told PolitiFact that ""we have canvassed at the county level, and we don’t have any clarity about the contents of the affidavit and the source of the alleged data."" Even if the data in the affidavit were accurate, it would do little to further the Trump campaign’s baseless argument that massive voter fraud swung the election to Biden. For instance, election data from the Minnesota secretary of state’s office shows that Benville Township voted overwhelmingly for Trump, not Biden.  It’s unclear what data Ramsland used to arrive at his percentages. We reached out to him but haven’t heard back.  L. Lin Wood, another Trump campaign lawyer, has filed the affidavit as part of a lawsuit in Georgia. When reached by email, Wood called the labeling of the numbers as being from Michigan rather than Minnesota a ""simple mistake"" and said the document ""will be corrected if it hasn’t been already."" ""We are imperfect,"" he told PolitiFact. Giuliani said that in Michigan, ""we have over-votes in numerous precincts of 150%, 200% and 300%."" The numbers come from an affidavit filed by lawyers working for Trump, but the jurisdictions cited are in Minnesota, not Michigan. Furthermore, the Minnesota data cited in the affidavit do not square with actual data from the Minnesota Secretary of State’s office. The official data shows no over-voting.  A Trump campaign lawyer acknowledged a ""simple mistake"" and said the document would be ""corrected."" We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

Biden mischaracterizes teacher layoffs from pandemic
","Speaking about the economic toll facing public schools, President-elect Joe Biden overstated the number of teachers who have been laid off since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. ""There’s already a circumstance where nationwide, because of the requirement of school districts, county offices, mayors, governors having to balance their budgets, they’ve already had to lay off 666,000 teachers,"" Biden said Nov. 18 during a virtual event with frontline workers.  ""666,000 teachers have been laid off already since March,"" he repeated.  Biden is right that the pandemic has challenged public schools. Many teachers are at high risk for severe illness due to COVID-19, and many school districts are strapped for funds as they try to balance their budgets without more assistance from the federal government. But the former vice president’s assertion that schools have laid off 666,000 teachers since March is inflated. The number he cited refers to the roughly 666,000 local government education jobs that went away between March and October, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Not all of those workers were teachers, and not all of them were laid off. The Biden team did not respond to requests for comment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides data that shows net changes in the number of people employed in an industry from month to month. For ""local government education,"" an industry that primarily consists of jobs in public K-12 schools, the data shows that the number of workers dropped from 8,041,600 in March to 7,375,800 in October. That’s a net loss of about 665,800 workers. Between February and October, the decline was about 666,200 workers.  The latter number — 666,200 — was cited in a Nov. 10 report by Pew Charitable Trusts. But Pew described the figure accurately as a net decrease in local government education jobs.  ""Those aren’t necessarily going to be teachers,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute who has written about public education job losses in the pandemic.  A BLS spokesperson said industries such as local government education can contain hundreds of different occupations, from librarians and coaches to administrators and custodial or cafeteria employees. The agency doesn’t collect data that would show job losses just among teachers. In 2019, non-instructional staffers accounted for roughly 30% of all full-time equivalent jobs in public elementary and secondary schools, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The second problem with Biden’s claim is that the 666,000 lost jobs are not all attributable to layoffs. Experts said there’s no data source to show a precise count of how many teachers have been laid off since the start of the pandemic.  First grade teacher Megan Garner-Jones teaches students participating remotely and in person during the pandemic at School 16 on Oct. 20, 2020, in Yonkers, N.Y. (AP) The BLS does track the number of layoffs and discharges by industry each month. But it lumps together data for local government education with state government education, which includes public colleges and universities.  Faced with the health threat of COVID-19, reports show some teachers have also quit, taken leaves of absence or retired. A survey of educators that Education Week conducted in July found many teachers saying they were likely to leave their jobs this year due to the pandemic, although the outlet reported recently that it’s unclear how many actually stepped away. One reason why there haven’t been more teachers laid off is that public sector layoffs often lag when recessions hit, said Kate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality. Another reason is that many school districts are bound by contracts and laws that restrict when teachers can be notified of layoffs. Experts expect more layoffs to hit teachers the longer the recession drags on.  Biden said, ""666,000 teachers have been laid off already since March."" The 666,000 figure comes from federal data, but it doesn’t describe teacher layoffs. We don’t actually know how many teachers have been laid off due to the pandemic. The 666,000 number reflects the net decrease in local government education jobs since March, but it’s not specific to teachers or job losses due to layoffs. It includes job losses by other school staff, such as cafeteria and custodial workers.

Yes, Donald Trump claimed fraud after the 2016 Iowa caucuses
","President Donald Trump telegraphed that he’d claim voter fraud in the November election and carried through with tweets about his unfounded claims of fake votes while simultaneously filing election-related lawsuits.  Republicans came to Trump’s aid. They included Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who defeated Trump in Iowa’s 2016 first-in-the-nation presidential precinct caucuses when Cruz also sought his party’s nomination to be president.  ""I believe President Trump still has a path to victory, and that path is to count every single legal vote that was cast, but also not to [count] any votes that were fraudulently cast or illegally cast. And we have a legal process to determine what’s legal and what isn’t,"" Cruz said in a Nov. 8 Fox Newsinterview on the Sunday Morning Futures program.  On Nov. 11, Cruz told conservative commentator Steven Crowder that overturning the election required Trump’s legal team to run the table in its court challenges to voting in several states:  ""I’ve talked with President Trump and with Jared Kushner and with the White House. What I’ve told them is they need serious lawyers to present evidence at this point. It can’t be won or lost in the world of social media, it’s got to be facts and evidence in court. And by the way, you can do it."" After Cruz’s comments, some Twitter users noted on the social media platform that they had heard about voter fraud before — after Iowa’s 2016 caucuses.  ""Trump is playing you. Before the election even started he admitted he was going to claim fraud if he lost. When he lost the Iowa caucus to Ted Cruz in 2016 he immediately cried that Cruz cheated,"" said one Another said, ""Trump has a history of claiming ‘fraud’ whenever he loses.  Remember the Iowa Caucuses from 2016 with Ted Cruz?""  Rachel Maddow, of MSNBC, quoted a story by colleague Steve Benen: ""Four years ago yesterday, one GOP presidential hopeful – I believe his name was Donald J. Trump – tweeted, ‘Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified’."" A look at Twitter confirms Trump’s post-Iowa tweets from 2016. Trump tweeted several times on Feb. 3, 2016, about Cruz’s win in a caucus system that collects presidential preference votes from Republicans who caucus but no formal, binding vote. In one post-caucuses tweet, Trump wrote, ""Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.""  In another: ""Cruz did not win Iowa, he stole it."" The tweets came two days after the caucuses and after Trump’s concession speech In Iowa. ""We finished second,"" he said in that speech. ""And I want to tell you something, I’m just honored. I’m really honored. And I want to congratulate Ted [Cruz]."" Following Trump’s comments that the caucuses were fraudulent, Cruz took to Twitter, calling Trump’s reaction ""yet another #Trumpertantrum."" When Cruz was asked in 2016 about his comments in a Goffstown, New Hampshire, news conference Cruz said Trump was a person who ""finds it very hard to lose."" When Trump loses, ""he blames everybody else. It’s never Donald’s fault,"" Cruz said, according to The New York Times story from the news conference.  The Des Moines Register reported that former Iowa GOP Chairman Matt Strawn called Trump’s claims of voter fraud ""an absurd allegation."" A 2019 book, ""American Carnage: On the Front Lines of the Republican Civil War and the Rise of President Trump,"" reported that Trump urged Republican Party of Iowa chairman Jeff Kaufmann to invalidate the results of the 2016 caucuses.  Trump abandoned his efforts in Iowa as he went on to win other state primaries and eventually the nomination.  Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, whose office did not have a role in the party-run caucus preference poll, said Iowa Republicans would not invalidate the 2016 caucus results for any reason when asked in a 2019 interview.

"['Coronavirus', 'Ron Paul']","
Biden is not advocating a nationwide lockdown
","With coronavirus cases surging again in the United States, all eyes are on President-elect Joe Biden, who vowed to change the course of the country’s pandemic response.  Biden has promised more vigorous steps than the Trump administration took to mandate wearing masks, improve access to testing and heed scientists’ advice on preventing infection. But former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul declared that Biden’s plans also include a nationwide lockdown, despite recent statements from Biden and his team that it’s not his preferred plan.  In a Nov. 5 Tweet that became a viral Instagram post, Paul said, ""20 million Americans are collecting unemployment, and Biden wants a nationwide lockdown to combat a virus that has a 99%+ survival rate?""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Paul is a libertarian and former physician who represented a Houston-area district in Congress. His tweet mostly gets the numbers right regarding unemployment aid and the COVID-19 survival rate, with the caveat that the survival rate does not include those over age 70. But for this check, we focus on the claim about Biden’s view on a national lockdown similar to the stay-at-home orders and business closures that many local and state governments have enacted. Recent statements from Biden and his advisers have created some confusion about his position on a U.S. lockdown:  In an August interview with ABC’s David Muir, Biden was asked whether he would shut the country down to stop the spread of COVID-19 if scientists recommended it. Biden said, ""I would shut it down; I would listen to the scientists.""   In early September, Biden said, ""There's going to be no need, in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy. I got asked by David Muir a question, if I was asked to shut everything down. I took that as a generic question if — ‘Am I going to follow the science?’"" On Oct. 31, Biden tweeted: ""I'm not going to shut down the country. I'm not going to shut down the economy. I'm going to shut down the virus."" On Nov. 12, as cases began surging nationwide, Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden’s newly formed COVID-19 task force, said he believed locking down the country for four to six weeks could help to slow the spread. Osterholm later clarified that his comments did not represent the views of Biden’s advisory team and had not been vetted by them. After Osterholm’s clarification, a Biden transition official said Nov. 13 that a shutdown ""is not in line with the president-elect’s thinking,"" according to NBC News. The same day, Dr. Celine Gounder, another member of Biden’s COVID-19 task force, said that it is ""not the opinion"" of the group to enact a nationwide lockdown, according to CNBC. She said the task force would prefer a geographically targeted approach to closures and shutdowns.  Misinformation also muddied the waters: Viral posts circulated in October that falsely claimed Biden pledged to lock down the nation until a vaccine is available. Reuters and other fact-checkers found no evidence that Biden said that. Daniel McAdams, executive director of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, said the basis for Paul’s tweet was Biden’s response to Muir in the August ABC interview, when Biden said, ""I would shut it down; I would listen to the scientists."" But Biden qualified his answer by saying he would take the advice of scientists — he did not explicitly say in that interview that he ""wanted"" a shutdown, as Paul claimed. And by the time of Paul’s Nov. 15 tweet, Biden and his advisers had provided more context on their current views about a national lockdown. Biden’s most definitive statement came on Nov. 19, a few days after Paul’s claim. ""I am not going to shut down the economy, period,"" he said in a news conference after a meeting with governors. ""I’m going to shut down the virus, that’s what I’m going to shut down. I’ll say it again: No national shutdown. No national shutdown. Because every region, every area, every community can be different. And so there’s no circumstance which I can see that would require a total national shutdown. I think that would be counterproductive."" In a tweet that became a viral Instagram post, Paul said, ""Biden wants a nationwide lockdown to combat a virus that has a 99%+ survival rate?""  Paul’s post mischaracterized Biden’s position at that time, and Biden has further clarified it since. Biden said in August that he would support a national lockdown if scientists determined it was necessary to curb the disease.  In October, he said he would not shut down the country or economy. And after the election —  before Paul made his claim — Biden and members of his COVID-19 task force indicated again that a nationwide shutdown is not part of their plans. Biden has come out even more forcefully against the prospect of a nationwide shutdown since Paul published his tweet.  While Biden’s earlier comments suggest he is open to seeking a lockdown if it’s warranted, he and his team have made it clear that they neither intend nor want to impose a national shutdown, as Paul claims.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/nov/20/ron-paul/biden-not-advocating-nationwide-lockdown/

Trump again flat wrong with claims about Wisconsin voter fraud
","Continuing his post-election barrage of misinformation, President Donald Trump revived a previously debunked voter fraud claim about Wisconsin on Twitter. He shared a chart Nov. 18, 2020, showing a jump in the number of votes for Democrat Joe Biden about 3:30 a.m. Nov. 4, the morning after the election. He added this commentary: ""Look at this in Wisconsin! A day AFTER the election, Biden receives a dump of 143,379 votes at 3:42AM, when they learned he was losing badly. This is unbelievable!"" Sigh. This jump is actually very believable — and was entirely expected. An array of similar claims surfaced in the days after the election, most based on errant assumptions around a chart from FiveThirtyEight.com that showed a sharp uptick in Biden votes in the wee hours of Nov. 4.  A conservative website trumpeted this as ""Voter Fraud in Wisconsin."" One widely shared Facebook post called it a ""ballot dump,"" while another referred to the votes as being ""found."" Trump also asserted Nov. 4 that his lead in key states ""started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted."" Those claims led to unanimous debunking from an array of fact-checking organizations, including USA TODAY, PolitiFact, AFP and Reuters. But since Trump has raised the issue yet again, with a slightly different chart, let’s review why this claim is absurd. That 3:30 a.m. change simply shows the time when the City of Milwaukee reported its absentee ballot results. This wasn’t surprising because: Milwaukee is a longtime Democratic stronghold. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the city of Milwaukee 77%-18%. We knew well before the election that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to vote absentee. Polling showed 81% of the people planning to vote absentee in Wisconsin supported Biden. We knew it was going to take a long time to count the absentee ballots, leading them to be reported later. Those absentee votes — a total of 170,000 in Milwaukee — were reported together because Milwaukee and 38 other Wisconsin communities used a central count location. Other communities counted absentee ballots at the polling places and reported them earlier along with their in-person vote totals. The ballots took that long to process at central count because Wisconsin law bans clerks from tallying absentee ballots before Election Day. Clerks from both parties have pushed for years for a change in state law, but Republicans who run the Legislature refused to address the matter. As a result, Claire Woodall-Vogg, the executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, said months before the election she didn’t expect to finish that count until the early morning hours of Nov. 4. And that’s exactly what happened. From 3:26 to 3:44 a.m. in The Associated Press election reporting stream, the vote for Biden jumped by 149,520 (9.2% of Biden's total votes) and Trump's vote jumped by 31,803 votes (2% of his total votes). Milwaukee County accounted for nearly all of that jump. The fact that Trump was ""ahead"" before that batch was reported —  as highlighted in Trump’s tweet —  is immaterial. At that point all the votes hadn’t been counted yet. It would be like trying to end a football game when your favorite team is ahead after the third quarter. So Trump’s number may be roughly right. But his explanation of what it means is completely wrong. Trump said Nov. 18 that Wisconsin received a ""dump"" of Biden votes, asserting this is ""unbelievable"" and evidence of fraud. But it’s just evidence of someone who doesn’t understand the vote counting process in Wisconsin. That jump in Biden votes is when Milwaukee reported its 170,000 absentee ballots all at once. We knew long before the election this group would be reported late together and would weigh heavily in Biden’s favor.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2020/nov/20/donald-trump/trump-again-flat-wrong-claims-about-wisconsin-vote/

Research shows cannabis can lower opioid dosage, but studies are preliminary
","State lawmakers so far have filed more than a dozen bills related to marijuana and medical cannabis for consideration during the 2021 legislative session, coming on the heels of a record-breaking 65 marijuana bills filed last legislative session. Proponents of loosening the state’s marijuana prohibitions hope that momentum generated by legalization efforts around the country could carry into Texas, riding on arguments that legalization would be a boon for the economy and an important pillar of criminal justice reform. Rep. Lyle Larson, R-San Antonio, made a different case for medical marijuana when he filed House Joint Resolution 28. In an announcement on Twitter, Larson said the bill would allow voters to decide ""whether Texas physicians should be allowed to prescribe medical cannabis for a variety of illnesses plaguing Texans."" If approved by more than two-thirds of both legislative chambers, a proposal would be added to the November 2021 ballot that would amend the state constitution to legalize the possession, cultivation and sale of cannabis strictly for medical use. Larson cited one statistic to justify his bill: ""Studies have shown up to 75% reduction in opioid dosage for medical cannabis users"" The intersection of medical cannabis and opioid use as treatments for chronic pain is an emerging field of research as more states loosen regulations on medical and recreational use of marijuana. But does science show that cannabis has as great an impact on opioid dosage as Larson claims? Larson’s aides pointed to a report published over the summer by researchers at the University of Arizona that assessed the effectiveness of medical cannabis in reducing opioid dosage for the treatment of chronic pain in non-cancer patients. The analysis looked at nine separate studies involving a total of 7,222 participants across the U.S., Canada and Australia that ""found a much higher reduction in opioid dosage, reduced emergency room visits, and hospital admissions for chronic non-cancer pain by (medical cannabis) users, compared to people with no additional use of"" medical cannabis. Those studies confirm Larson’s assertion: There was a 64% to 75% reduction in opioid dosage when patients supplemented their chronic pain treatments with medical cannabis, and 32% to 59% of cannabis users reported a complete end to opioid use. But University of Arizona researchers note several caveats to these findings. There has generally been ""a dearth of empirical studies"" about the use of cannabis versus opioids in chronic pain treatments. In order to include a large sample size, the researchers ""relaxed inclusion criteria"" in their analysis to allow for the inclusion of observational studies, which are not systematic enough to be considered empirical evidence. For instance, in each of the nine studies, patients were self-reporting their reduction of opioid dosage, implying a degree of uncertainty in the findings. And in several of the studies, patients didn’t report the amount of cannabis used to achieve a reduction of opioid dosage. Furthermore, researchers noted how cannabis can slow a person’s metabolism, thereby causing an opioid medication to absorb into their bloodstream more slowly. This effect can give a patient the impression that their opioid dosage may need to be increased. While studies suggest that cannabis could be used to reduce opioid dosages when treating chronic pain, researchers suggest the findings be interpreted with caution due to limitations in the evidence. The intent of the study is to suggest to the wider medical field that more systematic tests should be conducted, said Dr. Babasola Okusanya of the University of Arizona, who was involved in the study, and the severity of the opioid epidemic should heighten the urgency of these tests. ""Given the current opioid epidemic in the USA and medical cannabis’s recognized analgesic properties, (medical cannabis) could serve as a viable option to achieve opioid dosage reduction in managing non-cancer chronic pain,"" researchers wrote. ""Unfortunately, the evidence from this review cannot be relied upon to promote (medical cannabis) as an adjunct to opioids in treating non-cancer chronic pain."" It would be premature to base legislation on this study’s findings, Okusanya said. ""Although some evidence points to the potential use of medical cannabis for opioid dose reduction in people with non-cancer chronic pain, it is not sufficient to support a legislative bill to make medical cannabis available to people with non-cancer chronic pain,"" he said. While the effects of cannabis on decreasing opioid usage may be inconclusive, other studies have shown that increasing access to marijuana can lead to a reduction in opioid-related deaths. Last year, researchers found that the legalization of recreational marijuana reduced annual opioid mortality between 20% and 35%. ""Recreational marijuana laws affect a much larger population than medical marijuana laws, yet we know relatively little about their effects,"" said Nathan Chan of University of Massachusetts Amherst, who co-authored the study. ""Focusing on the recent wave of recreational marijuana laws in the U.S., we find that opioid mortality rates drop when recreational marijuana becomes widely available via dispensaries."" The Legislature first cracked open the door to medical cannabis in 2015 by creating the Texas Compassionate Use Program. The program limited medical cannabis to low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and could only be used in the treatment of intractable epilepsy. In 2019, the Legislature expanded the program to allow physicians to prescribe medical cannabis to treat several other conditions, including all types of epilepsy, terminal cancer, autism, multiple sclerosis and other neuro-degenerative disorders. Other conditions that medical cannabis advocates pushed for that did not get included in the 2019 expansion include chronic pain and post traumatic stress disorder. During the 2021 session, advocates say they will push to include these conditions under the program and will seek to eliminate restrictions on THC levels in medical cannabis. Currently, state law caps THC in medical cannabis at 0.5% — a level that advocates say is arbitrary. ""Many patients benefit from THC, and it's our position that doctors should be the ones who are making the decision about dosing rather than lawmakers,"" said Heather Fazio, director of the Marijuana Policy Project. ""We trust doctors with far more dangerous drugs."" Larson’s legislative director Caroline Cone echoed that argument. ""Currently, (medical professionals) can't prescribe it, but they can prescribe opioids which have proven to be much more addictive and damaging long term,"" Cone said.

Ron Johnson silent on presidential transition, a reversal of past comments
","In a typical election year, the president-elect already would be meeting with White House officials to ensure a seamless transfer of power in January. This year is far from normal.  President Donald Trump has refused to concede the election to President-elect Joe Biden and has cried fraud despite assurances by election officials that the vote was secure. In Wisconsin, Trump’s campaign requested a recount after the official tally showed him down statewide by nearly 21,000 votes — but only requested ballots in heavily Democratic Milwaukee and Dane counties be examined.  Against that backdrop, most Republican elected officials have been noticeably quiet and haven’t acknowledged Biden’s victory. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson went a step further on Nov. 10, 2020 when asked if he had congratulated Biden. ""Nothing to congratulate him about,"" Johnson told a reporter from The Hill. Johnson’s comment caught our attention because of his previous work on presidential transitions, specifically the need to have a structured process and a smooth transition once an election result is clear.  So we decided to break out our Flip-O-Meter.  Reminder: We’re not measuring whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. We’re just examining whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views. Has Johnson shifted his views on the need to assure a smooth transition? In the past, Johnson has backed multiple efforts to codify standards for the presidential transition process. We’ll start there. In 2015, Johnson introduced legislation — later signed by President Barack Obama — that requires the president to create a White House transition council at least six months before the election. It also outlines duties for a federal transition coordinator, which include negotiating a memorandum of understanding on the transition staff’s access to employees, facilities and agency documents.  ""The peaceful transition of power from one administration to the next is one of the hallmarks of our democracy,"" Johnson said after the bill passed the Senate. ""It is also an enormous undertaking, with complexities that require months of planning in order to be successful."" Fast forward to the 2016 election, when Trump won thanks to narrow victories in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Johnson was quick to acknowledge Trump’s victory after Hillary Clinton conceded — even though results had not been certified by then. ""I can’t wait to work with President Trump,"" he said one day after the election, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. A few years later, Johnson introduced another measure, which requires transition teams to enter into a contract with the General Services Administration, among other provisions. The 2018 bill came after Johnson raised concerns about allegations that the GSA improperly provided transition documents to former special counsel Robert Mueller’s office in the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. ""Regardless of what party wins an election, we need to make sure that handing over the keys to the entire $4.45 trillion federal government is a smooth and secure process,"" Johnson tweeted on March 4, 2020, after Trump signed the bill into law. So Johnson acknowledged Trump as the victor in 2016 before results had been finalized, but seemingly won’t accept unofficial results that point to a Biden win. He also has stressed repeatedly the need for transition planning to begin early and both sides to cooperate — and even sponsored legislation to help guarantee that. The Trump-Biden transition looks remarkably different than past transfers of power. According to Politico, the Trump administration began transition activities in May per federal law, and the White House says it’s doing everything by the book. But more than two weeks after the election, there has been no communication between the Trump White House and the Biden campaign, and Biden’s team has yet to be briefed. Meanwhile, the head of the GSA refuses to sign paperwork that would turn over federal resources for the transition, The Washington Post reported.  Johnson has been quiet since Election Day, but did say this of Trump in a Nov. 7 tweet: ""His unbelievably energetic reelection campaign efforts earned him 200,000 more votes in Wisconsin than in 2016 and once again made pollsters look ridiculous. Regardless of the outcome, in my book he will always be a winner and patriot that truly loves America."" Johnson said he has no problem with Biden’s team receiving high-level intelligence briefings but didn’t call on the GSA to certify Biden as president-elect, Politico reported on Nov. 12. Less than a week later, on Nov. 17, he told the political news website The Recount that Biden is ""starting his transition"" — despite evidence to the contrary. In addition to the recount in Wisconsin, of course, Trump’s campaign has been filing — and generally losing — lawsuits in critical states across the country. The campaign argues many states have not finalized vote totals and, due to various challenges, the outcome of the election is still in doubt. But there was also uncertainty at this stage last time. Green Party candidate Jill Stein soon pursued recounts in three swing states including Wisconsin. Yet the Obama-to-Trump transition had begun and the back-end process was working the way Johnson’s bills intended. A spokesman for Johnson said the senator is confident there will be an orderly transfer of power, but added it’s not his job to certify election results. Of course, no one expects Johnson to certify election results.  The issue in question is whether his approach now — when the results are clear, though not-yet-certified — is the same as it was in 2016, when it was clear Trump had won before results were final. And whether the position taken now is contrary to his past views — and legislation — aimed at ensuring there is a smooth transition. Johnson pushed legislation in recent years to streamline the presidential transition and called the process ""one of the hallmarks of our democracy."" But now, he’s silent as the Trump administration holds up the process and won’t acknowledge Biden as the president-elect. That hardly amounts to the smooth, peaceful transfer of power he worked to embed through bills he sponsored. When it comes to his views on handling the transition, we give Johnson a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2020/nov/20/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-silent-presidential-transition-reversa/
"['Georgia', 'Public Health', 'Coronavirus', 'Raphael Warnock']","
Claim that Ga. Sen. Kelly Loeffler backs ‘getting rid of health care’ partly correct
","Attacks are going extreme in the two Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. The Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat who is challenging Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, was accused by a conservative pundit of running over his wife and having been arrested for obstructing a child abuse investigation. We rated the claim, misleading on both counts, Mostly False. In a lighter response, Warnock used a TV ad to poke fun at attacks on him. ""Raphael Warnock eats pizza with a fork and knife, Raphael Warnock once stepped on a crack in the sidewalk, Raphael Warnock even hates puppies,"" the narrator says, before Warnock makes an attack of his own.  ""Get ready, Georgia, the negative ads are coming,"" a smiling Warnock says. ""Kelly Loeffler doesn’t want to talk about why she’s for getting rid of health care in the middle of a pandemic, so she’s going to try and scare you with lies about me.""   He’s made the health care attack repeatedly. This claim exaggerates, but has some truth to it. To back Warnock’s attack, his campaign cited Loeffler’s Oct. 1 vote to allow the Trump administration to proceed with its support of a lawsuit that aims to overturn the Affordable Care Act. (The specific measure would have blocked the Justice Department from pursuing the lawsuit; Loeffler voted against it.) Overturning Obamacare would eliminate the law’s protections for millions of people with pre-existing conditions. The protections include preventing insurance companies from excluding those people from coverage and limiting the premiums that can be charged to older people. RELATED: PolitiFact fact-checks and articles about the Georgia runoffs While it’s possible the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in the lawsuit Nov. 10, could strike down the entire law, law experts say that’s not the most likely outcome. Still, the lawsuit’s aim is to repeal the law entirely. Warnock’s campaign also argues that the lawsuit would eliminate health care coverage for millions of people who are insured through marketplaces set up by Obamacare or through the law’s expansion of Medicaid.  The New York Times reported that if Obamacare is struck down, 21 million people are at serious risk of becoming uninsured. In addition, Warnock’s campaign cites Loeffler’s support for two measures that would provide health coverage options that it criticizes, arguing that they would result in a loss of health care.  Loeffler supports allowing for more short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans, which she says gives consumers more options. Those plans are exempt from Obamacare’s protections for pre-existing conditions, however. Loeffler also backed a controversial Medicaid waiver, sought by Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and approved by the federal government. Kemp contends the waiver will help residents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidies on the federal marketplace.  But some 400,000 Georgians who bought individual health insurance plans on the federal healthcare.gov Affordable Care Act shopping website will instead have to work through private brokers or insurance companies., Critics say 60,000 Georgians could be left without health insurance. Railing against what she calls the left’s efforts to turn health care into a government-run system, Loeffler on Nov. 13 released a health care plan that she says will protect people with pre-existing conditions while offering them more options. It includes the short-term plans and the Medicaid waiver. It does not include the same robust protections that the federal Affordable Care Act has.  Warnock said Loeffler is ""for getting rid of health care in the middle of a pandemic."" That’s an overly broad statement that could be interpreted any number of ways.  The facts are that Loeffler voted to let the Trump administration continue supporting a lawsuit that seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act. Millions of people could lose health care if the Supreme Court throws out the law. Loeffler supports offering health care alternatives, but critics say they are not as good as Obamacare’s provisions. Warnock’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Our rating is Half True.

David Perdue opposes Biden but didn’t say he’d do everything to ensure he fails
","Jon Ossoff, the Democrat challenging Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., went extreme in describing Perdue’s opposition to President-elect Joe Biden. The documentary filmmaker faces the first-term senator in one of the two Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will decide which party controls the Senate. Ossoff made his attack in a TV ad released Nov. 17 that raises the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Look, the only way to beat this virus is to give our new president the chance to succeed. I'll work with Joe Biden to empower the medical experts to rush economic relief for families and small businesses and invest in infrastructure to jump start our economy,"" he said, looking into the camera. ""But David Perdue says he'll do everything in his power to make sure Joe Biden fails, just like he tried to do with President Obama."" Perdue and Georgia’s other senator, Republican Kelly Loeffler, who faces Democratic pastor Raphael Warnock, are portraying themselves as a ""last line of defense"" against Democrats. We did not find evidence that Perdue has gone as far in his public statements as Ossoff claims, although Perdue clearly is campaigning as a candidate who can block the Democratic agenda. RELATED: PolitiFact fact-checks and articles about the Georgia runoffs An Ossoff news release announcing the ad, referring to the attack on Perdue, links to an Atlanta Journal Constitution news story. The story is about a Nov. 13 campaign appearance by Perdue and Loeffler, which the newspaper said was Perdue’s first of the runoff campaign.  The story’s headline, quoting Loeffler, said: ""‘We are the firewall.’ Senate Republicans prepare to make a stand in Georgia."" But the story does not quote Perdue making any comment about Biden.  When we contacted Ossoff’s campaign, spokeswoman Miryam Lipper said, ""Perdue says and implies on a regular basis that he needs to be a block on the Democratic agenda.""  She cited three recent statements by Perdue: The Georgia Senate seats serve as ""the last line of defense against this liberal socialist agenda the Democrats will perpetrate."" Ossoff and two other Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, ""want to radically change our country. Sign up now to help (Loeffler) and I stop their dangerous agenda!"" ""The Democrats want total control so they can force their dangerous agenda through Congress with no negotiation. I need your help to stop them.""  None of the statements mentions Biden. ""To our knowledge, Senator Perdue has not made any comments about a potential Biden presidency, or how he would react to it in any context,"" Perdue campaign spokesman John Burke told us. Perdue has focused his criticism on other Democratic leaders, including Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both of New York. ""Their plan?"" a Perdue video says. ""Increase taxes. Defund the police. Pass the Green New Deal. Open the borders. .... Eliminate private health insurance….. And pack the Supreme Court."" Biden does not support defunding the police, open borders, or eliminating private insurance. He’s also expressed reservations about the Green New Deal and packing the Supreme Court,. He’s said he would increase taxes only on the wealthy.  At the same time, it’s clear Perdue would be part of Republican efforts to thwart Biden’s agenda. If Ossoff or Warnock loses, Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell would continue as Senate majority leader and ""likely would prevent many of Biden's legislative priorities from enactment and block his judicial nominees from confirmation,"" said Zachary Peskowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta.  But if Ossoff and Warnock win, creating a 50-50 split, he said, the prospects for Biden's priorities ""would improve dramatically"" because Kamala Harris, as vice president, could break tie votes in the Senate. Ossoff claimed that Perdue ""says he'll do everything in his power to make sure Joe Biden fails."" We found no record of Perdue making such remarks about Biden. Perdue is campaigning as a final block against the Democrats’ agenda, but Perdue has focused on others in the Democratic Party such as Schumer and Ocasio-Cortez. We rate Ossoff’s claim Mostly False.

""Since the early days of the pandemic, AARP has warned policymakers on all sides that rationing care based on age or disability is discriminatory,"" Young said in an email.

Trump lawyer falsely claims voting technology companies were created for changing election results
","A member of President Donald Trump’s legal team is falsely claiming that voting machines rigged the presidential race in favor of Joe Biden. In a Nov. 16 interview with Mark Levin, a conservative radio personality, Sidney Powell, a lawyer for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, said the machines that many Americans used to cast their ballots were originally created to falsify election results in Venezuela. ""I’ve got a firsthand witness. In fact I’ve just emailed you an affidavit from a witness who can now be used publicly,"" Powell said during the show. ""It’s redacted in some places but he was present for the creation of the system for this specific purpose of falsifying election results for Hugo Chavez and then (Nicolás) Maduro. They exported this all over Latin America."" ""It’s the Smartmatic and Dominion systems that were built to do this very thing, for changing the results of elections."" Posts with snippets of Powell’s interview have been widely shared on Facebook. They were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The lawyer’s claims have also surfaced on TikTok and been covered by conservative outlets like the Gateway Pundit. Powell joined Trump’s legal team after Election Day to pursue lawsuits in battleground states that the president lost to Biden. She has falsely claimed Trump won the election ""in a landslide,"" shared content related to QAnon, a baseless right-wing conspiracy theory, and said former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian election interference was a plot to force Trump out of office. RELATED: No evidence Dominion Voting Systems caused widespread tabulation errors that flipped votes for Biden We reached out to Powell for a copy of the affidavit she mentioned on Levin’s show or any other evidence to support her claim about Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic. We haven’t heard back.  Powell told Levin that she emailed him a full copy of the affidavit, but we couldn’t find the document published in full by the radio host or any other media outlet. Powell posted screenshots of a few pages of the purported affidavit on her Twitter account. They cite an anonymous whistleblower who says voting machines run by Dominion, Smartmatic and other companies could be susceptible to fraud. The individual claims to have witnessed fraud conducted using Smartmatic voting machines in Venezuela in 2013. What’s visible in the screenshots does not substantiate Powell’s assertion about Dominion and Smartmatic. Other fact-checkers have debunked similar claims. Dominion and Smartmatic are two separate companies that create electronic voting systems. Neither was created for ""changing the results of elections."" Dominion, a company that makes voting machines, was founded in 2003 and has headquarters in Denver and Toronto. Its technology is used to administer elections in 28 states. On its website, Dominion says it has no ties to Smartmatic, another firm that builds electronic voting systems. ""Dominion is an entirely separate company and a fierce competitor to Smartmatic,"" Dominion says on a rumor control page. Since Election Day, Dominion has been the subject of disinformation that seeks to undermine confidence in the integrity of the vote. We previously rated Pants on Fire a claim that the company flipped votes from Trump to Biden in states where the president has brought legal challenges. Smartmatic, which was founded in Boca Raton, Fla., in 2000 and is now based in London, has a similar statement on its website. ""Smartmatic’s software is not licensed or otherwise used by other companies,"" the statement says. Smartmatic voting systems have been used in elections around the world. In Venezuela, the company said its technology was manipulated to report a skewed tally in 2017, but Smartmatic said the incident was an anomaly and likely due to the lack of election monitors. The company stopped its work there in 2018. There is no evidence that technology linked to Smartmatic or Dominion is responsible for changing the outcome of the American presidential election. Smartmatic technology was not used in any of the battleground states won by Biden where Trump allies are disputing the results. RELATED: Trump’s tweet about 2.7 million deleted votes is baseless On its website, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency says bad actors would not be able to change vote counts without being detected even if they tried.

Is Joe Biden right that transition starts with an ‘apparent' winner?
","Eager to embark on the nitty-gritty processes of an administrative transition, President-elect Joe Biden complained about how one federal agency was dragging its feet. In a Nov. 17 discussion with health care workers in Wilmington, Del., Biden criticized the General Services Administration, the low-profile federal agency tasked by law to formally initiate the transition process. ""The law says that the General Services Administration has a person who recognizes who the winner is,"" Biden said during the roundtable. ""And then they have to have access to all the data and information that the government possesses to be prepared. And it doesn’t require there to be an absolute winner. It says the ‘apparent winner.’ The apparent winner. And we’ve been unable to get access to the kinds of things we need to know about."" Biden said the agency’s inaction means that his transition team has been prevented from obtaining key information from the Trump administration — specifically related to any plans for distributing coronavirus vaccines to more than 300 million Americans. Is Biden correct about the legal standard for the General Services Administration to initiate the transition process? Biden is correctly describing the language used in the law: To kick off the formal transition process, the agency administrator needs to determine whether there’s an ""apparent"" winner, rather than an ""absolute"" winner. Biden’s is ""a reasonable statement"" describing the current situation, said Terry Sullivan, a professor at the University of North Carolina who specializes in the presidency.  That said, experts acknowledge that the law is vague enough that the administrator has some leeway in making the ""ascertainment"" decision. The primary law governing transitions, the Presidential Transition Act, took effect in 1964. It has been updated on several occasions, including laws enacted in 2010, 2016, and 2020. The law says, ""The terms ‘President-elect’ and ‘Vice-President-elect’ as used in this Act shall mean such persons as are the apparent successful candidates for the office of President and Vice President, respectively, as ascertained by the Administrator following the general elections held to determine the electors of President and Vice President."" This language triggers the ""expectation that the administrator of the General Services Administration will make a common-sense decision about the election outcome,"" said Paul C. Light, a professor at New York University’s Robert Wagner School of Public Service. Once that decision is made, the legal basis for ""the infrastructure of support"" for a presidential transition is in place, Light said. The president-elect and his team have approximately 11 weeks between Election Day and Inauguration Day to organize the new administration, and prepare to assume national security and homeland security responsibilities from the incumbent, among other tasks, according to a Nov. 13 Congressional Research Service report. In general, presidential transition activities are coordinated by the General Services Administration and the Office of Management and Budget. Once the president-elect and vice president-elect have been ""ascertained"" by the GSA, federal officials are allowed to provide the transition team with facilities, funds, and services to prepare for the new administration. The money can be spent on salaries, consultants, office supplies, travel expenses and government aircraft. The agency’s current administrator, Emily Murphy, has not signed the required ascertainment document yet. ""The administrator is striving to adhere to the language and intent of the law, as well as precedent,"" GSA spokeswoman Pamela Pennington told PolitiFact. ""Please note that the law provides no process or standard by which ascertainment is made."" Prior to Trump, departing presidents have generally adhered to the tradition of a smooth and straightforward transition. The laws governing the transition have enshrined the idea that the outgoing administration ""had a responsibility to hand off matters in a considered and organized fashion,"" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that runs a Center for Presidential Transition that advises on best practices.  RELATED: How we know Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential race Light pointed to a statement by then-GSA Administrator David J. Barram in testimony before Congress in December 2000, at a time when the presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore was so close that it had to effectively be decided by the Supreme Court. ""While the Act gives no explicit criteria or deadlines for making this ascertainment, as the legislative history demonstrates, Congress made it perfectly clear that if there is ‘any question’ of who the winner is ‘in a close contest,’ this determination should not be made,"" Barram testified at the time. In an interview this week on CNN, Barram said the situation now is ""dramatically different"" than what he faced in 2000. ""To me, it's clear that we should be recognizing Joe Biden as the president-elect,"" he said on Nov. 19. The fuzziness in the law has meant that the ascertainment has traditionally been viewed ""as pro forma,"" Stier said. ""The expectation was that it was important and should be done without having to demonstrate an extraordinary level of proof."" The absence of a clear concession and Trump’s continuing efforts to fight the election results are the primary reason why the Trump-to-Biden transition has been so rocky, experts said. ""For 220 years, our country has had a peaceful transition of power,"" said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied transition issues. Trump has not only refused to concede, but he has ""perpetuated the myth that the election was somehow fraudulent,"" she said. Stier argues that, even in the absence of a formal ascertainment, the Trump administration could voluntarily start doing some things to help the incoming administration get ready, such as sharing intelligence, encouraging meetings with public health officials, and allowing security-clearance investigations to begin. ""This is not about some abstract decision that GSA has to make — it’s about choices being made to pursue a policy of noncooperation,"" Stier said. Light lays the blame on Trump, not on Murphy, who he says is required to answer to a vague law. ""Everything here hinges on good faith,"" Light said. ""The GSA administrator may have been well within the boundaries of the statute to deny a formal launch decision, but Trump's interference and threats have poisoned the cooperative relationship that has long marked the process, even after bitter campaigns such as 1980, when Reagan bested Carter for the presidency.""  RELATED: How narrow was Joe Biden’s victory over Donald Trump? Biden said the law governing the transition of presidential power ""doesn’t require there to be an absolute winner. It says the ‘apparent winner.’"" Biden has accurately phrased the language of the law, but the law is vague enough that it allows some leeway in making an ""ascertainment"" decision. It’s worth noting that the Trump administration has impeded a smooth transition in spite of the letter of the law, by challenging election results in courts. We rate the statement Mostly True.

Trump says Philly Democrats stole an election in the '90s. Is that true?
","As part of his relentless campaign against the results of the 2020 presidential election, President Donald Trump on Nov. 13 invoked an old case of voter fraud perpetrated by Philadelphia Democrats that altered the result of a state Senate election.  ""Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!"" Trump tweeted, referring to a federal judge’s determination that Democrats had orchestrated a ""massive scheme"" involving absentee ballots to win a pivotal 1993 race. The judge later removed the Democratic candidate from office and installed his Republican challenger.  But nothing like what happened nearly three decades ago occurred during the 2020 election in Philadelphia or anywhere else. In fact, none of the lawsuits the Trump campaign filed in Pennsylvania after the Nov. 3 election contains even one allegation — let alone evidence — of a single vote being cast illegally because of absentee-ballot fraud.  So what happened in 1993?  Pennsylvania held a special election to replace a Democratic state senator from North Philadelphia who died in office. Most of the voters in the area he represented were registered Democrats, but turnout in previous elections had been low, and the balance of power in the state Senate was on the line.  Whichever party won the special election was poised to capture a majority in the upper house.  To ensure that Democrat William Stinson would win, three Philadelphia election officials illegally delivered hundreds of absentee ballot packets to Stinson’s campaign. Staffers then distributed the packets to voters who didn’t qualify at the time to vote absentee, instructed them in some cases to vote for Stinson, and delivered the ballots to the Board of Elections. The case wound up in federal court after state election officials and state courts rejected Republicans’ claims about impropriety.   ""Stinson knew of and ratified the procedures, and the board participated in and later tried to conceal its involvement in the scheme,"" U.S. District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer said at the time. In February 1994, Newcomer took the unprecedented step of invalidating all 1,757 absentee ballots cast in the election.  Back then, voters were allowed to request absentee ballots only if they were too sick to vote in person or planned to be out of the city on election day. Newcomer heard testimony from dozens of voters who said the Stinson campaign led them to believe the law had changed and they were now allowed to vote from home just for convenience. In dozens of other cases, the campaign simply forged the signature of voters.  In the end, Newcomer ordered that Stinson, a then 49-year-old former assistant deputy mayor of Philadelphia, be removed from office and that Republican Bruce Marks, a then 36-year-old lawyer and former aide to U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, replace him.  ""This is extraordinary relief,"" Newcomer wrote in February 1994. ""However, it is appropriate because extraordinary conduct by the Stinson campaign and the board tainted the entirety of the absentee ballots."" The following month, The Philadelphia Inquirer published an exhaustive examination of the absentee ballots cast in the Stinson-Marks contest and revealed that 540 absentee ballots, nearly a third of the total, were tainted by some form of improper conduct, including voters’ signatures being forged, ballots cast in the names of dead or out-of-district voters, and campaign workers marking ballots themselves. The race was close enough to turn the loss into a win for the Democrats. The 2020 presidential election and this 1993 state Senate special election differ in several key ways.  Campaigns are still barred from distributing absentee ballots to voters, but Pennsylvania now allows residents to vote by mail without giving a reason — the very conduct that was barred during the 1993 special election.  And critically, unlike the Marks campaign, which sought relief for specific allegations of voter fraud, the Trump campaign has not alleged in court that any mail ballots were intentionally cast illegally. Rather, the campaign has been seeking to disqualify ballots submitted by lawful voters based on claims about counting procedures and other rules.  Trump tweeted that a 1993 example of voter fraud in Philadelphia is ""exactly what happened to us"" in the 2020 election.  It is not, and there is no evidence the Trump campaign is making that argument in court. The 1993 case at the heart of Trump’s tweet involved a rare, verified case of voter fraud. The Trump campaign has not alleged a specific case of voter fraud in Pennsylvania, and there is no evidence of any. Trump’s statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.  We rate it Pants on Fire. ",/factchecks/2020/nov/19/donald-trump/trump-says-philly-democrats-stole-election-90s-tru/
