Sen. Mike Enzi says Senate health care bill will leave 24 million uninsured
","
Republican Sen. Mike Enzi, whom Democrats had once hoped to woo for bipartisan support of a health care bill, attacked the version put forth on Nov. 18, 2009, by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.
 
""Like the Pelosi bill, the Reid bill is government-centered, not patient-centered,"" Enzi said ""It’s chock-full of new taxes and higher health care costs that would threaten jobs, weaken our economy, punish families and small businesses trying to make ends meet, and stick our children and grandchildren with the bill.""
 
That's all pretty standard fare from Republican opponents of the Democratic health care plans being debated in Congress. But we were intrigued by another criticism leveled by the Wyoming senator, that the Senate bill ""would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage.""
 
That uninsured figure cited by Enzi comes from an analysis of the Reid bill by the Congressional Budget Office. The report concludes that under the Reid bill, the share of legal nonelderly residents with insurance coverage would rise from about 83 percent currently to about 94 percent. Specifically, the report estimated that the number of nonelderly people who are uninsured would be reduced by about 31 million by 2019, leaving about 24 million nonelderly residents uninsured.
 
So who are those 24 million who would be left uninsured?
 
About a third of them are illegal immigrants, the CBO report states.
 
So who are the other two-thirds (16 million) left uninsured?
 
We asked three health care experts: John Holahan at the Urban Institute; Leighton Ku, a professor of health policy at George Washington University; and Kathleen D. Stoll, director of Health Policy at Families USA. They said those people mostly fall into several main categories:
 

•

People who are deemed able to afford health insurance but simply decide the tax penalties are not high enough to persuade them to buy it. Some young, healthy people, for example, may decide it's cheaper to simply pay the tax penalty rather than purchase insurance, Stoll said. The same is true for some wealthy people who are self-insured.
 
""These are basically people who say, 'It's not worth it to me,' "" Ku said.
 

•

People exempt from tax penalties because the cost of health insurance comes to more than 8 percent of their income, even if they are getting federal subsidies. These are generally people with a lower income, but not so low as to qualify for Medicaid. Without a penalty, many of those people may decide to continue not to buy insurance.
 
""These are people on the lower end of the income scale, but not the poorest of the poor,"" Ku said, generally people who make anywhere from 133 percent to 300 percent of the poverty level.
 

•

People who are eligible for Medicaid, but simply don't sign up. Some people just think it's a hassle to sign up for insurance, even when it's free, Ku said.
 
About 60 percent of people eligible for Medicaid today simply don't sign up, Holahan said. ""People with very low incomes don't always know how to navigate a lot of things in life. People don't necessarily value health care, and they don't take the time to fill out the necessary paperwork.""
 

•

Then there are those who are in transitional stages of life -- perhaps a job change -- and don't take steps to close the insurance gaps between jobs.
 
The CBO report found that the Senate bill was less effective in reducing the number of uninsured compared to the version of the health care bill that passed the House. While the Senate version was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by 31 million (leaving 24 million uninsured), the House plan was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by about 36 million, leaving about 18 million uninsured.
 
That's largely because the House tax penalty for not getting insurance is a lot harsher. Under the House bill, people who refuse to purchase health insurance will be hit with a tax penalty equivalent to 2.5 percent of their adjusted gross income. The Senate plan calls for a tax penalty of $95 in 2014, going up to $350 in 2015, $750 in 2016, and graduated up in ensuing years based on inflation adjustments.
 
Given differences between the House and Senate bills that cause the Senate plan to leave more uninsured, we certainly think it's fair for a senator to criticize the plan in that regard.
 
But since this criticism comes from a Republican senator, we would be remiss if we did not point out several other political realities.
 
A CBO analysis of the main Republican health care plan, which was put forward by House Republican leader John Boehner, concluded it would reduce the number of uninsured by only about 3 million people (as opposed to 31 million in the Reid plan).
 
""It has not been a particularly high priority for the Republican Party to expand the number of people who get health insurance coverage,"" Ku said.
 
Again, a third of the people who would remain uninsured under the Reid plan are illegal immigrants. You may recall that many Republicans criticized Democrats for not taking enough precautions to ensure that illegal immigrants are barred from a public option and also argued that illegal immigrants ought to be prohibited from buying insurance in any government-sponsored health insurance exchange.
 
And the biggest factor accounting for fewer uninsured in the Reid plan, as opposed to the House plan, is that the Senate plan has less severe penalties for those who do not buy insurance. But many conservatives have criticized Democrats for the mandate, arguing that the government ought not get involved in requiring health insurance.
 
Still, the bottom line is that Enzi said the Reid plan would leave 24 million people uninsured, and the CBO confirms that figure. We rate his statement True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Joe Lieberman']","
The public option was not discussed much during the campaign
","
Democrats hoping to pass health care legislation through the Senate need 60 votes to begin consideration of the bill and, ultimately, to pass it. That means every Democrat and the two independents who generally vote with them need to approve.


One of those independents is Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. Lieberman favors health care reform but opposes the public option. He

told Politico

that he was keeping ""all my options open"" when it comes to votes on health care.


He said the public option has only recently become a key part of Democratic plans for a health care overhaul.


""It's classic politics of our time that if you look at the campaign last year, presidential, you can't find a mention of public option,"" Lieberman said. ""It was added after the election as a part of what we normally consider health insurance reform — insurance market reforms, cover people, cover people who are not covered.""


Politico pointed out, correctly, that Lieberman was wrong about the public option being added after the election. It was part of Obama's plans released publicly during the campaign.


But we wanted to check his statement that during the 2008 presidential election, ""you can't find a mention of public option.""


Here at PolitiFact, we covered the Democratic primaries and examined the candidates' plans for health care reform in great detail. The most contentious issue during the primary was support for what is known as the individual mandate -- the requirement that everyone have health insurance or face a tax penalty. We don't recall any significant discussion of a public option, nor did we do any Truth-O-Meter items on it during the campaign.


To make sure we weren't missing anything, we conducted a database search of campaign coverage by all news outlets. We found very few news reports during the campaign that mentioned the public option or a public plan as part of Obama's health proposals, with the notable exception of a

New York Times

story published on May 30, 2007, headlined, ""




Obama

calls for wider and less costly





health

care coverage.

""


Here's what the

Times

reported:


""Mr. Obama would create a public plan for individuals who cannot obtain group coverage through their employers or the existing government programs, like Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. Children would be required to have health insurance. Subsidies would be available for those who need help with the cost of coverage.


""He would also create a National Health Insurance Exchange, a regulated marketplace of competing private health plans intended to give individuals other, more affordable options for coverage. The public plan would compete in that Insurance Exchange, advisers said.""


The Obama campaign mentioned the public option briefly in its health position paper and on its Web site. A typical description went like this:


""The Obama-Biden plan will create a National Health Insurance Exchange to help individuals purchase new affordable health care options if they are uninsured or want new health insurance. Through the Exchange, any American will have the opportunity to enroll in the new public plan or an approved private plan, and income-based sliding scale tax credits will be provided for people and families who need it. ... The Exchange will require that all the plans offered are at least as generous as the new public plan and meet the same standards for quality and efficiency.""


But there was little discussion about the public option. The debate in both the primary and the general election focused on the mandate, costs and covering the uninsured. We found the public option mentioned in only 70 articles or transcripts during the entire campaign and months prior to the inauguration.


It wasn't until after Obama took office that there was sustained attention to the issue. There were 50 items published between January and May and then coverage exploded this past summer. Major newspapers produced about 650 significant stories or op-eds on Obama and the public option in June, July and August.


Lieberman was wrong that the public option was added after the election, but he makes a valid point that it wasn't emphasized or discussed much during the campaign. Lieberman said, ""It's classic politics of our time that if you look at the campaign last year, presidential, you can't find a mention of public option."" We found a few mentions, but the public option was not at all a significant point of debate during the presidential campaign. So we rate Lieberman's statement Mostly True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Orrin Hatch']","
Hatch says Senate health care bill is longer than 'War and Peace'
","
They are both epic works of literature. One begins like this:


""Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.""


The other starts like this:


""Part A of title XXVII of the Public Health Service 10 Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg et seq.) is amended (1) by striking the part heading and inserting the following: 13 ‘‘PART A—INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP MARKET REFORMS’’; (2) by redesignating sections 2704 through 2707 as sections 2725 through 2728, respectively (3) by redesignating sections 2711 through 2713 as sections 2731 through 2733, respectively . . . ""


The first passage comes from Leo Tolstoy's

War and Peace

. The second comes from Harry Reid's health care bill. Republicans have been comparing them to make the point that the Democratic plan is big and will lead to a bloated bureaucracy. In a Nov. 19, 2009, news release, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said that the 2,074-page bill was ""longer than Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy’s

War and Peace

.""


We decided to see if he was right.


The Oxford World's Classics paperback edition of

War and Peace

weighs in at 1,392 pages, according to Amazon.com. By that measure, the 2,074-page Senate bill would indeed be longer.

 

But using pages as the benchmark is misleading. The page layout of a Senate bill is much different from a novel. The bill uses much larger type, on 8.5-by-11-inch paper. The margins are larger and there are wider spaces between the lines. On balance, then, fewer words fit on a page of the Senate bill than fit on the page of the paperback novel.

 

So for an accurate comparison, you need to count words. That's not perfect either, since the Senate bill (like its House counterpart, which checked in at just under 2,000 pages) has lots of line-by-line numbering, section headers, and various forms of coding that complicate the process of word counting. But it's still the best method available.

 

To count the words in

War and Peace

, we relied on a feature on Amazon.com called ""Search Inside!"" that quantifies the books it sells on various measurement scales. That function found that the Oxford paperback version of

War and Peace

, an English translation, has 561,893 words. (In an accompanying chart, Amazon notes that 0 percent of books it studied have more words than that, so Hatch has picked the the right epic novel for his comparison.)

 

As for the bill, we cut and pasted it into a Microsoft Word document and found that the bill contained 384,067 words. Just to make sure that Word wasn't choking on such a large file, we did a sampling of word counts on individual pages, then multiplied the typical one-page count by the total number of pages in our Word document. The single pages we checked tended to have a bit fewer than 300 words per page in Word. So, with our document running to 1,372 pages -- shrinkage that illuminates how spread-out the text of the Senate bill is -- we came up with a ballpark estimate of 411,000 words.

 

That last estimate is a bit higher than what the Microsoft's word count function found, but not by much. Either way, Reid's health care bill is actually shorter than

War and Peace

.
 
So while Hatch is right if you simply count pages, when you use a more accurate comparison -- the number of words --

War and Peace

is actually longer. In other words, he is right by one measurement, but not by the best measurement. So it turns out that Democrats aren't as wordy as a Russian novelist. Who knew?
 
We find his claim Barely True.

Chain e-mail claims Obama closed offshore tax safe havens
","
We got a chain e-mail recently that purports to list 90 accomplishments from President Barack Obama's first six months in office.
 
Unlike most chain e-mails we get, this one was signed by its author, Robert Watson, a professor of American Studies at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla. Watson said he spoke last spring at Democratic political clubs and was asked by some members to compile the list as talking points to balance some of the claims about the Obama administration coming from Republicans. The list has since gone viral, and now Watson fields several calls and e-mails every day challenging him on some of the entries.
 
We decided to look into a handful of items on the list to see if they check out.
 
Here, we look at No. 46, that Obama ""closed offshore tax safe havens.""
 
On May 4, 2009, the White House issued a detailed, six-page plan to curb overseas tax havens and remove tax incentives for companies to shift jobs overseas. The plan to ""get tough"" on overseas tax havens included eliminating loopholes for certain offshore subsidiaries; cracking down on the abuse of tax havens by individuals; and putting more resources into IRS enforcement to help close the international tax gap.
 
And in late October, the House and Senate introduced the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2009, which seeks to crack down on Americans hiding their assets in overseas tax havens.
 
The president promptly issued a statement in support of the legislation.
 
""Shortly after taking office, I laid out a set of proposals to crack down on illegal overseas tax evasion,"" Obama stated. ""The legislation introduced today would fulfill that promise, putting a stop to billions of dollars worth of abuses. I look forward to working with Congress to turn these proposals into law so that honest Americans no longer shoulder the burden of the few individuals and businesses that put profit before responsibility.""
 
Although the legislation enjoys the support of the White House, it is likely to face strong opposition from corporations that do considerable business overseas. According to a story in the

New York Times

, ""about 200 companies and trade associations, including Microsoft Corp., General Electric Co. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, signed a letter stating that the proposed changes to the tax code would put them at a disadvantage with their rivals.""
 
In other words, it's premature to put this one in the ""Obama Accomplishments"" column.
 
Watson acknowledged as much when we spoke to him on Nov. 19.
 
""The president started it, and Congress is now looking at it, but it's not a done deal,"" he said.
 
And so we rate this one Half True.

Chain e-mail claims Obama has visited more countries in first six months of presidency than predecessors

We got a

We decided to look into a handful of items on the list to see if they check out.
 
Here, we look at No. 34, that Obama has ""visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office.""
 
In the first six calendar months of his presidency, Obama did far more international travel than his previous five predecessors, according to

an analysis

by Brendan Doherty, an assistant professor of political science at the U.S. Naval Academy, for the White House Transition Project. In all, the study found, Obama traveled to 13 countries in his first six months in office. That's far more than George W. Bush, seven in 2001; Bill Clinton, one in 1993; George H.W. Bush, nine in 1989; Ronald Reagan, one in 1981; and Jimmy Carter, two in 1977.
 
Obama has also met with more heads of state. According to Doherty's analysis, seven of Obama’s 13 stops were bilateral visits with the head of state of another country; while 15 of the 20 journeys made by Obama's five predecessors combined were bilateral meetings with other heads of state.
 
""Examination of the first six months of President Barack Obama’s international and domestic travel reveals an active chief executive,"" Doherty concluded. ""His record-setting pace of travel abroad reflects the many international challenges facing the United States at the beginning of his administration.""
 
The U.S. Department of State posts

historical data

on presidential travel abroad, which allowed us to look back even further, to the 13 presidents before Carter, all the way back to Theodore Roosevelt. None come even close to Obama's international travel record for the first six months.
 
According to a Nov. 11, 2009

story

by CBS News' Mark Knoller, who keeps meticulous records on presidential travel, Obama has traveled abroad more in his first year in office than any other president in history, and the year isn't even finished yet. According to Knoller's story, ""Foreign travel by American presidents is a relatively new practice. No sitting U.S. president left the country until Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. He made a single foreign outing: a three-day visit to Panama in November of that year to inspect construction of the Panama Canal.""
 
Including his most recent Asia trip, Knoller notes that Obama has taken eight foreign trips to 20 countries.
 
Make what you will of Obama's globe-trotting, Watson's e-mail is correct that Obama has visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office. We rate it True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Stimulus', 'Recovery.gov']","
Recovery.gov shows jobs in Congressional districts that don't exist
","The Obama administration has promoted its Web site Recovery.gov as a bold new step in government transparency and a convenient way for voters to see that the economic stimulus program is working. The Web site makes the case that the stimulus has created tens of thousands of jobs by listing money spent and jobs created or ""saved."" It uses sophisticated mapping to show where the projects are located.   But it's also been a target for stimulus critics who contend that the site uses sloppy bookkeeping and overly generous assumptions to present data that they say is simply political propaganda. The critics were quick to highlight an ABC News report that the Web site shows jobs for Congressional Districts that don't exist.   The Obama administration acknowledged the mistakes and said that some of the data was entered incorrectly. Two days after ABC News reported on the problem with Congressional districts, the Recovery.gov Web site had changed the data from imaginary district numbers to ""unassigned"" districts.   But we were intrigued by ABC's report and decided to dig into the data a little deeper.   We selected the state of Florida and noted, before the data was changed, that it listed congressional districts that don't exist. There are 25 Congressional districts in the state, but the site listed projects in the 34th, 35th, 53rd, and 88th districts. It also listed one project in the ""00th"" district. (See  the page we archived here  .)   For our fact-checking purposes, we decided to select one of the non-existent Florida districts at random and see if we could discover what was going on. We selected the 34th District, which listed 52 jobs and $1,810,857.   After searching Recovery.gov a few different ways, we finally found the project: It was for the Hialeah Housing Authority, an agency in South Florida, to modernize and update its public housing. ""This funding can be expected to result in providing employment for construction workers and product manufacturers,"" said the project page on Recovery.gov. It said the money was being used for roofing and bathroom work and cabinet installations. The Congressional district was listed as 34, but it actually belongs in the 21st, which is represented by Republican Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart.   We couldn't reach anyone with the Hialeah Housing Authority. But there were four major contractors listed for the Hialeah Housing Authority's project, and we were able to find one of them, Greystroke Construction Inc. Owner Gustavo Blazquez confirmed his work for the authority, and said he assigned about six employees to the project. The work -- replacing cabinets in individual public housing units --had been going on for three months and he expected it to go for three more.   Blazquez confirmed the project details listed on Recovery.gov, including that he was one of several contractors who got a piece of the grant. Hialeah is near Miami, and the construction industry there has been hit hard by the housing bust, he said. ""We've got a bare bones crew, and we're trying to survive,"" he said. ""It's helped us keep a small amount of employees, but for how long?""   Blazquez said he's in the process of bidding for more work from the housing authority.   The Hialeah project highlights some important caveats -- some might consider them flaws -- in the Obama administration's accounting. The concept of jobs ""saved"" is nebulous and raises questions. Those six people Blazquez employs are listed as jobs ""saved or created"" on the Recovery.gov Web site, but it is a contract for short-term work. Those six people could very well be out of a job in three months -- even though the Obama administration touts them as holding new jobs.   Counting jobs ""created or saved"" is also under scrutiny from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an independent agency that does investigations for Congress. The legislation that created the stimulus also charged the GAO with monitoring jobs reported, and the GAO filed its first report on Thursday.   The report found that while agencies and employers were making good-faith efforts to report data, there was evidence that data reporting has been inconsistent. ""Even recipients of similar types of funds appear to have interpreted the reporting guidance in somewhat different ways and took different approaches in how they developed their jobs data,"" the report said.   The guidelines require employers to report full-time equivalents, or FTEs, on a quarterly basis for the duration of the project. That means the total hours worked divided by the number of hours in a full time schedule, as defined by the recipient. This is to account for people who work part-time.   The GAO report said that some employers and government agencies have been confused by the process and haven't followed the guidelines for determining FTEs, particularly using different time periods to calculate FTEs. In some cases, agencies didn't specify a time period to use. Housing authorities in particular had trouble because they have little experience with reporting employment data, according to the report.   We can't independently confirm whether the Hialeah Housing Authority appropriately reported its data on jobs created. But we do know they misreported their Congressional district. Still, it appears to be construction work that should have some stimulative effect.   When you hear the Obama administration cite the number of jobs saved or created, you may get the impression that they are referring to long-term, permanent jobs. But that is not the case. In many cases the jobs on Recovery.gov and cited by the administration represent contract jobs that are full-time but end after a short period of time.   We should also note this isn't the first time that we've seen problems with the Obama administration's aggressive counting of jobs created or ""saved"" under its stimulus plan. Back in May, President Barack Obama said the economic stimulus has ""  saved or created nearly 150,000 jobs  "" in its first 100 days. That was an estimate created by White House economic advisers, and independent economists we interviewed said that it was far too early to create a definite projection with a high level of accuracy. So we rated his statement Barely True. On the other hand, our reporting has also found the stimulus is properly credited for contributing to 3.5 percent growth in the Gross Domestic Product during the third quarter. Talk show host Rush Limbaugh said all that was due to  Cash for Clunkers and a homebuyers tax credit  , but we found that Half True.   Recovery.gov is a useful Web site for finding information on specific projects funded by the stimulus, but its rah-rah claims for job creation need some important context and explanation. We are not trying to suggest that the stimulus is doing nothing, but we don't believe that a six-month temporary job is what most people think of when they hear of a job saved or created.   In the claim we're examining here, Recovery.gov reported that 52 jobs have been saved or created in Florida's 34th Congressional District. The 34th District doesn't exist, and that's the result of a data entry error. The jobs are actually in the 21st District, and we know that work is being done there after we spoke with one of the contractors. But those still are short-term construction jobs. In the example we chose, we've seen enough questions about the data to give us significant pause. We rate the statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2009/nov/19/recoverygov/recoverygov-shows-jobs-congressional-districts-don/

Rendell says small businesses receiving health insurance subsidies couldn't offer plans that cover abortion
","
An amendment to the House health care bill continues to inspire political passions, driving a wedge between abortion-rights supporters who are outraged at what they consider a major loss for women's rights, and Democratic lawmakers who fear seeing their long-awaited health care reform effort stalled due to the debate.


The amendment -- a last-minute addition that passed, 240-194, with support from Republicans and antiabortion Democrats -- establishes restrictions on how abortion can be covered under the health care bill's insurance ""exchanges."" These exchanges are designed to help people buy coverage if they are not currently insured, or if they work for businesses that are too small to feasibly offer health coverage to their employees.


Essentially, the Stupak-Pitts amendment bars abortion coverage for those who choose the ""public option,"" which is the House bill's federally administered, but privately funded, insurance plan. (Cases of rape, incest or life of the mother are exempted.) The amendment also prevents anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from purchasing a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange.


However, the amendment does allow people in the exchange to choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without using federal subsidies. And those who accept subsidies can still purchase an abortion ""rider"" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money.


But in a Nov. 12 appearance on MSNBC's

Rachel Maddow Show

, Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, added a new layer of concern for abortion-rights advocates. Rendell said that in addition to erecting hurdles for individuals who receive federal subsidies, the amendment would also make it harder to secure abortion coverage if you happen to work for a company that gets federal subsidies.


""Take a small business that's receiving a tax credit, a federal tax credit, to provide health care for its employees,"" Rendell said. ""They would be barred under the Stupak Amendment from allowing their employees to use their -- the health care that they offer them for abortion. They would be absolutely disallowed from doing that.""


Let's start by looking at the small-business subsidy Rendell is referring to. According to Section 521 of the House health care bill, small businesses can receive federal tax credits for providing employees with health coverage. The tax credit would be equal to half the amount paid by the employer for health coverage, though the law also sets limits based on the size of the company and the average wages. It also says that companies can only receive the credit for two years.


The amendment clearly states that government funds cannot be used to pay for abortion coverage. So it seems to us -- and experts we spoke to agreed -- that just as subsidized individuals cannot buy a full plan that covers abortion, a small business receiving the credits could not purchase a plan that includes abortion coverage.


To a degree, then, Rendell is right: The amendment would affect people on the exchange if their company received health care subsidies, even if they paid their share of the premium entirely out of their own pocket and they did not personally receive subsidies from the government.


However, Rendell left out an important factor. Just as individuals who receive subsidies can still purchase abortion riders on the exchange, so too can individuals who work for a small business that receives tax credits. In addition, our experts said that nothing in the legislation would stop companies from offering abortion riders for their employees; the funds would need to be paid out of the employees' pockets, not the company's. Such a process already occurs in some of the states that have laws on the books that are similar to the Stupak amendment.


We give Rendell credit for noting the often overlooked impact the amendment would have on abortion options for employees of subsidized small businesses. He's right that the company cannot simply offer a single, comprehensive health care plan that includes abortion. But both the individuals and the companies in question can purchase separate riders that cover abortion, which suggests that the term ""absolutely disallowed"" is inaccurate. This may be cold comfort to abortion-rights advocates, who are generally skeptical of the value of riders, saying that companies may not offer them and that individuals may not purchase them. But it earns Rendell a Barely True.

Wyden mistakenly lowballs number of people eligible for public option
","
The House health care bill, with its exchanges, public option and nearly 2,000 pages of densely worded text, isn't the easiest thing to comprehend. So it's not surprising that even a senator with years of experience in health care policy can make a mistake while explaining it.


In a Nov. 17, 2009, appearance on MSNBC's

Morning Meeting With Dylan Ratigan

, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he's trying to prod Senate leaders into including a version of the public option that goes further than what's in the House bill. The public option would be a government-run plan offered as one of many alternatives on the new health care ""exchange."" The exchange is designed to help uninsured Americans, as well as those who don't work for an employer who offers health coverage, find reasonably priced health insurance. Beyond some startup money from the federal government, the public option would be paid for entirely by patient premiums.


Wyden argued during his MSNBC appearance that a public option that reaches more Americans than the one in the House bill would have a better chance of ensuring competition for private insurers. And that, in turn, would promote cost control and improve customer benefits. In explaining how limited the current House bill version is, Wyden said, ""Something like 2 percent of the people would [be] eligible even to get the public option.""


That's not correct. The Congressional Budget Office -- the nonpartisan group whose estimates on the cost and impact of proposed bills are considered definitive -- said otherwise in an Oct. 29, 2009, letter to Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.


The CBO estimated that by 2019 -- the final year of the office's 10-year forecast -- 30 million people would be insured through plans offered on the exchange. But the CBO predicted that most of those 30 million would choose plans from private insurers. Only 6 million, or one of every five people buying on the exchange, would select the public plan, according to the CBO's estimate. (Anyone who's eligible to purchase insurance on the exchange would be able to choose either the public option or a plan offered by private insurers.)


Now, 6 million people buying the public option amounts to just over 2 percent of the 282 million Americans who are under age 65 (that is, the 282 million Americans who aren't eligible for Medicare, the universal health insurance program for the elderly). But contrary to what Wyden said, it's not that 2 percent of Americans will be

eligible

for the public option in 2019; it's that 2 percent will

choose

the public option that year, according to CBO's estimate.


The actual number of people eligible to choose the public option would be the entire pool of 30 million Americans in the exchange -- almost 11 percent of the under-65 population, or five times the proportion that Wyden indicated.


When we spoke to Wyden's office, a spokeswoman immediately acknowledged that the senator had misspoken. In fact, when he returned to a different MSNBC program that night --

Countdown with Keith Olbermann

-- he said, correctly, that the public option ""has 6 million people in it.""


So while we applaud Wyden for correcting himself after the fact, his original comment was incorrect. So we're rating his statement False.

"['National', 'Energy', ""America's Natural Gas Alliance""]","

Industry group claims that we have 100 years' worth of natural gas
","
With Congress debating cap-and-trade legislation, we've seen a lot of television ads promoting the benefits of various fuels: coal, wind, solar -- you name it.

 

Recently, an ad sponsored by America's Natural Gas Alliance caught our eye.

 

In it, a mother tells her daughter that the United States has ""more than 100 years of natural gas.""

 

That's a lot of natural gas, so we decided to look into the claim.

 

America's Natural Gas Alliance, a group backed by the top natural gas producing companies in the nation, told us the figure came from a June 18, 2009, report by the Potential Gas Committee, a panel associated with the Colorado School of Mines and financially supported by the natural gas industry.

 

According to the committee, the nation has about 2,074 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Most of it is in the Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky Mountains, the Atlantic Coast and the Midwest. That figure includes 238 trillion cubic feet of proved gas reserves as established by the Energy Department and about 1,836 trillion cubic feet of what the school calls technically recoverable natural gas.

 

Let's pause to go over some energy nomenclature. The phrase ""technically recoverable"" has to do with how much natural gas is available using current technology; this is the amount of natural gas the Potential Gas Committee looked at. The term ""proved reserves"" is used to describe natural gas that is economically viable, and usually reflects sources that have already been tapped by natural gas companies. Proved reserves are tracked by the government through Securities and Exchange Commission filings because natural gas companies list their sources as capital assets. Recently, reserve estimates have been on the rise due to the extraction of gas from shale deposits, rock that holds natural gas and was, until recently, relatively expensive and difficult to harvest.

 

If you multiply 23 trillion cubic feet, the amount of natural gas used annually in the United States, by 100, you get 2,300 trillion -- roughly the amount the Colorado School of Mines has estimated.

 

So, by one standard, America's natural Gas Alliance is in the ballpark.

 

However, by another standard the group is pretty far off; the United States Geological Survey and the Minerals Management Survey say there's only about 1,162.7 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable natural gas available, a total of 1,400 trillion metric tons when paired with the government's proved reserve estimate. Using the same math, there's only about 61 years of natural gas in the United States.

 

What's more, energy experts we spoke with said that America's Natural Gas Alliance's use of technically recoverable estimates should come with an important caveat.

 

""Right now, we are awash in natural gas,"" said Vincent Matthews, Colorado's state geologist. ""But it's not about the reserves or resources. It's about how fast we can get it out of the ground and whether it's economically viable.""

 

Indeed, the price of natural gas has hovered around $4 per million British thermal units over the last few months, while the price of the same unit of oil has been as high as $9 more during the same period, according to the Energy Information Administration.

 

So, relatively low natural gas prices might be good for consumers, but they don't make production cost-effective for producers, Miller said.

 

Richard Heinberg, a senior fellow at the Post Carbon Institute, echoed the concern.

 

One hundred years ""is a hugely inflated number,"" he said. ""What price does natural gas have to be at to justify extraction? It needs to be $8 or more.""

 

So, by one estimate, the natural gas industry is correct that we have about 100 years' worth of natural gas. But another estimate disputes that total. Furthermore, geologists and energy experts warn that the higher number is somewhat misleading because it includes natural gas that is not economicaly viable to extract. Given that those important elements were not mentioned in the commercial, we give America's Natural Gas Alliance a Half True.

Palin claims Reagan faced a worse recession than Obama
","
It's no secret that Republicans love Ronald Reagan. So it's no surprise to see Sarah Palin, in her new book

Going Rogue: An American Life

, burnishing the reputation of the Gipper -- and taking a shot at the current president while she's at it.


""Our nation is facing great challenges, but I'm optimistic -- and I know there is a way forward,"" she writes. ""Ronald Reagan faced an even worse recession. He showed us how to get out of one.""


Was the Reagan recession really worse than the current one? We consulted economists and historians and examined statistics to determine if she's right.


Here are how some of the key factors stack up.


--

Length of the recession

. Dating the Reagan recession is somewhat tricky. The National Bureau of Economic Research -- the official arbiter of recession-dating -- classifies one recession as lasting from January 1980 to July 1980 and a second as running from July 1981 to November 1982. The first occurred wholly on President Jimmy Carter's watch, while the second was entirely under Reagan. However, some economists contend that the two recessions actually amount to one ""double-dip"" recession.


The maximum length of the early-1980s recession is nearly three years, but counting the double-dip recessions together while excluding the months of expansion between them leaves 23 months of recession. That's exactly the same length as the Obama recession, which began in December 2007 and continues through today. The whole early 1980s period was longer, but the Obama recession looks likely to continue for at least a little while longer.



VERDICT: Call it a wash -- for now.



--

Economic growth or contraction

. During the double-dip recession, inflation-adjusted GDP declined by 0.6 percent over the full three-year period -- far less than the 2.8 percent decrease seen in the current, two-year recession. But GDP loss in Obama's recession is pretty similar to losses in the second of the two early-1980s dips, when the economy shrank by 2.6 percent.


Viewed another way, in the worst full year of the 1980s recession, GDP shrank by 1.9 percent. Unless the economy supercharges during the final quarter of this year, there's a good chance that the contraction in 2009 will be bigger.



VERDICT: They're close, but the current recession will likely end up somewhat worse.



--

Peak unemployment

. Unemployment crested at 10.8 percent at the very end of the Reagan recession, in November and December of 1982. It hasn't gotten that high yet in the Obama recession -- it's currently at 10.2 percent -- but it could well get there in the coming months.



VERDICT: Worse under Reagan.



--

Rise in unemployment

. Some economists say that an even more important factor than peak unemployment is the total distance that unemployment rose over the course of the recession. By that measure, unemployment rose 4.5 percentage points over the full double-dip recession and rose 3.6 points during the second of the two dips. Both measures are lower than the 5.3 percentage-point climb in unemployment seen so far during the Obama recession.



VERDICT: Worse under Obama.



--

Long-term unemployment

. Many economists believe that long-term unemployment is more worrisome than short-term unemployment, because the longer someone goes without a job, the harder it is to get back into the work force, and, in turn, the harder it is for the economy as a whole to move forward. And there's a lot more long-term unemployment now than there was during the early 1980s.


In 1982, the final year of the Reagan recession, short-term unemployment -- that is, joblessness lasting less than five weeks -- hovered around 3.7 million. That's not much different than the 3.3 million or so short-term unemployed we've seen so far during 2009.


The picture is quite different for long-term unemployment, which is defined as 27 weeks or more without a job. In 1982, the number of people who were unemployed for the long term ranged from 1.2 million to 2.6 million. It's far worse today, with numbers ranging from 2.6 million to 5.6 million. In fact, in October 2009, the average duration of someone being unemployed reached 26.9 months -- the longest on record.



VERDICT: Much worse under Obama.



--

Personal income

. Personal income actually rose during the Reagan recession (up 28 percent over the full three years and up 7 percent during the second of the two dips). During the Obama recession, personal income has fallen by about 1 percent over the two years.



VERDICT: Worse under Obama.



--

Industrial production

 . Industrial production means somewhat less these days, in postindustrial America, but it's still a useful barometer for economic activity. Under the Reagan recession, industrial production fell by 9 percent over the double-dip recession and 8.6 percent during the second dip alone. By contrast, industrial production has shrunk during the Obama recession by 12 percent.



VERDICT: Worse under Obama.



--

The stock market

. Economists disagree about the merits of including the stock market as a factor when gauging recessions, but with many more Americans invested in stocks now than 30 years ago, a downturn in stock values can have both tangible and psychological effects.


As it happens, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose during the Reagan recession and has plunged during Obama's. It climbed by 19 percent during the full, double-dip recession and rose by 9 percent during the second dip alone. By contrast, the Dow has fallen 22 percent during the current recession.



VERDICT: Worse under Obama.



--

Housing prices

. The Reagan recession may have been bad for unemployment, but it was good for real estate. Over the double-dip recession, house prices rose by 11.4 percent. During the second dip, the rise was smaller -- 2.2 percent -- but still in positive territory. To be fair, that was in an era of much higher inflation. Still, during the Obama recession, house prices have fallen 5.7 percent, a decline much faster than prices as a whole. And the experience of seeing one's house value plunge only adds to the psychological wallop.



VERDICT: Much worse under Obama.



--

Foreclosures

. The comparisons for foreclosures aren't exactly apples-to-apples due to changes in the housing and mortgage markets. But foreclosures are definitely up. The rate of active foreclosures in the fourth quarters of 1980, 1981 and 1981 ranged from 0.38 percent to 0.67 percent. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the rate was 3.3 percent, and in the second quarter of 2009, it rose again to 4.3 percent.



VERDICT: Much worse under Obama.



--

Bank failures

. The peak bank failure years of the Reagan and Obama recessions -- 1982 and 2009 -- were almost identical in severity. In 1982, 119 banks failed; so far this year, the number is 123.


But the year isn't over yet -- and there's no certainty that banks won't continue failing in 2010 and beyond. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures customer deposits, estimates bank failures to cost $100 billion from 2009 through 2013, which prompted the agency to scramble to collect accelerated premiums from the banks it insures, just to make sure it had enough liquid assets on hand to cover new failures.



VERDICT: It's a wash so far, but things could get worse in the current recession before they get better.



The one factor we've sidestepped until now is inflation. A number of the conservative economists we spoke to believe that the high inflation of the early 1980s made Reagan's challenge worse.
 
But we found significant disagreement with other economists about whether inflation is a good barometer of a recession. Some of them said it can be high in good economic times and low in poor economic times. So we're not rendering a verdict on it to compare the recessions. Still, we'll provide the data below so you can see how they would have compared.
 
They're certainly right that inflation was high. The consumer price index rose by 12.4 percent in 1980, 8.9 percent in 1981 and 3.8 percent in 1982. By contrast, inflation was actually negative in 2008, at -0.08 percent, and is on pace to be about 2.7 percent in 2009.


As Richard Rahn, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, recently put it, ""Both President Reagan and President Obama inherited an economy suffering from a year of no growth, along with rising unemployment. (The numbers are almost identical.) But Mr. Reagan faced a far direr situation in that inflation was in the double digits and the prime interest rate was at 20 percent. In contrast, Mr. Obama inherited an economy in which inflation was falling (in fact, inflation has been close to zero for this year) and interest rates were very low. A situation in which the number of jobs available is falling is bad enough, but if inflation is also destroying purchasing power, the misery is compounded.""


Recreating the famous ""misery index"" -- unemployment plus inflation -- shows higher numbers in the Reagan years, ranging between 13.5 and 19.5. The misery index in the current recession has been lower -- 5.7 in 2008 and 11.8 so far in 2009.


So back to Palin's claim that Reagan's recession was more severe. The barometers we examined aren't necessarily equal measurements of the magnitude, but collectively they paint a picture that the current recession -- so far -- is worse than the one under Reagan. Even if we had decided to include inflation as a factor, the measurements would still indicate the current recession is worse. So we find Palin's claim to be False.

Sarah Palin claims the campaign did not elaborate on Obama's association with ACORN
","
In her book

Going Rogue

, Sarah Palin laments her campaign not hitting harder on Barack Obama's relationship with ACORN.
 
""On the campaign trail many had been hesitant to talk about legitimate fears that Obama's past comments and associations with anti-capitalist radicals would influence his economic policy,"" Palin wrote. ""The press gave the impression it was the wrong thing to do. I was 'going rogue"" when I answered reporters' questions about candidate Obama's associations and pals. I wish we had talked more about them, and about Obama's close relationship with ACORN, the voter-fraud specialists. But we did not elaborate on any of that during the campaign.""
 
That didn't jibe with our recollections from covering the campaign. So we did a quick search of our e-mail inbox to refresh our memory. Here's some -- but not all - of what we got from the McCain-Palin campaign:
 

Oct. 10, 2008

: MEMO: Barack Obama & ACORN
 
This is a memo from the McCain-Palin campaign that begins, ""Today, the McCain campaign outlined the intimate and longstanding relationship between Barack Obama and the Association of Community Organizers for Reform Now (ACORN). Given ACORN’s recent efforts to engage in voter fraud and to disrupt our political system, Obama’s affiliation with this group raises serious questions about his judgment and ability to lead this nation."" It goes on to highlight Obama's efforts directing Project Vote in 1992 as well as his work as a lawyer handling a case for ACORN. (We took a look at a few of the claims from Republicans about Obama's alleged ties to ACORN and found

some were more legitimate than others

.)
 

Oct. 10, 2008

: McCain-Palin 2008 Launches New

Web Ad

: ""ACORN""
 
The ad describes Obama as a man with vast ambition whose ""ties to ACORN run long and deep. He taught classes for ACORN. They even endorsed him for president."" The ad also accuses the Obama campaign of paying more than $800,000 to an ACORN front for get-out-the-vote efforts. ""Too risky for America,"" the ad concludes.
 

Oct. 11, 2008

: All: Please see statement by McCain-Palin spokesman Michael Goldfarb on Barack Obama and ACORN
 
In it, Goldfarb responds to a statement from the Obama campaign the previous week that ""Barack Obama never organized with ACORN."" Goldfarb repeats many of the same ties alleged before, adding ""he and unrepentant terrorist William Ayers funneled nearly $200,000 (to ACORN) from the Woods Foundation."" Says Goldfarb: ""It is clear that Barack Obama is not being honest about his association with ACORN, just as he has not been honest about his association with unrepentant terrorist William Ayers.""
 

Oct. 15, 2008

: Subject: Obama Misleads on ACORN Tonight
 
This is the campaign's ""fact-check"" based on a statement made by Obama during a debate with McCain, that ""The only involvement I've had with ACORN is, I represented them alongside the US justice department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs."" The response, sent by Brian Rogers of the McCain campaign, includes five points highlighting the ""full extent"" of Obama's relationship with ACORN.
 

Oct. 16, 2008

: All: Please see statement by campaign manager Rick Davis on FBI investigation of ACORN.
 
An excerpt from the statement:
 
""To date, in public announcements including last night's debate, Barack Obama has attempted to conceal and distort his and his campaign's relationship with a group that is currently engaging in systematic voter fraud. Barack Obama's campaign must fully disclose the true nature of his association with ACORN, including:
 

·

The total disclosure of all funds, including $832,000 from Barack Obama's campaign to ACORN and ACORN affiliations like Citizens Services, Inc.


·

Any and all information the Obama campaign has related to ACORN's database of registered voters compiled during this election cycle.


·

The total disclosure of coordination between Barack Obama's campaign, ACORN, and ACORN affiliations over the entirety of this election cycle.


·

The truth behind ACORN's hiring of get-out-the-vote workers on Barack Obama's behalf in Ohio during this election cycle.""
 

Oct. 17, 2008:

All: Please join us for a conference call at 11:30am ET with campaign manager Rick Davis to discuss Barack Obama's association with ACORN and the nationwide investigation of ACORN's practices.
 

Oct. 30, 2008

: Press release: McCain-Palin 2008 will hold a press conference call with Rick Davis, McCain-Palin 2008 Campaign Manager, to discuss the true extent of Barack Obama's relationship with ACORN and yesterday's sworn testimony of a former ACORN employee.
 
In addition to these e-mails, we note that McCain three times raised the issue of Obama's alleged ties to ACORN during the

third presidential debate

on Oct. 15.
 
Said McCain: ""We need to know the full extent of Sen. Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for 'lighting and site selection.' So all of these things need to be examined, of course.""


And then later: ""Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.""
 
And lastly: ""All of the details need to be known about Sen. Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.""
 
In her book, Palin says she wishes the campaign had talked more about ""Obama's close relationship with ACORN. ... But we did not elaborate on any of that during the campaign.""
 
So let's recap. The McCain-Palin campaign: sent out a memo to the media detailing Obama's alleged ties to ACORN; launched a Web ad about it; released several statements from campaign staffers; sent out ""fact-checks"" about it after a debate; held media conference calls with campaign staff to discuss it; issued several press releases about it; and McCain mentioned the issue several times during a debate.
 
That sounds like a lot of elaborating to us. We rule Palin's statement False.

Democratic cap and trade plans have credits to offset electricity rate increases
","In her new book,  Going Rogue  , Sarah Palin says President Barack Obama's support for a cap-and-trade plan is ""misguided."" ""The president has already admitted that the policy he seeks will cause our electricity bills to 'skyrocket.' Sadly, those hit hardest will be those who are already struggling to make ends meet. So much for the campaign promise not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year."" Before we examine her claim, here's a quick summary of cap and trade for those who aren't familiar with it: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Companies can buy and sell the credits as necessary to conduct their business. We were familiar with Barack Obama's original quote from his campaign for president. It came from a videotaped interview he did with the  San Francisco Chronicle  editorial board very early in the campaign in January 2008.

""Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket,"" Obama told the  Chronicle  . ""Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.""

(Separately, we rated Palin's statement on this comment  True  .) Ordinarily, higher electricty rates would hit hardest those ""already struggling to make ends meet,"" because it's awfully hard in this day and age to do without a basic level of electricity. But the actual legislation being considered in Congress now takes that into account, and includes measures intended to lower electricity rates for consumers. Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively, wrote the bill that passed the House in June. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given to companies for free. But eventually, they would have to buy those permits from the government. Under the bill, 30 to 40 percent of the revenues raised would go back to electric utilities to be passed on to consumers to offset higher rates they would have to pay. The money would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers. So how much would rates go up for consumers? It's hard to say. There has been much debate about the costs, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our  Pants on Fire  rating. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income. But we do know that the bill seeks to offset those higher costs through rebates for low-income consumers. In fact, the poorest people might see a net benefit from cap and trade, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan, independent arm of Congress. It analyzed the effect on rates by household income in 2020 and found that the lowest 20 percent of households would see a net benefit of $40 per year. The next 20 percent of households would see an added cost of $40 per year. The middle 20 percent would pay $235 a year more; the second-highest 20 percent would pay $340 a year more, and the top 20 percent would pay $245 a year more. (The top tier does a little better because of credits for businesses.) The House bill is not the final version of cap and trade; the Senate still needs to consider its own bill. Palin is correct in that lower-income households would feel the impact of higher utility costs, but the House bill contains significant offsets to help people of modest means. Thanks to its offsets, the plan is not entirely regressive because the lowest one-fifth of households would see a net benefit. So we rate Palin's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2009/nov/17/sarah-palin/cap-and-trade-electricity-rates-fixes/

Obama said cap and trade would increase electricity rates

""The president has already admitted that the policy he seeks will cause our electricity bills to 'skyrocket.'

""Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.""

Obama also said the biggest challenge would be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary. ""The problem is, can you get the American people to say this is really important,"" Obama said. Obama was talking in general about cap and trade, but there is now a specific bill making its way through Congress, written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out for free.

Revenue from the permits would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. So how much would rates go up for consumers? It's hard to say. There has been much debate about the costs, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our  Pants on Fire  rating. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income. So the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the  Chronicle  nearly two years ago.

Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340. Because that hasn't changed since Obama first said that utility rates would ""necessarily skyrocket,"" and because Palin got Obama's words right, we give Palin a True.",/factchecks/2009/nov/17/sarah-palin/obama-said-cap-and-trade-would-increase-electricit/
"['Corrections and Updates', 'Education', 'Vermont', 'Christine Hallquist']","
Did Vermont's governor dismiss all school merger appeals?
","Vermont is now in the final phase of implementing Act 46, a law requiring school boards to consolidate to form larger districts. The mergers are meant to encourage schools to share resources and save money. The state has some of the highest per-pupil costs in the country, and before this reform, it had the smallest ratio of school-board members to students. The process has been contentious, and debate over the mergers has spilled over to the gubernatorial race.  Democratic gubernatorial nominee Christine Hallquist has accused Republican Gov. Phil Scott of being heavy-handed in his efforts to contain education spending in his first term. She hammered that theme home earlier this month, accusing the Scott administration of rejecting all alternative governance proposals for districts that have refused to merge. ""There have been 44 plans submitted affecting 90 school districts. And the Scott administration has rejected all of them. We would definitely have a more flexible approach,"" she said at a press conference on October 10 in Burlington. She repeated a version of that claim later that day in a debate with Scott held in Rutland. That made us wonder – did Scott really say no to every district that asked for a reprieve under the consolidation law?  We reached out to the Hallquist campaign, which pointed to a report by Vermonters for Schools and Community, which claimed ""communities seeking approval for an alternative governance structure had a right to have their good faith effort be given a good faith evaluation. Instead, all were rejected.""   The Secretary of Education has, as required by the law, submitted a recommended plan to the State Board for unmerged districts. And that’s the plan attacked in the Vermonters for Schools and Community report cited by the Hallquist campaign. But the Scott administration has no power to reject or approve alternative structures. The Vermont State Board of Education has the final say over districts that have not voluntarily merged. Moreover, in multiple instances, Scott's secretary of the Agency of Education agreed with districts which submitted alternative governance proposals that they should retain their current structures.  Take Hartland and Weathersfield in the Upper Valley, for instance. The neighboring K-8 districts asked the state to allow them to remain single-town, stand-alone districts. In the agency’s proposed plan, then-interim Secretary Heather Bouchey wrote that while a merger between the two districts was legally possible, it wouldn’t make much sense to consolidate the two since each town had little in common and tuitioned their children to different high schools.  ""Because there does not appear to be any commitment of the communities to create a new definition of ‘us,’ there is scant likelihood that they will realize the potential opportunities of a larger, more flexible unified structure,"" Bouchey wrote.  In nearly half of all cases, the secretary recommended that the State Board do precisely what districts had asked for in their proposals. So why did the report argue that the alternative proposals were all rejected?  The Hallquist campaign said that Margaret MacLean, an education consultant and activist with Vermonters for Schools and Community, was their point person on Act 46.  Here’s how MacLean explained, earlier this summer, why the group claims all AGS proposals were rejected: ""The secretary recommended forced merger or no action. She recommended zero for approval,"" she wrote in an email to VTDigger.  MacLean’s general argument is that a fair appraisal of AGS proposals by the state would have included a rubric for vetting whether districts had shown they could meet the goals of the law – like cost-efficiency and equity – without merging, and then made recommendations accordingly. While the group is free to argue with how the secretary decided to make her recommendations, it isn’t fair to say the agency ""rejected"" all alternative proposals. In 21 cases, the secretary agreed with districts who submitted alternative governance proposals asking to keep their governance structures as-is.  Christine Hallquist accused Gov. Phil Scott of rejecting all alternative governance proposals under Act 46.  But that statement was based on misleading rhetoric by anti-merger advocates. And in 21 cases, the Secretary of Education agreed with districts who submitted alternative proposals that they could retain their existing structure, and did not recommend forced mergers to the State Board. We rate this claim as False.   Following the publication of this fact-check, Christine Hallquist send out a press release retracting her statement, thanking VTDigger reporter Lola Duffort for the article and celebrating the role of the press in political discourse.  ""I appreciate when the press holds both me and Governor Scott accountable when we make mistakes, as they should. This makes us better and serves the Vermont public,"" she said.  ""Governor Scott and his administration have been very heavy handed on public schools, but Duffort is absolutely correct that he did not, as I stated, reject every Act 46 Alternative Governance proposal. I apologize and retract this claim. In this, as in all matters of policy, I am open to new information and new evidence that will serve to better any proposals I put forward.""  ",/factchecks/2018/oct/30/christine-hallquist/did-vermonts-governor-reject-every-school-merger-a/

In Ohio, Troy Balderson brings up a seldom-mentioned health care angle
","Obamacare was supposed to make health coverage available to most Americans. But for someone to get coverage, an insurance company must sell it -- and that’s a problem when insurers pull out of a market, as they have in recent years, says an Ohio candidate in a 2018 congressional contest. Troy Balderson, who won a race this summer for a temporary stint representing Ohio’s 12th Congressional District and now is running to keep it, reminded voters of this recently. Discussing the Affordable Care Act on Columbus TV, Balderson, a Republican, said access is one of the health law’s shortcomings. He sees plenty of others -- he is a ""repeal and replace"" advocate -- but lots of other candidates are talking about those, and this was different enough to catch our attention. ""A lot of people are still dealing with lack of access to health care,"" Balderson told Scott Light, an anchor of WBNS, during an Oct. 20 program on the race between Balderson and his Democratic opponent, Danny O’Connor. ""There are counties out there, in my former Senate district, that didn’t have doctors and providers."" Did that really happen? And wasn’t the ACA supposed to provide access to care, not remove it? Let’s see how things have turned out. Broadly speaking, Balderson was referring to the start of the Affordable Care Act, his campaign said. The main provisions began in 2014. ""Numerous insurers pulled out of communities and counties when Obamacare was enacted leaving many of the constituents in my former State Senate district to drive to other parts of Ohio, and even across state lines, for their health care needs,"" Balderson told PolitiFact in a statement. ""This was just the beginning of the problems with Obamacare, and it's one of the many reasons I am committed to solving the problems in our healthcare system so patients have access to affordable care by a doctor in their community."" We’ll look at what happened at the beginning. But first, since Balderson was speaking in such narrow geographical terms, it helps to go back just one year, to the summer of 2017. That’s when health insurers were preparing for the coming year and the Ohio Department of Insurance announced preliminary participation by county. The number of insurers selling policies in the ACA marketplace was falling, with some companies complaining the cost of care was too high or the ACA market, mired in political controversy, was too uncertain. For a time, it looked as if 20 Ohio counties might wind up with no insurers at all in the ACA’s individual market for 2018. That included Guernsey, Morgan and Muskingum counties, in Balderson’s Senate district. What would people do if that happened? It became unnecessary to answer that question, because Gov. John Kasich and the Ohio Department of Insurance persuaded insurers working in other counties to fill the void. The crisis was averted. Nevertheless, 42 out of Ohio’s 88 counties wound up with only one insurer, and 20 counties wound up with two, according to the state insurance department. That meant residents buying policies on the individual exchange had limited or no choice of insurers. It also meant that if they wanted to stay in-network and avoid potentially big costs, they had to use the doctors and hospitals chosen by the limited number of insurers. We looked at the three above-mentioned counties to see how this played out. Guernsey, Morgan and Muskingum counties have only one ACA insurer now, CareSource. Each also had only one insurer in 2017. That insurer was Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. In other words, people buying ACA policies in both 2017 and 2018 had only one choice, but that choice required a change from Anthem in 2017 to CareSource in 2018. In 2016, the choice for those consumers was much broader, since Guernsey and Muskingum had 5 companies vying for ACA customers and Morgan had six. The ACA market has never been entirely static. From its start, insurers tested it for a year or two and then made new decisions. For example, in 2014, Guernsey and Muskingum counties had two insurers, and Morgan had three. Two more insurers decided to enter each of those counties in 2015, and one more in each county in 2016. That was the trend: A small number of insurers came into the market, more joined it the next year and even more the year after. But then came a retreat in 2017, with some insurers beating a path out. We were curious to see if fewer people bought insurance coverage as the number of carriers fell. So we looked at ACA enrollment data reported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, comparing 2016, when there were more choices, and 2018. Two of the counties, Muskingum and Guernsey, both of which went from five insurers to one, saw a drop in insurance purchases -- Muskingum by nearly 16 percent, Guernsey by 9 percent. Yet Morgan, which went from six insurers to one, saw a 7 percent rise. Because of other factors, including the economy, it is impossible to say there was a direct cause and effect. This is not to minimize the difficulty there, but for insurers, these are tiny markets. Only 1,504 people bought ACA policies Muskingum County this year, and only 303 in Morgan and 676 in Guernsey, according to CMS data. Balderson spoke of the past. But what lies ahead? It turns out that Ohio will gain two more insurers in 2019, although they won’t all participate in each county, bringing the statewide total from eight to 10. One of the new ones is Anthem, which retreated from Ohio amid uncertainty over the ACA but is coming back. In Balderson’s old Senate district, Guernsey County, now with one ACA insurer, will have two next year, according to the state. So will Morgan County. And Muskingum will have three. Before we rule on Balderson’s claim, it’s important to note that Balderson says he was speaking of changes after the ACA’s enactment, not just last year. So we wanted to look at pre- and post-ACA factors. But we found that good county-by-county counts of insurers didn’t exist before the ACA because there weren’t requirements to keep them at such a narrow level. But what about states? Were there more carriers in each state -- providing more access -- before the ACA? The problem with such comparisons, we found, is they are like comparing apples to oranges. The nature of the policies and their coverage was different before the health law kicked in in 2014. Before the ACA, a company could reject customers with pre-existing conditions, pay for fewer kinds care, close off enrollment or insure only a tiny or select group of people, Cynthia Cox of the Kaiser Family Foundation told us. In fact, insurers set up subsidiaries sometimes for just that purpose. ""So before the the ACA, you see a bunch of plans with about five people enrolled in them,"" Cox, the Kaiser foundation’s director for health reform and private insurance, said. She said that in 2006, 27 percent of plans in a given state had fewer than 100 enrolles. To make accurate comparisons, Cox looks at the number of insurers that are significant competitors, a measure that groups subsidiaries as part of the parent company. A significant competitor is a company with more than 5 percent of a state’s market share. In Ohio, there were three such companies in 2011, three years before the ACA kicked in. The number grew to four with the start of the ACA, then to five in 2015, then back to four in 2016. Overall, the trend nationally -- the number of carriers -- is ""remarkably flat,"" Cox said. There are other ways to measure access to care, including changes in the number of uninsured people, although that includes a large number who got coverage through Medicaid’s expansion, a facet of the ACA. Counting them, the share of uninsured Ohioans fell by 45 percent -- to 6 percent -- between 2013 and 2017, U.S. Census figures show.  Balderson said that ""a lot of people are still dealing with lack of access to health care."" He then spoke specifically about people in his former Ohio Senate district. It is true that a number of them dealt with changes, especially in the counties we mentioned. Nearly half of all Ohio counties, each in a small market, wound up with only a single ACA carrier this year. For some people, that changed their access to the doctors and hospitals they preferred. Yet things will improve for many in 2019. And even counting all the changes since the ACA began, many more people have health coverage now than before. This has been part of the ACA’s push and pull from the start. If you are a constituent who lost access to your preferred insurer or provider, you might have called Balderson to urge him to fight for change. If you are a citizen who got health care because of the ACA, you might have joined a protest in hopes Congress will leave it alone. That’s why we rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2018/oct/30/troy-balderson/ohio-troy-balderson-brings-seldom-mentioned-health/

No truth to claim that pipe bombs weren't mailed

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what we know. On Oct. 26, a Florida man named Cesar Sayoc Jr. was arrested on suspicion of sending explosive packages to Brennan, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama among others. According to a federal criminal complaint posted online by The New York Times, ""Sayoc mailed approximately 13 packages containing improvised explosive devices (‘IEDs’) to certain current and former U.S. government officials, politicians, and others, including mailings across state lines."" The complaint goes on to say that Sayoc ""knowingly caused to be delivered by mail … the IEDs."" Each of the 13 IEDs was ""packaged in a tan-colored manila envelope lined with bubble wrap,"" the complaint says. ""Each was stamped with approximately six self-adhesive postage stamps each bearing a picture of an American flag. Each envelope listed a return sender of ""Debbie Wasserman Shultz."" News media including The New York Times have published images of the envelope like the one that showed up on Facebook. The complaint describes such a package containing an IED—made with approximately six inches of PVC pipe, a small clock, a battery, wiring and energetic material—delivered via U.S. mail to George Soros’s home among others in October. After interviewing U.S. Postal Service employees, federal officials determined that between about Oct. 18 and Oct. 20, packages sent to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Robert De Niro, Maxine Waters and Joe Biden were routed through the USPS Royal Palm Mail Processing Center in Opa-Locka, Florida. So bloggers are right that the packages had six stamps, but the pipes used to make the IEDs were lightweight plastic, not steel.

Donald Trump says NYSE opened a day after 9/11. It didn't
","On the day a gunman killed 11 and wounded six others in a Pittsburgh synagogue, President Donald Trump twice defended his decision to hold a scheduled campaign rally by pointing to a rapid reopening of the New York Stock Exchange after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It did not happen the way he described. Trump first mentioned this rationale in an Oct. 27 address to the Future Farmers of America conference in Indianapolis: ""I remember when we had the attack in Manhattan. We opened that stock exchange the next day; people were shocked. A great group of people — the head of the New York Stock Exchange is just a fantastic guy — Dick (Grasso). And he opened it up."" Later that day, Trump kept his promise to hold a rally in Murphysboro, Ill. He repeated the anecdote in that address: ""With what happened early today, that horrible, horrible attack in Pittsburgh, I was saying maybe I should cancel both this and that (the speech in Indianapolis). And then I said to myself, I remember Dick Grasso, a friend of mine, great guy. He headed up the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 11. And the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day. He said — and what they had to do to open it, you wouldn't believe. We won't even talk to you about it, but he got that exchange open. We can't make these sick, demented, evil people important.""

Fact-checking an ad on Dan McCready and tax cut savings
","The biggest policy success of President Donald Trump’s first year was signing the sweeping tax reform bill, something Republicans had been striving for decades to achieve. Now, just one week before the first midterm elections since Trump took office, Republicans across the country are trying to remind voters of the tax cuts their bill ushered in. In the race for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, which stretches from south Charlotte east to include Lumberton and up the Interstate 95 corridor to Fayetteville, a new Facebook ad has leveled criticism at Democrat Dan McCready for his stance on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as the reform bill was called. ""Dan McCready wants to repeal tax cuts that saves (sic) you $1,300+/year,"" said the ad, which went live on Facebook on Oct. 24 and was created and paid for by FreedomWorks for America, a libertarian advocacy group. The claim made our eyebrows raise, so we decided to give the ad a closer look. The McCready campaign did not respond to a request for comment, but McCready spokesman Aaron Simpson told PolitiFact earlier this month that McCready would rather re-tool the Trump tax plan than repeal it. On his campaign website, McCready pledged to ""fight to simplify the tax code and cut taxes more for middle-class families, not just the ultra-wealthy."" The former Marine further explained this position on Facebook after the tax bill first passed, saying that he would have preferred ""real tax reform"" that was simpler, did not increase the deficit and was not as ""slanted toward the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations."" McCready repeated these complaints during an Oct. 10 debate with Republican Mark Harris and made it clear that he supports the Trump tax bill’s cuts. ""I supported very much the middle class tax cuts that were part of the tax bill,"" he said. ""But we needed to do much more of that: Give less of the tax cuts to the Warren Buffetts and Koch Brothers of the world and more to the hardworking teachers and firefighters that deserve a lot better here in North Carolina."" Peter Vicenzi, press secretary for FreedomWorks, said the ad’s $1,300 figure came from data produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation and the pro-business Tax Foundation, two think tanks in Washington, D.C. Vicenzi said the ""you"" mentioned in the ad refers specifically to North Carolinians in the 9th Congressional District, so we only looked at savings estimates for that district. The Heritage Foundation said the tax cut led to average savings of $1,353 in the district in 2018. But as PolitiFact has noted, averages can be misleading for something like the Trump tax bill, which has significantly different impacts on different types of taxpayers. ""Average tax cuts vary tremendously by income levels,"" said Lawrence Zelenak, professor of law at Duke University and an expert in tax policy. With that in mind, we decided to hone in on the Tax Foundation’s analysis, which highlighted the distributional effects of the Trump tax plan. That study showed that 9th District residents making between $50,000 and $75,000 saved $1,337, on average, from the tax cut in 2018. Citing a Money Magazine report, Vicenzi explained that FreedomWorks pulled from the $50,000 to $75,000 income bracket to reflect a ""real income"" of about $52,000 that the magazine calculated based on the state’s median household income of $47,830. But Zelenak said the ad’s claim that the tax cuts save ""you"" $1,300 is misleading, since only people with average incomes between $50,000 to $75,000 have actually experienced that amount of savings. According to the same Tax Foundation analysis, district residents earning $25,000 to $50,000 collected an average of $1,009 in savings, and those with average incomes between $10,000 and $25,000 brought in an average of $156. By contrast, those with yearly incomes higher than $200,000 saved a whopping $24,137. This disparity is not reflected in the ad’s claim. ""For a voter in the $10,000 to $25,000 income range, it would be more accurate to say, ‘McCready wants to repeal tax cuts that save you $156 while saving the average high-income taxpayer in your district over $24,000,’"" Zelenak said. Zelenak also noted that the ad says nothing about the tax cuts being deficit-financed, which could mean more savings now but higher costs in the future. ""Deficits have to be paid for eventually, so that in the long run the tax cuts imply tax increases on ‘your’ children and grandchildren,"" he said. ""But one doesn’t really expect a political ad to raise that point,"" he added. In an ad seen on Facebook, FreedomWorks said ""Dan McCready wants to repeal tax cuts that saves you $1,300"" or more per year. The $1,300 figure is an accurate average for district residents earning yearly incomes between $50,000 and $75,000, but those with higher or lower incomes will likely receive substantially different tax cuts, ranging from a measly $156 to a whopping $24,000. Plus, McCready has repeatedly indicated that while he wants to make serious changes to the Trump tax plan, he does not want to get rid of the tax cuts, especially for the middle class. Overall, the ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

Was Andrew Gillum 'singing a different tune' about charter schools at the Florida debate?
","Ron DeSantis accused Andrew Gillum of changing his message to Florida voters about his plans for the future of charter schools. At their final debate, moderator Todd McDermott asked Gillum to elaborate on his charter school plan. ""You’ve said ‘we’ve got to end this for-profit education’ in reference to charter schools in this state,"" McDermott said. ""Ten percent of students in Florida attend charter schools that provide an alternative to traditional public education. Are you saying you would cut any dollars away from what funds charter schools in the state?"" Gillum replied, ""No, I am not proposing any change to the current status quo. But what we are saying is that we are going to put money into our public system where over 90 percent of our kids are still being educated."" DeSantis accused Gillum of ""singing a different tune."" ""In the Democratic primary, he said that charter schools would be done,"" said DeSantis, who defended the rights of parents to choose charter schools. We looked back at Gillum’s statements about charter schools to see if he had called for any change to the status quo, and found he has been consistently critical of the involvement of for-profit entities in charter schools. (He has also called for a $1 billion increase in corporate taxes for education.) DeSantis wants to continue many Republican school initiatives, including supporting charter schools. Gillum has been a critic of for-profit involvement in charter schools throughout his campaign. Charter schools are public schools but operated by an entity other than a school district. They must be operated or controlled by a nonprofit organization by law, but some nonprofit charter school boards enter into contracts with for-profit companies. (It is hard to say exactly how many, due to murky state data however charter schools affiliated with for-profit firms are a large and growing sector of Florida’s charter schools.) A Miami Herald investigation in 2011 found charter schools are ""controlled largely by for-profit management companies and private landlords — one and the same, in many cases — and rife with insider deals and potential conflicts of interest."" That distinction is at the heart of Gillum’s critique. He couches his opposition to say he is a critic of for-profit charter schools. When asked on WPTV in February if he supports the charter school concept, Gillum said ""my issue is not with charters. My issue is with for-profit charter schools who take money away from the public system badly needed in the public system."" Gillum made some of his most forceful comments against for-profit involvement in charter schools in a June primary debate. ""What we’ve got to do is end this for-profit regime that the Republicans have entered into the public education system here in the state of Florida,"" Gillum said. ""We’ve got to do it immediately. ... I would be completely against for-profit charters in this state."" During an August primary debate, Gillum said the governor and Legislature ""have moved more and more of our public dollars out of public schools and into for-profit charter schools. We need to end that."" After Gillum won the primary, he continued to criticize for-profit charter schools. In September, the AP paraphrased Gillum as stating that it was time to stop siphoning off public money into privately run schools. Gillum said he would seek to bring the state's current voucher programs to a ""conclusion."" While Gillum hasn’t provided a detailed road map to the steps he would take if elected to crack down on for profits, he has made it clear these schools are in his crosshairs, and he views the involvement of for-profit entities as a problem. We asked his campaign to clarify whether he would try to shutter existing charter schools managed by for-profit entities, something that would require buy-in from the state Legislature. Campaign spokeswoman Carlie Waibel said Gillum ""will not shut down charter schools,"" saying he wants to bring them more ""transparency and standards."" Lynn Norman-Teck, executive director of the Florida Charter School Alliance, disagrees with a blanket condemnation of charter schools that are managed by for profit entities. For some schools, the for profit entity does back office type of work while in others they have a larger role. ""We should be looking at the value of a school whether it is a district school or private school or charter,"" she said. ""Let’s look at the return on investment -- are they reaping results? Are those children moving forward?"" DeSantis says Gillum was ""singing a different tune"" about charter schools at the Florida debate. That was a reference to Gillum’s answer to a question about whether he would cut any dollars from charter schools. But Gillum was downplaying his previous comments on charters, saying he would not propose any change to the ""current status quo."" He went on to say he was ""going to put money into our public system where over 90 percent of our kids are still being educated."" During the primary, Gillum had tougher words. He said Florida should ""end this for-profit regime"" immediately, in regard to charter schools managed by for-profit entities, and he called for an ""end"" of moving more public dollars to for-profit charters. What DeSantis omits is that Gillum hasn’t called for an end to all charter schools — he is targeting those that are managed by for-profit entities.

Does Vermont have the 'most progressive' tax system in the country?
","Gov. Phil Scott said in a debate this month that Vermont’s tax system is the most progressive in the nation. Scott made the claim while criticizing a proposal from his Democratic challenger, Christine Hallquist, who wants to use the income tax to pay for education. Vermont schools are primarily supported by a statewide property tax.  Hallquist says an income tax would be a fairer way to pay for schools because it would ensure that wealthy residents pay a more equitable proportion of education costs.  Scott countered that ""the people I’m talking to think they are paying their fair share and more.""  ""We have the most progressive tax system in the country, right here in Vermont,"" Scott said. ""So I’m not sure how many of these rich people we have left in Vermont because they’re moving out.""  Is Vermont’s tax system really the most progressive in the nation?  Tax policy experts agree that Vermont’s tax system is among the most progressive in the country, but no research concludes that it is the most progressive.  In fact, some suggest Vermont trails California and Delaware. And some researchers say that California, which has a much higher income tax than Vermont for those in the top bracket, clearly has a more progressive system.  Scott's assertion came from a Vermont Department of Taxes presentation, according to Rebecca Kelley, the governor's spokesperson. At the time, the administration was crafting its proposal restructuring the state’s income tax system to adjust for federal tax changes. The department based its report on two sources: A study from the Tax Foundation and a graph by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. 
 
The Tax Foundation study, which was published in 2014 and looks at income tax structures across the country, concludes that Vermont, California and New Jersey have the most progressive rate structures ""by a wide margin.""  By two progressivity measures, Vermont falls behind the other states.  The first measure looks at where the state’s top tax rate kicks in, an indicator of how much the wealthy residents pay, compared with others. Vermont ranked fifth in this category.   The top ranked state, California had a 9.3 percent gap between the two rates: its top rate in 2014 was 13.3 percent, and its rate on those making $25,000 was 4 percent. In Vermont, which ranked third, the top rate was 8.95 percent and the lower rate was 3.55 percent. The second source Kelley pointed to was a graph by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), which compares the top 1 percent and bottom 20 percent of taxpayers in all 50 states. The graph compares how much residents in these two brackets pay in all state taxes, including income, property, and excise taxes. The graph, which relied on data from 2012, shows that Vermont had the second most progressive tax system -- after Delaware.   The latest data from ITEP, released in a new report earlier this month, shows that Vermont’s system is the second most equitable in the country, behind California. The bottom 20 percent of Vermonters pay 8.7 percent of their income in state taxes while the top 1 percent pay 10.4 percent.  Carl Davis, the research director for ITEP, said he doesn’t believe it would be accurate to call Vermont the most progressive state. California has a much higher top rate for the wealthiest taxpayers, he said.  ""In our research Vermont does not have the most progressive system in the nation, but it is certainly far less regressive than the vast majority of states,"" Davis said.  Vermont has one of the most progressive tax systems in the country, but no research exists showing that it has the most progressive system.  The research the governor’s administration cited does not support the claim, but in several cases refutes it.  However, research on the relative progressivity of state tax systems is limited and appears to vary greatly based on methodology.  We rate this statement as Mostly False.

Despite claim, Minnesota's Dan Feehan isn't throwing the border gates open
","A new ad from a Republican-backed super PAC has a scary message about Democrat Dan Feehan for voters in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District: ""Gang members and criminals"" are marching toward the U.S. southern border in a caravan with thousands of potential immigrants from Central America — and if Feehan were elected, he just might let everyone in. The ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, hoping to keep a Republican majority in the U.S. House, juxtaposes the march-toward-the-border footage with a question: ""Who is tough enough to secure our border? Not Dan Feehan. In Washington, Feehan would vote with Pelosi for open borders and amnesty, putting Minnesota families at risk."" The concern about criminals has been heard since President Donald Trump stated it in tweets, speeches and remarks to reporters. Numerous news stories say the march that started in Honduras is full of people fleeing violence and economic turmoil. But Tyler Q. Houlton, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a tweet on Oct. 23 that the department ""can confirm that there are individuals within the caravan who are gang members or have significant criminal histories."" It is uncertain what will happen when the crowd arrives at the United States border, where some are expected to request asylum. Trump is working to increase barriers to entry and has spoken of sending soldiers, saying the caravan is ""an assault on our country."" Would Feehan really vote for open borders, and for that matter, would Pelosi? We went to find out. Few if any lawmakers and congressional aspirants have a policy that addresses the question, What to do about caravans? But none say they want to throw open the borders. Since the CLF says Feehan would vote for open borders and for amnesty, we asked his campaign if that’s what he wants. ""Dan obviously does not,"" Sara Severs, Feehan spokeswoman, said. ""As a decorated Iraq combat veteran, the safety and the security of this nation is personal to Dan and he believes our nation needs to secure our borders and pass comprehensive immigration reform to address our immigration challenges."" Feehan’s campaign website includes a page dedicated solely to immigration. He says he wants ""a pathway to citizenship for those who pay their taxes and don’t have a criminal record."" He wants to hold ""employers who hire undocumented immigrants accountable,"" and develop ""a robust guest worker program."" He also says that as a veteran, ""when it comes to public safety, let me be perfectly clear, no matter who you are, if you commit a violent crime, you must be punished."" In that vein, his ideas are similar to what House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others have proposed. Immigration and border debates over recent years have concerned what to do about immigrants who seek asylum, how to treat immigrants who got in without authorization, and whether to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, as Trump wants. The rhetoric has grown heated following large-scale deportations of immigrants here illegally, and separation of children from their parents. ""I don’t see any of us voting for wall funding,"" Pelosi told Politico recently. ""We have a responsibility to secure our borders. There are ways to do that that are consistent with civilization, humanitarianism and who we are as a nation."" She also said she wants to work on protecting so-called Dreamers, undocumented young adults who were brought to the U.S. as children. In 2013, she supported proposals to create a way for others here illegally to stay, while also doubling the number of border patrol agents to at least 38,405, adding hundreds more miles of border fencing and requiring the Obama administration to have a plan to apprehend 90 percent of attempted border crossings. The proposed legislation was similar to a 2013 bipartisan Senate bill, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act, that passed with support from 14 Republicans and every Democrat.  In the House, however, Republicans favored working on enforcement first, with some saying a path to citizenship would disadvantage U.S.-born citizens for jobs. One point of criticism of the Senate bill was that it would have allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status only if they had not been convicted of a felony or three or more misdemeanors. That means, as the Congressional Leadership Fund said in materials it sent us in support of its ad, that people who had committed two misdemeanors could qualify. The ad, however does not say that, focusing instead on ""gang members and criminals"" the super PAC says are marching to the country now. Under the Senate bill, applicants would have had to be living in this country already before they could qualify to apply. The Congressional Leadership Fund says Dan Feehan ""would vote with Pelosi for open borders and amnesty, putting Minnesota families at risk."" There is no question Feehan holds views contrary to the president’s and those of many House Republicans. He wants to find a way for people who are in this country already to stay, under certain conditions. But nothing in his positions suggests he supports open borders and total amnesty. There is a lot of either-or posturing in politics, and this is no different, but the CLF’s extreme framing of Feehan’s positions calls for a harsh ruling: False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/29/congressional-leadership-fund/despite-claim-minnesotas-dan-feehan-isn/

No, Dean Phillips was not involved in a sexual harassment case at one of his companies
","A television ad in Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District attempts to tie Democratic candidate Dean Phillips to a congressman accused of domestic abuse. Phillips’ opponent, Republican congressman Erik Paulsen, aired the ad that starts off by saying ""sleazy Keith Ellison and shady Dean Phillips, both caught up in another sexual harassment scandal,"" making it appear as if the two men are involved in the same scandal. Ellison is accused of domestic abuse by his former girlfriend. The congressman is currently running for Minnesota attorney general and has denied the allegations. But the focus here is the claim that Phillps is ""charged with ignoring sexual harassment and discrimination at his companies,"" as the ad’s narrator goes on to say. The full text: ""Sleazy Keith Ellison and Shady Dean Phillips, both caught up in another sexual harassment scandal. Ellison accused of physical abuse. Phillips charged with ignoring sexual harassment and discrimination at his companies. Sued over and over again. A whistleblower says he told Phillips' board of the abuse, warning the harassment was a serious problem that was being covered up. Keith Ellison. Dean Phillips. They are the problem. Dean Phillips, your time is up."" Phillips is airing a rebuttal ad calling Paulsen's attack false. We wanted to sort out the facts. We found that Phillips is not connected to Ellison’s case, and the allegation against him is based on a decades-old lawsuit filed against an organization where he was once a board member. The ad makes the suggestion that Phillips has been ""sued over and over"" and was ""charged"" with ignoring sexual harassment at his companies. We found no evidence that supports either claim. To be clear: Phillips is not involved in the domestic abuse allegations levied against Ellison by a former girlfriend, nor is Phillips involved in any sexual harassment case. The Paulsen campaign points to a February 2007 Star Tribune article that discusses a lawsuit brought against Allina Health by seven nurses who said they were sexually harassed by a doctor at one of the health group’s clinics. The case was settled out of court. The news account quotes a letter that was sent by another doctor to an Allina board member. The doctor vouched for the lawsuit, saying the harassment was a serious problem at the clinic and is being ""covered up by the Allina administration."" Phillips served on the board of directors from 2005 to 2011, and while the board advises Allina, it doesn’t ""run the company"" as the ad implies. There is also no evidence the note was actually sent to Phillips, and his campaign says he has no memory of receiving such a letter or having any board discussions about the harassment case. Shortly after the ad aired, Lori Peterson, the attorney who represented the women, contacted the Paulsen campaign requesting they take it down. She has not gotten a response, Peterson said, and sent the campaign another note Friday. ""You have been asked, for weeks, to stop using my clients in your ads. You have misrepresented their experiences, lied about your opponent, and further traumatized these women,"" Peterson wrote. ""You have dragged these women into your campaign against their will and you won’t even respond to their requests that you stop."" She goes on to say that her clients want nothing to do with Paulsen’s campaign, and that she has told him repeatedly that Dean Phillips ""had nothing to do with this case. No allegations were made about him and he had no involvement in the litigation."" Paulsen attempts to tie Phillips to another Democratic candidate involved in a domestic abuse case and says he ""ignored sexual harassment allegations at his companies."" But Phillips has nothing to do with the accusations against Ellison. Phillips served on the board of a health organization that was sued over sexual harassment allegations in 2007, but the lawyer in that case said he had nothing to do with it. There is also no evidence that proves he was informed or received a letter about the harassment. Paulsen’s ad misleads viewers by connecting Phillips to a domestic abuse case he is not involved in, and implies some sort of formal action was taken against Phillips (""charged with ignoring"") at a company he runs, neither of which are true.

Mike DeWine ad blames Rich Cordray for raising taxes and job losses, but that's misleading
","Ohio Republican Mike DeWine says Richard Cordray held statewide office at a time when the state bled jobs and hiked taxes. ""During the Strickland-Cordray era, taxes were raised by $800 million and Ohio lost 400,000 jobs...,"" says a TV ad by DeWine, the current attorney general. ""Richard Cordray will raise taxes. Kill jobs."" Previously, we found that DeWine has misled by stating that Cordray will raise taxes. Here we will fact-check whether Democrats Cordray and then-Gov. Ted Strickland were in office when Ohio raised taxes by $800 million and if Ohio lost 400,000 jobs. These are similar to attacks we heard from Ohio Republicans in 2010, and like back then, they omit some context. The new attacks pertain to when Cordray was state treasurer from 2007 to 2008 and attorney general from 2009 to 2010. We found that it is misleading to blame Cordray for job losses or tax increases during his tenure because he had the responsibility for neither. This statement pertains to a decision by Strickland in late 2009 to freeze a scheduled 4.2 percent income tax cut, the final year of a five-year cut. But the attack ignores the context of the cancelled tax cut and provides no evidence Cordray had a role in it. The tax cut freeze was adopted after a plan to place slot machines at Ohio racetracks fell through, leaving a hole of more than $800 million in the budget, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The Republican-controlled Ohio Senate signed off on the deal, narrowly. Strickland had to find a source of revenue or would have had to slash programs to balance the budget. And part of the reason for the shortfall can be pinned on Republicans, who increased spending in seven consecutive budgets while also cutting taxes when they controlled the General Assembly. However, the cut was scheduled to be reinstated the next year. Whether deferring a tax break for a year is the same as raising taxes has been a point of contention. PolitiFact Ohio previously found that those who owed the state after filing their 2009 taxes owed a little bit extra thanks to Strickland’s tax freeze. Strickland’s decision cost a family of four earning $60,000 a year about $78. Deferring a cut isn’t precisely the same as a tax hike, and either way as attorney general Cordray didn’t have any responsibility for it. It’s true that Ohio lost jobs while Cordray was in office, but this ignores that he wasn’t to blame for the national recession. Ohio lost about 368,000 jobs between January 2007 and December 2010, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. During the 2000s, Ohio lost a lot of manufacturing jobs. Most of the state job losses between 2007 and 2010 can be attributed to the severe national recession, University of Akron Professor Michael Nelson said. ""It is possible that a very modest amount of jobs could have been created had the scheduled state income tax cut gone through, but it would have minimal,"" he said. ""The bottom line: A state economy is driven first and foremost by what is happening in the broader national/international economy."" The Cleveland Plain Dealer compared the job record of Strickland with the current governor, Republican John Kasich, and found ""in both cases, like every other period as long as Ohio has been electing governors to four-year terms starting 60 years ago, Ohio has done worse than the nation as a whole."" Ohio consistently has gained jobs at a slower rate than the country, or in bad times, lost jobs faster than the nation. The DeWine campaign did not provide any direct evidence that Cordray played a role in the tax freeze or job losses. Instead, the campaign tried to portray Cordray as an opponent of policies that would grow jobs or reduce taxes and tried to lump him together with Strickland’s tax policy. For example, spokesman Joshua Eck pointed to Cordray’s criticism in 2010 over JobsOhio, a proposal by Kasich to replace the Ohio Department of Development with a private nonprofit. That doesn’t mean Cordray was to blame for job losses, he just didn’t support a private takeover of the entity. Eck pointed to statements Cordray made during this campaign about taxes, such as slamming Republicans for cutting state taxes. But Cordray has also said several times that he doesn’t see a need for tax increases. DeWine said, ""During the Strickland-Cordray era taxes were raised by $800 million and Ohio lost 400,000 jobs."" This is a case of misplaced blame. The ad tries to scare voters into portraying Cordray as a tax hiker responsible for job losses when in fact there is no evidence he deserves any blame. Then-Gov. Strickland delayed the fifth year of an income tax cut to fill a budget hole in 2009, but as attorney general Cordray had no role in that decision. Ohio did lose those jobs, but the national recession was to blame -- not anything done by Cordray as treasurer or attorney general.

Holding voted quite consistently on healthcare bills
","During a debate in the 2nd Congressional District in North Carolina, Republican Rep. George Holding made his stance on coverage for pre-existing health conditions clear when the topic of health care came up. ""I support protecting folks who have pre-existing conditions,"" Holding said, according to The News and Observer. ""I don’t know of any policymaker in Washington that wants to prevent people with pre-existing conditions from being able to get health care."" His Democratic challenger, Linda Coleman, thinks otherwise. Coleman named a person with a pre-existing condition and said ""George Holding has voted 13 times to deny Kevin, and the 300,000 people like him in the 2nd congressional district, coverage."" In an ad from Coleman’s campaign, Kevin LeCount – a friend of Coleman’s who had leukemia, according to her campaign – says, ""there are more than 300,000 people in this district, whose lives (Holding) put in danger when (Holding) voted to cut protections for people with pre-existing conditions."" The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, bans insurers from denying anyone coverage based on pre-existing conditions. It was legal to do so before. What has Holding voted for? There have been numerous attempts in Congress to fully or partially repeal Obamacare. They had voted 54 times through 2014 to repeal parts of the health care legislation or the whole thing, according to the Washington Post. Not all of the legislation Congress has voted on would have denied protection for people with pre-existing conditions. But some of them did, and Holding voted for some of these bills that range from budget bills defunding Obamacare to full-on repeals that would have fully eliminated protections. Bill: Date of Holding Vote: HR 45 5/16/2013 HR 2009 8/2/2013 H. Con. Res 25 3/20/2013 3/21/2013 H. Con. Res. 96 4/10/2014 4/10/2014 HR 596 2/3/2015 H. Con. Res. 27 3/25/2015 3/25/2015 3/25/2015 S. Con. Res. 11 4/30/2015 H.R. 3762 10/23/2015 1/6/2016 2/2/2016 We found that Holding has voted 14 different times for bills that affect pre-existing conditions in some way. Of these bills, four were budget bills that would have defunded Obamacare. Only the budget bills from 2015 and 2016 mentioned protections for pre-existing conditions by saying the protections should be included in any future health care reform. Since these bills didn’t provide a clear path to offering protections, people with pre-existing conditions could have been vulnerable until other health care legislation passed. Two budget bills from 2013 and 2014 were full repeals of Obamacare, and did not promise protections for pre-existing conditions. Any full repeal of Obamacare would also fully repeal these protections. It is important to note that budget bills are not binding on policy, so it does not mean a vote for these will automatically repeal or defund Obamacare One bill would have prevented the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing any of the tax mandates necessary for funding Obamacare. .Holding also voted in favor of a reconciliation bill, which is a budget bill that does not allow for filibusters in the Senate. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit with a focus on health policies, notes that this bill does not allow insurers to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University, said in an email that this reconciliation bill would not have fully repealed Obamacare or protection for those with pre-existing conditions. That doesn’t mean things would’ve stayed the same. ""[The repeal] would have made it much harder for people with lower incomes to afford coverage for pre-existing conditions,"" Jost said. Holding’s defense All of these votes came while President Barack Obama was in office, and Congress had no chance at successfully repealing Obama’s signature health legislation. The Republicans were well aware of that. Their repeal attempts were used to show they could organize as a party, and could get the job done if there was a Republican president. The game changed when President Donald Trump was elected. The Republican-controlled Congress pushed out its first health care bill. It would’ve fully repealed Obamacare and replaced it with the American Health Care Act. On May 4, 2017, Holding voted for this bill. During the debate, Holding cited his votes for the AHCA to prove he supported protections for people with pre-existing conditions. ""I really do want to put this pre-existing conditions argument to rest. I voted to repeal Obamacare as many times as I was given an opportunity to vote for repealing Obamacare,"" Holding said. ""... Obamacare didn’t work. The American Health Care Act would work, and it protects and gives coverage to people with pre-existing conditions."" A previous fact check found that the AHCA says insurers wouldn’t have been able to limit access to health care for those with pre-existing conditions. It would’ve cut back on protections, however, by allowing for insurers to raise premiums based on an individual’s health status. Our ruling Holding voted numerous times on bills that affect the Affordable Care Act in some way. We found eight bills would have either affected protections for pre-existing conditions, or fully removed them. None of the budget bills Holding voted for were binding either, meaning they wouldn’t have necessarily defunded or repealed Obamacare. Holding voted on two budget bills that promised protections in future health care reform, but they offered no replacement. When he did vote for a replacement, the AHCA, it would have allowed insurers to raise premiums for people based on their pre-existing conditions. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Net worth of Ted Cruz is not $4.6 million, according to best calculations

In response to an email seeking more information about the meme, the group said that it didn’t make the graphic but, faced with questions about its accuracy, has edited its description to quote Snopes. ""As far as we can tell, the only figure the meme states accurately is Cruz’s salary,"" it says. ""Although the $4.6 million figure cited isn’t implausible, we don’t know how it was arrived at, or by whom. Nor were we able to ascertain where the other amount cited—Cruz’s alleged net worth of $500,000 in 2012—came from."" Occupy Democrats originally fact-checked the $4.6 million figure ""and found it to be generally accurate,"" the group said in an email to PolitiFact on Oct. 24: ""Thank you for reaching out and for allowing us to acknowledge and correct our mistake. We will be more careful in the future when backchecking graphics that we did not create ourselves."" The Cruz campaign didn’t respond to an email about the Facebook post. Cruz does make $174,000 annually. All senators have been offered such a paycheck since 2009, when their salaries were increased from $169,300. But, as Abby Livingston of the Texas Tribune reports, it’s impossible to calculate the net worth of candidates for federal office based on their personal financial disclosure forms. That's because they don’t have to report exact amounts of income, financial assets or liabilities. Before winning the Senate in November 2012, Cruz filed a financial disclosure in July of that year showing that he and his wife, Heidi, had assets ranging from about $1.8 million to $4.4 million, according to our analysis. His liabilities ranged from about $900,000 to $2 million. Using these figures, it’s possible that the senator’s net worth was $500,000. If Cruz’s assets were worth $1.8 million, the low end of that range, and his liabilities totaled $2 million, the high end of that range, he would be in the red about $200,000. On the other hand, if his assets were worth $4.4 million and his liabilities $900,000, he could have been worth as much as $3.5 million back then. But that report covered calendar year 2011. Looking at the financial disclosure report Cruz filed in May 2013 for calendar year 2012 — the year he assumed his position in the Senate — his assets ranged from about $2.2 million to $5.1 million, and his liabilities ranged from about $750,000 to $1.5 million. The difference between the low end of the range for his assets and the high end of the range of his liabilities is $700,000. But if his assets were on the high end and his liabilities on the low end, the difference would be $4.3 million. The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics landed on slightly different numbers for 2012, with Cruz's assets ranging from $2.5 million to $5.9 million, leading them to estimate his net worth at $3.47 million. So, can we say, six years later that Cruz’ net worth is up to $4.6 million? In Cruz’s most recent financial report, which was filed in August 2018 but covers calendar year 2017, he listed assets ranging between about $2.2 million and $5 million, from stocks and a retirement plan, among other investments. He listed liabilities ranging from about $1.1 million and $5.4 million. If Cruz’s assets are in fact worth $5 million, the high end of that range, and his liabilities are only $1.1 million, the low end of that range, the most his net worth could be is about $3.9 million — not the $4.6 million claimed in the original graphic that Occupy Democrats shared. It’s hard to pin down lawmakers’ net worth, but some organizations have nonetheless tried — with a caveat. Roll Call, which produces a ""Wealth of Congress"" study, warns its ranking is a window into House and Senate members’ finances but ""far from comprehensive or exact."" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., is No. 1 on the Roll Call list with an estimated net worth of $283.3 million. The news organization, whose mission is to cover Congress, estimated O’Rourke’s net worth is $3 million, No. 97 among 530 voting senators and representatives in the 115th Congress (2017-2018). Cruz landed at No. 332 with an estimated net worth of about $200,000. Another financial footnote: Heidi Cruz is the managing director of Goldman Sachs in Houston. In a recent profile in The Atlantic, she described herself as the family’s ""primary breadwinner,"" working 70-hour weeks to keep the Cruzes financially afloat. Because this is a Democratic attack on Cruz, it’s important to look at how his challenger compares. O’Rourke also makes $174,000. He founded a technology company in El Paso and, according to the Tribune, he and his wife most recently listed assets — including a stake in that company, rental and commercial real estate, and his wife’s trust fund—that could range from $3.5 million to more than $16 million. The couple totaled liabilities between $1.3 million and $5.7 million, the Tribune reports. The Center for Responsive Politics estimated that in 2012, O’Rourke was worth $7.74 million. In 2015, according to the center, O’Rourke had an estimated net worth of nearly $9 million. Cruz, meanwhile, was worth $3.8 million that year, the group’s analysis shows. O’Rourke isn’t an outlier — Congress has plenty of wealthy members — but the suggestion that his opponent is making more than his salary in a way that’s unique doesn’t reflect reality. At most, based on the information available in Cruz’s own financial disclosures, his net worth was more than $500,000 when he became a senator in 2012 and he was potentially worth several million. And, based again on the figures he shared in 2018, his net worth is between $1.1 million and 5.7 million. That’s quite a spread — too much of a spread, we believe, to declare his actual net worth. What’s more, like Snopes, the only figure we could confirm is Cruz’s salary.  We rate this statement as False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/29/occupy-democrats/ted-cruz-net-worth-not-46m-according-best-calculat/

Three days later, the Athenaeum published a front-page editorial pushing back on Gee’s remark. ""Such a comment feeds into a narrative that diminishes truth, dubbing accurate news as ‘fake news’ and honest journalists as ‘enemies of the American people,’"" the editors wrote. When Gee held a meeting with the newspaper staff about a month later, he said that his original statement was taken out of context and sought to affirm his faith in the press. Encouraging the student paper to pursue greater diligence in their reporting, Gee said that ""the press is rated right now below that of Congress, and that is very low; it’s in the single digits."" Neither the press nor Congress is held in particularly high regard today, but we wondered: Is public trust in the press really lower than that of Congress? PolitiFact checked a similar statement by President Donald Trump in February 2017. We reviewed the data we found then and updated it with data that’s been produced since. As we noted in early 2017, Gallup has been asking people how much confidence they have in various institutions since 1973. Here’s a look at the run of historical data.  In a Gallup poll conducted in September 2018, 19 percent of respondents reported that they approved of the work Congress is doing in Washington, while 76 percent said that they disapproved. The remaining 5 percent reported that they had no opinion. As for the media, Gallup has asked the question a few different ways. In September 2018, the most recent poll specifically regarding media trust that Gallup published, asked the question, ""In general, how much trust and confidence do you have in the mass media such as newspapers, TV and radio -- when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly? A great deal, a fair amount, not very much or none at all?"" The survey found that 54 percent of individuals had ""not very much"" in the mass media or ""none at all."" But 45 percent responded that they had either a ""great deal"" or a ""fair amount"" of trust. In what may be Gallup’s most direct recent comparison of the press and Congress, a survey conducted in June 2018 asked about trust in various major institutions. In this survey, 58 percent of respondents said they had either a ""great deal/quite a lot"" of trust or ""some"" trust in newspapers, while 54 percent reported the same for television news. In the same poll, 50 percent of respondents said they had a ""great deal/quite a lot"" or ""some"" confidence in Congress, while 48 percent to say they had ""very little"" or ""none."" Looking just at the numbers for ""great deal/quite a lot,"" Congress was the lowest at 11 percent, with both types of news media in the low 20s. John Bolt, WVU’s senior executive director for the office of communications, responded to an email inquiry about the claim by citing several polls from NPR and Gallup. However, none of these polls supported Gee’s statement, either. The joint poll from NPR, PBS Newshour and Marist found that 25 percent of respondents had either ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in Congress, while 71 percent had ""not very much"" or none. In the same poll, 30 percent reported they had either ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in the media, while 68 percent reported they had ""not very much"" or none. A poll from Gallup asked respondents how they ""would rate the honesty and ethical standards of people in these different fields -- very high, high, average, low, or very low?"" 11 percent rated members of Congress very high or high, while 60 percent rated them very low or low. In the same poll, 25 percent rated the media very high or high, while 35 percent rated them very low or low. Gee would have been closer to the mark if he had referred to Republican views of the media. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research Center in February and March of 2018 measured partisan differences in attitudes towards the media. The lowest number is the 11 percent of Republicans who said that the ""national news media do very well at keeping them informed."" Meanwhile, 27 percent of Democrats responded said they believed that same statement. Bottom line: The levels of trust in the media are higher than Gee had indicated, and trust in the media are higher than they are for Congress. Gee said that in public approval, ""the press is rated right now below that of Congress, and that is very low; it’s in the single digits."" Levels of trust for both institutions are low, but Gee’s claims are wrong on two counts. First, trust in Congress is consistently lower than trust in the media. And second, we couldn’t find a poll in which the press’s approval ratings were in the single digits. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/29/e-gordon-gee/trust-media-lower-trust-congress/

This shark photo has never been and will never be a Nat Geo 'photo of the year'
","A Facebook account that posts wildlife photography has jumped the shark. In May, the account shared an image of what appears to be a great white breaching, soaring above the surf. ""National Geographic’s photo of the year,"" the caption says. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo was posted by a Facebook account called ""The Planet Today"" and it’s been shared more than 300,000 times. The account did not immediately respond to a message seeking the source of the photo. National Geographic also did not immediately respond to an email asking about the Facebook post. However, searching for the image on Google reveals a number of posts that pre-date 2018. In February 2017, for example, a Twitter user tapped the image for some early-morning inspiration. ""Do sharks complain about it being Monday?"" he tweeted. ""No, they are up early, biting stuff, chasing food, being scary, reminding everyone they’re a shark."" The shark has shown up on Pinterest and blogs. But we couldn’t find any credible websites connecting it to National Geographic. National Geographic does has an annual Travel Photographer of the Year competition. The grand prize this year was awarded to Reiko Takahashi, who photographed a humpback whale. The shark wasn’t the photo of the year in 2016, either, when this same shark pic was making the rounds on social media. In December 2016, National Geographic posted a blog refuting a claim that the photo was its photo of the year—an award the magazine doesn’t have. But editor Daniel Stone took the opportunity to blast fake news as a ""threat to those of us in the business of telling the truth."" He also shared 14 real shark photos. Check them out here.

Zimbabwean inventor did not create an electric car that never needs charging
","A false story about a Zimbabwean inventor defying the laws of physics with an electric car that never needs to be recharged is re-circulating on social media. The initial blog post was published in April 2018 on the conspiracy-fueled website Disclose.tv. It popped up again this month on Facebook and has been shared more than 25,000 times, according to CrowdTangle data. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The man who supposedly invented this vehicle, Sangulani Maxwell Chikumbutso, first appeared in headlines in the corners of the internet in 2015. At the time, his company, Saith Technologies, held an ""Open Day"" where he debuted his inventions and products, according to Zimbabwean technology news site Techzim. The South African news channel SABC Digital News also covered the event. All of the images on Saith’s Facebook and Twitter pages are from that event, as are all of the pictures of the inventions the company claims to have created. Neither account has been active since mid-2015. The Saith Technologies website appears to have been taken down. Chikumbutso claimed that his car runs on ""5 normal gel batteries."" According to an archived version of the Saith website, a secret substance is exposed to radio wavelengths, which give the car’s ""power generator"" the ""capacity to funnel the power generated into functional electrical energy"" and never require a recharge. Following the ""Open Day"" event, Techzim questioned the legitimacy of Saith Technologies products. It did not report on the company again. Techzim noted that Chikumbutso’s car was outside of the law of conservation of energy because it somehow converted 220 volt-producing gel batteries into a much higher output of 500,000 watts. ""We are not sure how this assertion can be dispelled and we hope at some forum scientist [sic] will put the claims to test,"" the article read. The disclose.tv article says that the U.S. government ""recently"" relocated Chikumbutso to California to work on his inventions and that it might be to ""control this type of invention."" There is no evidence that this happened. Three years ago, a man at a one-day event touted ""inventions,"" including a car that defies the laws of physics. Since 2015, his story has only found a home on false news blogs and conspiracy sites. We rate this claim Pants on Fire! Correction, Dec. 2, 2019: This report has been corrected to note that SABC Digital News is a news organization based in South Africa, not Zimbabwe.",/factchecks/2018/oct/29/blog-posting/zimbabwean-inventor-did-not-create-electric-car-ne/
