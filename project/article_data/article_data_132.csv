Donald Trump shirt on Whoopi Goldberg is doctored
","A viral image on Facebook purported to show Whoopi Goldberg wearing a shirt with a cartoon of President Donald Trump firing a gun at himself, but the image was manipulated.

""Out of curiosity, ABC & Disney, is this okay with you? Hypocrisy on the Left is sickening! Your (sic) pathetic!"" user JamieR tweeted. Barr has since deleted her retweet.

In the original photograph, taken at the Women’s March in New York on Jan. 21, 2017, Goldberg wore a shirt that read, ""And you thought I was a nasty woman before? Buckle up, buttercup."" Goldberg showed the original shirt she wore using video footage on The View on April 18, 2017, when the image first surfaced. ""I need to clear up a lie that was posted online this morning,"" Goldberg said. ""A photo of me at the Women’s March has been photoshopped to show me wearing an offensive shirt against you-know-who. Even though I don’t care for this man, I would never wear this shirt that’s there."" That didn’t stop social media users from circulating the image again in May 2017, when comedian Kathy Griffin landed in hot water after posing for photographs with a mock severed head of Trump. Goldberg explained the photo again when it resurfaced on May 30, 2018. ""Now, some bonehead photoshopped a horrific image on the shirt,"" Goldberg said. ""And (Barr) retweeted this. So this is what I’m going to say, Roseanne. Just because you were caught with your pants down, don’t try to drag other people down with you."" The picture was doctored.

Donald Trump's false claim about 'thousands' of immigration judges
","President Donald Trump has denounced the way the United States processes immigration cases, calling for thousands more judges to address a backlog on top of the current ranks. Trump highlighted the role of judges in immigration proceedings in early May after he falsely attributed a ""catch and release"" immigration practice to Democrats. ""We have thousands of judges. Do you think other countries have judges?"" Trump said. ""We give them, like, trials. That’s the good news. The bad news is, they never show up for the trial. Okay?"" In a May 24 interview with Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade, Trump again said the United States was the only country that had judges, while others had ""security people. People that stand there and say you can't come in."" ""We have thousands of judges, and they need thousands of more judges. The whole system is corrupt. It's horrible,"" Trump said. ""So yeah, you need thousands of judges based on this crazy system. Whoever heard of a system where you put people through trials? Where do these judges come from? You know a judge is a very special person. How do you hire thousands of people to be a judge? So it's ridiculous. We are going to change the system. We have no choice for the good of our country."" Trump’s conversation with Kilmeade centered on immigration, so we wondered if there are ""thousands of judges"" clearing immigration cases. Far from it. Fewer than 400 judges currently have this task. There also aren’t that many federal judges who hear other matters. (Immigration is regulated at the federal level.) There are slightly over 1,300 Article III federal judges that serve on the the Supreme Court, courts of appeals, district courts, and U.S. Court of International Trade. Adding the current number of immigration judges to that count still falls short of ""thousands."" The White House did not offer data to back Trump’s claim of ""thousands"" of judges, but pointed to remarks he made in April about increasing the number of immigration judges. ""We’re trying to hire thousands of judges,"" Trump said during a roundtable discussion on tax reform. The number of pending immigration cases has been increasing over the years. In fiscal year 2008, there were about 186,000 pending cases. That number has grown substantially over the last decade. Nearly 700,000 immigration cases were pending as of March 31, 2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided funding for the hiring of at least 100 additional immigration judge teams with a goal of fielding 484 immigration judge teams nationwide by 2019, according to an April report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. (Judge teams consist of an immigration judge,  judicial law clerk, legal assistant, and three administrative support staff, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association.) The Office of the Chief Immigration Judge within the U.S. Justice Department provides direction and sets priorities for the approximately 350 immigration judges located in about 60 immigration courts throughout the country, according to the Justice Department. James McHenry, director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review at the Justice Department, pegged the number of immigration judges at 334 in an April statement to a Senate committee. ""The reference to ‘thousands’ of immigration judges is inaccurate,"" said Judge A. Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. The Executive Office for Immigration Review has historically faced challenges filling positions due to a department-wide hiring freeze between January 2011 and February 2014, and to normal attrition, said Jeremy McKinney, secretary for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Still, there are not thousands of immigration judges, he said, ""not even close."" Speaking of immigration cases, Trump said, ""We have thousands of judges."" There are fewer than 400 immigration judges nationwide. The number of Article III federal judges is about 1,300. Even a combination of those numbers falls short of thousands. Trump’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C01F00>],/factchecks/2018/may/30/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-about-thousands-immigrat/

Texas law bars adults from leaving loaded guns accessible to children younger than 17
","Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told a national TV audience after the May 2018 Santa Fe High School shootings that he doesn’t see a need for more gun regulation in that Texas already bars children from having loaded weapons. We decided to check Patrick's reference to law given that the admitted Santa Fe shooter reportedly used his father’s shotgun and handgun in the attack. Our research identified the 1995 law, though we also learned it wouldn’t apply to the Santa Fe incident due to the shooter’s age of 17. Patrick, taking questions from George Stephanopoulos on the May 20, 2017, edition of ABC's This Week, said: ""We have to look at ourselves, George. It’s not about the guns. It’s about us. Can there be gun regulation? ""Gun control, I believe, starts at home, George. Every person who owns a gun must be accountable for their guns at home,"" Patrick said. ""We don’t know all the facts yet. But this particular young man got his guns in some way from his parents’ home. You should have your guns locked up. It’s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child, for example."" Law confirmed Our online search for such a law led us to a web page about preventing Texas children from getting guns created by the San Francisco-based Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. That page says Texas has a law holding a person criminally liable if he or she, ""with criminal negligence,"" fails to secure a ""readily dischargeable"" firearm and a child under age 17 gains access to it. Next, we turned to section 46.13 of the Texas penal code, titled ""Making a Firearm Accessible to a Child,"" which defines a readily dischargeable firearm as one ""loaded with ammunition, whether or not a round is in the chamber."" The law states:   ""A person commits an offense if a child gains access to a readily dischargeable firearm and the person with criminal negligence: (1)  failed to secure the firearm;  or (2)  left the firearm in a place to which the person knew or should have known the child would gain access."" Under the law, ""secure"" means ""to take steps that a reasonable person would take to prevent the access to a readily dischargeable firearm by a child, including but not limited to placing a firearm in a locked container or temporarily rendering the firearm inoperable by a trigger lock or other means."" The law otherwise provides defenses to prosecution starting with whether the child’s access was supervised by a person older than 18 and the firearm was for hunting, sporting ""or other lawful purposes."" Under the law, a violation is a Class C misdemeanor or a Class A misdemeanor ""if the child discharges the firearm and causes death or serious bodily injury to himself or another person."" Legislative history Legislative records show the legislation creating the law won approval in 1995, the same year that then-state Sen. Jerry Patterson, R-Pasadena, shepherded into law the state's concealed-carry measure. We connected with Patterson, who told us by email that the child-specific proposal, initiated by Rep. Al Edwards, D-Houston, had momentum that year in part due to testimony by a Houston couple who had lost their son to an accidental shooting. The boy’s mother, Linda Tarr, testified at the time: ""This bill is to save children. It  is not a gun-control bill. This is a gun-responsibility act, and children are our responsibility.'' Effective law? We also wondered about the law’s effects. The April 1995 Austin American-Statesman news story where we spotted Tarr’s testimony said that in 1993, 42 children younger than 17 had been killed in accidents involving firearms. There have lately been fewer such deaths, according to figures we requested from the Texas Department of State Health Services. Spokesman Chris Van Deusen emailed us a chart indicating that in 2014-15, 11 Texas children younger than 17 were killed in accidents involving firearms. Separately, Ari Freilich, a lawyer for the Giffords center, said by email that Texas is among 27 states with child access prevention laws potentially making adults legally accountable for letting minors gain unsupervised access to guns. But Freilich called the Texas law weaker than laws in some states because it only applies to adults who leave readily operable loaded firearms accessible to unsupervised minors. ""As a result, Texas' law would likely not apply even if an adult left an unsupervised minor home alone with an unloaded firearm out on the table right next to a box of ammunition,"" Freilich wrote. Also, Freilich said, the Texas law wouldn't apply to what evidently happened at Santa Fe High School because the admitted shooter was 17--and the law applies only to guns taken by minors 16 or younger. After the Santa Fe shootings, the center posted a memo to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott stating the law should be amended, at the least, to apply to minors under 18 ""and to cases where an adult leaves unloaded firearms and ammunition accessible to the minor."" We also asked the NRA-tied Texas State Rifle Association about the law. By phone, Alice Gene Tripp praised it, saying: ""It doesn’t try to criminalize how you store your guns. It simply puts a penalty in statute if you don’t do it effectively. Texas allows adults to make adult decisions and penalizes those who don’t do it correctly."" Our ruling Patrick said: ""It’s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child."" A 1995 state law makes it a misdemeanor if a person with criminal negligence fails to secure a loaded gun and a child younger than 17 accesses it or if a person leaves the gun where he or she knew or should have known the child would get it.

"['Education', 'Florida', 'Florida House Majority Office']","
Florida House says per-student bump of 47 cents is a myth. Here's why that's overstated
","Florida House Republicans are playing mythbusters on claims of stagnant school spending. The House Majority Office, which is overseen by Speaker Richard Corcoran, released a five-minute video May 17 that takes aim at teachers’ unions and state educators (and unnamed ""media allies"") who say the 2018-19 education budget isn’t enough to cover the costs of running a school district. Back in March, superintendents of some of Florida’s largest districts wrote a column saying, ""The 47 cents per student increase in the base student allocation — the only funds school districts can use for student programs, teacher salaries and other costs — will force us to make cuts in critical areas of our operations."" The House Republicans’ released their video on the same day 35 Democrats called on the Legislature to hold a special session to reconsider education funding for the next school year (a motion that failed). It offers a defense of education spending (using phrases like ""sparsity supplement"" and ""millage compression"") to argue that approved spending is really closer to $100 per student, at least. ""Have you heard the ‘47 cents’ myth?"" the Florida House asked in the description of the video. ""The rumor goes ‘per-student funding only rose by $0.47 this year.’ Nothing could be further from the truth."" The number isn’t a myth; it just isn’t the number that House Republicans want to highlight as inaccurate. House leaders and district officials are using two different ways to measure per-student funding, based on different funding sources. There’s some truth to both claims, but using either amount requires more context. Calling one a ""myth"" is too dismissive. The House Majority Office argues that per-pupil spending increased by $101, not 47 cents. The $101 figure is accurate if you consider every facet of education funding. The state’s 2018-19 education budget increased public school spending by more than $485 million. In 2017-18, per-pupil funding was $7,307. In 2018-19, it increased slightly to $7,408 per student (an increase of $101.50). It’s worth noting that the $101 increase is an average of what school districts will receive, so the actual amount of per-pupil funding really depends on the county. For example, it’s possible that the largest districts won’t receive all of the $101 after taking into account new state mandates and an expected student decrease. According to the Florida Department of Education documents, total per-pupil funding will increase by $65 in Miami-Dade; $52 in Broward County; $73 in Pinellas County; and $85 in Hillsborough County. That said, other counties, particularly smaller ones like Calhoun County, will receive $263. More importantly, the $101 increase in student spending includes every source of education funding. Some sources of funding have to be used for specific purposes. To name a few, there’s the Exceptional Student Education allocation reserved for people who are disabled or gifted; the Teacher Classroom Supply Assistance Program, which allows teachers to purchase materials and supplies for the public school students assigned to them; and the digital classroom allocation, which provides money for devices. It also includes the money set aside to hire additional school resource officers and money to increase mental health facilities. So, while it’s accurate to say per-student funding rose by $101, it’s important to know that school districts don’t have a lot of flexibility in how that money can be used. That’s why state educators and unions have used the increase in the base student allocation (47 cents) to demonstrate how little money is left for districts to pay for day-to-day operating costs. Labeling the 47-cent claim ""a myth"" is misleading. After all, it appears in the Florida Department of Education’s own 2018-19 document about education financing. This amount refers to the budget’s base student allocation, the amount of money allocated for each student. The money is unrestricted, which means districts have the most freedom in how that portion of the education budget is used. The base student allocation is one of the only pieces of the budget that goes toward teachers’ salaries and raises, electricity, fuel for buses, health care for faculty and administrators, and other operational costs. In 2017-18, the base student allocation was $4,203.95. In 2018-19, it increased slightly to $4,204.42 per student (an increase of 47 cents, if you haven’t caught on by now). The base student allocation fell during the recession from 2007 to 2012. Funding has increased each year starting in 2012-13, though those year-over-year hikes have been bigger than in this year’s budget. Fiscal year Base Student Allocation 2007-08 $4,079.74 2008-09 $3,886.14 2009-10 $3,630.62 2010-11 $3,623.76 2011-12 $3,479.22 2012-13 $3,582.98 (+$103) 2013-14 $3,752.30 (+$169.32) 2014-15 $4,031.77 (+279.47) 2015-16 $4,154.45 (+$122.68) 2016-17 $4,160.71 (+$6.26) 2017-18 $4,203.95 (+$43.24) 2018-19 $4,204.42 (+$0.47) The 47-cent increase wasn’t always the plan. In January, before the Parkland shooting, the House’s original education budget included increasing the base student allocation by $75. School districts receive more than just the base student allocation for education-related expenses. But the issue is that a good chunk of the overall funding is tied to specific purposes. For example, more than $161 billion of the $500 million increase is for the safe school allocation and can only be used on certain purposes such as paying for school resource officers. Another good chunk — $69 million — has to go toward mental health services. In both of those cases, the money is restricted and can only be used for its intended purpose. So, unlike the base student allocation, it can’t be used on teacher raises. ""While money has been poured into special legislative projects such as best and brightest, safe schools and mental health, it is the core funding beginning with the base student allocation that enables districts to do the vast majority of the work they do with students throughout the year,"" said Tracey Pierce, the Duval schools chief of public relations and marketing. The Florida House Majority Office said that it’s ""a myth"" that per-student funding only rose by 47 cents this year. The claim that per-student funding only rose by 47 cents definitely needs context. But calling it a myth goes too far, as does the Republicans’ claim that per-pupil spending is really closer to $100. Moreover, not every district will get that per-pupil amount. An amount that high is only possible once you factor in all education-related spending. That includes a good chunk of money that has to be spent on specific purposes like school security and mental health. The increase in the base student allocation (47 cents) represents the amount of money left over for flexible spending, which districts can use for student programs, teacher salaries and other operational costs. The office's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2B9100>],/factchecks/2018/may/30/florida-house-majority/did-florida-students-see-increase-47-cents-or-it-m/
"['Education', 'Income', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
With caveats, Scott Walker is right that income and property taxes in 2018 are lower than in 2010
","One of the favorite boasts of Republican Gov. Scott Walker -- and one he’s sure to repeat as he runs for a third term in November 2018 -- is how much he has cut taxes. In an online re-election ad released April 17, 2018, Walker claimed a number of tax-cut accomplishments, including this one: ""Property and income taxes will be lower in 2018 than they were in 2010."" Are they? The answer: Yes, with some caveats. In a nutshell, total property and income tax collections are higher now than they were. But that’s partly because of growth, such as property taxes based on new construction, and income taxes paid by more people being in the workforce. On the other hand, when you consider a typical taxpayer -- the property tax bill on a median home and income tax rates across the board -- the two taxes are lower in 2018 than 2010.   Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Property taxes To evaluate the first part of Walker’s claim, we’ll rely in part on our Walk-O-Meter, which tracks 86 previous campaign promises made by Walker over his previous two campaigns. When running for a second term in 2014, Walker promised to cut property taxes so that the levy on a typical home in 2018 is lower than it was in 2010. When we rated that pledge in November 2017, we gave Walker a Promise Kept, based on figures from the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. We followed up with the fiscal bureau and were given these figures for the property tax on a median-value home: 2010 2018 Difference $2,963 $2,875 -$88 Fiscal Bureau director Bob Lang told us that the median-value figure is what his agency provides in evaluating state budget bills, so it’s a typical measure. Median figures are also what Walker’s campaign relied on to back up the propery tax part of Walker’s claim. Two tax experts from nonpartisan organizations -- Jason Stein, research director at the Wisconsin Policy Forum and Dale Knapp, who was research director at the former Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance -- agreed that the median is a common measure for how property taxes have changed. But they pointed out that tax bills for properties can vary widely around the state, due to differences in property values, tax rates and other factors. In other words, not everyone’s property tax bill is lower. It’s worth noting that critics have said that under Walker, funding has been reduced for the state homestead tax credit, which was designed to provide property tax relief to low-income homeowners and renters. The nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project estimates that as a result of the most recent reduction, done in the 2017-’19 state budget, about 11,400 households will see property tax increases averaging $614 per year. The Wisconsin Democratic Party pointed to a recent rise in school referendums adopted by voters in school districts around the state, arguing the referendums are being forced because of reductions in state funding. The Walk-O-Meter Here’s a breakdown of our ratings on 88 campaign promises made by Scott Walker during his first two campaigns for governor. Promise Kept -- 53.5 percent Promise Broken -- 20.9 percent Compromise -- 12.8 percent In the Works -- 7 percent Stalled -- 5.8 percent Income taxes Both Stein and Knapp said changes in income taxes are more difficult to measure for a typical taxpayer because there are more variables -- such as how many exemptions or tax credits a taxpayer qualifies for, whether the taxpayers is single or married, owns a home, has children at home, etc. But they said one reasonable measure is income tax rates, especially given that’s where Walker has made major changes. Tax rates are what Walker’s campaign cited to back up the second part of Walker’s claim. We went to the fiscal bureau again and Lang confirmed that the tax rates in each income bracket are lower than they were in 2010. For people filing as single, married/jointly and married/separately, there were five rates in 2010, starting with the lowest level of taxable income and going up: 4.6 percent 6.15 percent 6.5 percent 6.75 percent 7.75 percent In 2018, there are only four: 4 percent 5.84 percent 6.27 percent 7.65 percent Jon Peacock, director of the Wisconsin Budget Project, told us it’s important to note that some low-income parents are paying higher income taxes because of cuts to the earned income tax credit. For families with three or more children who get the maximum credit, for example, a change Walker initiated in 2011 will cost them $579 in 2018, he said. The Democratic Party pointed out that a manufacturing and agricultural tax credit, worth more than $1 billion according to the fiscal bureau, primarily benefits corporations and high-income earners. Our rating Walker says: ""Property and income taxes will be lower in 2018 than they were in 2010."" Total property and income tax collections are higher in 2018 than they were in 2010, partly because of new properties paying taxes and more workers paying income taxes. But using two reasonable measures at the individual level, the property tax on a typical home is lower in 2018 and than it was in 2010; and across the board, income tax rates are lower in 2018 than in 2010.

"['Ethics', 'Illinois', 'Rod Blagojevich']","
Blago op-ed falsely claims he is in prison for ‘practicing politics'
","There’s little need to rehash the saga of Rod Blagojevich, Illinois’ 40th governor and the only one ever impeached. For the last six years he has been locked up in a federal prison in Littleton, Colorado, serving a 14-year sentence for convictions on an array of corruption charges, including a spectacularly brazen attempt to sell his power as governor to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the ascension of Barack Obama to the presidency. Blagojevich has exhausted all appeals through the courts to get his conviction overturned or the sentence reduced. Lately, his family and some diehard supporters have made noises about seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump, who once featured Blagojevich on his Celebrity Apprentice TV show and who, judging by his tweets, has his own beef with aggressive prosecutors. Against that backdrop, federal prisoner number 40892-424 this week penned a column in the conservative opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal, owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch who is tight with Trump. Murdoch also owns the conservative Fox News Channel, which the president is known to binge watch. Blagojevich framed his column as a cautionary tale to other politicians, warning that he had been hounded unfairly by an out-of-control Justice Department ""abusing their power to criminalize the routine practices of politics and government."" ""I’m in Prison for Practicing Politics,"" the headline on his opinion article declared. All of which raises some provocative questions. Is Blagojevich really the victim here, as he clearly suggests? And was he sent to prison for merely doing the same things other politicians and government officials routinely do? First, a note of explanation. The authors of this fact-check have more than a passing knowledge of Blagojevich. One covered every moment of both his federal corruption trials as a reporter for The Chicago Tribune, the other also as a Tribune reporter covered the federal investigation that led to Blagojevich’s indictment and later co-authored a book chronicling his political rise and fall. The portrait that emerged from that up-close observation was of a leader sublimely self-righteous, comically vain, untrustworthy, uninterested in the process of governing, unsophisticated in the arts of policy and deal making and not particularly discriminating in whose counsel he sought. As governor, he waged a bitter public battle with his father-in-law, who had been his political mentor. Another top adviser and fundraiser went to prison in corruption schemes that served as a precursor to Blagojevich’s own indictment. Another top fundraiser committed suicide after pleading guilty to federal charges in a kickback scheme. On the day he was sentenced in December 2011, Blagojevich fell on his sword before U.S. District Judge James Zagel, appearing to own his misdeeds in a plea for mercy that did not work. ""My life is ruined,"" he told Zagel. ""I have nobody to blame but myself for my stupidity and actions and words and what I thought I could do. I’m not blaming anybody."" But in his Wall Street Journal article, Blagojevich made clear that he was no longer blaming himself as he accused prosecutors and the FBI of abusing their powers to bring him down. ""Here I am in my sixth year of a 14-year prison sentence for the routine practice of attempting to raise campaign funds while governor,"" he wrote. Blagojevich’s legal team raised that defense at trial, but jurors rejected it. Acting on a tip from a longtime Blagojevich confidant, government agents received court approval to wiretap phones in the governor’s home and political office. It was evidence gathered from those wiretaps, much of it from Blagojevich’s own mouth, that served as the centerpiece of the case against him. Over two separate trials, Blagojevich was convicted on 18 criminal counts including wire fraud, bribery, attempted extortion, conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Five of those counts were later tossed on appeal, but the crimes for which he still stands convicted include: Among wiretaps played at trial were some that captured Blagojevich discussing a scheme to appoint a longtime political adversary to the post, then U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., in exchange for $1.5 million in political donations. Prosecutors said they arrested Blagojevich in December 2008 to prevent him from pulling the trigger on that deal. ""I’m in prison for practicing politics,"" read the headline on the article by the former Illinois governor. Blagojevich and his legal team also made the ""politics as usual, nothing to see here"" argument during his trials, but such claims were soundly rejected by federal jurors. Over two trials, they convicted him of multiple criminal counts stemming from his conduct in office. Much of the evidence presented at those trials stemmed from court-ordered wiretaps on which Blagojevich was heard scheming to carry out the very crimes for which he was convicted. Blagojevich was contrite about his actions at his sentencing, appearing to own up to misdeeds. Now, in playing the victim card, he is attempting to take that all back. But Blagojevich’s own words and deeds proved his undoing. Illinois has certainly suffered its share of public corruption, and skepticism about politicians abounds. But Blagojevich’s ""everybody does it"" argument seems an over-the-top exercise in desperation and self-pity. We give his claims our lowest credibility rating, Pants On Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3CD4C0>],/factchecks/2018/may/29/rod-blagojevich/blago-op-ed-falsely-claims-he-prison-practicing-po/

Donald Trump said a New York Times source in the White House doesn't exist. He does
","  Most Americans aren’t glued to Twitter over the Memorial Day weekend, but that didn’t stop a controversy this year, pitting President Donald Trump against journalists who cover the White House. On May 25, the New York Times published an article headlined, ""Trump Says North Korea Summit May Be Rescheduled."" The article included a line expressing an unnamed White House official’s skepticism that a summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un could be held on its originally scheduled date. ""On Thursday, for example, a senior White House official told reporters that even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed,"" the article said. The following morning, Trump tweeted criticism of the New York Times story. ""The Failing @nytimes quotes ‘a senior White House official,’ who doesn’t exist, as saying ‘even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed,’"" Trump tweeted. ""WRONG AGAIN! Use real people, not phony sources."" The Failing @nytimes quotes “a senior White House official,” who doesn’t exist, as saying “even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.” WRONG AGAIN! Use real people, not phony sources. Reporters from multiple outlets began pushing back on the notion that the New York Times had fabricated a source. The White House, they said, had actually furnished the source that Trump denied existing. They said the official did indeed exist; in fact, he had conducted ""an off-camera, not for broadcast, background briefing on North Korea,"" in the wording of the White House email that had announced it on May 24. The briefing had been held in the White House press room and was opened up to reporters elsewhere via a conference call line. Under the ground rules of a ""background briefing,"" reporters cannot use the name of the specific official and instead must use a more vague descriptor. The New York Times published a story after Trump sent his tweet, headlined, ""Trump Falsely Says Times Made Up Source in Report on Korea Summit Meeting."" It said that the source referred to in the article ""was in fact a senior White House official speaking to a large group of reporters in the White House briefing room."" Margaret Talev, the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, tweeted that she shared her ""colleagues’ conclusion.""   I share my colleagues’ conclusion- the sr official whose existence the president disputes certainly appears to be same sr official who briefed 100+ of us in person and via conf call from WH. Brfng conducted on condition it be on bck with no audio/video distrib. So what’s going on here? We did our own review. We found Trump was wrong in saying that the source ""doesn’t exist"" and was ""phony."" Evidence shows Trump's own White House arranged the briefing with the official. Yes. This can be demonstrated by audio released on Twitter by Yashar Ali, a contributor to New York magazine and HuffPost. The clip offers the first minute and a half of the background briefing. (The audio is actually video of the press room’s empty lectern as it it records sound elsewhere in the room.) 4. I've obtained audio of the WH press briefing. You can hear Raj Shah, Deputy Press Secretary, introduce Pottinger (along with the terms - which are standard) and then Pottinger makes the statement that POTUS says was never made. Lots of reporters in briefing room and on phone. pic.twitter.com/2gEYkRSyTv Some media outlets have not published the briefer’s name, including many outlets who participated in the briefing and felt they were bound by the original agreement not to publish the name. However, other outlets have subsequently published the name made available in the audio Ali tweeted. PolitiFact will reprint the briefer’s name for a few reasons: It is needed to full address the accuracy of Trump’s charge; the information is now readily available on the Internet; and we were not a participant in the original briefing and did not agree to keep it on background. The briefer was Matthew Pottinger, the National Security Council’s senior director for Asian affairs. Here’s a transcript of the audio segment Ali tweeted: White House press official: ""This briefing’s going to be on background, off camera, not for broadcast. Pottinger here can be referred to as a senior White House official. He is deputy assistant to the president for Asia. And you can take it from here."" Reporter: ""Can you clarify that the president obviously announced in the letter that the particular time and date of the summit is called off. Later, he said it’s possible the existing summit could take place, or a summit at a later date. Is he saying it’s possible that June 12 could still happen?"" Pottinger: ""The main point, I suppose, is that the ball’s in North Korea’s court right now. And there's really not a lot of time. We've lost quite a bit of time that we would need in order to — I mean there's an enormous amount of preparation that's gone on over the past few months in the White House, at State, and with other agencies and so forth, but there's a certain amount of actual dialogue that needs to take place at the working level with your counterparts to ensure that the agenda is clear in the minds of those two leaders when they sit down to actually meet and talk and negotiate and hopefully make a deal. And June 12 is in 10 minutes and it's going to be, you know — but the president has said that he some day looks forward to meeting…"" The White House declined to either confirm or deny to PolitiFact that Pottinger was the briefer. But the audio speaks for itself. Trump's underlying issue with the New York Times report might have to do with its paraphrase of what the official said.  Pottinger was certainly skeptical that a summit could happen on the original date, but he never actually used the word ""impossible"" — which is the phrasing the New York Times’ article had used. The White House argues that Trump’s incredulity is justified because, despite the New York Times’ characterization, nobody said in the briefing that a summit would be ""impossible."" That said, the New York Times paraphrased Pottinger rather than quoting him, as Trump said in his tweet. That gives the newspaper a bit of wiggle room. Trump tweeted, ""The Failing @nytimes quotes ‘a senior White House official,’ who doesn’t exist, as saying ‘even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.’ WRONG AGAIN! Use real people, not phony sources."" Trump is wrong that the senior White House official cited by the New York Times ""doesn’t exist"" and is ""phony."" In fact, the official in question, Pottinger, gave an authorized background briefing to dozens of reporters in person and via phone. The New York Times article that Trump criticized may have gone too far by paraphrasing Pottinger as saying that a June 12 summit would be impossible, since Pottinger didn’t use that specific word. However, Pottinger did express a significant degree of skepticism about the prospect of a June 12 summit.  If that was Trump's gripe, it isn't what he said. The White House source did exist.

Donald Trump blames Democrats for own immigration policy separating families
","President Donald Trump wrongly blamed Democrats for his own administrator’s immigration policy. ""Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there (sic) parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.,"" Trump tweeted. Trump recently told Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, ""I know what you're going through right now with families is very tough, but those are the bad laws that the Democrats gave us. We have to break up families."" But there is no law that mandates separating children from their parents. Trump’s own administration devised a policy to that effect. So what is Trump talking about? Whenever parents are charged with a federal misdemeanor (entry without inspection in this case), or awaiting trial, they are placed in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Children cannot go to jail, so they are transferred to the custody of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement. They are then placed with relatives, juvenile detention centers or foster care. That’s a longstanding Homeland Security policy, DHS told us. Before the Trump administration, immigrants entering illegally as families were rarely prosecuted, said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute. Instead, immigrants were held in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on April 6 the Homeland Security Department would now be referring all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution. Facing criminal charges, parents would go to detention centers, leaving their children unaccompanied. It’s the decision to prosecute parents that is causing the separations. ""That’s a choice they have made that’s largely different from what other administrations have done,"" said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. When we asked for evidence of policies separating families, the White House referred us to items determining what happens to unaccompanied immigrant minors. But none of the children in question would be deemed unaccompanied if the Trump administration did not decide to prosecute their parents. The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement, for example, calls for the release of unaccompanied minors to family members or sponsors who can care for them as their immigration case is resolved. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which Trump has wrongly called ""a Democrat rule,"" determines that unaccompanied minors be transferred to Health and Human Services custody. The White House argued such policies encourage parents to send their children into the United States, knowing they will be promptly released. ""The cruel and inhumane open borders policies of the Democratic Party are responsible for encouraging mass illegal migration, enabling horrendous child smuggling, and releasing violent MS-13 gang members into American communities,"" White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in an emailed statement. The Trump administration may believe that Democrats are responsible for policies that encourage illegal border crossing, but we found no law mandating that children be separated from their parents. Trump said a ""horrible law"" requires that children be separated from their parents ""once they cross the Border into the U.S."" There is no such law. The Homeland Security Department’s longstanding policy is to separate children from their custodians when they are referred for criminal prosecution. Trump’s administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families were rarely prosecuted under previous administrations.

Did Travis Allen oppose driver licenses for undocumented immigrants?
","Republican gubernatorial candidates John Cox and Travis Allen are competing for the conservative vote in California’s June primary. As part of that competition, they’re trying to prove who has the toughest credentials on immigration. Or, in the case of a recent TV attack ad by the Cox campaign, disprove their opponents’ record on the issue. Last week, we rated Mostly True Cox’s claim from the same ad that Allen, an Orange County assemblyman, donated to three of California’s top Democrats. We noted the donations took place when Allen was running his financial business full-time and before he ran for office. In this fact-check, we’ll examine the ad’s separate allegation that ""on the floor vote, Allen refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens.""  The ad was paid for by John Cox for Governor 2018. Did Allen, who has positioned himself as a staunch opponent of benefits for undocumented Californians, really miss this key vote? Background on Republican rivals Recent polls show increasing support for Cox, a wealthy San Diego businessman, who President Trump endorsed earlier this month. A survey released May 23 by the Public Policy Institute of California shows Gavin Newsom, the state’s lieutenant governor, leading Cox, 25 percent to 19 percent. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was third, at 15 percent, followed by Allen with 11 percent,  State Treasurer John Chiang at 9 percent and former state schools chief Delaine Eastin with 6 percent. The top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff. Missed vote? The claim in the Cox ad refers to votes on AB 60, which the California Legislature approved and Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed in 2013. Advocates for the law successfully argued it will make California’s roads safer by ensuring that many of the unauthorized immigrants who already drive have been properly trained and tested. Critics argue AB 60 condones law-breaking, and some claim the licenses could be used to commit fraud and that it could increase security risks. As of April 2018, the state had issued more than one million licenses under the law, which requires the new cards to display the words ""Federal Limits Apply"" in the top right corner. The license is for driving privileges only and not for federal use, such as boarding a plane. Nor does it allow undocumented Californians to vote, despite inflammatory claims to the contrary. Legislative records show Allen and other Assembly Republicans voted against the measure during a floor vote on May 29, 2013. But that wasn’t Allen’s final chance to weigh in on the bill.   During a final concurrence vote on September 12, 2013, records show no vote was recorded for Allen. The lawmaker was present at the Capitol that day, and voted on bills  before and after the final decision on AB 60, according to records kept by the Assembly Journal. Allen’s vote would not have made the difference, as the bill passed 55 to 21. Asked about this, Allen’s campaign spokeswoman pointed to the lawmaker’s May vote. She said he ""missed"" the final vote but did not elaborate on why he missed it. Our ruling John Cox’s campaign for governor claimed in a recent TV ad that Travis Allen ""on the floor vote … refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens."" Legislative records show Allen voted against a bill that allowed undocumented Californians to apply for a state drivers license during a floor vote in the state Assembly in May 2013. They also show he missed a final vote against the same measure in September 2013, even though he was present at the Capitol that day. There’s some truth to Cox’s claim. But it leaves out the key context about Allen’s earlier opposition, a detail that’s too important to omit. We rate the claim Half True.

Trump correctly tweets that Democrats mistakenly tweeted photo of child migrants being held in 2014
","President Donald Trump went on offense against Democrats after liberals attacked the Trump administration’s policy on child migrants. Trump said the Democrats were sharing a photo of detained children from 2014 during President Barack Obama’s presidency. ""Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages,"" Trump tweeted May 29. ""They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country...Bipartisan Bill!"" Trump’s tweets followed some blame and confusion about nearly 1,500 ""lost"" immigrant children. In late April, a federal agency reported being unable to locate about 1,500 children who came to the United States alone. Around the same time, the Trump administration announced a ""zero-tolerance"" policy to ramp up prosecutions of individuals who cross the border illegally. Trump’s tweet is accurate. One of the Democrats who shared the photo was Jon Favreau, a former Obama speechwriter. Favreau, who has one million followers on Twitter, tweeted on May 27: ""Look at these pictures. This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible."" Favreau included a link to a Arizona Republic story showing a photo of two detainees lying on mats on the ground in a holding cell with the headline ""First Glimpse of Immigrant Children at holding facility."" While Favreau has since deleted the tweet, Twitchy and Fox News showed screen grabs. The photo was taken by Ross D. Franklin of the Associated Press in June 2014 at a Customs and Border Protection Agency center in Nogales, Arizona. The photo was used in an Arizona Republic article which described the migrants as ""children in cages."" The newspaper verified the timing of the photo in a tweet. Minutes after Favreau’s tweet about the photo, at 3:27 p.m. Favreau followed up with a tweet that cited the actual date of the photo. ""These awful pictures are from 2014, when the government's challenge was reconnecting unaccompanied minors who showed up at the border with family or a safe sponsor. Today, in 2018, the government is CREATING unaccompanied minors by tearing them away from family at the border."" Favreau responded to our questions by pointing to his May 29 Twitter thread, including this tweet: ""I tweeted a story that multiple journalists were posting. My mistake for not checking the date first. A few minutes later, when I realized my error, I deleted the tweet and immediately tweeted the correct info and date of the picture."" In an email, Favreau told PolitiFact that a New York Times Magazine editor was one of the journalists who posted the photo. Jake Silverstein, the magazine’s editor in chief, tweeted on May 27 ""My bad for RT’ing without closer inspection and implying by timing that it’s current."" Trump’s swipe at ""Democrats"" was broad but there were liberal activists who tweeted about the photo including Shaun King and Linda Sarsour. The Daily Caller and The Daily Mail linked to tweets by other activists and journalists. Trump tweeted ""Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages."" Several Democrats did tweet a photo of a facility where child migrants are detained. While they initially stated the image was something happening right now, the photo was actually from 2014.

Scott Dawson distorts Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey's grant funding to LGBTQ nonprofit
","Scott Dawson, an evangelical minister running for governor in Alabama, accused the incumbent of funnelling taxpayer dollars to a controversial cause. ""It's been uncovered that Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers’ money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism,"" Dawson’s campaign wrote in a press release. The organization in question is Free2Be, a non-profit that provides counseling services to LGBTQ victims of domestic violence and bullying in Alabama. The nonprofit has been the subject of heavy scrutiny in Alabama, but for financial reasons, not political ones. After the group’s founder, James Robinson, left the group in January, the board of directors determined that Free2Be did not have the financial stability to continue. The group shuttered its doors after a state agency found they had failed to pay payroll taxes to the IRS. Dawson’s campaign pointed us to a 2012 YouTube video as evidence Free2be is a ""liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism."" The video didn’t suggest the organization aimed to change anyone’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Neither do the group’s public statements. Instead, Robinson railed against messages of hate from teachers, parents and churches towards LGBTQ teens. So what taxpayer funding did the group receive until they landed in hot water? Dawson’s campaign overshot the target by a few hundred thousand dollars with their $1 million figure. The campaign calculated that Free2Be received $762,042.37 in federal grants since Ivey assumed office in April 2017, using data from Alabama’s Finance Department. But the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, which reviews grant applications and presents funding recommendations to the governor’s office for approval, announces grants on an annual basis. Ivey’s administration was responsible for approving $800,000 in grants for fiscal year 2018, which began in October 2017. Of that total, $727,410 came from the Victims of Crime Act, which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice, and $49,915 from the federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act. The grants refunded expenses incurred by the organization. Those payments stopped in late March, when Free2Be shut down, and added up to $422,680.37. In fiscal year 2018, the state awarded $23.5 million in Victims of Crime Act grants to 79 nonprofit or governmental agencies across Alabama, said Department of Economic and Community Affairs spokesman Josh Carples. Free2Be was one of those recipients. The law requires that 10 percent of Victims of Crime Act grant funding go to underserved victims of violent crime each year. The agency started to look for LGBTQ grant recipients in 2013, after a program specialist noticed the agency was not funding any providers that serviced that community. Because it qualified as underserved, the specialist suggested the agency begin LGBTQ outreach. The following year, Free2Be was the only Victims of Crime Act applicant serving the LGBTQ population, and the agency approved their grant request. Ivey’s campaign argued that the grants were not funded by taxpayer dollars, but by federal criminal fees. The Office for Victims of Crime’s website uses a similar distinction as Ivey in describing these grants: ""The Fund is financed by fines and penalties paid by convicted federal offenders, not from tax dollars."" But Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said there is a distinction between tax dollars and taxpayer dollars. ""User fees are, technically, not ‘tax dollars’ in that they are not the product of our tax system,"" Gardner said. ""But the broader claim that these are not ‘taxpayer dollars’ doesn't seem right. When we pay the $20 entrance fee to visit a national park, we're not paying a tax. But most people would say that $20 is ‘taxpayer dollars’ in that the government collected it from people, and will spend it on some public services."" Gardner likened a $20 park fee to the fines and penalties paid by federal offenders. Susan Pace Hamill, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, agreed. ""Criminal fines and forfeitures are not typical taxes, but resemble typical taxes because they represent dollars collected involuntarily and are used for some public purpose,"" Hamill said.  Dawson said, ""It's been uncovered that Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers’ money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism."" The organization in question is Free2Be, a victims resources nonprofit that serviced the LGBTQ community. Dawson distorted the organization’s purpose, which was to support LGBTQ victims of domestic violence and bullying in Alabama, not to change anyone’s gender identity or sexual orientation. The Ivey administration approved almost $800,000 in grants to Free2Be in order to meet a federal grant quota for underserved communities. But the group did not receive the full amount before it closed in March; it received a little more than half of that funding. The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A7400>],/factchecks/2018/may/29/scott-dawson/scott-dawson-alabama-governor-kay-ivey-lgbtq/

Tennessee GOP's slam on Democrat Phil Bredesen's jobs record overlooks Great Recession
","The U.S. Senate race in Tennessee is starting to heat up. Phil Bredesen, the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, lofted an ad touting his accomplishments as governor. The Tennessee Republican Party fired back that on jobs, Bredesen’s track record wasn’t so rosy. ""While Phil Bredesen was in the governor’s office, the number of Tennesseans on unemployment nearly doubled,"" the GOP posted on its website May 23. ""He is backtracking to change his weak record, but Tennesseans won’t be fooled by misleading ads."" The post included numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to back up the claim. When Bredesen became governor in January 2003, the state had about 149,000 unemployed people. When he left in January 2011, it had about 296,000. As the Republicans said, that’s about double. Before we get into the caveats, we should note that there’s a flaw in the Republican language. The post talked about ""the number of Tennesseans on unemployment."" That’s different from the number of unemployed people, because some might not have been eligible for unemployment benefits in the first place, and some might have seen their benefits run out. The state labor market reports track the number of new claims for unemployment each month, but not the total number of people getting benefits at a given point in time. As for the point about unemployment growth, the Republican post leaves out the enormous impact of the Great Recession. That wasn’t something under Bredesen’s control; it was a global economic collapse that struck every state and pretty much every nation worldwide. In the time Bredesen was in office, the national unemployment rate went from 5.8 percent to 9.1 percent. The rate in Tennessee went from 5.1 percent to 9.5 percent; worse than the national average, but the overall trend was the same. This chart shows shifts in the unemployment rate under Bredesen. The GOP post also overlooks that before the recession, Bredesen oversaw a net increase in jobs. The state had 2.76 million jobs when he took office, and four years later in 2007, it had 2.94 million, a gain of about 180,000 jobs. Even as the automobile sales were falling in 2008, on Bredesen’s watch, Volkswagen committed to building a new plant outside Chattanooga, Tenn., a move that ultimately created 2,000 new jobs. The Tennessee Republican Party challenged Bredesen’s track record on jobs, saying that the number of people on unemployment doubled during his time as governor. Government statistics show that the number of unemployed did rise by that amount. But the statement suffers from two flaws: It ignores the impact of the Great Recession which was beyond the control of Bredesen or any state leader. And it assumes that every unemployed person is getting unemployment benefits, which is not accurate. The numbers leave out important context. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097635400>],/factchecks/2018/may/29/tennessee-republican-party/tennessee-gop-slams-democrat-senate-race-jobs-over/
"['Taxes', 'Pennsylvania', 'Scott Wagner']","
Pennsylvanians would only pay for a fraction of Gov. Tom Wolf’s severance tax
","Republican gubernatorial nominee Scott Wagner says Pennsylvanians will bear the financial burden of Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan for a severance tax on natural gas production in the Commonwealth. In a May 21 email sent to supporters, the York County-based state senator wrote that Wolf’s plan to impose a tax on natural gas extracted, or ""severed,"" in Pennsylvania ""would be financed by Pennsylvania’s working class."" But would the severance tax — expected to raise $108 million in the first year — actually be financed by Pennsylvanians? A severance tax is paid by drillers who pass the production expense on to retailers of the commodity, in this case utility companies, who would then likely offset the added expense by charging higher rates to end-of-the-line consumers. The tax has a variable rate based on the price of natural gas and the volume produced by a given well. Terry Engender, a professor with Penn State’s Department of Geosciences, added, ""The reality is that any cost put on the industry will be passed on to consumers. That’s a fact of life."" In this case, it’s a question of where those consumers are located. And that’s not unusual. According to The Fiscal Times, ""Virtually all energy states benefit from passing their cost of government to consumers outside their borders. Texas avoids an income tax in large part by charging a 7.5 percent severance tax on natural gas and a 4.6 percent severance tax on crude oil. North Dakota now gets 40 percent of state revenues from severance taxes."" Beth Melena, Wolf campaign spokeswoman, said in an email, ""Pennsylvanians are currently paying to improve roads and schools in Oklahoma and Texas while getting nothing in return."" At a press conference earlier this year, Wolf argued that in-state consumers wouldn’t see their utility bills spike because of a severance tax. He pointed to an Independent Fiscal Office (IFO) report in making the claim that 80 percent of natural gas produced in Pennsylvania is used by customers in other states and that, as a result, ""80 percent of the revenue raised by a reasonable severance tax would be paid by customers outside of Pennsylvania."" We reached out to the IFO to see if this interpretation is accurate. Mark Ryan, deputy director for the nonpartisan state agency, said, generally speaking, it is. ""I don’t think we’ve explicitly said that, but that could be considered a fair interpretation,"" Ryan said. Ryan said that based on federal data, the IFO estimates Pennsylvania natural gas consumption is about 20 percent of total production in the Commonwealth. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said because of Marcellus Shale production here, Pennsylvania can meet its own demand. Pennsylvania is one of the largest natural gas-producing states in the country. ""The remaining 80 percent — one could assert it’s being exported, and that’s just a rough measure,"" he added. Those percentages, however, can and do change, shifting the amount of gas remaining in the commonwealth and that which is exported. Meanwhile, Wagner’s camp is doubling down on its claim. ""It’s clear Gov. Wolf doesn’t understand simple economics,"" said Wagner spokesman Andrew Romeo in an email. ""If Pennsylvania’s gas industry is taxed further, that tax will be passed on to consumers in Pennsylvania. The governor can try to spin it all he wants, but the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry and the Marcellus Shale Coalition both have disagreed with his assessment of what would happen to utility bills in Pennsylvania."" Wagner said Wolf’s severance tax ""would be financed by Pennsylvania’s working class."" And with Pennsylvanians consuming roughly 20 percent of the gas produced here, the severance tax likely will cause utility bills in Pennsylvania to grow. But according to the IFO, more of the expense would be absorbed by consumers in other states where Pennsylvania natural gas is shipped. Additionally, there are many factors that would impact the ratio — everything from market forces to commodity prices to the tax amount levied to the availability of pipeline infrastructure across Pennsylvania to move gas to other markets. Without that nuance, Wagner’s claim leads a reasonable reader to conclude that the entirety of the burden would be borne by residents of the Commonwealth. Given that, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4AB180>],/factchecks/2018/may/25/scott-wagner/pennsylvanians-would-only-pay-fraction-gov-tom-wol/

Florida spent ""over $100,000"" on noncitizen voter purge in 2012, says group
","At the start of a statewide election year, Democrats and the NAACP launched new attacks on the state’s plan for a new round of searching for noncitizens who registered to vote. House Democratic leader Mark Pafford of West Palm Beach and the NAACP held a press conference Jan. 13 to criticize Florida’s Republican administration for preparing to send a new batch of names of potential noncitizens to county election supervisors. Secretary of State Ken Detzner, an appointee of Gov. Rick Scott, is leading the project. In a press release, the left-leaning group Florida for All criticized the state’s spending on the effort in 2012: ""Rick Scott’s Administration spent over $100,000 of taxpayer money during their first voter purge attempt in 2012, producing lists with hundreds and hundreds of citizens that local Supervisors of Elections proved were legally registered voters. Over 80 percent of those on the purge lists were people of color and more than 6 in 10 were Hispanic. It was a costly embarrassment that Floridians fear will be repeated."" Florida for All is a political action committee that is at least in part funded by the Democratic Governors Association. The group’s main target appears to be Scott, who faces a re-election this year and could face his predecessor, former Gov. Charlie Crist who is now a Democrat. At PolitiFact Florida we have fact-checked multiple claims about the state’s 2012 effort to search for noncitizens who registered to vote. But we had never researched the total dollar figure attached to that effort: Did Florida spend ""over $100,000"" for that initiative? Origin of $100,000 claim related to SAVE data In 2012, the Division of Elections put together a list of about 180,000 potential noncitizens based on driver’s license data. The state later reduced that list to 2,600 -- and then again to about 200. As county election supervisors found multiple errors, later criticizing the effort as ""sloppy"" and ""embarrassing,"" the project was scrapped as presidential election day approached. In the end, about 85 registered voters were removed from the list. Detzner later apologized and vowed a better process this time using a federal data source called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE. SAVE was originally intended to verify eligibility for government programs and licensing, such as welfare, driver’s licenses, unemployment compensation and other benefits. We asked Neal Waltmire, a spokesman for Florida for All, to explain how it concluded that the state spent ""over $100,000"" in 2012. Waltmire directed us to a May 2012 story by NPR Miami correspondent Greg Allen. The story included this sentence: ""Chris Cate, a spokesman for Ken Detzner, the secretary of state, says his office is working to improve the process — spending about $100,000 to update its records."" The story did not explain what that cost included. Cate, who is now a spokesman for Florida’s CFO Jeff Atwater, told PolitiFact he didn’t recall placing a total dollar amount on the project. ""It’s regular staff time -- there wouldn’t be a way to quantify the value,"" Cate said. ""It is people who would be working anyway."" It costs the state 50 cents each time it checks a name in SAVE. So at the time of the NPR story, it was possible that the state would process 180,000 names -- so at 50 cents a hit that would equal $90,000, or close to that $100,000 figure. But ultimately the state scrapped the effort and never checked all those names using SAVE data. What the state actually spent So how much did the state end up spending on the 2012 project? We can’t put a total dollar value on that because it would be difficult to account for the time spent by state elections’ staff. However we were able to nail down some costs by interviewing Detzner’s spokeswoman Brittany Lesser: • The total litigation costs for Florida’s case against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in it’s quest to gain access to SAVE was $50,705 in August 2012. The state used outside counsel. • The Secretary of State must pay DHS $300 a year to access SAVE. ""There were no other upfront costs,"" Lesser said. * In 2012, the state spent about  $1,287.50 checking names using SAVE data. (It’s unclear how many names were checked, in part because some names checked more than once.) County election supervisors also had expenses though we didn’t attempt to quantify the amount. ""County expenses would basically be staff time which would not be broken out usually and any postage and notice publication costs for individuals notified,"" said Ronald Labasky, attorney for the statewide association of election supervisors. ""Since there weren’t very many before it stopped, it probably wasn’t very much."" Our ruling Florida for All said in a press release, ""Rick Scott’s Administration spent over $100,000 of taxpayer money during their first voter purge attempt in 2012."" The number comes from a May 2012 news story. The amount based on 50 cent charge per search for using SAVE and multiplied times 180,000 names on a list of potential noncitizens. But months later the state abandoned its effort long before it got to checking all of those names. We can’t fully account for the state’s costs; for example, we can’t account for the time that government employees worked on the project. But we do know the state spent a total of about $52,000, largely for litigation and to use SAVE data. The group wrongly used a source that was based on initial information about the state’s project and did not reflect the total cost months later, resulting in a total that was about double the best number we could nail down. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809696EA40>],/factchecks/2014/jan/23/florida-all/florida-spent-over-100000-noncitizen-voter-purge-2/

Joe Scarborough: Top 1% took 95% of gains since 2009
","As we’re sure you noticed, income inequality in America figures to be a central theme of 2014. Joe Scarborough, co-host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, called it ""the issue of our time"" this week and cited Gallup Poll numbers that say only 30 percent of Americans are satisfied with the distribution of wealth; and 67 percent are dissatisfied. ""Since 2009, what's the stat,"" Scarborough said. ""Do we have the stat since Barack Obama became president of the United States, 95 percent of economic gains have been made by the richest 1 percent?"" We decided to fact-check Scarborough's statement. (Far be it for us to duck the issue of our time.) Scarborough’s statement goes back to a study from University of California-Berkeley economist, Emmanuel Saez. In the years from 2009 to 2012, Saez found that the income flowing to families in the top 1 percent of  families went up by over 30 percent, while for the rest, income grew by less than half a percent.   ""Hence, the top 1 percent captured 95 percent of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery,"" Saez wrote. The main caveat with Saez’s work is that he used preliminary data for 2012 and didn’t include two significant kinds of income -- money from the government (Social Security, welfare, food stamps, etc) or  the value of health insurance benefits. Saez focused on employment wages, capital gains, dividends and interest. So Scarborough has his figures right by Saez’s figuring, but what you count as income makes a difference. We’ll now walk you through some other ways of looking at this question. Other interpretations, analysis We came across a study that measured income differently than Saez -- by measuring capital gains regardless of whether the owner cashed out and including government assistance programs. That study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found a wide income disparity as well, but noted that the gap actually narrowed between 1989 and 2007. There’s another argument that it makes more sense to calculate consumption rather than income. Economist Aparna Marthur with the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market oriented think tank in Washington, believes what people spend shows you how well people are actually living, and it doesn’t matter if they pay for it using credit cards, their weekly paycheck or their savings. Viewed this way, the situation is not as bad. ""We find that consumption inequality is much narrower than income inequality,"" Marthur said. ""And has shown no trend towards widening over the last few decades."" Marthur’s perspective is fuel for a policy debate that goes far beyond what we are writing about here, but there is one other criticism of Saez’s analysis. Eugene Steurele, a fellow at the Urban Institute, a D.C-based academic center, warned about using 2009, the very bottom of the recession, as the starting point. ""The economic cycle messes up this comparison,"" Steurele said. ""In recovering from a recession, if an unemployed person stays with the same unemployment benefits, and a wage earner doesn’t increase her wages, but the stock market recovers enough so there are more capital gains, then one might get these types of results."" Steurele said Saez’s findings are useful but his approach simplifies a complex situation. Work by the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy analysis arm of Congress, goes at least part way toward addressing Steurele’s concern. A 2011 report chose two points at the same place in the economic cycle, 1996 and 2006. It also factored in taxes and if its results are not exactly comparable to the Saez article, they point in the same direction. ""The poorest tax filers (the bottom fifth) saw average after-tax income fall by 6 percent between 1996 and 2006,"" the report said. While ""the richest 1 percent of tax filers experienced a 74 percent increase in after-tax income."" The main reason for the widening gap was the rapid growth in capital gains and dividends income among the wealthy, the Congressional Research Service concluded. Our ruling Scarborough said that under Obama, 95 percent of the economic gains have gone to the top 1 percent of earners. To be clear, we saw no evidence that Scarborough was blaming Obama, so we're only evaluating the numbers. Scarborough accurately reflected the findings of a much publicized report from Emmanuel Saez, a Berkeley economist. Other studies confirm the overall trend in that report, although the disparities in gains between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else are not always as large as Scarborough said and depend on how you define income. Scarborough’s statement is accurate but in need of clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809756D180>],/factchecks/2014/jan/22/joe-scarborough/scarborough-top-1-took-95-gains-under-obama/
"['National', 'Energy', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says U.S. generates 'more natural gas than anybody'
","During a recent radio address, President Barack Obama said the nation’s energy picture was robust. ""Thanks in part to our all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here at home than we buy from the rest of the world,"" Obama said on Jan. 18, 2014. ""We generate more renewable energy than ever, and more natural gas than anybody."" We’ve previously checked one of these claims. Earlier this month, we gave a True rating to Obama’s claim that ""for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world."" But we hadn’t fact-checked his claim that we generate ""more natural gas than anybody."" So we’ll check it here. We turned to two widely used sources for energy data. One is the Statistical Review of World Energy, published by petroleum giant BP. The other is the website of the Energy Information Administration, an office of the U.S. Department of Energy. According to BP’s data, United States natural gas production in 2012 was 619 million tons of oil equivalent, or 20.4 percent of the world. The only nation that came close to that was the Russian Federation, which produced 533 million tons of oil equivalent, or 17.6 percent of the world total. So by this measurement, Obama was correct. And the Energy Information Administration data concurs that the United States was No. 1 in the world. According to EIA -- which has figures as recent as 2011 -- the gross natural gas production by the United States was 28.5 trillion cubic feet, or 19.7 percent of the world total. The figure for Russia was 23.7 trillion cubic feet, or 16.4 percent of the world total. That said, there are still some issues to factor in. One is that there’s no guarantee that every country’s data is reliable, since not every nation has put the same effort into researching the question -- or, if they have, they may not be interested in sharing accurate information with economic rivals. While it would seem less likely that Russia would undercount its production than overcount it, it can’t be ruled out that, intentionally or unintentionally, the Russian figure for production is higher than these tables would suggest. The second issue is whether it’s justified for Obama to claim a share of the credit for the United States’ burst of natural gas production. It’s nothing new that the United States is at or near the top in natural gas production internationally. According to BP’s data, the United States and Russia have traded off the No. 1 and No. 2 spots in natural gas production ever since the data separated out the Russian Federation from the old Soviet Republics in 1985. Since 1985, the United States has outpaced the Russian Federation in 13 years: 1985, 1986, 1995, 1997 to 2002 and 2009 to 2012. During the same period, the Russian Federation outpaced the United States from 1987 to 1994, 1996 and 2003 to 2008. The United States’ lead over Russia has increased during Obama’s tenure. The United States produced 12 percent more natural gas than Russia in 2009, but 16 percent more than Russia in 2012. A big reason is the expansion of natural gas extracted from shale, using advanced technologies known as fracking. In some areas of the country, fracking has kicked off an economic boom, and measured by carbon emissions at the point of combustion, natural gas represents an improvement over oil or coal. But environmentalists argue that there are other downsides to fracking, from the risk of localized water contamination to higher carbon emissions when the entire drilling and transportation cycle is considered. We won’t referee this debate, but we will note that both advocates of drilling and environmentalists have criticized Obama, either for being too cautious about promoting natural gas development or being too eager to support it. When we looked at Obama’s campaign promise to expedite oil and gas drilling from domestic shale formations, we rated it a Compromise, noting that the numbers can be framed in ways that can either support or weaken the case that Obama has sped up the process of developing oil and natural gas resources. Obama did issue an executive order in 2012, titled, ""Supporting Safe and Responsible Development of Unconventional Domestic Natural Gas Resources"" that established an interagency working group to ""facilitate coordinated"" federal efforts on new types of natural gas extraction. ""While natural gas production is carried out by private firms, and states are the primary regulators of onshore oil and gas activities, the federal government has an important role to play by regulating oil and gas activities on public and Indian trust lands, encouraging greater use of natural gas in transportation, supporting research and development aimed at improving the safety of natural gas development and transportation activities, and setting sensible, cost-effective public health and environmental standards to implement federal law and augment state safeguards,"" the order said. Alan Krupnick, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank that tracks energy policy, said that the administration at the very least ""has not interfered with the shale gas revolution, which I'd say is something. In my view, the Environmental Protection Agency has not been heavy-handed on environmental concerns"" relating to natural gas. Still, as the administration acknowledged, the advances in shale-based natural gas extraction largely developed due to the private sector. And given the long-term pattern, it’s clear that natural gas production in the United States was already high before Obama took office. ""Obama's claim, implied or voiced, rings hollow,"" said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future. ""The shale gas fracking revolution, especially in its development phase, antedates Obama's presidency. And the bonanza it has created and the dramatic price declines it has spurred don't seem to me to be traceable to any of his administration's policies."" Our ruling Obama said, ""Thanks in part to our all-of-the-above strategy for American energy,"" the United States generates ""more natural gas than anybody."" The best available data suggests that he’s right about the United States being No. 1 in the world in natural gas production, though it’s more in dispute whether his administration deserves credit (or, in the eyes of some environmentalists, blame) for ""part"" of this development, as Obama put it. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097807440>],/factchecks/2014/jan/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-we-generate-more-natural-gas-any/
"['Corporations', 'Florida', 'Republican Party of Florida']","
GOP accuse Alex Sink of 'using predatory lending practices'
","The Republican Party of Florida wasted no time attacking former Florida CFO Alex Sink in her bid for Congress. The GOP started its campaign long before the Jan. 14 Republican primary, which clinched the nomination for David Jolly. A video posted Oct. 31, 2013, begins with Sink taking a break at a CNN/Tampa Bay Times debate in 2010, during which a makeup artist showed Sink an email message from one of the candidate’s advisers. The incident broke the debate’s rules against coaching, and became a sensational talking point about the Democrat cheating. After flashing a sentence accusing Sink of having ""failed the public’s trust by cheating during a debate,"" the video then declares it wasn’t her only failure, launching into several attacks, including the claim that Sink ""failed Florida investors by allowing for deceptive sales practices … and failed Florida homeowners by using predatory lending practices."" With the March 11 general election matchup set, we decided it was time to lend Sink’s past some of our attention. Sink’s banking background Before being elected Florida’s chief financial officer in 2006, Sink’s extensive banking career included 26 years working for Bank of America, formerly NationsBank. She was promoted to president of Florida operations in 1993 and oversaw tremendous growth. In 1997, NationsBank acquired Jacksonville-based Barnett Bank, then merged with California’s BankAmerica Corp. the following year. The new company took the Bank of America name. Sink retired as Florida president in 2000. The GOP said the ""deceptive sales practices"" that ""failed Florida investors"" was referring to a time between 1998 and 2002 when NationsBank and subsidiary NationsSecurities paid more than $13 million in fines to the federal government and the SEC. That led to a class-action lawsuit by investors; the bank in 2002 agreed to compensate their former customers with an $8.1 million settlement. Even though Rick Scott brought up the NationsSecurities fiasco during the same gubernatorial debate being referenced in the ad, Sink said the lawyer bringing the case declared she ""had nothing to do with the situation."" We found her statement Mostly True in 2010. The part of the ad we are checking, however, is about predatory lending. The video doesn’t give a time frame, and it would be understandable if your first thoughts went to the housing crash of 2008. But when we asked, the GOP told us their accusation actually goes back before that, to NationsBank’s August 1997 merger with Barnett, which was the largest commercial bank in the state at the time. The merger included Barnett subsidiary EquiCredit, which specialized in home loans for low-income borrowers at high interest rates, or subprime lending. EquiCredit was accused of predatory lending on multiple occasions, eventually leading to several lawsuits. The accusations gained steam after a May 2000 hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Financial Services. William J. Brennan, an Atlanta Legal Aid Society attorney, told the committee that EquiCredit and NationsBank’s own subsidiary, NationsCredit were ""the worst I have ever seen"" in terms of predatory lending. EquiCredit’s delinquency rate -- the share of mortgages either 90 days past due or in foreclosure -- was much higher than average, and targeted minorities, women and the elderly, he said. The company charged higher than average interest rates, which is common in subprime lending. The difference, Brennan alleged, is that EquiCredit willfully deceived vulnerable consumers into taking on loans they could not easily pay, with terms they could rarely understand. At the end of 1999, Bank of America held more than $22 billion in subprime loans, the most of any bank in the country. But Sink was in charge of Florida operations, not national lending for EquiCredit -- that company was run out of two offices in Dallas and Jacksonville, and it used independent brokers, not Bank of America employees. Sink has repeatedly said she did not work with the mortgage side of the business and ""never had any involvement with them."" Her team reiterated to PolitiFact Florida during the current campaign that she ""was not engaged in these disreputable practices."" EquiCredit operated as a national entity, with about 150 units across 43 states (22 of which were in Florida). Sink’s Bank of America Florida operations existed alongside the division, but EquiCredit took orders from the bank’s Charlotte, N.C., headquarters. Amid pressure from regulators, lawsuits and consumers, Bank of America closed NationsCredit and sold off EquiCredit by the end of 2001. Officially, both were shuttered because Bank of America no longer considered them profitable. By 2001, one of every 18 EquiCredit loans nationwide went bad, compared to one in 60 of Bank of America’s overall loans. These practices preceded the post-9/11 housing bubble that thrived on subprime lending -- in fact, one of the reasons cited for the closure was the poor economy that initially resulted from the 2001 terrorist attacks. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida accused Sink of having ""failed Florida homeowners by using predatory lending practices,"" citing the subprime lending practices of Bank of America’s NationsCredit and EquiCredit during her time as the bank’s Florida president. The EquiCredit problems were a nationwide issue, though, not just in the Sunshine State. And EquiCredit used brokers to sell their products, not Bank of America Florida employees. Sink would have had no control over that. The video also seems to imply Sink was somehow responsible for the precipitous loss in property values since 2008, but that timeline doesn’t match up, either. There doesn’t seem to be much of anything at all to tie Sink with EquiCredit, other than they both answered to Bank of America HQ in Charlotte. The Florida subsidiary of PolitiFact rates this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978C5480>],/factchecks/2014/jan/22/republican-party-florida/gop-accuse-alex-sink-using-predatory-lending-pract/

Steven King, director of R.I.’s Quonset Business Park, says private investment at Quonset is double public investment
","From before World War II until just after the Vietnam War, Quonset Point, in North Kingstown,  was a bustling U.S. Navy base, a massive complex of buildings and docks where aircraft and ships could be rebuilt and repaired and their crews trained. Since the Navy closed the base in 1974, the state and federal governments have been financing an array of improvements and cleanups to convert it to civilian, commercial use. That ongoing real estate redeployment is overseen by the Quonset Development Corporation, a quasi-public state agency. Steven J. King, the corporation’s managing director, was on WPRI’s ""Newsmakers"" show Jan. 5 touting the progress he said had been made at Quonset. During the interview, WPRI’s Tim White noted that the federal and Rhode Island state governments had spent more than $600 million on improvements to the property. White asked how King how he’d explain that generosity to taxpayers who might think ""that’s a lot of taxpayer money that went, essentially, to the private sector."" King balked at White’s description of the money the federal and state governments spent rehabilitating the site as a private industry handout. He said private businesses put their own money in, too. ""We’ve had the private sector more than double the investment that was made by the public sector on the property,"" he said. According to the Quonset Development Corporation, $666.4 million in federal and state government money has been spent since 1974 on the 3,207-acre park: $460.3 million from the federal government and $206.1 million from the state. Nearly half went to transportation improvements: $160 million for upgrading freight rail lines and $159 million to improve state Route 403 and its access to state Route 4. Hazardous waste cleanups, which are ongoing on some parcels, cost $100 million. So, if state and federal investment comes to $666.4 million, for King to be right the private sector would have to have contributed $1.3 billion. Do the locals measure up? Quonset Business Park’s 170-plus tenants cover a range of businesses from warehouses for Ocean State Job Lot and Sally Beauty Supply to high-technology manufacturers Toray Plastics and submarine builder Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics Corp. Quonset spokesman David Preston said the corporation doesn’t have precise figures on all private investment because some tenants chose to keep confidential how much they’ve spent on their facilities. But we checked with some of the bigger tenants. Electric Boat employs 2,767 people at its 140-acre plus complex, where workers build submarine sections, called ""supermodules,"" which are then shipped to either Groton, Conn., or Newport News, Va., to be welded together to form a new submarine. Since it opened its Quonset factory in 1974, EB spokesman Robert A. Hamilton said the company has spent about $900 million on its facilities. Last week, Jeffrey S. Geiger, the new president of General Dynamics/Electric Boat, announced the company plans to invest $150 million more there over the next four years. Toray Plastics America Inc. is the next biggest firm in the park, occupying about 70 acres and employing approximately 680 people. The firm makes extremely thin plastic films for use in manufacturing. In July 2010, Shigeru Osada, Toray America’s senior vice president for engineering and maintenance, appeared before the state Public Utilities Commission and said that as of that date, the company had invested $750 million in its facilities at Quonset. Toray vice president for human resources Lisa Ahart said last week that number was still valid. They aren’t alone. Besides high-technology firms like Toray and EB, the Quonset has attracted business like All American Foods Inc., which supplies meat, fish and produce to supermarkets throughout the region. All American vice president Steven Savastano said the company has had a warehouse operation there for about 15 years, and invested more than $6 million in the site. Add Toray’s $750 million to EB’s $900 million and you get $1.65 billion. Our ruling Steven King said private companies have invested twice what taxpayers have spent on developing Quonset Park. With federal and state government putting up $666.4 million, that would be at least $1.3 billion in private investment. Just the two largest tenants combined spent $300 million more than that.

Deal's speech jumps the gun on education spending increase
","Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal spent a portion of his State of the State address discussing what’s often a major issue in any election year. Education. Deal touted his accomplishments on the issue in his speech. One statistic he cited piqued our interest and that of one PolitiFact Georgia reader who asked us to do a fact check. ""Since spending on education has always been the largest part of our state budget, representing over half of all spending, it was to be expected that it would be reduced during these hard times,"" the governor said. ""However, during my administration, funding for education has increased by over $930 million."" Has funding for education increased by $930 million since Deal took office? Not exactly. Before Deal took office in January 2011, then-Gov. Sonny Perdue and the state Legislature approved a fiscal year budget that included about $7 billion for its public school students. Deal amended that year’s budget, increasing education spending to about $7.1 billion. Last spring, Deal signed a fiscal year budget for a 12-month period that ends June 30 that included about $7.4 billion for education. That’s about a $400 million difference since Deal took office. Not exactly $930 million, is it? We had a theory about how the governor came up with that number. Deal has proposed increasing education spending by $547 million. That’s the greatest single budgetary year increase in seven years, Deal said. Add those numbers and the total does equal more than $930 million. That’s how they came up with the number, Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said. Deal offered some specifics about his plans for the extra money. About $200 million of that would merely fund growth in student enrollment. An additional $315 million would go to shore up local budgets, and school districts can choose raises, smaller classes, more school days or other ways to spend the money. The governor wrote in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he wants to spend an additional $10 million to redevelop the state’s standardized tests for grades three to 12. He wrote that he wants to add nearly $50 million in state general and bond funding to support high-speed broadband access for all public schools. We still wondered whether it was accurate for the governor to say education spending had risen by $930 million if this budget hasn’t been adopted. Robinson said the sentence should had been phrased differently. ""There is still a legislative process,"" Robinson said. ""The sentence could use ‘once the budget is adopted.’ "" Deal has received little resistance from the Legislature over his past budget proposals. Deal is a Republican, and both chambers of the Legislature are led by the GOP. It’s likely the budget will be adopted, but it is still a proposal at this point. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, the Senate president, praised Deal's proposal to pump more money into education, ""rightfully our state's top priority,"" the AJC reported. The governor’s statement contains some elements of truth, but there is a good deal of context that must be considered here.

Does Washington County ""constantly"" have Oregon's lowest unemployment rate?
","Former Oregon Congresswoman Elizabeth Furse filed two weeks ago for the District 4 seat on the Washington County Board of Commissioners. In doing so, she became the first to take on first-term incumbent Commissioner Bob Terry. Oregon Public Broadcasting contacted Terry to get his reaction to Furse’s announcement. In a brief interview, the Fisher Farms nursery owner said the county already is heading in the right direction, noting that the reserve fund is healthy and that the county carries little to no debt. He added this: ""And we’ve constantly been the lowest unemployed county in the state.""  That’s impressive, if true. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We called Nick Beleiciks, a state employment economist, who walked us through a website containing the annual average unemployment rates by county. The data go back to 1990. Before that, only statewide figures were tracked, Beleiciks said. ""Washington County had the lowest (or tied for the lowest) annual average unemployment rate in 1990, 2000, and 2006,"" he wrote in a follow-up email. ""Washington County generally has the third or fourth lowest unemployment rate among Oregon’s counties. The county’s worst rank for unemployment rate was 9th lowest in 2009."" So the county registered the lowest average annual unemployment rate in Oregon only three times in the past 23 years. The most recent figures, from November 2013, show Benton County’s 5.7 percent rate as lowest in the state. Hood River is second at 5.7 percent, with Washington County third at 6 percent. We called Terry to get his response. ""There are two ways of interpreting that,"" he said. ""When I was asked that question, I was thinking of the four-county region (Washington, Multnomah, Clackamas and Clark counties). Among those, it has consistently been the lowest. If you look at the entire state, which is what I actually did say, the proper word would be one of the lower. I’ll be more careful about how I state that in the future."" He added, ""You need to look at the population bases of the counties we’re talking about. None of them is anywhere near as big as we are. We are a leading contributor to the coffers of the state of Oregon."" Washington County has long touted its economic vitality, with good reason. It’s home to some of the state’s biggest and most successful businesses, such as Nike, Intel, Tektronix and Columbia Sportswear. ""Washington County does, in fact, have a very important place in Oregon’s economy,"" said Tim Duy, senior director of the Oregon Economic Forum at the University of Oregon. ""Clearly, it has a large employment base with relatively high salaries."" Mark McMullen, Oregon state economist, told us that the county’s computer and electronic producers alone account for more than 20 percent of overall Gross State Product, and the majority of GSP growth in recent years. Sliced another way, the county over the past four years has been responsible for one-third of all statewide wage and job gains, McMullen said. Terry is correct in talking about Washington County’s large jobs base. Its 260,900 jobs as of November 2013 dwarf, say, Hood River County’s 11,030 jobs. But those figures, while impressive, don’t support Terry’s statement about Washington County ""constantly"" leading the state in low unemployment rates. Statewide, Washington County has ranked third behind Benton and Hood River counties since November 2012, according to state data. Even looking just at the four-county metro area, to which Terry said he should have limited his comments, Clackamas County has had a lower annual unemployment average than Washington County five times since 1990. Twice, in 1999 and 2002, the counties tied. Terry noted, in follow-up comments, that Washington County has had and continues to have a significant role in powering the state’s economy. Two state economists and a wealth of data support that idea. But his claim to OPB was that the county has ""constantly been the lowest unemployed county in the state."" The county has led or tied for the lead in that category only three times in the past 23 years, though it has often had the third- or fourth-lowest rate. By saying ""constantly,"" ""lowest"" and ""in the state,"" Terry left himself no wiggle room. The numbers don’t bear out his initial claim.

""We have sacrificed everything in order to enhance those corporate profits for people who are outside this state,"" Kincaid said on MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry. ""Let's understand that most of West Virginia is still owned, in excess of 90 percent, by out-of-state interests."" That number jumped out at us and when we got in touch with Kincaid, he was quick to say he had made a mistake. ""The number is lower,"" he said. But whatever the number, Kincaid said it wasn’t central to his point. ""The germane fact remains that 300,000 human beings are involuntarily participating in an unconscionable experiment on them, and that is a terrifying reality."" West Virginia has been rich in coal and timber and the trade-off of who benefits the most from mining and logging is a topic that has simmered for many decades in the state. A landmark 1974 study by a local investigative journalist found that absentee landlords owned or controlled two-thirds of the state’s private land. (That’s obviously well short of 90 percent.) In 2013, a follow-up report from the West Virginia Center for Budget and Policy, a group that focuses on the needs of the moderate and low-income people, and the American Friends Service Committee, found that the fraction of land concentrated in the hands of relatively few owners is much less today. The 10 largest landowners are all headquartered out of state and they hold title to about 12 percent of the state’s private acreage. Laying claim to what’s on the surface misses a big piece of West Virginia’s wealth picture. A huge sum of money lies in the mineral rights, mainly the coal and gas. Owning the land doesn’t necessarily mean you own what’s underneath it. But Ted Boettner, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, is reluctant to make hard and fast claims as to who owns that part of the state. ""All you can say is that a large fraction of the mineral rights are held by out-of-state interests, but beyond that, we just don’t have the data,"" Boettner said. Our ruling Kincaid said during the broadcast that more than 90 percent of West Virginia is owned by out-of-state interests. He told us he realized his mistake after the show and apologized for his error. Kincaid gets credit for his readiness to correct his original statement, but we fact-check what he said on air. His claim was wrong. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280977364C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/21/bob-kincaid/west-virginia-activist-says-outsiders-own-90-state/

Democratic Hispanic group says Carlos Lopez-Cantera ""staunchly supported"" an immigration enforcement bill
","Gov. Rick Scott named former House Republican leader and Miami-Dade property appraiser Carlos López-Cantera as his lieutenant governor and runningmate on Jan. 14, 2014. López-Cantera was born in Spain to Cuban parents and lives in a county with a large number of Hispanic voters. Democrats dove into López-Cantera’s past record on immigration and launched immediate attacks, including about a controversial 2011 proposal known as the Florida Immigration Enforcement Act (HB 7089). ""In 2011, Lopez-Cantera staunchly supported HB 7089, the anti-immigrant bill modeled after the racial profiling Arizona law, which Rick Scott embraced during his first governor's race,"" said the Miami-Dade chapter of the Democratic Hispanic caucus of Florida in a Jan. 16 press release. ""Lopez-Cantera called it a ‘common sense’ and ‘reasonable’ bill in a press release on March 10, 2011."" The Florida Democratic Party launched a similar attack. We wanted to know, did López-Cantera ""staunchly support"" House Bill 7089? López-Cantera’s comments about an Arizona-style law in 2010 During his Republican primary in 2010, Scott vowed to bring an Arizona-style law to Florida. ""Rick Scott backs Arizona’s law; he'll bring it to Florida and let our police check if the people they arrest are here legally. That’s common sense,"" his campaign said. Signed into law by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer in 2010, that law requires police who stop a person to verify their immigration status if they reasonably suspect the person of being in the country illegally. (The U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the law in 2012.) The law became a focal point of a hotly contested Republican primary between Scott and then Attorney General Bill McCollum as they battled for conservative voters. In May 2010, McCollum announced he would support an Arizona-style law. Though Scott strongly supported the measure as a candidate, he abandoned it once he became governor. PolitiFact Florida rated the campaign pledge a Promise Broken on our Scott-O-Meter, a database of his campaign promises. Back during the 2010 campaign, the Miami Herald interviewed Hispanic legislators, including López-Cantera, about McCollum’s support for the Arizona law. ""As far as I’m concerned, I don’t think Florida has a problem like Arizona does,"" López-Cantera said. ""I realize there’s a problem in Arizona. They have a serious problem, but I don't think you can compare it to Florida."" In August 2010, López-Cantera told the Tampa Bay Times: ""I am concerned that this could jeopardize civil liberties."" The topic of immigration reform remained a concern for López-Cantera after Scott won the primary, and it appeared the two had a conversation about it. ""I asked about the issue going forward, and he (Scott) said immigration is an issue, but the more pressing one is jobs and the economy,"" López-Cantera told the Miami Herald in September 2010. Immigration bills during 2011 session López-Cantera served as the state House majority leader and would have to deal with a range of Republican viewpoints on immigration reform: both hardliners who wanted a crackdown and some Hispanic lawmakers and constituents who viewed such a push as anti-Hispanic. During the 2011 session, legislators introduced the Florida Immigration Enforcement Act as HB 7089 and a similar bill in the Senate, SB 2040. The bills were not identical to Arizona’s law, but for immigrant advocates it raised fears that it would increase racial profiling. Some business-backed groups also raised concerns because there was a component that related to employers. The House bill would have required police to check the immigration status of a person subject of a criminal investigation if the police had ""reasonable suspicion"" the person was in the country illegally. Also, employers would be required to check workers’ immigration status. The Senate counterpart didn’t go as far and only let police police check the status of an inmate -- not a person only under investigation -- and it gave some wiggle room to employers. In March 2011, the House judiciary committee passed the bill 12-6. López-Cantera, Miami-Dade’s delegation chair, wasn’t a member of that committee. But in his press release after the vote he spoke positively about the law but didn’t specifically state how he would vote on it: ""Chairman Snyder and the Judiciary Committee recognize the unique and diverse history of our state and have worked hard to bring all stakeholders to the table to produce this piece of common sense, Florida immigration reform. This legislation is designed to preserve employment opportunities for Floridians through the use of the E-Verify system. ""The bill does not require law enforcement officers to ask individuals for immigration documentation during routine traffic stops. It does, however, give law enforcement officers the tools necessary to enforce the immigration laws of the United States."" ""I look forward to watching this reasonable and effective approach to immigration reform work its way through the legislative process."" Activists opposing the bills turned up the heat and particularly targeted López-Cantera and Sen. Anitere Flores, a sponsor of the Senate bill and another Hispanic Republican from Miami-Dade. In April, left-leaning and Hispanic groups announced they would launch Spanish-language radio ads calling out the two legislators. Groups also held a protest in front of López-Cantera’s office. While the attacks were going on, the Herald reported that López-Cantera was now against the House measure and planned to vote against it as well. ""Florida doesn’t need an immigration law,"" he said in April 2011. The Senate passed a version of the bill, but the full House never took a vote. The measure was dead by the end of the session. We asked for evidence from the Miami-Dade group that made the claim but didn’t hear back. However Joshua Karp, spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, said there was a period of time when López-Cantera supported the bill but later flip-flopped. We were unsuccessful at getting a direct response from López-Cantera. A spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida sent us a statement arguing that Florida’s proposed bill was different from the Arizona law and repeated this line from López-Cantera’s press release: ""The bill does not require law enforcement officers to ask individuals for immigration documentation during routine traffic stops."" Our ruling The Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Florida’s Miami-Dade chapter that stated López-Cantera ""staunchly supported"" a bill modeled after Arizona’s immigration law. López-Cantera never had to take a vote on the bill, so the only evidence we can evaluate is his statements about the bill. At first, López-Cantera said he looked forward to ""watching this reasonable and effective approach to immigration reform work its way through the legislative process."" That’s a positive statement, but hardly ""staunch"" support. But as protesters turned up the heat on López-Cantera, he became decidedly opposed, saying ""Florida doesn’t need an immigration law.""

Historically 'blue' Travis County surrounded by 'red' counties
","In a video endorsement of Andy Brown for Travis County judge, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett stressed the Austin lawyer’s past chairmanship of the county’s Democratic Party, adding: ""I know he shares our values. He will stand up to the Republicans. We are surrounded by red counties."" Six counties enwrap the capital’s county: Bastrop, Caldwell, Hays, Blanco, Burnet and Williamson. Unlike Democratic-blue Travis, are they all Republican-red? A standard way of gauging whether a state is red or blue, so to speak, is whether the Republican or Democratic nominee won the state in the latest presidential election. In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney carried each of Travis County’s contiguous counties, drawing 54 percent to 77 percent of the vote, according to election results posted online by the state. Republican U.S. Senate nominee Ted Cruz similarly prevailed across the board, drawing 51 percent to 73 percent of each county’s vote. That November, Democrat Barack Obama won 60 percent of Travis County’s vote; Democratic Senate nominee Paul Sadler got 59 percent. Next, we scrolled presidential election results for the surrounding counties from 1992 through 2008. We largely saw red: The Republican nominee won Blanco, Burnet and Williamson counties all five elections. The nominee carried Hays County in all but 1992 and Bastrop and Caldwell counties from 2000 on. Separately, we asked the state parties how they would gauge the red or blue qualities of counties. By email, the chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, Steve Munisteri, said the party draws on a proprietary index for each county, its Optimal Republican Voting Strength or ORVS, which he described as based on a mathematical formula originated years ago. Munisteri said the ORVS draws on particular election results to indicate the percentage of the vote a party nominee would likely get in a general election in the best of circumstances. Munisteri sent us a chart indicating the ORVS for each of the six counties: Bastrop (56.2 percent); Blanco (72.5 percent); Burnet (74.3 percent); Caldwell (55 percent); Hays (56.2 percent); and Williamson (62.2 percent). By phone, Munisteri said the fact that Democrats have been elected to offices in some of the counties means the congressman’s claim isn’t entirely so. Election results for 2012 show local Democrats winning countywide races in two of the Travis-bordering counties, sometimes after they didn’t draw a Republican opponent. In 2010, Democrats won countywide offices in Bastrop, Caldwell and Hays counties. Let’s paw the details. In Bastrop County, according to 2012 results, a Republican won for county judge and the Democrats did not have a sheriff nominee. On the flip side, there was no Republican choice for county tax assessor-collector; Democrat Linda Harmon won without opposition. Two years earlier, Republicans won two contested county races, though a Democrat beat a Republican for county clerk, the results indicate. In Hays County, Republican victors in 2012 for sheriff and county tax assessor-collector ran unopposed, according to results emailed to us by Joyce Cowan, a county elections official. In 2010, Democrat Sherri Tibbe ran unopposed for criminal district attorney as Republican Bert Cobb defeated Democrat Jeff Barton for county judge, according to results. By telephone, Jon Leonard of the Hays County Democratic Party agreed that the county is red, though he expects Democratic candidates for statewide office to fare well there in November 2014; Obama, he pointed out, lost the county in 2008 by two percentage points.    In Caldwell County, Democrats Daniel Law and Darla Law defeated Republicans to win 2012 races for sheriff and county tax assessor-collector, respectively, according to results emailed to us by a county official, Joy Morris Pardo. Two years before, victorious Democrats ran unopposed for the offices of criminal district attorney, county clerk, district clerk and county treasurer, though Republican Tom Bonn defeated Democrat Morris Alexander for county judge. In Burnet County, Democrats had no 2012 nominees for the several county offices, according to county-posted results. Two years earlier, several Republicans nominated for county offices (including county judge) lacked Democratic opponents. In the only red-blue 2010 showdown for county office, Republican Casie Wills handily defeated Democrat Cynthia Chisolm for district clerk. In Williamson County, according to county-posted results, Democrats had no 2012 nominee for sheriff as the losing Democratic nominee for district attorney garnered 40 percent against Republican Jana Duty. In 2010, Republicans cruised past Democrats for two contested county court-at-law judgeships. We did not obtain official records of Blanco County election results. But by telephone, Barbara Hudson, who chairs the county’s Democrats, told us that while the party seeks candidates to run countywide, for now, ""we don’t even have Democrats who run for local offices."" Our ruling Doggett said Travis County is ""surrounded by red counties."" That’s supported in each of the six counties by the outcome of presidential elections since 2000, though there has been some purpling in that Democrats won a few countywide offices in Bastrop, Caldwell and Hays counties in 2012 and 2010.

"['Georgia', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Nathan Deal']","
Deal says more working in Georgia since financial crisis
","Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal sounded as optimistic as Ronald Reagan in the early moments of his State of the State address. ""The state of our state is excellent and it is a great day in Georgia,"" the Republican said. Excellent is a strong word considering the economic doldrums that Georgia has faced since 2008, when the American financial system nearly collapsed. But things are getting better, particularly the job market, Deal said. ""(M)ore Georgians have jobs than at any other time since October 2008,"" the governor said in his prepared remarks. Is this correct, we wondered. The Georgia Department of Labor keeps the most detailed data on employment in the Peach State. In October 2008, when the national economy was at the height of its financial crisis, there were 4,076,000 people employed in Georgia, its numbers show. The following month, the number of Georgians employed dropped to 4,051,500, the data shows. The employment numbers gradually declined and fell to its lowest levels in February 2010, the records show. That month, an estimated 3,838,500 Georgians were employed. Employment in Georgia has steadily increased since then. Last February was the first month in more than four years with the state’s employment exceeding the 4 million mark. As of November, the most recent month available, the estimated total was 4,072,200. That’s an increase of about 21,200 jobs since November 2008. It is the highest number of Georgians employed since that time. Georgia’s overall population increased about 4.7 percent during the same time period. So what’s happening here? Deal, who was sworn in as governor in January 2011, has touted initiatives such as increasing the deal-closing fund and ending the sales tax for energy used in manufacturing as helping bring jobs to Georgia and improving the state’s economy. The increase in Georgia mirrors a national increase in employment. The number of Americans employed increased by about 1.7 million people between November 2008 and November 2013. Critics say that despite the increase and a significant decline in the national unemployment rate over the past four years, all is not well with the economy. They say the decline in the unemployment rate doesn’t reflect how many people have given up looking for work. PolitiFact Georgia was still curious whether Deal was cherry-picking the job numbers to make him look good for his re-election bid. We looked at the employment numbers in Georgia since Deal took office on a cold and snowy morning in January 2011. There was an increase of about 217,000 jobs between that time and November 2013, according to the state Labor Department figures. Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said the employment numbers cited in the governor’s speech were seasonally adjusted to take into account changes in weather, harvests, major holidays and school schedules. Robinson said the actual numbers for Georgia may be even higher. In December, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Georgia had gained 91,200 jobs over the prior 12 months. The top areas for new jobs were professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, education and health services, transportation and warehousing, and construction. Still, the AJC noted that the state has replaced only 65 percent of the jobs that were lost when the recession began. Economists believe the job market will continue to improve in 2014, but some caution that the kinds of jobs available aren’t exactly offering the same kind of pay as baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who last week signed a contract to make $30 million a year. Some prominent economists have projected that only one in five jobs added in 2014 will pay more than $60,000 a year, the AJC reported. To sum up, Deal said in his State of the State address that more Georgians have jobs than they did at any time since October 2008. Data from the state’s Labor Department supports the governor’s argument. We rate Deal’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A46A080>],/factchecks/2014/jan/21/nathan-deal/deal-says-more-working-georgia-financial-crisis/
"['Wisconsin', 'Crime', 'Federal Budget', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Taxes', 'Welfare', 'Ron Johnson']","
On average, 20 to 25 cents of every $1 spent on four government assistance programs is lost to fraud, Sen. Ron Johnson says
","Once a month, the Waukesha County Republican Party hosts ""Pints and Politics,"" a Friday evening gathering at a suburban Milwaukee restaurant that is ""open to anyone conservative."" The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel covered the soiree on Jan. 10, 2014, when the special guest was U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. When a woman asked Johnson about the Internal Revenue Service enforcing provisions of the Affordable Care Act, he expressed doubt about how effective the IRS would be. Then Johnson made an allegation about government assistance programs that packed the punch of a beer and a shot. ""Do you realize the average rate of fraud,"" Johnson asked, ""whether it's in the Earned Income Tax Credit or Medicare or Medicaid, across the board, food stamps -- the average rate of fraud in those programs is 20 to 25 percent?"" Fraud is sobering stuff. It’s defined as ""the crime of using dishonest methods to take something valuable"" from someone or something; and as the intentional use of ""dishonest means to deprive another"" of money, property or a legal right. Are errors made in the programs Johnson cited -- people who aren’t eligible still getting benefits, or getting more than they should? Sure -- tens of billions of dollars worth per year. But in terms of fraud, there’s no evidence the rate in the four programs is anywhere near 20 or 25 percent. Johnson’s response When we asked for evidence to back Johnson’s claim, Johnson policy advisor Patrick McIlheran told us the senator meant error rates in the various programs, not actual fraud. ""The former is of interest to taxpayers, the latter is a matter for prosecutors,"" McIlheran said in an email. The next day, however, Johnson conceded he had erred -- even though he continued to use the term fraud. In a statement, Johnson said that when he made his claim, he was ""primarily referencing fraud"" in the Earned Income Tax Credit program. But, he added: ""I made too broad a generalization to other mandatory spending programs based on reports in the press and from colleagues that are not supported by other inspector general reports. I strive hard to convey accurate information that is fully supportable, and I was mistaken in making this overly broad generalization,"" the statement read. ""This inaccuracy, however, should not detract from the larger point I was trying to make: Fraud is a significant and serious problem."" Johnson cited a U.S. Government Accountability Office report which said that in 2011, federal agencies estimated that $115.3 billion in improper payments were attributable to 79 programs spread among 17 agencies. The error rate was 4.7 percent. So, the senator admits his claim is false; let’s see just what the numbers are. Before we review each of the four programs Johnson singled out, it’s important to note the difference between fraud and error rates. As Malcolm Sparrow, a specialist in corruption control at Harvard’s Kennedy School, told PolitiFact National, fraud and improper payments are far from identical. ""There is a serious problem with conflating these different types of overpayment,"" he said. We found that reviews done by federal agencies, as well as by independent offices such as inspectors general and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, do not cite rates of fraud. Rather, they document or estimate error rates -- how often benefits in various programs are overpaid or underpaid. Such improper payments can include instances of actual fraud, but by and large they cover errors, which can be made by government workers, service providers such as physicians, and by the benefit recipients themselves. Some of the errors could be intentional, such as a taxpayer claiming a credit he isn’t eligible for, but the nature of fraud makes it very difficult to quantify. In other instances, a caseworker might mistakenly arrange benefits for someone who isn’t eligible. Food stamps The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the food stamps program, said 3.8 percent of benefits were paid in error in 2011, according to a factcheck done by PolitiFact Texas in June 2013. The error rate covers both overpayments, including fraud, as well as underpayments. Caseworker mistakes, rather than fraud, were the primary cause. Six months later, we found, the USDA reported the error rate dropped to 3.42 percent in 2012, an all-time low. Medicare Another June 2013 factcheck, by PolitiFact National, found Medicare has an improper payment rate of 8 to 10 percent.   We found that the improper payments rate for Medicare, the government health insurance program for Americans age 65 and older, was 10.1 percent in 2013, up from 8.5 percent the previous year, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Fraud makes up a relatively small portion of the improper payments, according to the factcheck done by PolitiFact National. More common are improper payments that are the result, for example, of a doctor ordering too many tests, or providing a service but submitting the wrong payment code. As for fraud in Medicare, ""there are no reliable estimates"" on how often it occurs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in an October 2013 report. Medicaid The rate of error payments in Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor, is lower than it is for Medicare. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimated overpayments and underpayments for Medicaid totaled $21.9 billion in 2011, an error rate of 8.1 percent, according to a March 2013 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office A different GAO report said Health and Human Services estimated error payments of $19.2 billion, or 7.1 percent, in 2012. That report notes that improper payment estimates reported by federal agencies ""are not intended to be an estimate of fraud."" Note: A 2012 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association offered three estimates of fraud (not error rates) in the Medicare and Medicaid programs: a low of 3 percent, a medium of 6 percent and a high of 10 percent. Earned Income Tax Credit  The Earned Income Tax Credit gives a federal income tax credit to low- and moderate-wage workers. A taxpayer who gets the credit could owe less in income taxes or receive a larger tax refund. A February 2013 report from the U.S. Treasury’s inspector general said the IRS estimated that 21 to 25 percent of the payments it made in the program in 2012 -- between $11.6 billion and $13.6 billion-- were issued improperly. The IRS said faulty payments result from a variety of causes, including the complex nature of the law, the shifting EITC-eligible population and the nature of the credit. Eight months later, the inspector general said the estimated error rates were understated. And it bears repeating: these are error rates, not rates of fraud. Our rating Johnson said: ""The average rate of fraud"" in the Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps programs ""is 20 to 25 percent."" Improper payment rates are in the 20 to 25 percent range in the tax credit program -- but are 10 percent or less in the other three programs. So, even the average among the four programs would be far less than what Johnson claimed. More importantly, those are error rates; there are no figures on the rate of fraud, which is believed to be a small component of errors. Johnson’s remark to the group was grossly misleading.    For a claim that is false and ridiculous, we give Johnson a Pants on Fire.

"['Medicaid', 'State Budget', 'Virginia', 'William Howell']","
Speaker Howell says Virginia's Medicaid costs went up 1,600 percent over 30 years
","House Speaker William Howell says Virginia should rein in the ever-rising costs of Medicaid rather than expand the program to cover 400,000 additional low-income Virginians. Howell, R-Stafford, staunchly opposes Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s goal to broaden the state’s Medicaid program as part of Obamacare. The speaker, in a January 5 op-ed in the Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg, wrote that Medicaid is rife with waste and fraud and in dire need of reform. ""Medicaid has grown by 1,600 percent in the last 30 years,"" Howell wrote.   Howell was referring to the cost of Virginia’s Medicaid program -- an expense evenly split between the federal government and the state. We’ve heard the figure he cited before. Former Gov. Bob McDonnell used it repeatedly in explaining his reluctance to expand the program. Under Obamacare, the federal government would pay all the costs of the new enrollees’ health care until 2016, and eventually, 90 percent from 2020 and beyond. We wondered whether the 1,600 percent growth figure is correct. Matthew Moran, a Howell spokesman, pointed us to data from the House Appropriations Committee showing the total of state and federal funds budgeted for Virginia’s Medicaid program was $455 million in 1984 and projected at $8.1 billion this fiscal year. That’s a 1,683 percent increase.   We also sought Medicaid spending figures from the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services -- the agency that administers Medicaid, which now covers about 1 million Virginians. We got somewhat different numbers. Craig Markva, a DMAS spokesman, said his agency estimates Medicaid costs increased by about 1,400 percent over the thirty-year period. Why are the numbers different? Markva noted that DMAS was formed in 1985 -- one year after the starting date for Howell’s claim. Prior to that, he said some Medicaid expenses were pooled with costs of other health programs in the state budget. DMAS estimates the 1984 Medicaid price tag was $531 million -- some $76 million above the committee figure the Howell used. Either way, it’s a huge increase. Markva said policy makers started using the 1,600 percent figure a few years ago and, back then, it was undisputedly accurate. Between 1980 and 2010, he said, DMAS estimates Medicaid rose by 1,650 percent. What caused this tsunami? Inflation played a big part. The 30-year figures cited by Howell and the House Appropriations Committee fall to a 694 percent increase in Medicaid costs when adjusted for inflation. DMAS, in a report last June, said rising healthcare costs and greater use of services accounted for most of the increased costs in the state’s medicaid program between 1990 and 2012. Growing enrollments also pushed up costs, according to DMAS. There were 300,000 enrolled in the program in 1990 and that grew to 1 million in 2012. Enrollments have risen for a couple of reasons, Markva explained. ""Some of this was simply population growth,"" Markva said in an e-mail. Also contributing to the surge were federal laws that significantly expanded the population eligible for Medicaid, Markva said. The state contributed to the growth by transferring people with intellectual disabilities out of institutions and into the community homes where they require costly long-term care. Markva said the annual cost per Medicaid enrollee was $1,617 in 1980, and that rose to $6,453  in 2010. ""This is a 453 percent increase or about 6 percent per year,"" Markva said. ""Much of this increase is simply the same increase in health care cost that everyone experience over this time period. Some increase was also due to the creation and expansion of waiver programs, which bring into the program new members and new services, resulting in higher per person costs."" The rest of the nation has also seen large hikes in their Medicaid spending. Total Medicaid spending among all states rose from $33.1 billion in 1985 to $398.4 billion in  2012, according to a report from the National Association of State Budget Officers. That’s an 1,100 percent increase. Adjusted for inflation, it comes to a 332 percent rise. Our ruling Howell said the cost of Medicaid in Virginia ""has grown by 1,600 percent over the last 30 years."" We find no reason to quibble. The Speaker accurately cited budget figures kept by the House Appropriations Committee, a source that many around the Capitol -- including PolitiFact Virginia -- turn to for reliable data. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EB4E80>],/factchecks/2014/jan/20/william-howell/speaker-howell-says-virginias-medicaid-costs-are-1/

Putin: In some places in the United States 'homosexuality remains a felony'
","Americans should take a look at the superpower in the mirror before judging Russia for its anti-gay laws, says Russia President Vladimir Putin.

Stephanopoulos asked if gay and lesbian athletes who ""wear a rainbow pin"" or something like it to protest the law will be protected from prosecution. Legally speaking, Putin said, ""protesting a law does not amount to propaganda of sexuality or sexual abuse of children."" He added: ""I'd like to ask our colleagues, my colleagues and friends, that as they try to criticize us, they would do well to set their own house in order first,"" he said. ""I did say, after all, and this is public knowledge, that in some of the states in the U.S., homosexuality remains a felony."" Putin’s statement is misleading. Several states do, in fact, have anti-sodomy laws. Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma specifically ban sodomy for gay Americans, and Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina and Utah have criminal sodomy laws that apply to everyone (see this 2011 Mother Jones map). (Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli unsuccessfully tried to reinstate Virginia’s sodomy ban, which he said would have protected minors. Montana repealed its law banning gay sex in 2013.) Some, such as ""buggery"" in South Carolina, carry the weight of a felony, but most are misdemeanors. That part is nearly irrelevant. The key thing to know, as Stephanopoulos tried to point out, is these laws were ruled unconstitutional in the landmark Supreme Court case Lawrence vs. Texas. The case stemmed from the 1998 arrest of a gay Houston couple accused of having sex in violation of state law. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 the Texas law is an unconstitutional privacy invasion under the country’s equal protection clause and invalidated these laws. Even though prosecutions under the state’s sodomy law were rare, the court noted, the law did not serve a ""legitimate state interest."" The decision did not erase the laws from each state’s books -- it just knocked out their teeth. State legislatures would have to pass repeals to get them out of state statutes, and some conservative states have ignored bills that call for repealing them. The country’s sodomy laws that only applied to homosexuals are ""not ancient in origin"" and only started to appear in the late 1960s, said Dale Carpenter, a University of Minnesota constitutional law professor and author of the book Flagrant Conduct: The Story of Lawrence v. Texas: How a Bedroom Arrest Decriminalized Gay Americans. The country’s early sodomy laws drew from the teachings of the King James Version of the Bible and applied to heterosexuals and homosexuals, he said. The laws were more often used not as arrest-generators but as ""permission slips to discriminate against gays and lesbians"" in accommodations, child custody and adoption, jobs and education, Carpenter said. In practice, prosecutors usually invoked sodomy laws on top of other charges, such as rape or prostitution. Many states started to repeal their sodomy laws in the 1960s. The laws that remain exist despite being ""absolutely unenforceable,"" said Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director of Lambda Legal, the gay rights group that represented the couple arrested in Texas. ""That is not to say that it’s not stigmatizing and sometimes potentially misleading to have them on the books, and they should be erased from history,"" Gorenberg said. The decade-old Lawrence vs. Texas ruling has not stopped some local law enforcement officials from using the laws, including against a gay couple who kissed at a restaurant in Texas or a sheriff’s office arresting a dozen men for sodomy in Louisiana (the Texas couple was never cited and charges in the Louisiana cases were dropped). The penalty for violating Texas’ law is a Class C misdemeanor, on par with a speeding ticket if it could really be enforced, Carpenter said. Putin’s comment misrepresents the reality in the United States, where many states have legalized gay marriage or passed anti-discrimination laws that include sexual orientation, Carpenter said. ""It’s much bigger than just sodomy laws,"" he said. ""But if you want to focus on just that, it’s a whole lot more complicated than saying the states have felony laws. That just hardly scratches the surface."" Our ruling Deflecting criticism of his country’s anti-gay propaganda law, Putin said, ""In some of the states in the U.S., homosexuality remains a felony."" Several states still have sodomy laws on the books, and a few specifically prohibit gay sodomy. But the laws are unenforceable and have been for a decade after a Supreme Court ruling. That makes Putin’s statement that ""homosexuality remains a felony"" inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097720FC0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/19/vladimir-putin/putin-some-places-united-states-homosexuality-rema/

Putin: All people in Russia are 'equal,' in 70 other countries it's a crime to be gay
","Russia has become a lightning rod for controversy heading into the upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi, and it has nothing to do with figure skating judges. The former communist nation faces threats of terrorism and criticism from the United States for harboring fugitive National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. And then there is Russia’s crackdown on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, which has become decidedly more aggressive in the last 12 months. But on Jan. 19, 2014, just weeks before the games begin, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to quell fears that gay athletes, delegates or fans will be discriminated against. ""In Russia, as opposed to one third of the world's countries, there is no criminal liability for homosexuality,"" Putin said during a lengthy interview with several media outlets, parts of which aired on ABC’s This Week. ""Seventy countries of the world have criminal liability for homosexuality, and seven countries out of these 70 enforce death penalty for homosexuality."" Putin went on to note that the former Soviet Union ""had criminal liability for homosexuality, today's Russia doesn't have such criminal liability. In our country, all people are absolutely equal regardless of their religion, sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation."" We decided to check both Putin’s international figures as well as his assessment of Russia’s position toward the LGBT community. How the LGBT community is treated worldwide Putin’s claim that 70 countries have ""criminal liability for homosexuality,"" is backed up by at least one international report. In May 2013, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (known as the ILGA) released the eighth edition of its study titled, ""State-Sponsored Homophobia: A world survey of laws."" The report found 76 nation states where homosexuality is criminalized, representing about 40 percent of United Nations members. Nearly half of those countries, 36, are in Africa, where homosexuality is taboo and prosecuted with executions or prison sentences that can last up to 14 years in many countries. Conversely, 114 countries do not criminalize homosexual relationships. In 14 countries and some parts of Mexico and the United States, same-sex couples can marry. The updated figures would probably bump countries where same-sex relationships are illegal to 77. In December, India’s Supreme Court reversed a previous court decision to end an 153-old ban on homosexual intercourse first instituted by British colonial rule. There are also seven countries where homosexual acts can receive a death sentence: Mauritania, Sudan, Asia Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and 12 northern states in Nigeria and the southern parts of Somalia. In 11 countries, mostly former British and French colonies, the report notes homosexuality receives lengthy prison sentences longer than 14 years. How does Russia compare? Russia is not listed as one of the 76 countries where homosexuality is banned. In fact, according to the ILGA’s profile of Russia on its website, male-to-male and female-to-female relations are not legally discriminated against there. Gays and lesbians can also serve in the military in Russia. In 1993, Russia repealed a Soviet-era law persecuting gay couples. However, while homosexuality is not outright criminal in Russia, there are many elements of de facto criminalization. In June 2013, Putin signed a law banning promotion of ""non-traditional sexual relations"" toward minors, a prohibition on so-called ""homosexual propaganda."" The Russian law places stiff fines on individuals and companies that promote homosexualtiy in front of children, whether in public or through media or the Internet. Critics say the law essentially bans homosexuals from speaking out in public. The scope of the law is broad, and it's not clear how it will be enforced. With the Sochi Olympics just around the corner, many Western countries took exception to the law, including President Barack Obama, who said he had ""no patience for countries that try to treat gays and lesbians and transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them."" In what was seen as an act of defiance, Obama chose two openly gay athletes to represent the United States at the Olympics: tennis legend Billie Jean King and hockey player Caitlin Cahow. Former Olympic gold medal figure skater Brian Boitano, also tapped by Obama to head to Sochi, has since said he is gay. And just because the ILGA does not include Russia with the 76 countries that legally bar homosexuality, it doesn’t mean the organization is complimentary of the country’s recent direction. ""While criminalization is the most blatant form of state-sponsored homophobia,"" the 2013 report says, ""countries which decriminalized homosexuality in the recent past, such as Russia … are sadly seeking to re-legitimize discrimination based on sexual orientation both at the national level, by way of laws against LGBTI activism – preposterously defined as ‘homosexual propaganda’ – and at the international level, in the name of ‘tradition.’"" Same-sex relationships are not recognized by Russian law. Same-sex couples also cannot adopt and lesbians cannot undergo artificial insemination to have children. Employers are not banned from discriminating based on sexual orientation. Foreigners with HIV can be barred from entering the country and also can be expelled. Gay pride parades are also banned in the country and have been going back to 2005. However, some pride events did take place without collaboration with authorities, and often sparked violence and attacks on those participating. Our ruling Putin said 70 countries criminalize homosexuality and Russia isn’t one of them. His estimate is pretty close to the 76 highlighted by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association and its true the organization did not include Russia in that number. But Putin also was far too rosy in his depiction of how the country treats gays and lesbians when he said ""all people are absolutely equal regardless of their religion, sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation."" Recent actions by Putin and the ruling United Russia party have further restricted the rights of gays and lesbians to peacefully demonstrate.

Chris Christie claims state's jobless rate is lowest in 5 years
","New Jersey’s jobs picture is improving so much that the state’s steadily declining unemployment rate is the lowest its been since before Gov. Chris Christie took office. That’s one of several jobs claims the Republican governor made Tuesday during his State of the State address in Trenton. ""Today, our unemployment rate is 7.8 percent. That is the lowest in five years,"" the governor said before touting gains in private-sector job growth that the Truth-O-Meter has previously rated as True and Mostly True. Although New Jersey’s unemployment stagnated in the mid-to-high 9-percent range for the better part of Christie’s first term, the governor’s claim is not entirely accurate. First, we’ll look at the state’s unemployment rate by reviewing data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the state’s Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Both agencies note that New Jersey’s unemployment rate as of November – the most recent month for which data is available – was 7.8 percent. So Christie’s figure is correct. To put that rate in context, it’s the highest in a region that also includes New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Delaware. Eight other states, however, had an even higher unemployment rate in November than New Jersey. Still, New Jersey’s unemployment rate has been declining steadily since for the past year. The rate, which had been stuck in the 9 percent range from June 2009 through March 2013,  finally dipped below 8 percent in November. Getting back to Christie’s claim, we went back exactly five years from the November 2013 unemployment rate to review data from November 2008, onward, to fit his cited timeframe. We found that New Jersey’s unemployment rate was 6.5 percent in November 2008, 7 percent in December 2008, and 7.4 percent in January 2009 – lower than the current 7.8 percent. So Christie’s claim is off a bit – the state’s unemployment rate has been lower within the past five years than the current rate of 7.8 percent. But Christie’s claim is accurate beyond those three months. The state’s unemployment rate jumped to 7.9 percent in February 2009 and continued climbing until it topped out at 9.7 percent that December. The rate stayed that high until April 2010, when it began a slow downward trend. New Jersey’s unemployment rate finally dipped below 9 percent in April 2013 and below 8 percent in November. Christie spokesman Colin Reed said in an email that the administration expects to have a new unemployment data report this week. Our ruling Christie said during his State of the State address, ""Today, our unemployment rate is 7.8 percent. That is the lowest in five years."" Federal and state labor data confirm that New Jersey’s unemployment rate is 7.8 percent as of November 2013, the most recent month for which data is available. Although New Jersey’s unemployment rate has exceeded 9 percent for much of Christie’s tenure, the fact is that federal and state data both confirm that the unemployment rate was lower than 7.8 percent for the first three months of Christie’s five-year timeframe. We rate the governor’s claim Mostly True.

Cullen says Abele security detail equals those for governor, mayor -- and saved taxpayers money
","Sometimes it seems everything’s a fight at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. During last fall’s budget battle, even County Executive Chris Abele’s request for a personal security detail provided by a private firm or local law enforcement touched off a tussle. Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr.’s reaction was basically no way: ""I won't spend one penny of taxpayer money on Abele's self-importance exercise."" Supervisor Jason Haas said Abele was wealthy enough to pay for his own security. Others noted Scott Walker had no security when he had Abele’s job. Abele said he’d received threats. The County Board ultimately carved 75% from Abele’s plan for $400,000 worth of protection and assigned the duty to -- who else? -- Clarke’s office, then overrode an Abele veto to make it happen. After tempers cooled, County Supervisor David Cullen portrayed the outcome as a victory for Abele and the taxpayers. ""The County Executive also requested $400,000 for his personal security,"" Cullen wrote in his year-end 2013 newsletter to constituents. ""The Board allocated $100,000 from the Sheriff's budget for this purpose. This will provide the County Executive with the same level of security as the Governor and the Mayor of Milwaukee while saving taxpayers $300,000."" We can’t say what the appropriate level of spending is. But let’s check that last statement by the county supervisor. Did the move provide the same level of security, while saving money? How spending compares For the record, Abele believes the County Board-approved plan is inadequate. His spokesman, Brendan Conway, said Milwaukee Police officials privately estimated -- based on what it costs to protect Mayor Tom Barrett -- that it would cost $400,000 to protect Abele. MPD spokesman Mark Stanmeyer told us that the $400,000 figure (it’s $500,000 including overtime) includes police presence in the entire municipal complex, not just for protecting and driving Barrett to events. Officers are stationed at the Treasurer’s office, for instance. It’s clear, though, from what police tell us that a significant chunk of the $400,000 covers Barrett, and that multiple officers are part of the team that protects and escorts him. By contrast, the county plan is limited to $100,000 and county supervisors say they were told the funds would cover salary and benefits for the equivalent of one full-time deputy. In addition, Conway said Clarke so far is talking about an on-call system, not a body attached to the exec’s office. In addition, Abele would only be escorted when outside the Courthouse. That would be different than the City Hall setup, where police provide security for Barrett both while working in his office and outside City Hall at various functions. As for Walker, who was elected governor in 2010, it’s clear that his security costs greatly exceed $100,000. Factors include a large increase in threats he and his family reported receiving in the wake of his Act 10 collective bargaining law, and the fact that his two sons lived at home in suburban Milwaukee during the height of the protests over the law. The governor has maintained separate residences in Madison and Wauwatosa. The costs of the governor's security detail totaled $611,400 over the 10 months from Walker's election in November 2010 to the end of August 2011, the Journal Sentinel reported at the time. That also covers the lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch. That was more than twice as much as it cost to protect then-Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle over the comparable 10-month period from November 2009 to August 2010. We could not get updated figures. In 2013, a state transportation spokesperson told the Capital Times that the State Patrol unit responsible for providing security for the governor, lieutenant governor and visiting dignitaries has doubled its staffing from five to 10 since Walker took office. As is readily evident to the public, a State Trooper squad is a fixture in the driveway of the Walkers’ home in Wauwatosa. In light of these facts, we asked Cullen about his newsletter claim that Abele would get ""the same level of security"" as Barrett and Walker. He told us he ""may have chosen my words inartfully,"" explaining that he meant only that professional law enforcement would protect Abele just as it does Walker and Barrett. ""I wasn’t necessarily arguing it was the same level of man hours the governor or mayor gets,"" Cullen said. A day later, Cullen said it was possible the county and city security could be more comparable than at first blush. The comparison is not as straightforward as it seems, he said, because the county figure ($100,000) doesn’t include spending on the security checkpoints at the public entrances to the Courthouse. Those checkpoints, staffed primarily by security-trained county facilities employees and lately with help from sheriff’s deputies, give the Courthouse a security dimension lacking at City Hall. True, but it’s hard to get past the fact that Barrett gets close personal attention inside and outside City Hall, while Abele would only have escorts outside the Courthouse -- and possibly only on an on-call basis. In sum, we think Cullen’s claim would read to most people as comparable security presence for Abele and the other two officials, and it falls way short of that. Is it a savings? What about the $300,000 savings Cullen claimed from the County Board’s action? He bragged about it in his newsletter under the headline, ""County Board Adopts a no-tax increase Budget While Protecting Core Services."" While it’s true the board slashed Abele’s security request by that amount, the money was not used for tax relief. Instead, the money went for new spending: The County Board shifted the $300,000 through a budget amendment to beef up the county’s existing support of emergency homeless shelters. Finally, what will happen now that Abele and Clarke -- bitter personal and political rivals -- have to work out a security plan? Clarke told us he’s still angry that Abele eliminated the sheriff’s department’s dignitary protection unit in the 2012 election year, opening Clarke to criticism about not fully participating in security when President Obama visited the area. ""Now in his narcissistic way (Abele) feels his security should be funded without question as to cost,"" Clarke told us. Conway’s response: Clarke has made clear he has the authority to provide whatever function he wants. Clarke, who is certified in dignitary protection work, declined to discuss how the department would arrange protection for Abele, citing the need to keep such details secret for safety reasons. He called it a ""gross breach of security"" for Conway to discuss it with the media. Last fall, an Abele aide told county supervisors Abele would want to hand-pick the sheriff’s deputy assigned to him. We’ll have to stay tuned to see if he picks the sheriff for the job. Our rating Cullen said action by the Milwaukee County Board will ""provide the County Executive with the same level of security as the Governor and the Mayor of Milwaukee while saving taxpayers $300,000."" There are major problems with the claim, which Cullen acknowledges was poorly phrased. Cullen emphasized how much the County Board’s action would save taxpayers, but there is no real savings. It actually costs taxpayers more money. Abele’s personal security would fall far short of the governor’s and also appears to be less intense than that accorded to Mayor Tom Barrett. Cullen now says he meant only that Abele would have law enforcement security as do those two officials. But his newsletter said ""same level."" For these reasons, we rate his statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979D8880>],/factchecks/2014/jan/19/david-cullen/cullen-says-abele-security-detail-equals-those-gov/
