Greenfield attacks on Ernst ACA lawsuit position reflect past statements
","The Affordable Care Act has become a flashpoint in this year’s battle for the U.S. Senate seat from Iowa. Democratic candidate Theresa Greenfield has honed in on Republican Sen. Joni Ernst’s past votes to repeal and replace the ACA, while Ernst has been adamant that she supports people with preexisting conditions.  In an Oct. 22 tweet, Greenfield again criticized Ernst’s record on health care.  ""She’s voted repeatedly to repeal the ACA, and now she supports the lawsuit that’s headed to the Supreme Court that will do just that,"" Greenfield tweeted. Greenfield and Democrats have been critical of the lawsuit, and Greenfield has called on Ernst to publicly oppose it. A look at congressional records shows Ernst has cast multiple votes to repeal the ACA, and similar claims have been vetted by other fact-checkers. But here, we’re focusing on Greenfield’s second claim — that Ernst supports the lawsuit coming up in the Supreme Court that could invalidate the Affordable Care Act.  The lawsuit Greenfield references challenges the ACA’s constitutionality and is under appeal in the case California v. Texas.  A mandate that required most people to have some level of health insurance or face a penalty tax was zeroed out in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Twenty states, represented by Texas, are suing the federal government, arguing the mandate is not constitutional and the whole law should be struck down. Iowa is one of 20 states and the District of Columbia that are defending the ACA. Democratic Attorney General Tom Miller joined the defense on appeal in February 2019.  The Supreme Court is to hear oral arguments in the case soon after the election, on Nov. 10.  Ernst has not expressed a hard position on the lawsuit during this year’s campaign and has declined to say whether or not she supports or opposes it, saying the decision is up to the courts.  ""We’ll see what the decision is. But that’s in the court’s hands,"" Ernst told Politico in September. When we contacted the Greenfield campaign for evidence to back up its claim that Ernst supports the lawsuit, staffers said that Ernst’s history of opposing the ACA, her lack of a stance on the lawsuit, and her vote to cut the individual mandate are all signs that she supports the lawsuit.  ""There’s absolutely no doubt that Senator Ernst supports the ongoing anti-ACA lawsuit,"" campaign spokesperson Izzi Levy wrote in an email to Politifact. ""…In fact, Theresa even called on Senator Ernst to oppose this harmful lawsuit on the first day of the general election. But since then, Ernst has consistently refused to speak out or take any meaningful action to stop it."" Ernst has a history of antagonism against the ACA. She campaigned in 2014 on repealing the law. She voted for three measures to replace the ACA in 2017 and also voted to begin debate on a bill that would have eliminated the provision that prevents insurers from dropping coverage for people with preexisting conditions. Two years earlier, she voted to approve the fiscal 2016 federal budget that included provisions for adjustments tied to repealing the ACA. She has criticized the law throughout the 2020 campaign, saying it caused health care prices to go up. Ernst has been more careful in her recent criticism and votes related to the ACA. On Oct. 1, she voted with Democrats on a bid to block the U.S. Justice Department from supporting the lawsuit. She was one of six Republican senators who crossed the party line, all of them vulnerable from Democratic challengers in the fall election. Ernst said her vote showed her support for protecting people who have preexisting conditions.  The vote was called symbolic by both Politico and the Washington Post, and it was seen by political opponents and some political analysts as a decision from Republicans in competitive elections to avoid backlash.  While it signals opposition and prevents Ernst’s opponents from having another point to attack her on, it doesn’t show that Ernst opposes the lawsuit itself. The lawsuit would have continued whether or not it had backing from the Justice Department because the department is not part of the original lawsuit or ruling. When asked whether Ernst supports or opposes the lawsuit, campaign spokesperson Brendan Conley said she hasn’t taken a position on it. ""Joni has made clear that this is being taken up by the courts and that her focus is on taking Iowans’ fight to Congress to ensure we maintain protections for those with preexisting conditions,"" Conley wrote in an email to PolitiFact. Ernst also supported the law that ultimately led to the lawsuit. The 2017 Republican-led Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which eliminated the penalty from the individual mandate, set the ground for the constitutionality of the law to be challenged.  Ernst has continued to promote the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the campaign trail in 2020. Greenfield said that Ernst supports the lawsuit striking down the Affordable Care Act. But Ernst has failed to give a clear, publicly stated stance on the lawsuit. Greenfield’s claim is based on Ernst’s consistently critical assessment of the ACA and votes in favor of repealing the law. Ernst also voted to cut the individual mandate, which led to the law being challenged in court.  Even though Ernst hasn’t taken a position on the lawsuit itself, she’s expressed a repeated desire to roll back the ACA. We rate Greenfield’s claim Half True.","[('Email exchange with Brendan Conley, Ernst campaign spokesperson', 'https://www.thegazette.com/factchecker/fact-checker-ads-health-care-claims-against-joni-ernst-mostly-accurate-20190930'), ('Email exchange with Izzi Levy, Greenfield campaign spokesperson', 'No link'), ('The Gazette,\xa0Fact Checker: Ad’s health care claims against Joni Ernst mostly accurate, Sept. 30, 2019.', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/19-840.html'), ('U.S. Supreme Court docket,\xa0California, et al., Petitioners v.

Fact-checking Raphael Warnock's claim that Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler profited from COVID-19
","The Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat and first-time candidate running to unseat Georgia GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler, accused her of using her position to profit from the coronavirus outbreak. ""We have a United States senator, Kelly Loeffler, unelected by the people of Georgia who, when she heard about COVID-19 seemed much more focused on her own portfolio than the people she was sent there to represent,"" Warnock said on MSNBC. ""She profited from the pandemic."" Warnock was referring to ethics complaints about questionable stock trades by Loeffler and other senators after an early briefing about the coronavirus threat.  Financial disclosures and news reports show that on the day of the briefing and in the weeks afterward, Loeffler’s accounts engaged in various stock trades involving companies that would be affected by a disease outbreak, and some of those trades helped her make profits, or avert big losses. Loeffler has denied using nonpublic information to benefit financially, and a Senate Ethics Committee investigation found no evidence that Loeffler violated any laws or Senate rules.  Warnock is the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached. Warnock is among 21 candidates competing to fill the seat held by Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned in December with health problems. Loeffler, an Atlanta businesswoman, was appointed on an interim basis. If no candidate gets at least 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face each other in a runoff Jan. 5.  The race is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. It’s rated a tossup by the Cook Political Report. So is Georgia’s other Senate contest, which pits Republican incumbent David Perdue against Democrat Jon Ossoff. Loeffler’s stock trades during the period before the potential threat of the virus became widely known surfaced in news stories early in the pandemic, and crystallized with complaints made to the Senate Ethics Committee that targeted several other senators as well.  Here’s a timeline, based on the complaints and news reports: Jan. 24: Loeffler attended a private briefing for senators from administration officials about ""an emerging public health threat"" posed by the novel coronavirus, just three days after the first case in the United States had been confirmed.  Jan. 24 - Feb. 14: Loeffler and her husband made more than 20 stock sales amounting to between $1.275 million and $3.1 million. Loeffler also bought stock in two companies, including Citrix, which produces teleworking software.  Feb. 14: The stock market began a tumble that would take the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 36% over the next five weeks. (It recouped most of those losses over the next several months.) Feb. 26 - March 11: $18.7 million in shares of Intercontinental Exchange stock were sold on Loeffler’s behalf in three separate deals, among other trades from mid-February to mid-March, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported in April. Loeffler is a former executive with the company, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and her husband, Jeff Sprecher, is the CEO. March 13: President Donald Trump declared a national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak as shutdowns began across the country. March 20: Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, filed a complaint asking the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate Loeffler and another GOP senator, Richard Burr of North Carolina. Another government watchdog group, Common Cause, filed similar complaints against those two and two other senators, Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California and Republican James Inhofe of Oklahoma. The CREW complaint alleged that Loeffler violated insider trading laws and the STOCK Act, which bars members of Congress from using nonpublic information for private profit. June 16: The Senate Ethics Committee dismissed its investigation into Loeffler, saying it ""did not find evidence"" that she violated the law or Senate rules. It did not elaborate. The Department of Justice had also conducted a probe, but closed it in May with no action. Days after the Journal Constitution report, Loeffler announced that she and her husband would divest themselves of all individual stocks and move their money into mutual and exchange-traded funds. ""I have never used any confidential information I received while performing my Senate duties as a means of making a private profit, she said then. ""Nor has anyone in my family."" Loeffler campaign communications director Stephen Lawson told PolitiFact that Loeffler and her husband had no role in the transactions. ""She had no knowledge, no control, no communication, none of that"" with the ""third-party advisers"" who handled all of the transactions, he said. Lawson said Loeffler ultimately lost $1.3 million in the ""liquidation"" of her stocks. Asked for information to support Warnock’s attack, his campaign highlighted a number of Loeffler transactions, citing news reports and Senate disclosure reports made by Loeffler. The transactions involved shares of companies that were affected by changes brought on by the pandemic. Some examples: Loeffler and her husband bought stock in Citrix on Feb. 14 and sold it on April 7, creating a gain of $33,285. On Feb. 14, Loeffler sold between $250,001 and $500,000 worth of stock in Exxon Mobil from an account owned jointly with her husband, avoiding losses that would occur as the outbreak took hold. The stock then was trading at around $60 per share; by the end of March, it had tumbled to about $31.  Between Feb. 28 and March 10, Loeffler’s husband purchased $206,774 worth of stock in DuPont de Nemours, which produces protective suits used by health care workers. Warnock claimed Loeffler ""focused on her own portfolio"" after hearing about the COVID-19 threat and ""profited from the pandemic,"" suggesting that she used non-public information about the coronavirus outbreak to make beneficial stock trades. Loeffler denied using inside information, and Senate Ethics Committee and Justice Department investigations found she did not violate laws or Senate rules barring insider trading.  Her disclosures and other news reports show that on the day she received a private coronavirus briefing and in the weeks weeks afterward, there were stock trades made on her behalf involving companies that would be affected by the pandemic, and she benefited from those trades.  We rate the statement Half True.

Follow the Money: Rep. Wagner has received millions
","It’s all about following the money. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran an ad on the 2020 Priorities website calling out Missouri’s 2nd District Rep. Ann Wagner. Among other claims, it asserted: ""Wagner’s campaign has taken millions of dollars from special interests, more than almost anyone else in Congress."" Money plays an ever-growing role in politics, so it’s worth looking into.  According to DCCC spokesperson Courtney Rice, Wagner received more than $3 million from corporate political action committees throughout her political career, which started in the 2012 election cycle when she was elected. In that same vein, Wagner also received more than $2 million ""from the broader financial industry,"" according to Rice. We were directed to searches from MapLight and the Center for Responsive Politics, two non-partisan research groups that track campaign contributions, political donors and the influence of money on politics. According to MapLight, since 2011 Wagner received $3.1 million from ""corporate PACs,"" which MapLight defines as when a political action committee identifies its affiliation to a corporation in a ""statement of organization"" filed with the Federal Election Commission.  The Center for Responsive Politics, also known by its website name OpenSecrets.org, tracks all kinds of PACs, and showed higher numbers. According to the center, Wagner received more than $6.4 million from a variety of PACs, including corporate political action committees. Of that $6.4 million, more than $2.6 million came from PACs affiliated with the finance, insurance and real estate industries. In addition, she received:  $226,022 from registered lobbyists; $1.7 million from non-PAC sources in the finance, insurance or real estate industries; $547,291 from non-PAC law firms and lawyers. Wagner received $4.3 million from the financial/insurance/real estate sector, as coded by the Center for Responsive Politics from both individuals and political action committees. Out of the more than 1,500 U.S. representatives listed who have served between 1990 and 2020, Wagner ranked 82nd for most contributions received from this sector. This is behind other politicians from Missouri, including U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt and U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, who received more than $8 million and $5 million respectively during their terms in Congress. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer received the most money from the financial/insurance/real estate sector, over $28 million. In the 2020 election cycle, Wagner received $668,560 from corporate PACs, according to MapLight. She was No. 54 out of 435 members of the House when she received $56,471 from lobbyists this election cycle.  Fellow Republican congressmen from Missouri — Billy Long, Jason Smith and Luetkemeyer — received more from lobbyists than Wagner in this cycle. From the financial/insurance/real service sector, Wagner was No. 20 out of all House members in this cycle as she received $1,137,674. In an ad, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said, ""Wagner’s campaign has taken millions of dollars from special interests, more than almost anyone else in Congress."" We can break this claim down into two parts: Wagner’s campaign has received millions of dollars from special interests. That amount received is more than almost anyone else in Congress. It’s true that Wagner’s campaign has received millions of dollars from corporate political action committees, more than the majority of elected representatives and senators. MapLight and the Center for Responsive Politics both confirm this. However, a significant number of senators and representatives have received more than Wagner from special interest groups, both in this election cycle and over the course of their respective political careers. For these reasons, we rate this claim as Half True. ","[('2020 Priorities, Ann Wagner Ad, accessed October 23, 2020', 'https://2020priorities.com/mo02'), ('MapLight, MapLight FAQs, accessed October 28, 2020', 'No link'), ('Center for Responsive Politics, Ed Markey - Contributions by Industry, accessed September 28, 2020', 'https://maplight.org/data_guide/federal-contributions-search-guide/#common-questions'), ('Center for Responsive Politics, Ann Wagner - Contributions by Industry, accessed September 28, 2020', 'No link'), ('Center for Responsive Politics, 2020 Lobbying Spending, accessed September 28, 2020', 'https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/ed-markey/industries?cid=N00000270&cycle=CAREER'), ('Center for Responsive Politics, Lobbying - Top Contributors to Federal Candidates, Parties and Outside Groups, accessed September 28, 2020', 'No link'), ('Center for Responsive Politics, Contribution Sectors, accessed September 29, 2020', 'https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/ann-l-wagner/industries?cid=N00033106&cycle=CAREER'), ('Center for Responsive Politics, Money to Congress from the Finance/Insurance/Real Estate Sector - All Members of the House across All Cycles, accessed September 28, 2020', 'No link'), ('Map Light, Ann Wagner Contributions from Corporate PACs in 2019-2020, accessed September 29, 2020', 'https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/lobbying.php?cycle=2020&ind=k02'), ('Map Light, Ann Wagner Contributions from Corporate PACs 2011-2020, accessed September 28, 2020', 'No link'), ('Email, Courtney Rice, Midwest Regional Press Secretary for the DCCC, September 27, 2020.', 'https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/contrib.php?ind=k02&Bkdn=Source&cycle=2020')]",/factchecks/2020/oct/30/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/follow-money-rep-wagner-has-received-millions/

Does Gov. Parson actually oppose protections for preexisting conditions?
","With the Affordable Care Act under fire from Republicans, protections for pre-existing conditions have become a big issue in the 2020 election. Missouri State Auditor Nicole Galloway, who is running to replace Gov. Mike Parson in the Nov. 3 election, has repeatedly said Republicans have no plan to prevent health insurance companies from denying coverage or raising rates for people with pre-existing health conditions, such as cancer survivors or those with diabetes. She’s also leveled this attack against Parson specifically. In a Sept. 26 campaign ad, she said, ""Mike Parson opposes protections for pre-existing conditions."" We reached out to the Galloway campaign and were told that the core of their argument is based on Parson-appointed Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act through a lawsuit. A critical part of the Affordable Care Act includes protections for pre-existing conditions. Republicans, including Parson, have made no secret that they oppose the Affordable Care Act. But they say he doesn’t oppose protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions. The Parson campaign pointed us to a legislative proposal dated Dec. 10, 2019. Parson’s proposal called for legislation that ""prohibits health insurance plans from imposing a pre-existing condition exclusion."" After providing us with the proposal, the Parson campaign did not respond to follow-up questions. This proposal became Senate Bill 970, sponsored by state Sen. Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia. An identical counterpart was filed in the House. The bill has caveats, though. It only keeps these protections in place ""until such time as the General Assembly specifically provides otherwise"" and nowhere in the bill are the words ""pre-existing conditions."" Neither bill ever made it to the floor of either chamber. One legal scholar who specializes in public health law and has studied the Affordable Care Act extensively said that he doesn’t think any state law could replace the act’s protections. ""If you pass a state-level law saying you have to cover pre-existing conditions, it will nevertheless be the case, without the Affordable Care Act, that there will be no coverage for pre-existing conditions,"" said Sam Halabi, law professor at the University of Missouri. He said the issue is with people who can’t get health care from an employer and have to purchase individual policies. Before the Affordable Care Act, employer-provided policies generally didn’t exclude pre-existing conditions. But without the ACA, if health insurers were forced to cover pre-existing conditions in individual policies, they’d simply stop offering individual policies or raise rates to unreasonable levels. The proposed bill would prevent them from raising prices for people with pre-existing conditions, but it would not prevent them from raising prices on all individual policies across the board. ""I say that based on what insurers did before the Affordable Care Act,"" Halabi said. ""What happened pre-ACA was that insurers generally just wouldn’t offer individual policies in the state... or they would price them out of reach."" If the Affordable Care Act were struck down and the state law were in place, he believes this same thing would happen again. ""I think the best way to interpret this,"" Halabi said, ""is that by submitting this, both on the governor’s point and on Caleb Rowden’s, for them, they can plausibly say to voters, ‘oh, but we’ve offered something to put in place of the federal law,’ but what will happen is that if (the Affordable Care Act) gets struck down, insurers will no longer offer those policies in this state, so it won’t do anybody any good."" Nicole Galloway said, ""Mike Parson opposes protections for pre-existing conditions."" Parson has made it clear that he opposes the Affordable Care Act, which protects Americans with pre-existing conditions. At the same time, like other Republicans, he has said he supports the protections for pre-existing condition coverage. He backed a state law intended to protect pre-existing conditions if the Affordable Care Act were overturned. But that bill never made it out of committee, and a legal scholar says the legislation wouldn’t work — insurers would simply stop offering individual policies at affordable prices, leaving people without employer-provided insurance no way to get coverage. Parson may say that he likes the idea of protections for pre-existing conditions, but he has done nothing to put in place effective, clear legislation that will provide these protections. And by supporting a lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act, he has taken steps to overturn a federal law that already protects people with pre-existing conditions.  We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('KCUR 89.3, Galloway Takes On The Challenge Of Bringing A Missouri Governorship Back To Democrats, Oct. 15, 2020', 'https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2020-10-15/galloway-takes-on-the-challenge-of-bringing-a-missouri-governorship-back-to-democrats'), ('Nicole Galloway, ""Even Now"" Ad, Sept. 26, 2020', 'No link'), ('Email Exchange with Kevin Donohoe, Galloway Campaign Spokesperson, Oct. 8, 2020', 'https://nicolegalloway.com/news/galloway-missouri-releases-new-ad-sept26'), ('Interview with Kevin Donohoe, Galloway Campaign Spokesperson, Oct. 8, 2020', 'No link'), ('U.S. House of Representatives, The Affordable Care Act, May 1, 2010', 'http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf'), ('Email Exchange with Dallas Ernst, Parson Campaign Communications Director Oct. 16, 2020', 'No link'), ('Missouri Times, Parson establishes task force in effort to make health insurance market more ‘competitive,’ July 17, 2019', 'https://themissouritimes.com/parson-establishes-task-force-in-effort-to-make-health-insurance-market-more-competitive/'), ('Call Newspapers, Parson, Galloway spar on COVID, policing, health care in debate, Oct. 22, 2020', 'No link'), ('The Associated Press, Missouri governor denounces expanding government health care, Jan. 16, 2020', 'https://callnewspapers.com/parson-galloway-spar-on-covid-policing-health-care-in-debate/'), ('Office of Governor Mike Parson, Legislative Proposal – Health Insurance, Dec. 10, 2019', 'No link'), ('Missouri Senate, Senate Bill 970, Feb. 4, 2020', 'https://apnews.com/article/235916309b3091c93fcb001c82ce455b'), ('Email Exchange with Sam Halabi, University of Missouri School of Law Professor, Oct. 29, 2020', 'No link'), ('Interview with Sam Halabi, University of Missouri School of Law Professor, Oct. 29, 2020', 'https://mikeparson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20.10.08-Exhibit.pdf')]",/factchecks/2020/oct/30/nicole-galloway/does-gov-parson-actually-oppose-protections-preexi/

False post inflates number of rejected mail ballots in Miami-Dade
","Democrats and Republicans are scrutinizing voter turnout in Miami-Dade County, the county with the largest number of registered voters in Florida, for clues about which way the swing state will land in the presidential contest. A Facebook post misleads about the proportion of mail ballots rejected so far.

This Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The text in the post says ""early ballots"" but it appears to be a reference to mail-in ballots, as evidenced by the fact that it included a link to a Miami-Dade Democrats page about how voters can ""cure"" or fix their mail in ballot if a voter forgot to sign the envelope or their signature didn’t match. As of the morning Oct. 30, the county had received 449,645 vote by mail ballots, including 3,308 that were rejected, said Suzy Trutie, spokesperson for Miami-Dade Supervisor of Elections. That comes to slightly less than 1%. About 2,313 of those rejected ballots were missing a signature on the ballot envelope. The signature did not match on 569 ballots. Smaller numbers of ballots were rejected for other reasons including that some voters had moved out of the county. When mail ballots are rejected for missing a signature or a signature mismatch, the county contacts the voters to give them the opportunity to submit an affidavit to ""cure"" or fix their ballot. So far, about 2,016 of those ballots have been cured.  The 23% statistic could have come from a misinterpretation of an Oct. 16 op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times by University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith and Dartmouth College professor Michael C. Herron. ""Although Miami-Dade County accounts for only 7.2% of mail ballots cast by Florida voters, it accounts for nearly 23% of the state’s mail ballots received without signatures,"" they wrote. The purpose of that part of the op-ed was to point out the variability in ballots being received without signatures — as of earlier this month. The op-ed didn’t state that 23% of ballots in Miami-Dade had been rejected.  RELATED: Ask PolitiFact: Is it too late to mail in your ballot? A Facebook post said  ""Miami-Dade reporting 23% of early ballots being rejected for missing signatures.""  A spokesperson for the county elections office said that less than 1% of mail ballots have been rejected, including many that were missing signatures.

Donald Trump Jr. claims COVID-19 deaths at ‘almost nothing’ as U.S. reports 1,000 new deaths
","Donald Trump Jr. falsely claimed that the number of coronavirus deaths had plummeted to ""almost nothing,"" dismissing the impact of the pandemic on a day in which the U.S. reported a record-breaking number of new cases and roughly 1,000 more deaths. In an Oct. 29 interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, President Donald Trump’s eldest son said CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta and others worried about surging new cases and the impact of the president’s large-scale rallies were ""truly morons."" ""The reality is this: If you look, I put it up on my Instagram a couple days ago, because I went through the CDC data, because I kept hearing about new infections,"" Trump said, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""But I was like, ‘Well, why aren’t they talking about deaths?’ Oh, oh, because the number is almost nothing.""  Jr. claims Coronavirus death numbers are down to “almost nothing” pic.twitter.com/NGMDLYkdsD ""If you look at that, look at my Instagram, it’s gone to almost nothing,"" he added. Experts rejected Trump’s false claim about COVID-19 deaths. It came on the same day that the U.S. reported a record number of new cases and around 1,000 deaths due to the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University, the COVID Tracking Project and other sources.  ""There is no other way to slice these data — 1,000 deaths per day is most assuredly not ‘nothing,’"" said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. She called the claim ""particularly absurd"" and ""extraordinarily cruel"" to those who have recently lost loved ones to the virus. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The death rate has declined since the spring. Some explanations that have come up in our reporting include doctors understanding the disease better and masks becoming more common. But Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the recent daily death tallies can ""by no measure"" be considered ""almost nothing.""  The Trump administration’s coronavirus testing czar, Adm. Brett Giroir, said Oct. 28 that with the recent upticks in cases and hospitalizations, ""we are starting to see the increase in deaths.""  RELATED: No, fight against coronavirus isn't rounding the corner, as Donald Trump said As the calendar turns to November, the U.S. has had more than 229,000 COVID-19 deaths, the most in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University. That’s nearly 20% of the world’s total, in a country with about 4% of the global population. Data from Johns Hopkins University and the World Health Organization shows the U.S. has also reported more deaths on a per capita basis than a number of other similar countries.  One recent CDC study said the U.S. has seen ""excess deaths"" related to the coronavirus every week since March. The study said the U.S. has lost an estimated 299,028 more lives since Jan. 26, 2020, than would be expected. ""These are deaths that we wouldn’t normally expect,"" said Mary Jo Trepka, a professor and the chair of the epidemiology department at Florida International University.  Activists mark 200,000 COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. with American flags on the National Mall in Washington on Sept. 22, 2020. (AP) RELATED: COVID-19 by the numbers: A status report Trump’s Instagram post shows a chart that is labeled Oct. 26. The image says that data comes from the CDC, and it includes a link that directs to the agency’s provisional death count data. Alexis C. Madrigal, a reporter with the Atlantic who helped launch the COVID Tracking Project, noted on Twitter that Trump appeared to have made ""a common misinterpretation"" of what the provisional death counts are able to show. The provisional death counts lag by a few weeks, because they are based on death certificates that take time to report and process. The CDC says its provisional death counts ""may differ from other published sources."" The agency says the data is ""incomplete"" and ""will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods.""  For those reasons, experts told PolitiFact that the provisional counts shouldn’t be used to draw conclusions about the impact of the virus in the most recent weeks.  ""There’s such a delay in terms of the classification of deaths that of course it’s going to look like there’s hardly any deaths over the last couple of weeks,"" Trepka said.  ""You can’t say anything definitive about provisional data when we know there are likely to be revisions,"" Adalja added.  The more telling figures, Trepka said, are the excess death estimates over time. Scientists have warned that colder weather and state reopenings could bring a staggering death toll in the winter, as the continued coronavirus threat overlaps with the flu season. ""If things do not change, if they continue on the course we’re on, there’s going to be a whole lot of pain in this country with regard to additional cases and hospitalizations and deaths,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, in an Oct. 28 interview with CNBC. Trump said the number of coronavirus deaths is ""almost nothing."" Experts rejected the claim, which came on a day when the U.S. reported roughly 1,000 new coronavirus deaths. The country leads the world with over 229,000 total COVID-19 deaths.  With those numbers, it’s ridiculous to say deaths are down to ""almost nothing."" Trump pointed viewers to a post on his Instagram account that appeared to show provisional death counts from the CDC. But his post left out a key CDC disclaimer, which said that such provisional counts are incomplete due to lags in reporting death certificate results.

On protecting people with pre-existing conditions, Jacobs' claim needs context
","Republicans in races across the country, aware of polling data showing Americans care about keeping and affording their health insurance coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions, are talking about their efforts to keep these protections if the U.S. Supreme Court dismantles the Affordable Care Act.  Democrat Nate McMurray, running in the 27th Congressional District, said the incumbent, Rep. Chris Jacobs, supports using U.S. Justice Department funds for a lawsuit challenging the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Jacobs' voting record supports this. The existing law contains strong protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case on Nov. 10.  Jacobs, a Republican, countered McMurray’s claim.  ""I am for protecting pre-existing conditions,"" he said during a debate at St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute. ""Actually, in the first couple of months I actually co-sponsored legislation to do just that.""  Protecting people with pre-existing conditions is a priority of the nearly three-quarters of Americans, according to a July 2019 poll. So we wondered about Jacobs’ claim.  Jacobs co-sponsored the ""Pre-existing Conditions Protection Act of 2019,"" on Sept. 30, about two months following his swearing-in on July 21.  The bill, H.R. 692, was introduced on Jan. 18, 2019, by Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., but no other action has been taken on it. It has 83 co-sponsors, all Republicans. Jacobs’ spokesperson, Cam Savage, told us the bill contains key provisions that protect patients, including prohibiting insurers from excluding certain benefits based on pre-existing conditions, prohibiting charging people with pre-existing conditions higher premiums, and guaranteeing that people will be issued policies.  ""This bill is one step in the process to improve health care for all Americans should the ACA be struck down by the Supreme Court,"" Savage said.  In New York, there are protections for people with pre-existing conditions, regardless of whether the ACA is struck down by the high court. But without the federal law, states also face losing the federal subsidies that help pay for the coverage. New York state could face dire financial consequences, including the loss of $3.7 billion for the state and nearly $600 million for counties, according to a state report from 2017. In addition, the state estimated that 2.7 million New Yorkers would lose coverage. We reached out to KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of information about health policy.  The bill contains some of the protections contained in the ACA, but not all of them, said senior fellow Karen Pollitz.  Pollitz confirmed the bill forbids insurers from selling policies that lack certain coverage based on a customer’s pre-existing conditions. It also prevents insurers from turning patients down if they apply for coverage, known as guaranteed issue. The bill’s provision on whether groups of insured people could be charged more if someone in the group is sick contains the wrong language, Pollitz said, though she thinks that it was a mistake and not intentional.  Though the bill contains those provisions, Pollitz said people with pre-existing conditions could still face barriers to coverage based on how the insurance market behaved before the ACA. ""There is a history with all of this,"" Pollitz said. ""This isn’t theoretical.""  The bill does not require policies to contain certain benefit standards, she said. Some policies could omit coverage for major medical services, such as chemotherapy or maternity care.   Healthy people would purchase these cheaper plans, leaving sicker people to pay for costly plans that contain pools of mostly sick people.  The bill also doesn’t prohibit lifetime limits, so patients with costly medical conditions could reach the end of their insurance coverage while they still need it.  Other protections, such as prohibitions on discriminating based on gender, age, and out-of-pocket caps aren’t in this GOP House bill, she said. The subsidies, or funds that allow people to purchase plans for lower costs, are not in the bill either.  Based on all of this, those people with expensive health conditions probably couldn’t purchase insurance for an affordable premium on the individual market, she said.  The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, which focuses on policy effects on people with low incomes, came to the same conclusion in its analysis.  ""Eliminating the ACA’s financial assistance would put coverage out of reach for millions of low- and moderate-income consumers, including many with pre-existing conditions,"" wrote Sarah Lueck, a senior policy analyst. ""It also would create severe adverse selection in state insurance markets, since it would remove a major financial incentive for healthy people to enroll in plans that pool risk across people with and without serious health needs."" Jacobs said he co-sponsored legislation to protect people with pre-existing conditions.  He did co-sponsor a bill that protects people with pre-existing conditions in certain respects. But experts said that to truly ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can access coverage, more comprehensive action is needed. If the ACA is repealed or struck down and this legislation is put in its place, people with pre-existing conditions could find the coverage they need to be unaffordable, they said.  So while his statement is accurate, it needs clarification. We rate Jacobs’ claim Mostly True.","[('KFF, ""5 Charts About Public Opinion on the Affordable Care Act and the Supreme Court,"" Oct. 16, 2020.

Donald Trump's claim on GDP growth: Historic, yes. Surprise, no
","For months, President Donald Trump has been predicting huge economic growth in the third quarter of 2020, and on Oct. 29 it became official. Government numbers showed a 7.4% jump in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the quarter before. If that lasted for a year, it would add up to a growth rate of 33.1%. ""Nobody's ever seen a number like this,"" Trump told his supporters at a rally  in Tampa, Fla. ""This explosive economic growth is four times greater than what the experts expected."" Trump is half right. Going back to 1947, the earliest point in the government data, this rise from one quarter to the next tops them all. (You have to also consider how far it had dropped.) But as for surprising the experts, Trump is off target. Each month, the Wall Street Journal asks over 60 economic forecasters what they think the future holds. The average estimate has risen steadily. In September, it stood at 23.9% growth. By the October survey, it stood at 28.5%. The average of all the guesses was about five percentage points under the official figure. That’s a far cry from the 400 points that Trump said. There are other ways to crunch those estimates. The median forecast was 30%, which is a bit closer but still under the actual figure. The Trump campaign noted that estimates back as recently as July had growth in the neighborhood of 12% or lower. One particularly low forecast of 13.6% came from an economic model at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in October. Trump didn’t specify which experts he had in mind, but it would always be possible to point to the more pessimistic predictions. The increase of 33.1% is historic. (It’s so large, the expected revisions won’t change its ranking.) But the economic damage of the coronavirus has been severe. The record growth in the third quarter came after a record drop in the quarter before, and the economy is not back to where it once was. In terms of jobs, 9.6 million fewer people are employed than a year ago. The economy remains $70 billion smaller than it was two years ago. While it’s customary to convert GDP growth in one quarter to a yearly number,  University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers said that hinges on that growth continuing. ""There's no chance that will happen, so the annualized rate answers a question no one is asking,"" Wolfers tweeted Oct. 29. The Wall Street Journal survey of economists backs up Wolfer’s point. The average estimated growth is about 3.8% for the last quarter of 2020. Trump said no one has ever seen growth like the country saw in the third quarter, and it was four times higher than experts expected. Trump is literally correct that the jump in GDP is the highest as far back as the government numbers go. However, it came after a drop that was equally historic, and both were driven by a pandemic, the likes of which hasn’t been seen in a century. Trump erred on the expectations of forecasters. Experts were predicting high growth. The average in one large survey of economists came in about five percentage points low, but that’s a fraction of the error Trump stated. We rate this claim Half True.

"['Workers', 'Joe Biden']","
 Does Donald Trump think $15 an hour is ‘too much’ for essential workers?
","As part of the Scranton vs. Park Avenue contrast he’s trying to draw against President Donald Trump, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has sought to highlight the differences between his stance on raising the minimum wage and Trump’s. At an event in Dallas, Pa., on Oct. 24, Biden said that Trump ""thinks that $15 an hour minimum wage is too much for essential workers."" In reality, Trump’s position is a bit more complicated than that. The federal minimum wage has been fixed at $7.25 an hour since 2009. In all, 29 states (and a range of cities) have set a higher minimum wage, but in remainder of the country, the $7.25 federal floor prevails. Biden, for his part, has expressed clear support for raising the minimum wage to $15, saying on his campaign website that he would ""increase the federal minimum wage to $15."" Biden reiterated this position during the final presidential debate on Oct. 22 when moderator Kristen Welker of NBC News asked about it. ""Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You of course support a $15 federal minimum wage,"" Welker said at the debate. ""I do,"" Biden responded. During this exchange, Trump interjected, offering a position that wasn’t as clear-cut in favor of a wage hike as Biden’s was, but that also didn’t close the door on it. Trump expressed concern that the wage hike could result in employers laying off lower-wage employees. ""How are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages? What’s going to happen, and what’s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees,"" Trump said. Trump added his preference for state-by-state minimum wages. ""Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option."" (It’s worth noting that no change would be required for this to happen, since states can already set a minimum wage higher than the federal level.) That said, Trump added that he’d ""consider it to an extent … in a second administration. But not to a level that’s going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option."" One thing that’s clear is that the White House officially opposed a bill to enact $15 minimum wage in 2019.  That came when the House was considering H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act. All but six Democrats voted for the measure while only three Republicans voted for it. The bill would phase in a $15 minimum wage over a seven-year period. As the measure was being considered in the House, the White House weighed in, as White Houses often do on major pieces of legislation, in a document known as a Statement of Administration Policy. The administration wrote that a $15 an hour minimum wage would ""reverse"" recent economic progress ""and hurt workers. … The successful efforts to reduce taxes, eliminate regulations, and implement fairer trade deals are driving economic growth and increasing workers’ take-home pay far more effectively and efficiently than legislation like H.R. 582, which would eliminate jobs and reduce total wages for American workers."" The document concluded that ""if H.R. 582 were presented to the president in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it."" The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry to clarify the president’s current position. A final note: Some economic commentators, including some who ordinarily lean liberal, have previously told PolitiFact that Trump has a point on geographic variations. They suggest that while a $15 minimum wage may be justified in metropolitan areas with high costs of living, it would be disruptive to the economy in lower-cost areas, with up to half of workers getting a raise, potentially resulting in job losses and inflation. Biden’s statements have not directly addressed the question of whether it would support regional variations in a minimum wage bill, and his campaign did not clarify that point to PolitiFact. The bill that passed the House did not have a mechanism for regional variations. Biden said Trump ""thinks that $15 an hour minimum wage is too much for essential workers.""  Trump has expressed skepticism about a $15 minimum wage in the past, and his administration issued clear opposition to a $15 minimum wage bill that passed the House in 2019. However, in the debate held just a few days before Biden’s comment, Trump did say that he’d ""consider it to an extent … in a second administration.""

 No, this photo doesn’t show Joe and Hunter Biden with Burisma CEO
","During a recent ""60 Minutes"" interview, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden called allegations against his son Hunter ""a smear campaign."" But he didn’t go into detail about the claims, including that Hunter Biden purportedly introduced his dad to an adviser to the board of a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma Holdings.  Still, a Facebook post published after the interview said that ""on 60 Minutes, Joe said that he never met with Hunter and the Burisma CEO.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So we looked into it. First, during the ""60 Minutes"" interview, Joe Biden never mentioned Ukraine or Burisma, where Hunter Biden was a board director while Joe Biden was vice president.  Second, the photo doesn’t show Taras Burdeinyi, CEO of Burisma, or Mykola Zlochevsky, the company’s founder and owner. The man on the far left is Devon Archer, another American board member of Burisma who worked with Hunter Biden in a series of investment and consulting firms in 2008.  Standing next to him is Ralph Pasucci, founder of Netrex Capital Markets LLC, a New York investment banking firm. He is also a principal of Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, N.Y., where the Bidens spent a week in August 2014. In October 2019, Trump tweeted a claim that’s similar to what appears in the Facebook post.  ""Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter,"" Trump said at the time.  When we fact-checked Trump, we did not find where Biden ever claimed that he’d never spoken to Burisma. Rather, Biden said he’d never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings.  In either case, Biden didn’t mention Burisma during the ""60 Minutes"" interview, and the photo doesn’t show the Burisma CEO.  We rate this Facebook post False.

Biden called Trump supporters disrupting his rally ‘chumps’
","Recent Facebook posts claimed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was caught insulting President Donald Trump’s supporters, but they took his comments out of context.  ""Joe Biden calls Pennsylvania voters who don’t support him ‘chumps,’"" the posts said.  They were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Trump was outspent by his closest primary opponents
","After Donald Trump replaced campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, another aide, Michael Caputo, sent a tweet that read: ""Ding dong the witch is dead!"" Afterward, Caputo quickly resigned from the campaign. Since then, he’s been making the rounds on television. Caputo, who ran Republican Carl Paladino’s 2010 bid for governor in New York, appeared on Capital Tonight on Time Warner Cable News last week. During the segment, Trump’s finances came up. Trump had about $1.2 million on hand through the end of May. Hillary Clinton had $42.4 million. Caputo called Trump’s spending humble. ""Donald Trump is not known for wasting money,"" Caputo said. ""He spent the least amount of money of any of the competitive primary contenders that he beat so badly, and he doesn’t intend to start burning money in the middle of the street now."" Caputo says he was referring to spending by Republican rivals who left the race: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Ohio Gov. John Kasich also held out until late in the race. We wanted to know if Trump actually spent less during the primary than his closest competitors. Overall spending vs. spending during the campaign At first glance, the numbers show Trump spending more than his opponents. Filings with the Federal Elections Commission show Trump’s campaign spending has topped $63.3 million through May, which are the most recent filings. Only one GOP candidate spent more throughout the campaign: Ted Cruz spent $85.8 million. Among the candidates spending less than Trump: Rubio at $50.4 million, Carson at $62.4 million, Bush at $35.1 million, and Kasich at $18.8 million through the end of May. But if you break up that spending over a timeline of the primary, Caputo’s claim holds water. We looked at how much Trump spent compared to each candidate over the course of their respective campaigns. After Bush suspended his campaign at the end of February, his campaign reported spending $34.2 million. Through the same filing period, Trump’s spending was slightly less at $33.4 million. Carson dropped his bid just a few weeks later, in early March. His campaign spent $60.7 million through the end of February compared with Trump’s $33.4 million. Rubio dropped his bid in mid-March. Trump spent about $1 million more than Rubio by the end of the filing period that included March, but if you look at spending by both campaigns over individual days, Rubio’s campaign spent almost $4 million more than Trump before the Florida senator dropped his bid. Cruz suspended his campaign after losing to Trump in the Indiana primary on May 3. Campaign filings through the end of May show Cruz had spent $85.8 million to Trump’s $63.3 million. The one exception is Kasich, whose spending came in at just under $19 million through May - more than $40 million less than Trump. Caputo told PolitiFact New York he was not referring to the Ohio governor when he made the claim. Our ruling Caputo, a Trump supporter and former adviser, said, Trump ""spent the least amount of money of any of the competitive primary contenders that he beat so badly."" When Trump’s spending is looked at broadly over the course of the campaign, he appears to outspend the majority of his opponents through the end of May. But a review of his spending during the time rival candidates were still in the race shows a different result. All except Kasich spent more money than Trump before dropping out. It's also worth mentioning that Trump did not have any major funding from a superPAC, while some of his opponents did. The Right to Rise superPAC, for example, spent more than $80 million to elect Jeb Bush.

Did The Governator protect more land than any California governor in history?
"," Arnold Schwarzenegger’s achievements are many: Body builder. Movie star. Governator. Honorary Forest Ranger. Yes, he was named an Honorary Forest Ranger by the federal government. But was he California’s environmental champion, its greenest governor in history, in terms of protecting the state’s natural beauty through land conservation? That’s what a top official with the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, Bonnie Reiss, claimed in a recent opinion column. ""When he served as governor, Schwarzenegger preserved more land than any other gubernatorial administration in California’s history,"" Reiss, the institute’s global director, wrote in the Malibu Times on June 8, 2016. She continued: ""He established the Sierra Nevada Conservancy that oversees more than 25 million acres of land in Northern California, reached an agreement to preserve Hearst Ranch with its 13 miles of pristine coastline in Central California and brokered the Tejon Ranch Conservation Agreement that permanently preserved 90 percent of the 270,000-acre ranch in Southern California."" Schwarzenegger’s publicist made the same claim about protecting ""more land"" than any other California governor recently on Twitter.  Reiss, who served as a senior advisor to then Gov. Schwarzenegger, also highlighted the recent completion of the National Park Service’s Backbone Trail project near Malibu, to which Schwarzenegger donated 40 acres of his personal property. On the big screen, the Hollywood icon regularly saves the day. So we decided to fact-check whether he’s saved ""more land"" than any governor ""in California’s history."" Our research Environmentalists and state officials said they are not aware of records that track land conservation by a governor. Reiss told us she knows of no official rankings. To back up her claim about Schwarzenegger, she pointed to articles by Wikipedia and an environmental nonprofit that describe the Sierra Nevada Conservancy as the largest of its kind in California and the nation. It operates across a huge swath: 25 million acres stretching from the Oregon border to Kern County. But that’s the boundary inside which land can be protected. The total acreage conserved by the agency is much less -- about 58,000 acres over the past decade, according to a conservancy spokeswoman. That is still a large patchwork of protected land. But Reiss’ emphasis on the 25 million acre boundary muddies the water. ""It’s not like they created a new park,"" said Bill Magavern, who was director of Sierra Club California at the same time Schwarzenegger was governor. ""They established a new government entity."" Schwarzenegger did not originate plans for the conservancy -- he signed a bill into law in 2004 creating it. The state agency administers grants to local governments and trusts seeking to preserve land. Also in response to our questions, Reiss pointed to the conservation of Hearst Ranch along the Central Coast and Tejon Ranch north of Los Angeles, two mammoth conservation deals, both completed during Schwarzenegger’s tenure. Those protected 80,000 acres and 240,000 acres, respectively, according to websites for each. Environmentalists say Schwarzenegger deserves credit, not as the architect of the deals, but as a significant player in both. The Tejon Ranch Company describes its agreement as the largest private conservation deal in California history.  Then California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks in May 2008 at Tejon Ranch. State officials we spoke with, including researchers at the California State Library, said they are not aware of any other governor whose administration protected larger collections of land. Conservation money While it’s difficult to track governors by acreage protected, there’s another way to measure their green works: Money raised for land conservation. During the early and mid-2000s, California voters approved nearly $20 billion for conservation through six bond measures. This was ""a huge influx of money,"" dwarfing amounts raised in previous decades, said Bryan Cash, who serves as deputy assistant secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency under current Gov. Jerry Brown and also worked for the agency under Gov. Schwarzenegger. Four of the bond measures were approved under Gov. Gray Davis, but later implemented by Schwarzenegger. The voter-approved bond money led to the preservation of 1.5 million acres across California from 2000 to 2011, Cash said. ""The statement,"" about Schwarzenegger protecting more land than any California governor, ""is probably true,"" Cash added. Cash said money still flows to conservation under the Brown Administration, but significantly less than in the 2000s.  The USDA named Schwarzengger an 'Honorary Forest Ranger' in 2013. Our ruling Bonnie Reiss of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute said: ""When he served as governor, Schwarzenegger preserved more land than any other gubernatorial administration in California’s history."" State officials and environmentalists agree Schwarzenegger helped protect vast tracks of California’s hills, forests and coastline. No other governor, they said, compares in this category. They also said Schwarzenegger benefitted from conservation efforts initiated before he took office, including plans for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy and state bond measures that helped fund much of the land protected under his watch. Also, Reiss’ emphasis on Schwarzenegger’s establishment of the ""25 million acre"" Sierra Nevada Conservancy needs the clarification that only a small fraction of that acreage has been preserved over the last decade.

Was gun used by Orlando shooter a 'weapon of war'?
","In the aftermath of the shooting at an Orlando nightclub, Democratic politicians -- including U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin -- reignited the debate on gun control. Just a few days after the shooting at the nightclub that catered to the gay community, Baldwin, the first openly gay member of the Senate, appeared on the Wisconsin Public Television show Here and Now. ""Now several days after this mass shooting in Orlando, as a member of the LGBTQ community, how are you processing what happened?"" host Frederica Freyberg asked. ""Oh it’s just horrific,"" Baldwin said. ""It’s simply horrific. And you know I juxtapose the opportunity to kick off PrideFest in Milwaukee the Friday before the massacre and the celebration of how far we’ve come in the LGBT community to fight bullying, discrimination and violence turned on members of the LGBT community. ""And then to wake up Sunday morning to this devastating, devastating news -- the worst gun violence in modern U.S. history,"" she continued. ""And you know, to take in the fact that this was a U.S. citizen inspired by terrorists who legally purchased a weapon of war and turned it on the LGBT community."" We’ve heard others use the phrase ""weapon of war"" to describe the guns used by mass shooters. So, we thought we’d find out if Baldwin is right. Does the military use the same weaponry the Orlando shooter did? Civilian vs. military guns The Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, had two firearms the night he killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a Florida nightclub -- a rifle and a 9mm handgun. Both were purchased legally. The rifle was a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic. That is what Baldwin meant when she cited ""a weapon of war"" and what we are looking at in this factcheck. Baldwin’s claim was a very stark one. While guns of many varieties may be used in battle, we view the phrase ""a weapon of war"" in this context to mean a gun used by the military. As backup, Baldwin’s team sent us to a couple news articles and gun reviews. The first news article, dated June 16, 2016, was from the Associated Press and carried the headline, ""Rifle used in Orlando shooting was designed for military use."" Her staff also pointed us to videos from the rifle’s manufacturer and highlighted some portions of the videos, including a point when Kevin Brittingham, president of the company’s silencer division, says ""the Sig MCX was designed to meet the DOD (Department of Defense) requirement for a weapon that would be as compact as possible, that focused on signature reduction. (They) wanted something as quiet as possible and also wanted something that would engage targets out to 300 meters."" But it’s not that simple. The article and the video don’t address the differences between the guns issued to soldiers and those sold to civilians. The Sig Sauer MCX rifle Mateen carried is a civilian version of the MCX-MR, a gun designed for military use. The MCX-MR was designed to comply with a Department of Defense requirement for a weapon to be carried by special operations units with low visibility in terms of size and noise. A backgrounder on the gun from the Violence Prevention Center sent to us by Baldwin’s team said, ""there are no significant differences between them and military assault weapons."" But Leigh Neville, a military researcher and author of the book ""Guns of the Special Forces,"" said the two versions differ ""fundamentally."" The civilian MCX lacks three key design attributes that make the MCX-MR suitable for special operations use. 1.  The civilian version is semiautomatic, rather than fully automatic. A semiautomatic gun fires one round of ammunition for every press of the trigger whereas a fully automatic gun fires a burst of rounds with every trigger press. 2.  The civilian weapon does not feature a silencer, though one can be purchased and attached with separate approval. A special operations soldier would be issued a silencer with the rifle. 3. The civilian version does not have all the options for differing barrel lengths and shoulder stocks as the military version to make the guns lighter and easier to carry. The shorter barrel options, which decrease the speed at which the ammunition is propelled, would be illegal or restricted for civilians under federal laws. Weapons like the M16 and M4, the primary weapons used by United States military, do have these attributes. ""If it was a weapon of war, it would be a machine gun,"" said Steven Howard, a competitive shooter and gun expert. ""If a weapon of war is simply that it resembles a military firearm, then absolutely positively every weapon is a weapon of war."" So, the gun used by Mateen isn’t really a military weapon. But not everyone agrees the differences are significant, arguing the killing power of civilian and military guns is similar and that there are many physical similarities as well. ""Civilian semiautomatic assault weapons incorporate all of the anti-personnel features of design and function that make assault weapons so deadly,"" said Marty Langley, senior policy analyst with Violence Prevention Center. Langley and others note that the weapon Mateen used is also very different from guns typically used for, say, hunting. High-capacity ammunition magazines can be attached to guns like the MCX to hold extra rounds of ammunition. Additional grips like a forward grip or barrel shroud give shooters greater control for spray firing. In the end, guns like the one used by Mateen are more advanced than the typical civilian weapon but not quite military weapons. PolitiFact Florida rated a related claim from U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat, about the power of guns like the one Mateen used. Grayson said the gun Mateen had ""shoots off 700 rounds in a minute."" Grayson was referring to an AR-15, another civilian weapon modeled after military weapons, in this case the M16. The M16 has a cyclic rate of fire, a theoretical measure, of 700 to 900 rounds per minute, according to U.S. Army documents. The ""maximum effective rate of fire,"" the highest rate of fire that can still achieve target hits, is about 150-200 rounds per minute. But that’s much greater than what most mass shooters achieve with semiautomatic rifles. Gary Kleck, a Florida State University criminologist, said that based on his research on mass shootings, most shooters rarely fire more than 50 rounds per minute. Grayson’s claim was rated Mostly False, as the weapon would need to be converted from an semiautomatic into an automatic weapon to even come close to shooting 700 rounds a minute. Our rating Baldwin said the Orlando shooter used ""a weapon of war."" Baldwin backed up her statement by showing that the gun Mateen had was originally designed for military use. But he had a civilian version of that gun that lacks key attributes of a military-style weapon. However, it’s also significantly different from weapons typically used by civilians for hunting. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate the claim Half True. (Correction: This item was corrected to reflect that a shorter gun barrel reduces the velocity at which a bullet exits the barrel. It does not change the rating.) https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ddb98f12-62dc-4a3e-ae44-2d4509d6c220","[('Email exchange with Leigh Neville, military researcher and author of the book Guns of the Special Forces, June 2016.', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/06/14/the-gun-the-orlando-shooter-used-was-not-an-ar-15-that-doesnt-change-much/'), ('Email exchange with Russell Phillips, author, The Weapons and Equipment of the US Army, June 2016.', 'No link'), ('The Washington Post, The gun the Orlando shooter used was not an AR-15.

Hannity misleads about stand-down order, clothing change in Benghazi attack
","Was the United States’ military response to the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, hampered because the State Department couldn't decide what the troops should wear? That's one of the suggestions that Fox News host Sean Hannity offered in summarizing the Republican-written report on the crisis, released June 28 by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. ""During the attack, a stand-down order was given, and our troops were told to change their clothes four times, and we needed, you know, permission from the Libyans to actually save Americans, and that's what they were discussing"" in Washington, Hannity said on his program that evening. For this fact-check, we'll look at the alleged stand-down order and whether troops were told to change their clothes four times while the attack was under way. The short answers, based on the committee's report: The stand-down order was actually an order to wait while CIA officials tried to make sure its security team didn't get into a firefight with friendly militia. The order for troops to change clothes was unrelated and came hours after everyone had already been evacuated from Benghazi, not ""during the attack."" We'll go through this chronologically. All times are Libyan. Washington was six hours behind. The ‘stand-down’ order The attack on the mission compound began at 9:42 p.m. on Sept. 11, 2012, when seven American staff members were inside, along with five diplomatic security agents. In addition, the United States was using local militia to help provide protection, so there were three armed members of the February 17 Martyrs Brigade, who lived on the compound and helped provide security, and five unarmed members of the Blue Mountain Guard Force. According to the Benghazi committee report, a frantic call for help immediately went out to the CIA annex about a mile away. The annex security team, known as the GRS, started getting their gear together as annex officials made fruitless calls trying to contact the local groups, including the February 17 militia, they had been working with. Their goal: find out who was involved in the fight and whether they could get additional equipment. With the sounds of gunfire in the distance and occasional tracer bullets flying overhead, the security team was eager to get going. Yet the officer in charge — the chief of base — was telling them to wait because the calls to the militias were not being answered. He and his deputy, who are unnamed, said they didn't want the team mistakenly getting into a firefight with friendly militia forces. Although sending the security squad and all the heavy weaponry from the annex to the mission would leave the annex defenseless, according to the report, the top officials at the annex gave them the green light, according to the testimony. At 10:05 p.m., 23 minutes after the frantic call from the mission, the annex team was rolling. Kris Paronto, a former Army ranger, is one of the men who rushed to the compound from the CIA annex to help bring people back. ""Thirty minutes we were told to wait,"" he told Hannity June 28. ""Twice the word 'wait' was used. Once the words 'stand down' was used. But to me that's semantics."" Not exactly. The dictionary definition of a stand-down order means your force is no longer on alert or operational. The chief of the annex was adamant that he never told the security team to actually stand down — only to wait. While members of the security team reported hearing the phrase ""stand down,"" the narrative in the GOP report offers no evidence that, contrary to Hannity's claim, the team was told it wasn't going to be sent to help. Assistance from Tripoli It was around the time the annex security team was departing that U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and communications specialist Sean Smith apparently died from smoke inhalation from a diesel fire set by the attackers. They had been taking refuge in a safe room in the compound. Just after 11 p.m., President Barack Obama gave clear directions to do everything possible to save Americans, according to the report. At 11:23 p.m., with Stevens missing, State Department personnel were evacuated to the CIA annex. At 12:30 a.m., a six-man security team was dispatched to Benghazi from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. They had no official transportation and had to use a private plane. By 1 a.m. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had unequivocally ordered troops to deploy. At the time, another mob was gathering at the CIA annex where people had been evacuated. At 1:30 a.m., the six-member Tripoli team arrived at the Benghazi airport, but it took hours to arrange transportation to the annex. There was a delay because they wanted to get to Stevens, who was reportedly in a hospital. When they learned that he had been pronounced dead, they had to figure out which militia group at the airport could safely get them to the CIA annex. They arrived just in time to help repel an attack at 5:15 a.m., where mortar fire hitting the roof killed personal security specialists Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both former Navy SEALs. Coincidentally, it was Libyan forces who were former loyalists of Muammar Gaddafi, whose regime was toppled a year earlier, who got the Americans out of the compound to the Benghazi airport in 50 heavily-armed security vehicles, the report says. A CIA operative stumbled onto the group while trying to get help. The first flight of survivors to Tripoli left at 7:31 a.m., flown by the private aircraft used by the Tripoli embassy team. The second plane, provided by the Libyan Air Force, left for Tripoli at 9:54 a.m. The attacks were over. The clothing controversy hadn't begun to unfold. Three-hour delay over clothing? Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams (FAST) based in Rota, Spain, had been ordered to Benghazi and Tripoli. Those Marines turned out to be anything but fast. They had no way to get to Libya. The call for a C-130 transport came in the middle of the night to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. But none of the personnel were on alert, so it took hours to assemble that team. At the time the last of the evacuees had left Benghazi, the Marines were still waiting for transport. Two planes touched down around noon. They were loaded by 1 p.m. And then, according to the GOP report, they sat there. Neither the Republican report nor the minority report released by Democratic members on June 27 offers a solid explanation for the three-hour delay. The GOP report quotes the platoon commander, who is not named, as testifying that the Marines were told multiple times to change from camouflage to civilian attire and back again. In all, there were four changes. There was indecision because some officials didn't want it to appear that the arrival of the Marines constituted a United States invasion of Libya, which might have sparked violence, officials said. ""State was very, very concerned about what the footprint would look like in Tripoli. They didn’t want it to look like we were invading,"" according to testimony by Navy Vice Adm. Kurt Tidd, who was then director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But why that took three hours to resolve is a mystery. A transcript of the platoon commander's interview shows that he was getting his information from his company commander in the next plane. The committee did not interview the company commander. It's also not clear why the troops, who were carrying both sets of clothing, didn't just take off and change into the appropriate attire just before landing. We posed that question to the White House and Department of Defense, and didn't hear back. Finally, just to add to the confusion, the newest account differs in its details from a House Armed Services Committee report, again authored by Republicans, from February 2014. It said that General Martin Dempsey, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee that once the FAST team got under way, it landed at a ""forward-basing location"" so the Marines could change into civilian clothes."" The latest report makes no mention of a stop. The FAST team arrived in Tripoli at 8:56 p.m., 23 hours after the attack. Our ruling Hannity said, ""During the (Benghazi) attack, a stand-down order was given, and our troops were told to change their clothes four times."" Hannity is mashing up two different incidents. There was no order to give up on the rescue effort altogether; rather, security personnel held their position about a mile away for 23 minutes as they gathered equipment and attempted to make contact with personnel on the ground. Separately, several hours later and in Spain, Marines did get in and out of uniform over a period of three hours as officials debated how they should respond. The delay occurred after the surviving Americans and those who had been killed already had been evacuated to Tripoli. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8e1f49fc-15c1-4e74-8c4e-2b4471ba85c7","[('House Select Committee on Benghazi, ""Select Committee on Benghazi Releases Proposed Report,"" June 28, 2016 and ""Report of the Democratic Members,"" June 2016, and ""Interview of: Captain (Censored),"" Sept. 2, 2015', 'http://benghazi.house.gov/NewInfo'), ('Fox News, ""House Benghazi report slams administration response to attacks,"" and ""Benghazi hero says patriotism trumps politics,"" June 28, 2016', 'No link'), ('NBC News, ""House Republicans\' Report Sheds Light on Benghazi Attack,"" June 29, 2016', 'http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/28/house-benghazi-report-slams-administration-response-to-attacks.html'), ('Congressional Quarterly, ""State Department Holds Regular News Briefing,"" June 28, 2016', 'No link'), ('House Armed Services Committee, ""Majority Interim Report: Benghazi Investigation Update,"" February 2014', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/house-republicans-report-sheds-new-light-benghazi-attack-n600121'), ('Emails, Matt Wolking, majority spokesman, House Select Committee on Benghazi, June 30, 2016', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/jun/30/sean-hannity/hannity-misleads-claim-about-benghazi-stand-down-o/

Pants on Fire: Trump lawyer tweets meme accusing Clinton of murder
","Donald Trump’s lawyer accused Hillary Clinton of incompetence, treason, breaking public disclosure law and murder. A week after his client delivered a major speech knocking Hillary Clinton, Trump Organization executive vice president and special counsel Michael Cohen used his client’s preferred social media platform, Twitter, to paint ""Crooked Hillary"" as a disaster for national security.  Cohen told us he didn’t create the meme and pointed out it’s been widely shared on social media. But virality and retweets don’t make a claim accurate, and this meme distorts the facts. Each claim is either misleading or outrageously wrong. We'll explain why.  ‘$6 billion lost at the State Department’ This echoes reports from many conservative pundits and outlets (and some nonpartisan news sites) about a State Department Inspector General alert in March 2014. The alert warned that files for over $6 billion worth of contracts from 2008 to 2014 — spanning the entirety of Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 —  ""were incomplete or could not be located at all."" A spokesman for the Office of the Inspector General told PolitiFact the alert speaks for itself, but many seemed to misinterpret what it actually said. The confusion prompted Inspector General Steve Linick to pen a clarification in the Washington Post. ""Some have concluded based on this that $6 billion is missing. The alert, however, did not draw that conclusion,"" he wrote. ""Instead, it found that the failure to adequately maintain contract files — documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of U.S. tax dollars — ‘creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department’s contract actions.’ "" In other words, the State Department was terrible at paperwork. The $6 billion figure refers to the total amount affected by file mismanagement. It’s akin to spending $20 on lunch and losing or not asking for a receipt. Documentation over where that $20 went was lost, but not the $20 itself. So the State Department under Clinton, who wasn’t mentioned in the alert, may have been financially disorganized, but it didn’t ""lose"" $6 billion. ‘Sold uranium to the Russia through my faux charity’ Trump offered a more nuanced (but still Mostly False) version of this claim: ""Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation."" The State Department didn’t unilaterally greenlight Russia’s purchase of a company with U.S. uranium assets. It was one of nine government agencies, along with federal and state nuclear regulators, that approved the deal. Moreover, there is no evidence that Clinton personally advocated for approval. Nine people related to the company did give to the Clinton Foundation at some point in time, but most of their donations occurred before the Russian deal. Cohen’s meme is a more outlandish. Given the available evidence, the most that can be said is the State Department had a hand in the approval process, and Clinton Foundation donors were linked to the company Russia purchased. That may look fishy, but there’s no proof of quid pro quo. ‘Illegally deleted public records’ This part of the meme refers to Clinton’s use of a private email server. While Clinton’s actions in deleting some 31,000 emails certainly broached the rules of record keeping, the meme’s use of the word ""illegally"" is premature. Before she turned over the server to the State Department, she and her staff deleted half of all the emails without government review, saying they were personal correspondence. Her decision is the subject of FBI scrutiny. But was this illegal? It depends, according to Douglas Cox, a law professor at City University of New York who studies records preservation. ""If Clinton destroyed work emails knowing they should have been kept and was intentionally trying to remove them from the public record, then yes, that is illegal and it is a crime,"" he said. ""In the end, I think there is not enough public information available to know whether Clinton did ‘illegally’ destroy public records."" Clinton’s overall defense that her email practices were ""allowed"" is False. ""The whole situation also again raises questions about the process by which Clinton decided what was, and was not, a federal record, a process she enshrouded in a black box of attorney-client privilege when she involved her personal attorneys, and a process she made final when she destroyed anything they determined was ‘personal,’"" Cox said. Ultimately, Clinton hasn’t been charged with any crime at the time of Cohen’s tweet. ‘Murdered an ambassador’ Rhetoric about the Benghazi attacks seldom matches up with reality, and this part of Cohen’s claim is no different. The day of Cohen’s tweet, the Republican-led House Benghazi Committee released its findings after a two-year investigation. The partisan 800-page report concluded that a series of missed cues, intergovernmental miscommunication, inadequate security and general incompetence delayed attempts to rescue Americans in Benghazi. It also accused the Obama administration of misleading the public to save political face in the aftermath of the attacks. But neither the report, nor the seven other probes before it, held Clinton specifically responsible for the events that led up to the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others, let alone charge her with murder. Here’s an exchange between the chair of the Benghazi committee, South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, and a reporter that demonstrates his thinking on the matter: Reporter: ""There are bumper stickers and T-shirts all over this country that say, ‘Hillary Clinton lied, people died.’ ...Is that true?"" Gowdy: ""You don’t see that T-shirt on me, and you’ve never seen that bumper sticker on any of my vehicles, and you’ve never heard me comment on that."" To review, the ambassador died during attacks at the U.S. compound in Benghazi, which began suddenly on the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2012. Sean Smith, a State Department foreign service officer, was found dead within an hour and Stevens was missing and pronounced dead from smoke inhalation later that night. Clinton, as we have previously reported, learned of the attacks in real time and said she worked late into the night. According to her memoir Hard Choices, she called White House National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, CIA Director David Petraeus and the president of Libya; directed State Department officials to secure other American facilities in Libya; convened a meeting of department leaders, among other actions. But was there something she could have done that day to prevent Stevens’ death? Barring conspiracy theorists, no one seems to think so, including the Benghazi committee. ""We now know neither one of these brave men could have been saved,"" Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., said in a video explaining the committee’s findings. ""I do not blame Hillary Clinton or (Defense Secretary) Leon Panetta,"" Ann Stevens, the ambassador’s sister who serves as the spokesperson for the family, told the New Yorker. ""I don’t see any usefulness in continuing to criticize her. It is very unjust."" It’s one thing to say Clinton and other top government officials should shoulder some responsibility for the institutional failure that contributed to the inadequate response to the Benghazi attacks, but it’s ridiculous to accuse Clinton of murder. Our ruling Cohen tweeted a meme that says Clinton ""presided over $6 billion lost at the State Department, sold uranium to the Russians through (her) faux charity, illegally deleted public records, and murdered an ambassador."" There are significant problems with each part of the post. During Clinton’s tenure at as secretary of state, the department was reprimanded for shoddy paperwork affecting $6 billion worth of contracts, not ""losing"" the money. The Clinton Foundation did not sell uranium to the Russians. Clinton’s State Department approved Russia’s purchase of a company with uranium assets in the United States but it was one of 11 organizations to do so. There’s no evidence that she personally advocated for the deal, nor is there evidence that people related to the company who donated to the Clinton Foundation did so on a quid pro quo basis. Clinton deleted over 30,000 emails off her private email server without government review. Experts say that’s certainly skirting the rules and her email server in general was not allowed. But to say that it was ""illegal"" takes it too far, at least for now. Finally, terrorists murdered the U.S. ambassador. None of the seven probes into the Benghazi attacks held Clinton personally responsible for the ambassador’s death, let alone charge her with murder. This claim is outrageous.

How much do gun lobbyists fund Kelly Ayotte's campaign?
","The ad cuts to a shadowy close-up of a man and woman shaking hands, as if they'd just made a deal, superimposed over a stack of $100 bills.  The narrator explains: ""She stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns.""  The 30-second spot attacks Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte's record on gun control measures as she faces a tough re-election bid against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat.  Sponsored by the political action committee for Americans for Responsible Solutions, the ad’s ominous tone and imagery leave the viewer with the impression that Ayotte doesn’t care what her constituents want because she’s in the pocket of well-heeled firearms lobbyists. It’s a line of attack used in the wake of the Orlando shootings and the Senate’s votes on gun control legislation. It has also employed by New Hampshire Democrats. ""Ayotte puts her gun lobby backers before the safety and security of New Hampshire,"" Ray Buckley, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said in a June 21 statement. PolitiFact New Hampshire wondered how much the ""gun lobby"" is really spending on Ayotte’s campaign. We’ve recently looked into Ayotte’s voting history on expanded background checks. Now, we’ll focus on the financial supporters of her campaign. Following the money A review of campaign finance records shows that Ayotte has accepted at least $7,450 in donations from the most prominent lobbying group, the National Rifle Association, over her career. Over the course of Ayotte’s career, according to the database, gun rights groups have given her campaign or leadership PAC a total of $68,595. This total includes donations from the NRA as well as other groups such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation. It also includes donations from individuals who have a pattern of making political contributions supporting gun rights, which most people wouldn’t associate with the ""Washington gun lobby."" Americans for Responsible Solutions communications director Mark Prentice said the data in the OpenSecrets database makes it ""absolutely clear"" that gun rights groups fund her campaign. Beyond direct campaign contributions to Ayotte, those groups have spent another $12,500 in independent expenditures to support her, bringing the sum to more than $80,000. But it’s important to keep those numbers in context.  The average U.S. Senate campaign costs more than $10 million, according to a study by MapLight.org, a nonpartisan group that studies money in politics. As she prepared for a contentious reelection battle, Ayotte reported having $6.9 million cash on hand in the last fundraising report March 31. In other words, the money she’s received -- directly or indirectly -- from gun lobbyists during her political career represents about 1 percent of the cash she has on hand right now. When compared against the $12.4 million she’s raised since she first became a candidate in the 2010 cycle, it’s 0.65 percent of her lifetime fundraising. And Ayotte’s $7,450 from the NRA pale in comparison to what the group gave to its top recipient in Congress, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. McCain has received $37,150 in direct support and more than $7 million in independent expenditures for him and against his opponents, according to OpenSecrets records dating back to 1989. ""The ad is misleading because the contributions cited equal only about half a percent of the total amount raised by our campaign over her career,"" Ayotte’s campaign spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in an email statement. Meanwhile, the group that’s running the ad, Americans for Responsible Solutions, was founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords, an Arizona Democrat and mass-shooting survivor. It has spent $834,278 in independent expenditures against Ayotte’s candidacy, according to OpenSecrets. That’s about 10 times the amount of money spent on Ayotte’s campaign by pro-gun groups. Ayotte’s gun-policy views The ad also claims Ayotte ""stands with the Washington gun lobby"" in return for the donations she’s received, but that hasn’t universally been the case. Ayotte received an ""A"" rating from the NRA in 2012, meaning she was viewed as a ""solidly pro-gun"" candidate.  The NRA and associated groups have taken out ads supporting Ayotte in the past. ""Thank you for protecting the rights of gun owners, hunters and all who cherish the freedoms of our Second Amendment,"" one ad from from the National Shooting Sports Foundation said. Another ad came from an organization called the The New Hampshire Men and Women of the National Rifle Association.   However, her voting record has not always adhered to the NRA’s stances. On June 20, for instance, Ayotte backed two bills blocking gun sales to suspected terrorists -- a switch from when she voted to kill a similar Democratic plan in December. A day later, she co-sponsored a bipartisan gun control bill with U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to strengthen existing background check laws, which the NRA opposed. Collins, one of the Senate’s most moderate Republicans, has a C+ rating from the NRA.   Our ruling The gun control group Americans for Responsible Solutions said Ayotte ""stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns."" Ayotte has indeed benefited from money from gun rights groups – $81,095 over her career, to be exact.

Donald Trump inaccurately suggests Clinton got paid to approve Russia uranium deal
","Hillary Clinton’s eponymous nonprofit foundation provided ready-made fodder for a series of attacks from Donald Trump. In a major speech last week, the presumptive Republican nominee recited a number of claims from Clinton Cash, a 2015 bestselling investigation into donations to the Clinton Foundation. Among them: ""Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation — $145 million dollars."" We wanted to vet this charge of Clinton engaging in pay-to-play politics. Trump’s claim is a reductive version of his source material’s findings and runs into several problems. First, the State Department did approve of Russia’s gradual takeover of a company with significant U.S. uranium assets, but it didn’t act unilaterally. State was one of nine government agencies, not to mention independent federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal. Second, while nine people related to the company did donate to the Clinton Foundation, it’s unclear whether they were still involved in the company by the time of the Russian deal and stood to benefit from it. Third, most of their Clinton Foundation donations occurred before and during Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid, before she could have known she would become secretary of state. The bottom line: While the connections between the Clinton Foundation and the Russian deal may appear fishy, there’s simply no proof of any quid pro quo. Clinton’s unsubstantiated role Did Clinton singlehandedly imperil national security by greenlighting the Russian deal, as Trump implies? No. The company in question, Uranium One, does have mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity. It churns out a smaller portion of actual uranium produced in the United States (11 percent in 2014), according to Oilprice.com. But that’s less cause for alarm than Trump is suggesting. For one, the United States doesn’t actually produce all that much uranium (about 2 percent in 2015) and is actually a net importer of the chemical, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at Middlebury Institute and former director at the New America Foundation. For another, Russia doesn’t have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, Oilprice.org pointed out, ""so it’s somewhat disingenuous to say this uranium is now Russia’s, to do with what it pleases."" The Kremlin was likely more interested in Uranium One’s assets in Kazakhstan, the world’s largest producer. Trump is also wrong that Clinton alone allowed the transfer. The Kremlin’s 2010 purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One had to be approved by the nine members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. That included Clinton as secretary of state, but also the secretaries of the Treasury (the chairman of the committee), Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security as well as the the heads of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The deal also had to be okayed by the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission as well as Utah’s nuclear regulator. While it’s conceivable Clinton advocated for the deal, the author of Clinton Cash Peter Schweizer himself admitted that he doesn’t have ""direct evidence"" proving Clinton played a part. The State Department’s principal representative on the committee, Jose Fernandez, told Time that Clinton ""never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter."" Why on earth would the United States allow the transfer of a uranium company? As others, including a New York Times’ investigation, have explained, the United States was still seeking to ""reset"" its relationship with Russia and trying to get the Kremlin on board with its Iran nuclear deal. But at the end of the day, the Russian deal wasn’t that big. Russia’s purchase of the company ""had as much of an impact on national security as it would have if they set the money on fire,"" said Lewis. ""That’s probably why (CFIUS and the NRC ) approved it."" A condensed timeline Trump's suggestion that the Russian deal occurred ""while nine investors funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation"" is not supported by the evidence presented in Clinton Cash. On the contrary, the donations detailed by author Schweizer occurred at least two years before the deal. Furthermore, it’s not clear from the book whether all nine of the Clinton Foundation donors were actually involved in the Russian deal at all. The timeline is key here, so bear with us. Uranium One had several facelifts between 2007 and 2013. Back in 2007, it was a South African company that had mining assets in Africa and Australia. That spring, it merged with another mining company, the Canada-based UrAsia Energy. The combined company kept Uranium One as its name but Toronto as its base. Under the terms of the deal, the shareholders of UrAsia retained a 60 percent stake in the new company. Russia didn’t get involved until two years later, in June 2009, when its nuclear agency started buying shares in Uranium One. The Kremlin upped its stake in the company from 17 percent to a controlling 51 percent the following year, and assumed total ownership of the company in 2013 (and renamed it to Uranium One Holding). Out of the nine investors listed in Clinton Cash, five were linked to UrAsia only, and Schweizer doesn’t say whether they were still involved with the company after the merger and when Russia was buying it out.  (We asked Schweizer’s publicist via email, but we didn’t hear back.) Using SEDAR, Canada’s filing system for public companies, we could only verify one UrAsia shareholder (Ian Telfer) who also owned stocks in Uranium One in 2010 and who chaired its Board of Directors. A New York Times investigation on the topic linked two others to Uranium One. Why does it matter? Because UrAsia investors could have conceivably sold their shares before they could have profited off the Russian deal. In other words, giving to the Clinton Foundation wouldn’t have mattered to the allegedly Clinton-backed acquisition of 2010 if they had no stake in it. We created a breakdown of the nine ""investors"" and their donations to the Clinton Foundation, based on the most complete information we could find through the Clinton Foundation, media reports and public filings as well as what Clinton Cash reported. ""Investor"" Connection Donation Year Frank Giustra* UrAsia Energy founder $131.3 million Late 2005 and June 2007 Frank Holmes* Executive at U.S. Global Investors, which held Uranium One shares $250,000 to $500,000 $100,000 in March 2008 Neil Woodyer* Advisor to Uranium One $500,000 March 2008 Robert Disbrow Broker at Haywood Securities, which provided $58 million in capital UrAsia-Uranium One merger, according to Clinton Cash $1 million to $5 million $1 million in 2007 Paul Reynolds* Financial advisor on UrAsia-Uranium One merger $1 million to $5 million $1 million in March 2008 Robert Cross UrAsia shareholder and director $500,000 March 2008 Egizio Bianchini Cohead BMO’s Global Metals and Mining group, underwriter for UrAsia-Uranium One Merger $600,000  March 2008 Sergey Kurzin UrAsia shareholder $1 million March 2008 Ian Telfer** Uranium One chairman $3 million  March 2008 Total $139.15 million to $146.9 million As you can see in the chart, the $145 million in donations didn’t happen ""while"" the Russian deal was occurring in 2010. According to Clinton Cash, five donors contributed $136.4 million at or before a March 2008 benefit hosted by Giustra. While the book doesn’t specify when the other four donated to the Clinton Foundation, we were able to trace another $2.6 million to the March fundraiser. Furthermore, the bulk of the $145 million comes from Frank Giustra, the founder of UrAsia Energy and a major Clinton Foundation donor. Guistra says he sold all of his stakes in Uranium One in the fall of 2007, ""at least 18 months before Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State"" and three years before the Russian deal. We couldn’t independently verify Giustra’s claim from UrAsia’s or Uranium One’s public filings. Assuming Giustra is telling the truth, the donation amount from confirmed Uranium One investors drops from over $145 million to just $4 million. All of these occurred before the Russia deal. One caveat: The New York Times found that Ian Telfer donated between $1.3 million and $5.6 million to the Clinton Foundation during and after the review process for the Russian deal. So there’s evidence showing that one man involved with Uranium One (Telfer) donated millions to the Clinton Foundation at the same time as the deal. That certainly doesn’t look good for Hillary Clinton, but it’s a far cry from nine investors funneling $145 million. Our ruling Trump said, ""Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation."" There’s a grain of truth in this claim. Clinton’s State Department was one of nine government agencies to approve Russia’s acquisition of a company with U.S. uranium assets. Nine people related the company at some point in time donated to the Clinton Foundation, but we only found evidence that one did so ""while"" the Russian deal was occurring. The bulk of the $145 million in donations came two years before the deal. Trump is certainly within his right to question the indisputable links between Clinton Foundation donors and their ties to Uranium One, but Trump’s charge exaggerates the links. More importantly, his suggestion of a quid pro quo is unsubstantiated, as Schweizer the author of Clinton Cash himself has admitted. On the most basic level, Trump’s timeline is off. Most of the donations occurred before Clinton was named secretary of state. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False. Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled the name of the State Department’s representative on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. He is Jose Fernandez.  ","[('YouTube, ""Donald Trump\'s Full Anti-Hillary Clinton Speech in NYC,"" June 22, 2016', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUW2-MUonbo&feature=youtu.be&t=24m47s'), ('Peter Schweizer, Clinton Cash, May 5, 2015', 'No link'), ('Huffington Post, ""Hot Rocks: Hidden Cost and Foreign Ownership of ""Clean"" Nuclear Fuel Emerging,"" May 30, 2010', 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/da-barber/hot-rocks-hidden-cost-and_b_518956.html'), ('Salt Lake Tribune, ""Uranium company deal nearly done,"" Dec. 13, 2010', 'No link'), ('Oilprice.com, ""Does Russia Really Own 20% Of The US’ Uranium Reserves?,"" May 6, 2015', 'http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/sltrib/home/50850101-76/uranium-company-utah-mill.html.csp'), ('World Nuclear Association, ""World Uranium Mining Production,"" May 19, 2016', 'No link'), ('U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ""NRC Approves Transfer of Control of Uranium Recovery Licenses to Russian Firm,"" Nov. 24, 2010', 'http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Does-Russia-Really-Own-20-Of-The-US-Uranium-Reserves.html'), ('ABC, ""This Week Transcript: \'Clinton Cash\' Author Peter Schweizer,"" April 26, 2015', 'No link'), ('Quartz, ""Breaking down the Russian uranium deal hanging over Hillary Clinton’s campaign,"" April 23, 2015', 'http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx'), ('New York Times, ""Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal,"" April 24, 2015', 'No link'), ('SEDAR queries for UrAsia and Uranium One public filings', 'http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/news/2010/10-211.pdf'), ('Nexis search', 'No link'), ('Uranium One, ""Uranium One and UrAsia Energy Announce Combination to Create Emerging Senior Uranium Company,"" Feb. 12, 2007', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-clinton-cash-author-peter-schweizer/print?id=30568766'), ('New York Times, ""After Mining Deal, Financier Donated to Clinton,"" Jan. 31, 2008', 'No link'), ('Clinton Foundation, Contributor and Grantor Information, accessed June 24, 2016', 'http://qz.com/389829/breaking-down-the-russian-uranium-deal-hanging-over-hillary-clintons-campaign/'), ('Globe and Mail, ""Renaissance Man,"" June 27, 2008', 'No link'), ('Globe and Mail, ""Clinton charities take hit from mining bust,"" Feb. 19, 2008', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html?_r=0'), ('CEO.ca, ""Statement of Frank Giustra,"" April 23, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Josh Schwerin, Hillary Clinton spokesman, June 25, 2016', 'https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:cSj_WEhqCKgJ:www.uranium1.com/index.php/en/component/docman/doc_download/256-uranium-one-and-urasia-energy-announce-combination-to-create-emerging-senior-uranium-company+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us'), ('Interview with Peter Lewis, professor at Middlebury Institute, June 29, 2016', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/jun/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-inaccurately-suggests-clinton-got-pai/

U.S. Rep. David Jolly worked to 'drill off our beaches,' Charlie Crist says in email
","Only hours after U.S. Rep. David Jolly announced he would drop his Senate bid and instead seek re-election to Congress, his Democratic opponent Charlie Crist sent out a fundraising email attacking the incumbent. ""We are now being challenged by a well-funded former Washington lobbyist,"" former Gov. Crist’s June 17, 2016, email stated. ""This is a man who has used money and power to try to take away women’s rights, drill off our beaches and block common sense gun control."" Jolly had been vying for the U.S. Senate seat Marco Rubio was vacating after his presidential campaign, but Rubio decided he wanted to run for re-election after all. Now Jolly is competing against Crist in a redrawn district that leans heavily Democratic. There’s plenty of accusations packed into that sentence, but Jolly’s record on oil drilling struck us as particularly Florida-centric. Was Jolly an advocate for offshore drilling, as Crist said? Crist has a point about Jolly’s past work, which we’ve previously researched. But his claim ignores Jolly’s record of pushing back against offshore drilling in Congress. Not off our shore Jolly, a former lobbyist and aide to longtime U.S. House Rep C.W. ""Bill"" Young, replaced the congressman after Young died in office in 2013. He’s been in office since winning a 2014 special election. Offshore drilling, for the most part, is not allowed off Florida shores. The 2006 Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act prohibits drilling within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 125 miles from the Panhandle. The law expires in 2022. Crist is making it sound as if Jolly clearly favors more drilling off the coast of Florida. Jolly’s actions recent actions haven’t shown that at all. As a congressman, Jolly voiced opposition in July 2014 to expanded exploration off Florida’s Atlantic coast using sound waves, out of concern for the same process being used in the Gulf of Mexico. He signed a bipartisan letter to President Barack Obama opposing so-called seismic testing. (The Atlantic drilling was later called off.) He introduced legislation in June 2015 that was co-sponsored by Democratic Reps. Gwen Graham and Patrick Murphy to extend the ban on drilling in the eastern Gulf another five years, until 2027. The following month, he introduced an amendment heading off a Senate plan that would have potentially expanded drilling off Florida’s Gulf coast.   This is not to say that Jolly is against drilling for oil as a practice. In an editorial that coincided with his bipartisan bill, he said Florida didn’t need to risk its beaches simply to increase oil production. ""In the eastern region off Florida's coast, there are zero producing leases, and none are needed,"" he wrote in a Tampa Bay Times op-ed on June 3, 2015. ""Gulf drilling activities in the western and central Gulf meet today's energy demands and are capable of meeting tomorrow's."" Jolly makes no secret his strategy is based on keeping Florida waters free of oil platforms while relying on drilling elsewhere. ""I've been pretty clear I support the current administration plan for continued drilling in the western and central Gulf, while strengthening the ban in the eastern Gulf,"" Jolly told us in an email statement through his spokesman. So where is Crist getting the idea that Jolly worked to open up more drilling? His campaign’s single piece of evidence was one of our own fact-checks from 2014. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee accused the then-candidate of working to expand the practice in the Gulf, but Jolly claimed he ""never lobbied for offshore oil drilling."" We rated Jolly’s statement Mostly False. While at his firm Three Bridges Advisors, Jolly had listed on a March 3, 2011, lobbying disclosure form that he had discussed H.R. 909, an energy independence proposal known as the Roadmap for America’s Energy Future. The bill in part called for expanded offshore drilling and was supported by Jolly’s client, an anti-regulation advocacy group called Free Enterprise Nation. Jolly admitted he had listed the bill on the form because he was at a meeting in which his client discussed it, but he ""did not lobby on its behalf."" Lobbying experts we spoke to at the time said it was unlikely Jolly would have listed the bill if he hadn’t discussed it, although there was no way to verify that. More importantly, according to the Lobbying Disclosure Act, even being in a meeting in which it was discussed was technically a form of lobbying. We decided that Jolly couldn’t claim to having never lobbied on the subject, because he said he had. But we think a single instance of lobbying on a broad energy plan years ago is very different than implying Jolly did (and still) wants to expand drilling entirely. Our ruling Crist said Jolly ""has used money and power to try to … drill off our beaches."" His campaign’s argument is that Jolly technically lobbied on a failed 2011 bill that would have potentially expanded offshore drilling. But that was several years ago, and about a claim Jolly made during his House campaign concerning one event in his years as a lobbyist. Crist is ignoring Jolly the congressman’s efforts while in office  — however nuanced — to keep drilling away from Florida’s shores. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c29ba169-b094-41c3-b660-bfcb9bb12d57","[('Charlie Crist, Fundraising email, June 17, 2016', 'http://www.scribd.com/doc/49803471/Summary-of-the-Energy-Roadmap'), ('The Weekly Standard, ""Summary of the Energy Roadmap,"" March 2, 2011', 'No link'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""U.S. Rep.

Did DUI arrests in Tampa plummet when Uber came to town?
","As the debate over regulation of Uber continues across the country, Florida House Majority Leader Dana Young, R-Tampa, took to Twitter with a factoid about the ridesharing company’s effect on DUIs in her home city. ""DUI arrests dropped significantly in Tampa once Uber began operating here,"" Young tweeted June 21. ""The Austin situation is disturbing.""  Young was responding to a tweet by conservative focus-group leader Frank Luntz, who said the number of DUI arrests has increased in Austin, Texas, since Uber and Lyft ceased operations in May. Luntz’s tweet linked to an article that discussed the aftermath of Austin abandoning the ridesharing companies. After talking to experts and analyzing the data, we found the relationship between DUIs and Uber isn’t as clear-cut as Young makes it seem. The road to the truth This isn’t the first time Young, who is running for the Florida Senate, has fought in favor of Uber, which arrived in Hillsborough County in April 2014. Lyft arrived the same month. In February 2016, Young co-sponsored a bill (HB 1439) that would stop the Hillsborough Public Transportation Commission from treating ridesharing apps like taxicabs. In 2015, the Hillsborough County legislative delegation advanced a bill (HB 509) that would regulate ride-sharing companies. Before the bill passed, Young proposed an amendment with stipulations for background checks but didn’t include fingerprinting, which is required for Hillsborough County taxicab and limousine drivers. With Young’s interest in mind, we turned to the evidence. Young’s communication team sent data to support the claim, but it only included two six-month periods from January-June in 2014 and 2015. Although the data from 2014 and 2015 shows a 30 percent decrease in DUI arrests, it cherrypicks the timeframe. Kelsey Swithers, a spokeswoman for Young, said the data was the most recent information that Tampa police had as Young prepared a local bill. We requested more recent, comprehensive data from the police department. It shows the number of DUI arrests has fluctuated since 2012. Before we get into the numbers, here’s a few things to know: Other law enforcement organizations like the Hillsborough County Sheriff Department also make DUI arrests in Tampa, which aren’t reflected in these numbers. However, arrests by Tampa police far outnumber those from other agencies in Tampa. The data includes DUI arrests from different categories, whether it is a simple DUI stop or a serious car accident where a person was driving under the influence. So let’s look at what the numbers show.  Graphic by Lauren Flannery It’s hard to detect a general trend in the data. For instance, the total number of DUIs between 2012 and 2013 decreased by 135 arrests, but the total number of total DUI arrests increased by 64 between 2013 and 2014. There was a general decline in DUI arrests after Uber came to town, with arrests staggering between 103 and 136 for most of 2015 — compared to a June 2014 high of 185. But at the beginning of 2016, arrests for DUI increased again to pre-Uber levels. Tampa police spokesman Stephen Hegarty cautioned that a number of factors could explain the volatility in the numbers, including announcements of DUI checkpoints and heightened enforcement around holidays. Still, Bill Bales, a professor in the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University, said there may be something to Young’s theory based on the preliminary evidence for 2015, even if it doesn’t control for other factors. There were 414 fewer DUI arrests in 2015 than in 2014. It probably took around nine months before the number of Uber drivers was meaningful, Bales said, so it’s fair to use DUI stats from 2013 to 2014 as pre-Uber DUI trends. ""The fact that DUI arrests declined by 22.2 percent from 2014 to 2015, which is arguably the first full year of operation, suggests Uber has had a significant impact on DUI arrests,"" Bales said. So case closed? Not exactly. Correlation ≠ causation Academic research rarely makes assertions like Young’s tweet, Bales said. ""The reality is we can’t control for everything,"" Bales said. ""We rarely make the claim that X caused Y at this level. We’re not that precise."" Researchers behind a three-year study (not yet peer-reviewed) of Uber in 150 cities did conclude that Uber lowers the rate of fatal crashes and DUI arrests. The study, which did not include Tampa because it examined 2010-13 data, was just finished in May. Sean Mulholland, co-author of the study and professor of economics at Stonehill College, said they were able to draw broad conclusions about Uber’s influence because of the large sample size. ""When looking at only one city or county, there might be other factors unique to the city that are driving the decline,"" Mulholland said. ""But when we look at many cities, we are able to hold constant any unique factors that do not change over the years of the study."" In addition to all of the factors potentially influencing DUI stats, the culture of drinking and driving has changed over the last several decades, said Thomas Blomberg, executive director of the Center for Criminology and Public Policy Research at Florida State. The portrayal of DUI stops in media is just one way people have become less deterred from getting behind the wheel while under the influence. Our ruling Young said DUI arrests dropped dramatically when Uber came to Tampa. Uber came to Tampa in April 2014, and DUIs did drop that month, and continued to do so in 2015.

Arizona’s House Democrats claim governor wants to increase private prison salaries
","Arizona House Democrats are questioning the priorities of their Republican counterparts, balking at a Department of Corrections plan to buy a $137 million privately run prison in Kingman. The Democrats say the plan, which was developed by the governor’s office, the corrections department and the Department of Administration, is bad for taxpayers. ""Gov. (Doug) Ducey wants to use public, taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards,"" the Democrats wrote in a June 20 blog post. ""Guards employed by a multi-billion dollar company that made nearly $140 million in profits last year."" While the state wants to purchase the prison, they want a private company -- GEO Group -- to continue to manage it. Does the sale include a raise for the private corrections workers? Acronym soup The history of the Kingman prison is a bit complicated, and filled with companies with strange names, so we’ll take it slow. The prison was opened in August 2004 as part of a plan by Gov. Janet Napolitano to build more inmate beds using the private sector. As part of the original agreement, the state was scheduled to pay off the construction of the facility over 20 years and then take ownership. Until the state’s debt was paid off, a non-profit, Mohave Prison LLC, was created to own the prison. Management and Training Corporation, a Utah-based private prison operator, was originally contracted to manage Kingman. However, after multiple inmate riots in July 2015, the state fired MTC, and GEO Group assumed their contract. GEO Group is one of the largest private prison operators in the country. The Florida-based company manages more than 60 correctional facilities nationwide. Now Ducey and others in the state want to buy the Kingman prison early as part of what they say is a cost-saving measure. According to the proposal, the state owning the prison would save taxpayers more than $70 million and reduce the per-prisoner cost from $60.10 to $40.37 a day — a savings of more than 30 percent. Buying the prison nine years early would allow the state to refinance and reduce the amount of interest paid on the facility, the state says. The plan was approved by the state Legislature for fiscal year 2017 and is expected to be implemented sometime in the ""next few months,"" according to Department of Corrections spokesman Andrew Wilder. Plan would include raises  If the purchase goes through as expected, the state would officially own the prison, but it would still be managed by the GEO Group. As part of the plan, the state would offer $2 million to increase the salaries of the GEO Group workers. Keely Varvel, chief of staff for the Arizona House Democrats, pointed us to page 18 of the proposed purchase plan, which says that $2 million is intended ""to increase starting salaries for correctional officers and improve retention."" But there’s a big caveat: The $2 million in annual expenses would be offset by the $8 million in annual savings the state would incur for buying the prison. Pablo Paez, a spokesman for the GEO Group, called the Democrats’ claim an ""unfair characterization."" He said the proposal allows for ""significant savings for taxpayers overall,"" while providing additional resources for staff wages. In essence, Paez said, Democrats are focusing on one side of the ledger -- money spent increasing salaries -- while ignoring the larger cost savings. The average salary for a state correctional officer is $36,800. Under this plan, Kingman correctional officers would see a 13 percent raise, from $29,453 to an average salary of $33,300. That’s still less than the state average and well under the national average of $45,320, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman with Ducey’s office, said the overall plan, besides saving money, allows the state to ""invest in ensuring public safety."" Our ruling Arizona House Democrats said, ""Gov. Ducey wants to use public, taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards."" That’s literally accurate. The state contracts with GEO Group to manage the Kingman prison in question, but GEO pays its correctional officers. And if the state purchases Kingman, it would use $2 million for raises for the prison staff. The major caveat is those raises would be more-than-offset by money the state says it will save with the purchase of the Kingman facility.

Tom Perez says union members earn median $200 a week more than nonunion workers
","U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez says a union job is a ticket to the middle class. ""If you are a member of a union, your median weekly income is roughly $200 more than if you are a nonunion member, and that doesn’t include benefits,"" Perez said in an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch, prior to headlining the Democratic Party of Virginia’s Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner on June 18. We wondered if Perez’s figure is correct. Mattie Munoz, a spokeswoman for the labor secretary, said the information comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which which tracks the earnings of union and nonunion workers. The bureau examines ""median"" earnings - the halfway point at which 50 percent of workers make less and 50 percent of workers earn more. In 2015, the median weekly earnings for people who are a member of a union was $980, according to the bureau’s most current figures. For nonunion members, the median weekly pay was $776. That’s a $204 difference and in line with Perez’s claim. Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, told our colleagues at PolitiFact National in a 2014 story that unions typically do a better job of raising wages for workers with less-than-average education than they do for those with higher levels of education. Someone who has a doctoral degree, for example, probably wouldn’t get as much of a pay bump from being in a union, but they might have better job security as well as better health and retirement benefits than their nonunion colleagues, Burtless said. Another table from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which further breaks down the pay disparity among specific occupations, shows that unionized workers in some professions earn less than their nonunion colleagues. In the architecture and engineering fields, for example, workers in a union last year had a median weekly pay of $1,393, but that was outpaced by nonunion workers who earned $1,427 each week. Federal employees who are in a union earn a median weekly pay of $1,058, while those not in a union earn more: $1,159 each week. But for other government employees, the story is different, with unions typically leading to larger paychecks. Across the country, state employees in a union earned a $988 median weekly salary, while nonunion workers earned a median $867. Unionized local government workers earned a median weekly salary of $1,043, compared with nonunion local government employees who earned $783 a week. This isn’t the first time Perez has made this claim, although he’s changed the wording. PolitiFact National in 2014 noted that the labor secretary said the ""average"" union member makes $200 more than a nonunion employee. That was rated Mostly True, since the figures involved instead are a tally of the ""median"" weekly pay rather than ""average"" pay. Our ruling Perez said that a union member’s median weekly income is about $200 more than someone who is not in a union. His figure, on the whole, holds up, although there are some professions that are exceptions. But Perez clearly was talking in general terms. So we rate his statement True.","[('Comments by Labor Secretary Thomas Perez to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.', 'http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm'), ('Interview with Mattie Munoz, press secretary for Thomas Perez, June 22, 2016.', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Union members summary,"" Jan. 28, 2016.', 'http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t04.htm'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Table 4.

Donald Trump quotes Bernie Sanders' Half True claim about Clinton, free trade
","Donald Trump made a grab for blue collar Democrats by citing the anti-trade, anti-Hillary Clinton rhetoric of Clinton’s Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. For his latest attack, he borrowed Sanders’ own words. ""As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton ‘voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs,’ "" Trump said in a speech about the economy delivered outside a recycling plant in western Pennsylvania. The presumptive Republican nominee quoted Sanders accurately (barring the Trumpian flourish emphasizing ""millions""). But Sanders’ original claim, which we investigated, wasn’t without faults. Clinton has largely supported free trade, though her position is more nuanced than Trump and Sanders suggest, she  The notion that ""millions, millions of jobs"" have been lost because of trade, however, is more debatable. Clinton’s position on free trade Sanders is consistently anti-free trade, and Trump has been outspoken in disapproval of deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans Pacific Partnership. Clinton’s views, however, seem to depend on the content of each agreement. Overall, Trump and Sanders have a point that she’s supported more trade deals than she’s opposed. As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably of the NAFTA, signed by President Bill Clinton. The deal, she wrote in her 2003 memoir Living History, ""would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization."" During her 2000 Senate bid to represent New York, Clinton supported normalizing trade relations with China. Out of the 10 trade deals that came up for a vote when she was in the Senate, Clinton said yes to six, no to two, and skipped the votes on two (though she had given her vocal support). She also voted for legislation that included an amendment granting Vietnam normalized trade status. She was in favor of a deal with Jordan because of its ""internationally recognized enforceable labor standards,"" she explained in 2005, but she considered the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement ""a step backward."" As a presidential candidate in 2008, Clinton had varying opinions on several trade deals, and she changed her position on NAFTA. She called NAFTA ""a mistake"" and opposed pending deals with South Korea (out of concern for American carmakers), Colombia (because of labor rights abuses) and Panama (whose National Assembly president was a U.S. fugitive). She reiterated her support for free trade with Peru on the campaign trail, praising the country for its ""very strong labor and environmental protections."" As secretary of state in the pro-trade administration of President Barack Obama, Clinton walked back her opposition to three deals from her 2008 run and helped negotiate them. As a presidential candidate in 2016, she flip-flopped on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Year Trade deal Clinton’s position 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement Supported in 1990s, against in 2007 2002 Trade Act of 2002* Voted against** 2003 Chile-United States Voted for 2003 Singapore-United States Voted for 2004 Australia-United States Voted for 2004 Morocco-United States Voted for 2005 Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement Voted against 2005 Bahrain-United States Voted for*** 2006 Oman-United States Voted for 2007 Peru-United States Didn’t vote, supported in 2007 2007 Jordan-United States Didn’t vote, supported in 2005 2011 Panama-United States Against in 2007, supported in 2010 2011 Colombia-United States Against in 2007, supported in 2010 2011 South Korea-United States Against in 2007, supported in 2010 2015 Trans-Pacific Partnership Supported in 2010, against in 2015 * This deal is not included in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative’s list of free trade agreements, but contains many free trade provisions. ** This is a vote for ""fast track authority"" — allowing trade agreement to move through Congress without amendments or filibusters. *** The free trade agreement with Bahrain passed by unanimous consent, not a recorded roll call vote. Employment impact unclear The jury is still out on the impact of trade deals on employment, even after decades of debate. On one side, unions and some left-leaning think tanks often link American job losses to expanded trade. Labor advocates opposed the Chile and Singapore agreements, which they said in a 2003 report would kill an unspecified number of jobs. The liberal Economic Policy Institute, which Trump cited, has found that NAFTA has cost the United States over 800,000 jobs, and the South Korean deal cost about 60,000. In a 2014 report, the think tank reported that the United States has lost 3.2 million jobs between 2001 and 2013 to trade with China. Business groups, on the other hand, argue that trade deals actually boost employment. For example, a 2010 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that the 14 trade deals in place in 2008 supported 5.4 million jobs. Meanwhile, the U.S-China Business Council and the Financial Times contend that the loss in manufacturing jobs were not due to trade with China so much as gains in technology and productivity, as well as the result of a more sophisticated economy.    And in a recent fact-check, we found several nonpartisan reports demonstrating that NAFTA produced no significant job losses nor job gains. Analysis by economists at Tufts University and the University of Michigan projected no net impact on employment from the Chile, Singapore and South Korea deals. Our ruling Trump said, ""As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton ‘for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs.’ "" He accurately recasted Sanders’ words, but that doesn’t make the attack any more correct. Out of the 10 trade deals Clinton could have voted on, she voted in favor of six and against two. On two other deals (with Peru and Jordan), she didn’t vote but did vouch for them. As for subsequent job losses, independent research has shown the impact of NAFTA, for example, to not be significant one way or the other for jobs. Trump’s claim is partially accurate and needs additional information. We rate his statement Half True.","[('YouTube, ""Full Speech: Donald Trump Delivers Economic Policy Speech in Monessen, Pennsylvania,"" June 28, 2016', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A55goJJKYE'), ('PolitiFact, ""Clinton voted for \'virtually every\' trade agreement, killing millions of jobs, Sanders says,"" April 10, 2016', 'No link'), ('\xa0', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/10/bernie-s/clinton-voted-virtually-every-trade-agreement-kill/')]",/factchecks/2016/jun/29/donald-trump/donald-trump-quotes-bernie-sanders-half-true-claim/

Do 250,000 Americans die every year because of mistakes made during surgery?
","Speaking to an anti-government group in New York, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. vowed to ""do everything that I can"" to get Donald Trump elected president. The pledge made news back home. But a claim Clarke made about doctors killing people is what caught our attention. The conservative firebrand, who has built a national profile with frequent appearances on the Fox News Channel, spoke June 13, 2016 in Albany to the New York Oath Keepers. The group, sometimes dubbed a citizens militia, says its aim is to educate people ""on the true purpose of the Constitution, which is to preserve liberty for the people."" It gave Clarke its annual leadership award. The 38-year law enforcement veteran spent much of his speech defending police agencies from criticism by outsiders.  ""I decided at one point that I'd had enough. I was not going to let somebody who had never done this job for one day in their life transform this profession,"" Clarke said. ""That would be akin to me trying to transform the medical community after a botched surgery when I know nothing about the medical community. I'm not educated in it, I'm not trained in it. By the way, did you know that doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries? ""Has anybody-- has President Obama or the attorney general or Black Lives Matter -- demanded that the medical community be transformed? No. The medical community will have to figure that out."" There was a 250,000 figure in the news recently. But Clarke misstates it. Recent study Clarke refused to provide us information to back up his claim, saying through a spokeswoman that he ""gets his data from the same sources that the anti-gun bigots get their data from."" But it seems likely his statement was based on news reports about a study on medical errors that was published several weeks earlier in The BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal. It is an international peer-reviewed medical journal. The study, which was done by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, made news in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and in news outlets across the nation. Its major finding: An estimated 251,454 deaths per year, or 9.5 percent of all deaths in the United States, stem from a medical error. In publishing the study, The BMJ declared that medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in the United States, behind heart disease and cancer. Those diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each cause about 600,000 deaths per year. Regarding Clarke's claim, there are two important things to note:  1. The study did not attempt to do a count of deaths attributed to medical errors -- rather it made estimates based on medical death rate data and hospitalizations. 2. More importantly, the 250,000 estimate was based on many types of medical errors, not just botched surgeries -- anything from bad doctors to communication breakdowns when patients are handed off from one department to another, to medicine dosage mistakes, diagnostic errors and more. ""It boils down to people dying from the care that they receive rather than the disease for which they are seeking care,"" Johns Hopkins professor of surgery Martin Makary, the study’s lead author, told the Washington Post. Digging deeper Critics pointed out that the study did not take into account studies from 2008 and later, when improvements have been made, Modern Healthcare reported. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in December 2015 that from 2010 to 2014, hospital patients experienced 2.1 million fewer hospital-acquired conditions, resulting in about 87,000 fewer patients dying in hospitals. On other hand, we found that some studies have published estimates that were higher than the one from Johns Hopkins. A study published in 2013 in the Journal of Patient Safety estimated that more than 400,000 patients per year die in hospitals as a result of ""preventable harm."" And a 2014 report for the U.S. Senate estimated medical errors killed 325,000 people per year. Like the Johns Hopkins study, neither of those studies made an estimate of the number of deaths due specifically to errors in surgery. And Makary, the lead author of the Johns Hopkins study, told us he is not aware of any studies that count surgery deaths. Our rating Clarke said: ""Doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries."" A study released several weeks before Clarke made the statement estimates that 251,000 people per year in the United States die from any number of types of medical errors. But that figure is an estimate. Moreover, no estimate was made in the study on the number of deaths due to botched surgeries. We rate Clarke’s statement False.","[('YouTube, David Clarke Oath Keepers speech (25:40), June 13, 2016', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Iep-M236iA'), ('Email, David Clarke spokeswoman Fran McLaughlin, June 22, 2016', 'No link'), ('The BMJ, ""The third-leading cause of death in the U.S.,"" May 3, 2016', 'http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139'), ('New York Times, ""Medical errors may cause over 250,000 deaths a year,"" May 3, 2016', 'No link'), ('Johns Hopkins University, ""Study suggests medical errors now third leading cause of death in the U.S.,"" May 3, 2016', 'https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/medical-errors-may-cause-over-250000-deaths-a-year/?_r=1'), ('Washington Post, ""Researchers: Medical errors now third leading cause of death in United States,"" May 3, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email, Johns Hopkins professor of surgery Martin Makary, June 22, 2016', 'http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/study_suggests_medical_errors_now_third_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us')]",/factchecks/2016/jun/29/david-clarke-jr/do-250000-americans-die-every-year-because-mistake/

Democrats stretch impact of Planned Parenthood exclusion in Zika bill
","Emergency money to block the spread of the Zika virus won’t be coming any time real soon. A $1.1 billion funding measure failed to win enough support for an up or down vote in the Senate. The major stumbling point wasn’t the money (though Democrats wanted additional funding). Rather, it was the strings that were attached to the measure as it relates to combatting the virus in Puerto Rico. After the House passed the bill on a largely party line vote, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., berated it. """"The House Zika bill is a disaster,"" Nelson said June 24, 2016. ""Not only does it take $500 million in health care funding away from Puerto Rico, it limits access to birth control services needed to help curb the spread of the virus and prevent terrible birth defects. This is not a serious solution."" We wondered about Nelson’s claim that the House Zika bill ""limits access to birth control services needed to help curb the spread of the virus,"" in Puerto Rico. What the bill said The conference report (the bill that emerged from negotiations between top Senate and House Republicans) included two pots of money of particular importance for Puerto Rico. There was $80 million through the Social Services Block Grant program, and $40 million for community health centers. By and large, these dollars were targeted toward Puerto Rico, where the Zika virus has been transmitted widely by mosquitoes. The words that limited how this money could be spent applied to the block grant program. Those dollars were ""for health services provided by public health departments, hospitals, or reimbursed through public health plans."" Helen Hare, spokeswoman for the Democrats on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, told us this language cut out Profamilias, the Puerto Rican branch of Planned Parenthood. ""They are a key provider of women’s health care in Puerto Rico, and women would not be able to get the kind of care they need to protect themselves,"" Hare told us. This is about more than abortion services, Democrats say. Zika can be transmitted through sex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, ""Condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika from sex if used correctly from start to finish."" Hare said Profamilias served 8,000 people in 2015. Republicans counter that the bill would have funded many health clinics and women would not be denied care. Jennifer Hing, spokeswoman for Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee, told us that even though Profamilias would be ineligible, the money could go to clinics across the island. There’s no debate that the limits applied to Profamilias. So the central question is, would that restriction make much of a difference? There are two ways to sort this out. You can look at where clinics are located and you can look at if they serve different types of women. Mapping health care Many Puerto Ricans live in rural areas and struggle to get by on very modest incomes. Martin Kramer with the Health and Human Services Department’s Health Resources and Services Administration told us that the island territory has 20 community health centers operating at 84 sites. HHS sent them $5 million in April to fight Zika. ""That money was for contraceptive services, community education and to hire new staff,"" Kramer said. Thanks to the Primary Care Association of Puerto Rico, there’s a map of where those clinics are.  According to HHS, that network provides contraceptive services to more than 16,600 women each year. The map shows the municipal boundaries that serve as Puerto Rico’s counties. We went to the HHS Data Portal and a list of clinics in the public health insurance plan to add in hospitals and public health clinics. Out of a bit under 20 municipalities not served by the community health clinics, we found about eight that lacked any facility that we could identify. What’s important to note is that everywhere Profamilias lists a clinic -- Arecibo, Caguas, Carolina, Isabela, Moca, Ponce and San Juan -- has another type of facility that would have been eligible for additional funding to combat the spread of Zika. Profamilias clientele One expert we spoke with said that while Puerto Ricans may have had access to another clinic, Profamilias serves a specific type of client. ""The Planned Parenthood-style clinic tends to serve very young, very poor women,"" said Peter Shin, an associate professor in public health at George Washington University. Shin has studied health services in Puerto Rico. ""It takes a different set of tactics to reach the teenage or young adult women,"" Shin said. Shin said these clinics generally do better at connecting with women who are more at risk at having unprotected sex. In addition, because poverty and Zika often go hand in hand, these women are more at risk because they are poor. Our ruling Nelson, along with many other Democrats, said the Zika funding bill would limit access to family planning and contraceptives that would help stop the spread of the Zika virus. The legislation would have blocked the flow of money to one organization, Profamilias, the Planned Parenthood chapter in Puerto Rico. However, the bill also provided funds that would potentially help clinics and hospitals in nearly every municipality on the island.

Donald Trump exaggerates Hillary Clinton's role in growing trade deficit with China
","Donald Trump blames Hillary Clinton for the United States getting beaten by China on trade. ""Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs,"" he tweeted on June 21, 2016. He said something similar during a speech the following day -- that ""our trade deficit with China soared 40 percent during Hillary Clinton’s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned."" To analyze Trump’s assertion, we looked at two key questions. First, did the trade deficit with China go up by 40 percent during President Barack Obama’s first term -- the period when Clinton was serving as secretary of state? And second, given how directly Trump blamed Clinton, how much responsibility does she have for the rising trade deficit? We found that Trump’s 40-percent figure is somewhat valid, though it depends on when you start the clock running. Where he goes wrong is saying that it’s Clinton’s fault. Did the trade deficit with China go up by 40 percent during Obama’s first term? The trade deficit with China did go up during Obama’s first term, and one can argue that the increase was as high as 40 percent. Here are recent statistics for the trade deficit with China as compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service:    The rise between 2008, the last year before Obama took office, and 2012, the final year of his first term, amounted to 18.4 percent, which is less than half as big as Trump said. Looking instead at the period 2009 through 2013 does produce a 40 percent increase, however, and that’s in line with what Trump said. It’s worth noting that this time frame uses 2009 as the baseline year. That was the worst point of the recession, which means that the baseline that year was artificially low. Incidentally, the evidence for the loss of ""millions of jobs"" is somewhat mixed. The strongest support comes from an Economic Policy Institute study that found that between 2001 and 2013, the trade deficit with China ""eliminated or displaced 3.2 million U.S. jobs,"" of which 2.4 million were in manufacturing. But it’s worth noting that the Economic Policy Institute is a think tank with backing from labor unions, which are often skeptical of free-trade policies. Other analysts who take a more free-market orientation, such as the conservative American Enterprise Institute, argue that the connection between trade deficits and job losses is much less direct than the Economic Policy Institute study suggests. All told, Trump’s 40 percent figure is credible, though it’s important to note that the number is somewhat cherry-picked. How much responsibility does Clinton have for the rising trade deficit? The support for this part of Trump’s tweet is weaker. First off, the State Department has a voice in trade policy, but it is not the most important one. ""The secretary of state is only slightly involved with trade policy,"" said Joel P. Trachtman, a professor of international law at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. ""Trade policy is set at the presidential level, and the U.S. Trade Representative’s office otherwise has the greatest role in negotiations and agenda setting. So, among U.S. government officials, the secretary of state has a minor effect."" Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, agreed. ""The secretary of state has little if any influence over trade deficits,"" he said. But what if Trump was saying that Clinton was part of the Obama administration, and that Obama is to blame for China’s growing trade deficit? That’s not the case, either. For starters, the trend lines go back long before Obama took office. ""The United States has been running a trade deficit since 1996, with the big drop coming after the bursting of the ‘tech bubble’ in 2001 under George W. Bush,"" said Timothy J. Sturgeon, a senior researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Industrial Performance Center. The statement, he said, ""is extremely misleading."" Indeed, broader economic forces -- more so than an administration’s policy decisions -- tend to determine the size of trade deficits, experts said. ""Trade deficits are the product of three macro forces over which the secretary of state has no control -- the trade-weighted dollar exchange rate; the state of the world economy outside the United States; and the state of the U.S. economy,"" Hufbauer said. Other trends also complicate an easy assignment of ""blame"" for trade deficits with China, experts added. Martin Baily, a Brookings Institution economist, previously told us that some manufacturing job losses stem from trade, but not all. ""Part of what has happened is that there has been consolidation in the industry to take advantage of larger scale production,"" Baily said. ""Manufacturing is changing because of technology and trade, and that inevitably will lead to plant closures."" Alternately, economists Robert Z. Lawrence and  Lawrence Edwards have written in the Harvard Business Review that a lack of demand led to manufacturing job losses. American factories grew to be too efficient, and therefore needed fewer workers to meet the needs of consumers, they argued. Finally, as we saw earlier with the data quirks around 2009, the Great Recession likely played a role in how the deficit grew during Obama’s first term. ""This economic expansion would be expected to expand imports more than exports would expand, and thus the trade deficit would be expected to widen, holding other things constant,"" Lawrence J. White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. ""This surely is the overwhelming reason for any expansion of the the U.S.-China trade deficit during this period."" Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs."" Trump is largely accurate about the 40 percent bump, though that number is somewhat cherry-picked, and he has a point that some -- though not all -- estimates suggest that trade with China has resulted in millions of job losses. However, Trump’s strong words of blame for Clinton overplays the role she had in this process. Not only do other administration players have a bigger role in setting trade policy, but the growth in the trade deficit predates the Obama administration and has a lot to do with factors that any administration would have little control over.

Hillary Clinton wrongly places full blame for NC teacher salaries on Republican leaders
","In a speech in Raleigh on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton laid out her plan for improving the economy and reducing income inequality. But she segued into local politics, too, seeking to boost the campaigns of North Carolina Democrats like Roy Cooper, who is running for governor against Republican incumbent Pat McCrory. Teacher pay was her weapon of choice for hitting the state’s Republican leaders. Clinton was introduced at her rally by a Durham teacher and by former Gov. Jim Hunt, a Democrat known for his education initiatives. ""You know, for many years, thanks to people and leaders like Jim Hunt, North Carolina was a leading state when it came to education,"" Clinton said. ""Now, unfortunately, thanks to your governor and the legislature, the average teacher salary can barely support a family."" There are two things here that made our ears perk up. Can the average teacher ""barely support a family"" on his or her salary? And if not, is it the fault of McCrory and the state’s Republican-controlled legislature? How much teachers make The average North Carolina public school teacher made $47,819 in 2014-15 according to the National Education Association, an advocacy group. Both the NEA and the N.C. Department of Public Instruction have estimated the average teacher this school year is making just shy of $48,000. That’s the equivalent of slightly more than $23 per hour when adjusted to 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year. That’s not the schedule teachers work, but we’ll use it for the sake of comparison since it’s what most people are familiar with. North Carolina’s cost of living What does it mean to be barely able to support a family? Clinton’s campaign didn’t respond on the record, but there are a few ways of looking at it. The average teacher’s salary is more than triple the minimum wage. It’s also enough to keep a family of nine out of poverty. For a more traditional family of four, it’s about double the poverty level. But the government’s poverty guidelines have faced criticism for being outdated and/or inaccurate. So what about other ways of measuring ways to support a family? MIT professor Amy Glasmeier created something called the Living Wage Calculator. It takes local-level data on taxes, rent, transportation, food, child care and other costs into account. The formula also assumes non-working adults are providing full-time child care. Glasmeier has written that it shows ""the minimum level of income required for individuals and families to pay for basic living expenses"" – a pretty good approximation of what Clinton was talking about. A single parent making the average teacher’s salary could support one child but would struggle to support two children, according to the living wage calculations. Likewise, if the teacher is married with a child, an average salary could easily support the child and a stay-at-home spouse. The salary would still be considered a living wage even if that couple had a second child – here it gets to the level of barely enough – but not if they had a third child and the spouse remained unemployed. But we didn’t want to just take a calculator’s word for it. So we asked a professor who studies poverty and politics, Duke University’s Anirudh Krishna. He agreed that a teacher’s salary can provide for a family’s basic needs but not much more. ""An annual salary of $48,000 is less than what typically makes for significant intergenerational upward mobility,"" Krishna said. ""Rents or mortgages usually make up for half of that amount, and food and fuel account for much of the rest, leaving relatively little for a rainy day, far less for a child’s college education."" So this part of Clinton’s claim could be accurate or not, depending on how big the family in question is and what you consider to be barely supporting that family – whether it’s simply keeping the children out of poverty or being able to do more. But is Clinton right to pin the blame on Republicans for not giving teachers even higher salaries? Political blame Since 2010, the average teacher has earned right around the state’s median household income. Republicans took control of the state legislature in January 2011. In most states, teachers make more. North Carolina is one of the 10 lowest-paying states for teachers, and inflation-adjusted salaries have dropped 10.2 percent in the last decade, according to the NEA. Only three states saw teachers’ salaries fall by more between 2004-05 and 2014-15. Who is responsible? Both political parties have seen teacher pay rise and fall under their watch in the last decade, although Democrats were in power most of that time. Under Democratic Gov. Mike Easley average teacher pay grew by thousands of dollars, to $48,454 in 2008-09, his last year in office. Then the Great Recession happened and in 2009-10, Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue ordered a pay cut for state employees and teachers. That cut was approved by a Democrat-led legislature, and average teacher pay continued to fall every year under Perdue. Republicans were in charge of the statehouse the last two years of Perdue’s term. Both years, Perdue vetoed the budget and said more money should’ve been spent on education, but to no avail. Average teacher pay continued dropping after she left office. It reached its lowest point in McCrory’s first budget – the third year of GOP legislative control – when it dipped below $45,000 to 47th in the nation in 2013-14. But since then, teacher pay has been rising. It’s still not yet back to pre-recession levels, but it could be next year. The House, Senate and McCrory’s office have all said teachers ought to earn more than $50,000 on average in 2016-17. Our ruling Clinton said the average North Carolina teacher’s salary ""can barely support a family"" and placed the blame squarely on Gov. Pat McCrory and Republican legislators. The average teacher salary of just less than $48,000 is higher than what most households around the state make per year. Yet it’s also right around what’s considered the bare minimum ""living wage"" for a couple with two kids. Clinton, however, muddles the political blame. Average teacher pay did hit its lowest point when Republicans controlled both the governor’s office and General Assembly. Yet the only actual salary cuts happened under Democratic control. And more recently, Republicans have raised teacher pay almost back to pre-recession levels.

Trump wrongly says Clinton filibustered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac legislation
","Responsibility for the 2008 housing crisis is at stake in a new attack launched by Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton. ""Hillary Clinton filibustered legislation to reform Fannie and Freddie Mae – institutions at the center of the Great Recession – which have been funneling hundreds of thousands to Hillary Clinton's campaign and Foundation,"" a statement from the Trump campaign said on June 21. Republican changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac regulation never faced a cloture vote, the most clear-cut procedural sign that a filibuster has occurred. (The statement calls mistakenly calls them Fannie and Freddie Mae). Without a cloture vote, the question of whether the bill was filibustered becomes ""a gray area,"" according to one expert in congressional use of the filibuster. If a filibuster did occur, it's even harder to say that Clinton was responsible. Trump’s statement presumably refers to a Republican-backed attempt in 2005 to bolster regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two huge government-backed mortgage finance companies. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but the statement itself cited a CNBC opinion piece. The Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 passed out of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on a party line vote. It was never brought before the full Senate. After the mortgage collapse revealed the vulnerability of America’s housing market, some pointed to the bill as evidence of Republican foresight and Democratic obstruction. Experts disagree on the role Fannie and Freddie played in causing the financial crisis, but they certainly experienced its results: billions were spent bailing out the companies. Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska introduced the bill, and every committee Republican voted to move it out of committee. The question, then, is why Republican leadership did not introduce it on the floor of the full Senate, where they also had a majority. One possibility is that they suspected that Senate Democrats, including Clinton, would oppose the bill as a bloc, as the Democrats on the committee had done. Democrats had enough votes to sustain a successful filibuster if they had wanted to, and the then-Senate minority leader Harry Reid expressed his opposition when the bill passed out of committee. Experts are divided on whether even an explicit threat of a filibuster by the majority should be counted as a use of the filibuster power. The only mention of a filibuster in contemporary coverage of the bill’s progress is a quote from Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut. ""The word ‘filibuster’ is nowhere near the horizon,"" Dodd, a leading opponent of the bill, told reporters after the bill passed out of committee. Democratic and Republican senators both expressed optimism that a compromise version of the bill would go forward. Some accounts of the bill’s progress suggest that Dodd later blocked the bill by telling Sen. Richard Shelby, the head of the committee that passed the bill, that he planned to filibuster it. Democratic opposition was more widely expressed, but some Republican senators may have been reluctant as well. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lobbied some Republican senators to oppose the bill, the Associated Press reported. Without a vote or a public statement, it is impossible to see where individual senators who did not vote on the bill in committee, like Clinton, stood on the issue. Clinton never voted or publicly took a position on the bill. In contemporary reporting about the bill’s progress, her name is not mentioned. Three political scientists we spoke to had different standards for determining when a filibuster occurred, but all agreed that without specific evidence that she took some action to block it, it did not make sense to say Clinton filibustered the bill. ""In the absence of clear evidence, I’m not sure how you ascribe it to Hillary Clinton or any other Democrat,"" Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said. Clinton’s campaigns and the Clinton Foundation have both taken large donations from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s employees and an associated Political Action Committee. In 2008, Clinton was the fourth highest recipient of donations from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s employees and PACs. Our ruling In an attempt to assign responsibility for the financial crisis to Clinton, Trump’s campaign accused her of filibustering legislation that would have changed how two government-backed mortgage giants were regulated. Republican leadership chose not to bring the bill before the whole Senate after it passed out of committee. It is possible that they thought Democratic senators would filibuster, but based on the evidence available, we found no evidence that Clinton herself took any action in relation to the bill.
