Most people released by immigration authorities do attend their court hearings
","In a hearing over the Department of Homeland Security’s budget, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., asked Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about DHS’s capacity to detain immigrants entering the country illegally at the southern border.  Mayorkas said detention capacity is limited, but authorities hold certain people if there is a belief that they will not show up to their court hearings. Lankford replied: ""You say detention is used when you’re not sure if they’re going to show up for hearings. The vast majority of individuals that we’re releasing out are not showing up for hearings."" Mayorkas pushed back, saying he ""would respectfully disagree"" with Lankford because ""the data evidence is that the majority of people show up for their hearings."" We reached out to Lankford’s office — and to DHS — for their respective data but did not hear back. We also sought information from the Executive Office for Immigration Review within the Department of Justice but did not get a response. That office is responsible for adjudicating the immigration cases of people placed in deportation proceedings. Debate on whether immigrants show up to their hearings is not new. The ways of measuring this number vary, but regardless of the metric, the numbers show a majority of immigrants do show up to their hearings.  Immigrants apprehended at U.S. borders receive from DHS a Notice to Appear, a charging document that explains why the U.S. government seeks to deport them. Immigrants who receive a Notice to Appear are either placed in detention or released. Due to limited detention space, immigration authorities generally release people they believe don’t pose a threat to public safety and are likely to show up to their court hearings.  People who are released can travel to their final destination in the U.S. while they await their hearings, according to Jessica Bolter, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.  During their first hearing, immigrants can tell a judge whether they will contest removal and seek a form of relief, like asylum. It can take years and multiple hearings before a person gets a final decision. If an immigrant fails to show up to any hearing, the immigration judge can issue what is known as an in absentia removal order. This means the immigrant is ordered to be deported without being present in court. For the most part, in absentia cases occur with non-detained immigrants because DHS is responsible for ensuring detained immigrants show up to all their hearings.  The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review publishes immigration court data, including what’s known as the ""in absentia rate."" To get this number per fiscal year, the government divides the number of in absentia cases by the total number of cases completed that year.  The in absentia rate for fiscal year 2021 was 10%; for the first quarter of 2022, October to December 2021, it was 18%. Court closures due to COVID-19 meant some hearings were postponed. Because non-detained immigrants weren’t scheduled to show up to court, the in absentia rate went down from 2020 to 2021. ""It’s true that data show that the majority of people show up for their hearings,"" Bolter told PolitiFact via email. ""And even more do so when they are represented.""  Overall, the government data do not support Lankford’s claim that ""the vast majority"" of people released from immigration custody ""are not showing up for hearings."" The way that the Justice Department’s office calculates the in absentia rate does not take into account cases that are pending completion or administrative closure cases, where immigration judges move non-priority cases to the court’s inactive docket indefinitely. Some experts say that leaving these cases out of the calculation leads to a higher in absentia rate that can be misleading. That’s because in absentia cases are completed faster than cases in which an immigrant shows up to multiple hearings, according to Bolter.  An immigrant might show up to multiple hearings in a year, but if the case is not completed during that year, they will not be included in the in absentia rate calculation. On the other hand, if an immigrant doesn’t show up to one hearing that case could be quickly completed with an in absentia removal order, which would be included in the rate as a no-show. Cases are now taking even longer to complete due to the increasing backlog, now at 1.6 million cases. As the backlog grows, cases stay pending for longer. A 2020 study by the University of Pennsylvania measured the in absentia rate taking into consideration administrative closures and pending cases. Under either of these scenarios, the rate of immigrants who showed up to court still outweighed those who did not.  Between 2008 and 2018, about 66% to 83% of immigrants released from custody attended their court hearings, according to the study. Andrew Arthur at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low immigration levels, disputed the study’s ways of calculating the in absentia rate. These methods inflate the denominator by including administrative closures and pending cases, he said, making the in absentia rate appear lower.  ""At best, calculating in absentia rates is an art, not a science,"" Arthur said. ""Because of course, it's always going to be a moving target.""  Lankford said ""the vast majority of individuals that we’re releasing out are not showing up for hearings."" There are different ways to track how many immigrants don’t show up to immigration court hearings, and all indicate that a majority of immigrants, including those who are not detained, do attend their hearings. Data from the Justice Department show that in fiscal year 2021 and during the first quarter of 2022, most immigrants attended their hearings. We rate Lankford’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F890C0>],/factchecks/2022/may/17/james-lankford/most-people-released-immigration-authorities-do-at/

Ordering baby formula from Amazon in Canada has catches
","Many American parents feel desperate to secure baby formula for their infants amid a nationwide shortage, but online ordering advice that’s spreading on Facebook isn’t the quick fix it seems.  ""TO ALL THE MOMS THAT CAN’T FIND BABY FORMULA,"" one Facebook post said. ""Go to Amazon… go to the bottom … change from U.S. to Canada. You can get all the formula you need. They are not having a shortage just the U.S. is. Have it shipped to your front door.""   ""TikTok Hack,"" said another post. ""Supposedly if you go on Amazon and change over to Canada you can order baby formula, no shortage.""  These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Associated Press reported May 16 that the formula shortage in the United States is starting to affect some Canadian stores, but the country isn’t nearly as affected as its neighbor to the south.   However, changing your preferred country/region from the United States to Canada on Amazon’s website isn’t a loophole for American residents to tap into Canadian stock.  U.S.-based Amazon customers aren’t able to buy baby formula from Amazon.ca if it’s sold and shipped by Amazon or sold by third-party sellers and shipped by Amazon, according to the company.  ""We know these products are of great importance to parents and caregivers and are working closely with our selling partners to get them back in stock as quickly as possible,"" an Amazon spokesperson said.  Third-party sellers on Amazon can ship their own products across the border, but as Snopes noted, it comes at a cost. When a Snopes reporter tried to purchase baby formula from a third-party seller, the quoted shipping price was $35.  After a U.S.-based PolitiFact reporter changed their preferred region to Canada on Amazon’s website and went through the steps to try to order a few in-stock formulas in Canada from third-party sellers, the reporter was met with an apologetic message from Amazon: ""Sorry, this item can’t be shipped to your selected address."" Jenifer Lightdale, a pediatric gastroenterologist at UMass Memorial Children’s Medical Center, told KHOU in Houston that she doesn’t recommend parents import formula from other countries. ""You might think you’re buying it from Canada, but somebody’s giving flour in a can,"" she said. ""You don’t really know who you’re buying it from.""  Some Facebook posts claim Americans can order baby formula from Canada on Amazon and have it shipped to U.S. addresses if customers change their preferred country from the U.S. to Canada on the Amazon website.  That’s not quite right; these posts ignore critical facts that leave desperate parents with a misleading impression.  Formula sold and shipped by Amazon, and formula sold by third-party sellers and shipped by Amazon, aren’t crossing the border to a U.S. address, no matter how you change your settings.  But there’s an element of truth here: Third-party sellers who do their own shipping can send orders across the border.

Local TV error leads spurs Buffalo shooting ‘crisis actor’ conspiracy theory
","One day after a shooter opened fire on a Tops supermarket in Buffalo, New York, a local news station based in Orlando, Florida, ran a report from the scene of the massacre.  The segment that WKMG-TV ran was a package shared from a partner affiliate in Houston, KPRC-TV, featuring a report that KPRC reporter Brandon Walker filmed from Buffalo.  ""Good evening to you from Buffalo, the northeast side of town,"" Walker said in the May 15 report as he stood outside the supermarket, yellow police tape still stretched behind him.  ""Tonight, as FBI investigators continue to process the scene inside Tops Friendly Market, community members reflect on how they feel,"" Walker said. ""There's a lot of sadness, a lot of anger, too, over the racism they say fueled 18-year-old Payton Gendron’s actions."" The problem: Walker was wrongly introduced by WKMG anchor Erik von Ancken as ""Walker Graham,"" and the chyron at the bottom of the screen identified him the same way. In a statement to PolitiFact, WKMG’s assignment desk said the script the station received from KPRC listed Walker’s name as ""Walker Graham,"" and the error was carried over onto the air. At the end of his report, Walker signed off by saying, ""I’m Brandon Walker."" But across social media, the mixup was a sign of something more nefarious, a conspiracy in which Walker was playing the role of a reporter as a ""crisis actor"" on the set of a staged attack. The ""crisis actor"" claims started with a tweet that put a photo of Walker’s report for WKMG, in which he’s listed as ""Walker Graham,"" next to a report he did for KPRC under the correct name. ""So he just got two different names depending on the news station?"" said the May 16 tweet. ""One day people, one day you’ll realize why people like me question EVERYTHING."" Screenshots of the tweet quickly spread to Instagram and Facebook, where they were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  ""Let’s give a warm welcome to the latest crisis actor in the Buffalo show!"" one Instagram post said.

Among the people pushing the false ""crisis actor"" claim was Lauren Witzke, the far-right GOP nominee for a 2020 U.S. Senate seat from Delaware, who has promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory. ""New Buffalo crisis actor just dropped,"" Witzke said in posts on Telegram and Instagram.  PolitiFact previously debunked a Pants on Fire claim that Gendron, who was charged for the shooting, was a ""crisis actor."" There is no evidence that the attack was staged or a ""false flag."" There were multiple witnesses, and the shooter live streamed the assault. This claim about Walker is also baseless. ""This is a real reporter,"" WKMG’s assignment desk said in its statement to PolitiFact. Walker has worked for KPRC since 2015, according to his bio on the KPRC website. In a reply to the original tweet that set off the ""crisis actor"" conspiracy theory, Walker wrote: ""Seems my colleagues at a sister station don’t know my name. Brandon Walker, it is. I work for a station in Houston, KPRC2; however, I’ve filed reports for our sister stations in other cities."" Walker and KPRC did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.  Another Houston-area journalist tweeted that KPRC and WKMG both are owned by Graham Media Group, a broadcasting company, which might have prompted the ""Walker Graham"" error.

Baby formula donations to Ukraine not linked to U.S. shortage
","The U.S. shortage of baby formula has several causes — from supply chain problems to formula recalls — but charitable giving is not among them, despite social media claims. A May 12 post on Facebook suggests that donations of baby formula to Ukraine are related to the current shortage. The post shows side-by-side screenshots of two news headlines. One is dated March 7, 2022, and says, ""Operation Ukraine boxes baby formula to send overseas,"" and the other, dated May 12, 2022, says, ""Baby formula shortage hits parts of the U.S."" The dates are circled on each story. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence the donated baby formula contributed to U.S. shortages, which are attributed to supply chain problems that began during the COVID-19 pandemic, plus the recall of some formula that led to a manufacturing plant shutdown. The headline about Operation Ukraine is a reference to a 22-year-old Columbus, Miss., nonprofit that gathered $10,000 worth of baby formula to ship to Ukraine in March, a Mississipipi television station reported. One 21-ounce can of Enfamil formula costs around $30, so $10,000 would purchase about 333 cans — not nearly enough to have an effect on the nationwide shortage. Causes of the U.S. shortage are described by Bloomberg as ""​​long-term economic pressures collid(ing) with a sudden supply shock."" The long-term issues are related to the pandemic, which led to supply chain and shipping disruptions, as well as labor shortages. And the supply shock, Bloomberg explained, came when Abbott Laboratories recalled its baby formula and shut down a Michigan manufacturing plant because of concerns about contamination. The claim that donations of baby formula to Ukraine are related to the current U.S. shortage is unfounded. We rate it False.

Nancy Pelosi repeats outdated economic theory on link between unemployment, inflation
","Most Americans are experiencing the highest rate of inflation in years, so it was no surprise that George Stephanopoulos, the host of ABC’s ""This Week,"" brought up the year-long rise in consumer prices during an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pelosi answered by citing several thorny factors pushing prices upward, including coronavirus-related supply chain problems and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, both of which the U.S. government has limited leverage to control. ""What causes inflation?"" Pelosi said on May 15. ""One is when unemployment goes down, inflation goes up. That's not anything to accept. When wages go up, inflation goes up. That's one. When supply goes down, cost goes up. So supply is affected by COVID and supply chain problems that we have because of COVID, and also because of the war in Ukraine. There is a Putin price hike at the pump. Not all of it to him, but a large part of it."" One part of Pelosi’s comments caught our attention — that ""when unemployment goes down, inflation goes up."" That seemed at odds with economic data of recent years, when unemployment was quite low, but so was inflation. Economists told PolitiFact that Pelosi’s formulation was once widely accepted in the field, but it has taken many hits over the past few decades. The inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation was first noted by economist A. W. Phillips in 1958. ""He reasoned that when unemployment is high, workers are easy to find, so employers hardly raise wages, if they do so at all,"" economist N. Gregory Mankiw wrote in 2019. ""But when unemployment is low, employers have trouble attracting workers, so they raise wages faster. Inflation in wages soon turns into inflation in the prices of goods and services."" Two economists who later won Nobel Prizes, Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow, found a similar pattern. The theory, which came to be known as the Phillips curve, played an important role in economic policymaking during the 1960s and 1970s. Economists told PolitiFact that there can still be some linkage between high unemployment and low inflation (and vice versa). But this correlation can be negated by a variety of factors — factors that have been present in the economy since at least the 1990s. Consider a comparison of the rates of inflation and unemployment from 2012 to the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Inflation ran in a pretty narrow range during that period, from effectively zero to 2.9%. Yet, over the same time span, unemployment ranged from 8.3% (a level rarely reached going back to 1950) all the way down to 3.5% (close to a record low).   It’s not that the factors creating the Phillips curve are dead, economists say. Rather, they’ve been drowned out by other, more powerful factors. All things being equal, said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless, low unemployment will boost workers’ wages, which in turn will increase producers’ costs and spur inflation. But, he added, ""all things are often not equal."" Unusual, and possibly transitory, factors can mess with the clean linkages embodied in the Phillips curve, he said. For instance, the theory’s inability to explain the U.S. economy since the 1990s may have been because of strong growth in productivity, Burtless said. Productivity gains enabled workers’ wages to grow even as overall costs for employers remained low. This produced the combination of relatively low unemployment and relatively low inflation. Intensifying globalization, which put competitive pressure on U.S. producers to keep price increases small, may also have played a role. The linkage between unemployment and inflation ""appeared to be missing in action during much of this period,"" Burtless said. Today, one of the primary assumptions that undergirded the Phillips curve — a steady supply of goods — has vanished, because of the supply-chain issues spawned by the coronavirus pandemic. In turn, the supply chain backup has been only exacerbated by Putin’s invasion, which has spiked prices for oil and other commodities. ""Many economists would think of the war in Ukraine as a classic supply shock,"" said Emi Nakamura, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. The combination of supply chain concerns and the war in Ukraine has produced significant inflation in the United States for the first time in decades. During the past year, inflation has run between 5% and 8.5%. Superficially, this could be attributed to the low unemployment rate, but this would be simplistic: It wouldn’t explain why similarly low unemployment rates before the pandemic never produced inflation higher than 2.9%. Pelosi’s office said she wasn’t trying to be overly reductive in her comments. ""Acknowledging low unemployment as a factor among others isn’t the same as saying the Phillips curve is destiny,"" said Henry Connelly, a Pelosi spokesperson. He added that Pelosi ""has never agreed with those who believe that low unemployment is dangerous or that keeping millions of Americans out of work and out of a paycheck as a response to inflation makes any moral or economic sense."" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank, said he empathizes with Pelosi. ""For a layperson to get this wrong, I don’t find that supershocking,"" he said. ""I don’t mean that as a wisecrack. If you grew up in a certain era, this was the received wisdom."" Pelosi said, ""When unemployment goes down, inflation goes up."" For years, economists believed in this relationship, and there is still an element of truth to it. However, several decades of real-world experience has shown that the relationship between unemployment and inflation is not all that precise, because other factors — including supply shocks, productivity improvements and globalization — have often overwhelmed the effects between the two.  We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9E980>],/factchecks/2022/may/17/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-repeats-outdated-economic-theory-link/

Senate hopeful Kathy Barnette criticized Trump until he won 2016 nomination, then became a supporter
","Just before Pennsylvania Republicans choose their Senate nominee, surprise contender Kathy Barnette was attacked by a super PAC that supports Dr. Mehmet Oz, the candidate endorsed by former President Donald Trump.  ""Don’t trust phony Kathy Barnette,"" says the narrator in a TV ad from Our American Century. ""Barnette pretends she’s America First, but repeatedly attacked President Trump.""  Barnette, who vaulted to the top tier of candidates days before the May 17 primary, criticized Trump during his run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.  But after he won the nomination, she pivoted, became a Trump supporter and has campaigned on a platform similar to Trump’s ""America First"" in style. We did not reach Our American Century, a conservative PAC based in McLean, Virginia, that provides no contact information on its website. We received no replies to emails we sent to addresses listed on the organization statement the group filed with the Federal Election Commission. The group’s ad backed up its claim against Barnette by citing excerpts from a May 11, 2022, article on Breitbart, a conservative website.  In four Twitter posts from September 2015, Barnette called Trump’s debate performance ""horrid,"" said he would not be a good president, called him liberal"" and said his moral character is ""questionable."" ""Did u c d last Presidential Debate. #Trump2016 was horrid."" — tweet ""#Trump2016 is good 4 beers & barbeque. BUT, not as President.""  — tweet  #Trump2016 is JUST AS LIBERAL as d leaders we currently hv n office. #MoralityMatters & Trump does not rank high in it…"" — tweet ""#Trump2016 moral character is questionable!"" — tweet The article also noted that Barnette wrote in her 2020 book, ""Nothing to Lose, Everything to Gain: Being Black and Conservative in America,"" that Trump was her least favorite Republican presidential candidate in 2016. ""Out of 16 presidential candidates, Donald Trump was no. 16 on my preferred list,"" she wrote.  Much of Barnette’s book, however, praises Trump. Barnette wrote that historically low Black unemployment was the result of Trump’s ""proactive support for Black communities."" She said he enacted prison reform, revitalized urban areas, and forgave loans to four historically Black colleges and universities. Trump is ""an extraordinary man with amazing stamina and broad shoulders capable of carrying the weight of his office,"" she wrote. Barnette’s campaign website includes a page that has a video in which Barnette says she is on her way to vote for Trump in the 2016 general election, and a 2017 tweet in which she writes about why she supports him.  Barnette’s campaign also cited to PolitiFact that page and her book. Barnette’s support for Trump also includes participating in the Jan. 6, 2021, protest at the Capitol that turned into an insurrection.  A week earlier, Barnette posted a video saying she was organizing buses to travel to Washington, D.C., for the protest.  On April 27, 2022, Barnette told a Philadelphia TV station that she attended the protest but did not enter the Capitol. Asked if the 2020 election was stolen, she said: ""I do have concerns. I believe there are legitimate concerns about what took place during the election of 2020."" On May 16, 2022, NBC News published photos of Barnette marching toward the Capitol alongside members of the far-right extremist Proud Boys group who were later arrested and indicted for breaking into the building and attacking officers. Barnette’s campaign responded by saying Barnette ""was in D.C. to support President Trump and demand election accountability."" Barnette, who ran for a U.S. House seat in Pennsylvania in 2020, has been put in an awkward position by Trump’s endorsement of Oz and his doubling-down by saying that she can’t win the general election.  ""I lost by 19 points, Donald Trump lost by more than 26 points,"" Barnette said May 16 in her final campaign appearance, comparing her 2020 performance in the district with Trump’s margin there, The New York Times reported. ""Who’s less electable with those numbers?"" The Pennsylvania race is for the seat held by Republican Pat Toomey, who was first elected in 2010 and decided not to seek re-election.  Besides Barnette and Oz, polls show the other major contender for the GOP nomination is former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick.  The Nov. 8 general election race is rated as a toss-up and as ""tilts Republican."" The outcome could help determine which party controls the Senate, now split 50-50. The Our American Century super PAC said Barnette ""pretends she's America First, but repeatedly attacked President Trump."" Barnette attacked Trump during his run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, but she became a supporter after he won the nomination.

Re-crossings at the border not the only factor in ongoing border crisis
","Title 42 has become a hot topic, as the number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border has risen.  The policy was enacted in 2020 under President Donald Trump in hopes of stopping the spread of COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic by sending people immediately back to their home countries. The policy was to be lifted at the end of May 2022, but now faces uncertainty, including the prospect of legal challenges and a push from Republicans who want President Joe Biden to keep the controversial immigration program in place to stem a surge at the border.  Tom Nelson, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Wisconsin, weighed in with an alternative view — that Title 42 is a cause of the crisis, not a solution for it.
  ""Title 42 has fueled the border crisis,"" he said on April 26, 2022. ""In 2019, 7 percent of illegal border crossings were repeated crossings. Today the rate is 27 percent.""  Is it true that the percentage of repeat crossings has nearly quadrupled, fueling the border  crisis?  Let’s take a closer look.  Title 42 stems from a 1944 public health law aimed at preventing the spread of communicable diseases, according to an April 7, 2022 article from Voice of America.  It allows border enforcement agencies to remove migrants crossing into the United States, including those in search of asylum. That part is important, because migrants who reach the U.S. ordinarily have the right to apply for asylum if they can cite a credible fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social class in their home country. In practice, once instituted by Trump, Title 42 allowed agents to send migrants who cross  the border back to Mexico within hours, or to another country of origin within a few days, without any immigration hearing process taking place.  Those crossing the border never faced legal consequences for crossing, which would typically disincentivize people from recrossing the border after being removed from the U.S.  So is Title 42 fueling the immigration crisis?  The Voice of America article noted that Title 42 created a ""significant increase"" in the number of repeat crossings, because people who were expelled simply tried to cross again.  When we asked Nelson’s team for backup for his claim, they shared testimony from an April 6, 2022 meeting of a U.S. House subcommittee focused on border security that made the same point. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior policy counsel for the American Immigration Council, testified that in fiscal year 2019, only 7% of people encountered at the border had previously crossed that year. But in the two years following the implementation of Title 42, that number jumped to 27%.  ""This is due in large part to the fact that under Title 42, individuals expelled back to Mexico are not subject to any collateral consequence,"" Reichlin-Melnick said. ""This lack of collateral consequences (other than the inherent risk of death in the journey), combined with the desperation and insecurity faced by people waiting at the border for the asylum process to restart, strongly incentivizes many migrants expelled under Title 42 to try again."" Collateral consequences for people crossing the border, he said later in his testimony, could include no opportunity to appeal immigration decisions, and no process to challenge a decision to expel someone from the U.S. after they cross the border.  Basically, because more people were being expelled from the U.S. without those consequences, they weren’t entered into Border Patrols databases, and therefore were free to try and cross again with no previously logged history.  The number of people being turned away since March 2020 supports that.  According to an April 27, 2022, report from the Pew Research Center, about 2.9 million encounters were logged between April 2020 and March 2022. Nearly 1.8 million of those encounters, or 61%, resulted in migrants being expelled from the U.S. under Title 42. The remaining 1.1 million were apprehended under an existing immigration policy at the border, allowing them to stay within the country under a claim of asylum and a requirement to attend immigration court. Most of the people who made it into the U.S. under asylum claims since March 2020 have been unaccompanied children and migrant families with children.  But just because the number of re-crossings are high doesn’t mean that is the only thing driving high numbers of people crossing the southern border. According to an April 28, 2020, New York Times article, the number of migrants crossing the border is growing. In March, more than 221,000 people crossed the border, the highest for a single month in decades.  Another New York Times article, published in October 2021, suggests the high number of crossings is likely being driven by the pandemic response in migrants’ home countries, natural disasters and a lack of jobs. So, although Title 42 may be prompting more repeat crossing attempts, inflating the numbers, there are still deeper, fundamental reasons for the surge at the border. Nelson claimed ""Title 42 has fueled the border crisis. In 2019, 7 percent of illegal border crossings were repeated crossings. Today the rate is 27 percent."" The numbers are on target, and repeated crossing attempts under Title 42 have undoubtedly increased, which inflates the numbers. The lack of repercussions means there is little incentive to not try again. However, more people are trying to come into the U.S. based on other reasons, typically related to their home country.  That leaves a claim that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.    ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E7E2C0>],/factchecks/2022/may/17/tom-nelson/re-crossings-border-not-only-factor-ongoing-border/

Factchecking Arizona’s Blake Masters’ claim of open borders and Democratic amnesty plans
","On the day that the murder of 10 people in Buffalo, New York, led to an online racist tract that spoke of people of color replacing white people, Arizona U.S. Senate Republican candidate Blake Masters tweeted his opposition to what he described as Democratic immigration policies. ""The Democrats want open borders so they can bring in and amnesty tens of millions of illegal aliens — that’s their electoral strategy,"" tweeted Masters May 14. The Democrats want open borders so they can bring in and amnesty **tens of millions** of illegal aliens — that’s their electoral strategy. Not on my watch. pic.twitter.com/t9NQmEmdzG Masters’ tweet included a clip from a May 10 interview on ""The Ben Shapiro Show."" Asked about immigration, Masters said the Biden administration and Democrats like seeing thousands of people coming to the border ""so that someday, they can amnesty these people, and make them voters."" This Republican talking point is common in the 2022 midterm elections. We have checked it before and found it inaccurate. We reached out to the Masters campaign and did not hear back. A COVID-19 policy invoked to allow border officials to quickly expel immigrants arriving at U.S. borders is scheduled to end May 23. Barring any change, immigrants may soon find it easier to request asylum and stay in the U.S. while their applications are pending. The impact on the number of people showing up at the border is difficult to predict. In some DHS scenarios, as many as 18,000 migrants a day might arrive at the southwest border, although one DHS official told Congress the number of migrants is expected to fall. But even after the pandemic policy is over, many migrants can be quickly turned back or enter a long winding process if they are placed in removal proceedings or apply for asylum or other immigration protections.  The term ""open border"" can be subjective, but controls at the southern border are significant. They include nearly 20,000 Border Patrol agents and surveillance systems that rely on motion detectors and blimps that scan for low-flying aircrafts. And there are hundreds of miles of fencing at the southwest border. ""There's no such thing as an open border,"" Terence Garrett, political science professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, told PolitiFact in April.  In Biden’s State of the Union Address, he talked about the importance of strengthening border controls.  ""If we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system. We can do both,"" Biden said March 1, 2022. ""At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  We’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers."" Republicans have called for additional efforts, but the measures in place are aimed at policing the border.  The process of becoming a U.S. citizen — and therefore earning the right to register to vote — can take years. ""First you have to get the right to stay as a legal resident,"" said Eduardo Gamarra, professor of Latin American studies at Florida International University. ""That can take three, five, maybe 10 years. Then you have to be a legal resident for five years before you can apply for citizenship. Then you have to wait more years after that."" During his interview with Shapiro, Masters spoke of Democrats ""someday"" granting amnesty to those who enter the country today. We can’t assess a prediction. But for the estimated 11 million immigrants who have been illegally in the U.S. for years, the latest Democratic proposal would put them on a path to citizenship that takes eight years. It’s unlikely that the proposal will get enough support in Congress to eventually become a law. Masters’ statement assumes that newly arriving immigrants will eventually seek U.S. citizenship; however, not all eligible lawful permanent residents apply for naturalization. He also assumes that Latino voters are firmly in the Democratic orbit. Some evidence backs that up, but several trends push the other way. In 2021, 56% of Latino voters identified as Democratic or leaning Democratic. On the other hand, Equis Research, a polling firm that focuses on Latino voters, found that Trump made gains in 2020, especially among voters in South Florida and south Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. In south Texas, for example, Democrats still won the Latino vote, but their margin went from 33 points in 2016 to 17 points in 2020. ""There is great diversity within the Hispanic voting bloc,"" the Equis Research report said. Gamarra said there’s another reason more Latino voters might not translate into more Democratic votes. Many have weak ties to either party. And as a group, turnout can be relatively low. ""Especially among Mexican Americans, they don't vote as reliably as others,"" Gamarra said. ""They might identify as Democrats, they may even register, but they don't show up."" In the last election, according to the Latino Data Project, the turnout for Latino voters was 54%, compared to 60% for Asian Americans, 63% for Black voters, and 71% for white voters. Masters said that to win more elections, ""Democrats want open borders so they can bring in and amnesty tens of millions of illegal aliens."" The rules, manpower and hardware at the southwest border might not satisfy Masters, but he exaggerates by saying the border is open. The process of becoming a U.S. citizen takes many years. And while current Hispanic voters lean Democratic, they have low turnout rates on Election Day. In the 2020 election, Republicans increased their share of Latino voters.

In a Sept. 4 email to PolitiFact, Disney World said it was not dismantling the castle in preparation for Dorian. As for the photo we found on Facebook, there’s evidence that it was digitally altered to make it look like a castle spire is being removed by a crane. Using a reverse image search, we found the exact same photo of Cinderella Castle published on Twitter in the lead-up to Hurricane Michael last year. We also found a very similar image published in a blog post in 2009 — but with the spire intact. The crane in the photo was reportedly being used to remove holiday lights. (Right, image from the blog DIS Unplugged. Left, the altered version.) Using FotoForensics, a visual analysis tool, we were able to isolate the manipulation. The tool results indicate that someone cloned part of the blue sky and placed it over part of the castle spire on the left-hand side. The right-hand spire appears to have been removed altogether.

No, Evers did not ‘cancel’ the sales tax holiday
","Back-to-school shopping was a smidge more expensive in Wisconsin this year. Wisconsin Republicans set up a sales tax holiday in 2018, giving consumers a pass for many categories of clothing, computers and school supplies. There was no such holiday in 2019. And since there’s change, there must be blame. In posts on Twitter and Facebook, the Wisconsin Assembly GOP pointed the finger at the state’s new Democratic governor. ""Last year, Republicans gave part of Wisconsin's budget surplus back to the taxpayers by instituting a sales tax holiday on some back-to-school items,"" the Aug. 27, 2019, posts said. ""You won't see that this year under Governor (Tony) Evers, despite the continued surplus."" A graphic accompanying the text stamped the word ""CANCELED"" across a description of the sales tax holiday categories.  The Twitter version of the post was retweeted by several Republican legislators, including Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna. So, did Evers really cancel the sales tax? Let’s start with the history. Gov. Scott Walker introduced a sales tax holiday in his budget for 2017, but GOP lawmakers voted to kill it. In 2018, lawmakers went through various versions of a sales tax holiday early in the year. The Assembly approved a bill in February that would have created a $50 million sales tax holiday on all goods under $100. But an amendment introduced in March by Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, limited the sales tax holiday to specific school-related categories. They included clothing and school supplies under $75 per item and computers under $750. That version passed both houses and was signed into law by Walker. It reduced the expected consumer savings (and, therefore, lost state revenue) to about $14 million, according to an estimate from the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It made Wisconsin one of 17 states with a sales tax holiday in 2018, according to the Tax Foundation, a pro-business think tank. But Republicans were explicitly clear that this was a one-time deal. The statutory language included a note that ""This subsection does not apply in 2019 or in any year thereafter."" And Walker’s veto message (which didn’t change the nature of the holiday) also noted the holiday ""will not recur in future years."" This year, Republicans — who still control the state Legislature — never proposed a sales tax holiday, noted Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback. ""Republicans specifically prevented the 2018 back-to-school holiday from being offered in 2019 and any year thereafter,"" she said in an email. ""If Republicans wanted to extend the 2018 back-to-school sales tax holiday, they would have had to pass legislation this year to do so."" RELATED: Republicans botch claim comparing tuition for immigrants, veterans RELATED: GOP blames Evers’ budget for potential property tax hike Adam King, director of social media for the Assembly Republican Caucus, pointed to an Evers quote as evidence supporting the post’s claim. ""Parents are going to be out there purchasing their kids' supplies whether they have an incentive or not,"" Evers said at a July 29, 2019, press conference. ""I just don’t think the incentive actually worked."" Said King: ""By making this statement, the governor effectively shut the door on any possibility that a tax holiday could be implemented this year."" But that timeline defies logic. If Republicans wanted a sales tax holiday, they would have introduced the measure months before that comment. Certainly before the Legislature passed the final version of the budget in late June. As a quick aside, Evers’ comment does appear to misconstrue the intent of the sales tax holiday — Republicans intended it as tax relief in the wake of a General Fund surplus, and his comment treated it as an economic incentive. A 2018 study from the Tax Foundation found sales tax holidays don’t promote economic growth, they just shift the timing of purchases. It called the holidays ""political gimmicks"" that ""distract policymakers and taxpayers from genuine, permanent tax relief."" But that doesn’t play into the veracity of this claim. Assembly Republicans said Evers ""canceled"" the 2019 sales tax holiday. You can’t cancel something that was expressly created as a one-time occurrence. Republicans could have introduced a new bill creating another sales tax holiday this year, but they didn’t. And Evers’ comments showing a lack of support for such a measure didn’t come until months after Republicans would have needed to broach the subject.

"['Health Care', 'North Carolina', 'Dan McCready']","
In N.C. congressional race, McCready says Bishop was lone vote against pharmacy bill
","All eyes are on North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, where candidates are trading accusations about health care in the final days before a Sept. 10 special election. At a WBTV debate Aug. 28, Democrat Dan McCready accused Republican state Sen. Dan Bishop of voting against a bill that would allow pharmacists to inform people about cheaper alternative drugs. ""He took the only vote from either party — the only vote — against pharmacists being able to tell people about lower-cost drugs,"" McCready said. It’s a claim McCready has repeated throughout the race on social media and in an attack ad. He’s talking about The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act, which banned gag orders discouraging pharmacists from offering customers cheaper alternative drugs. It passed 115-0 in the House and 45-1 in the Senate in 2017.  And in fact, Bishop was the only member of the North Carolina General Assembly to vote against the bill before Gov. Roy Cooper signed it into law. On the debate stage, Bishop said his opposition was ""for procedural reasons."" When he’s been confronted with the charge before, the state senator has said he didn’t have time to read the final version of the House bill before the vote and noted that he supported a similar Senate bill. We asked both campaigns about Bishop’s position on the policy. While it’s true that Bishop cast the lone vote against The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act, his votes and statements indicate he’s in favor of allowing pharmacists to tell people about cheaper alternative drugs as long as that doesn’t burden pharmacies — and, in turn, customers — with higher costs. Bishop supports banning pharmacy gag orders The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act was introduced in both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly in March 2017. Over the next several weeks, those identical bills made their way through various committees in the House and Senate that amended their language. In the Senate version, Bishop backed changes that his campaign says were designed to protect consumers from additional costs.  On April 26, the bill that Bishop helped revise unanimously passed in the state Senate. When a House version of the bill was added to the calendar on June 28, Bishop says he didn’t have time to read the bill to check that it included similar amendments. ""That was a big sticking point for him,"" said Jessica Proud, a spokesperson for Bishop’s campaign. ""He didn’t feel comfortable voting for legislation without ensuring that those changes had been made."" (If he had, he would have found the bill was indeed identical.) Didn’t have time How should elected officials vote when they haven’t done their homework? Bishop says he votes no on any legislation he hasn’t fully read. In an email to the Charlotte television station WBTV, Bishop responded to McCready’s claim: ""This companion House version was added to the Senate calendar on June 28 at the last minute and, unlike Nancy Pelosi’s advice on Obamacare, I don’t vote for bills without an opportunity to read them."" But McCready has questioned why Bishop didn’t have time to read a bill less than two pages long. ""State Senator Bishop refused to even read the bill that would let pharmacists tell people about lower-cost drugs even though it was shorter than ‘Green Eggs and Ham,’"" he said at the debate. (We counted, and The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act comes in at about 200 words shorter than Dr. Seuss’s ""Green Eggs and Ham."") When we asked the state senator’s campaign about his lack of preparation, Proud explained that the vote followed a debate on a workers’ compensation bill that Bishop authored. The General Assembly’s website shows that votes on The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act and Bishop’s workers’ compensation bill occurred less than an hour apart. Our ruling McCready said Bishop was the only member of the House or Senate to vote against a bill allowing pharmacists to tell people about lower-cost drugs. The roll call confirms that is correct.  However, McCready ignores the fact that Bishop supported an identical version of the bill. That vote and his statements indicate he supports the policy.

"['Florida', 'Guns', 'Dave Aronberg']","
How Florida’s red flag gun law works
","Law enforcement officials are using Florida’s so-called ""red flag"" law to remove guns from people five times a day. That’s what Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said on MSNBC when asked about the state’s implementation of the red flag law, enacted after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting. ""That law is being used by law enforcement to get a judge to take away guns from someone who is deemed a threat to himself or others,"" Aronberg, a Democrat, told ""Morning Joe"" host Mika Brzezinski on Aug. 26. ""It has been used about 2,500 times in the state of Florida in the past year and a half. That’s about five times a day."" As recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton renew calls to pass red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who pose a danger, we wanted to look closer at Aronberg’s claim and examine how the Florida law is changing how guns are treated day to day. About 15 states have red flag or extreme risk laws. The laws allow police to petition a court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may be dangerous, or to block the person from obtaining a firearm. After a set amount of time, the firearm is either returned to the person or the court order is extended. (In some states, family members can petition a court to remove the firearm, but in Florida relatives have to contact the police.) We found Aronberg correctly cited state court data on the number of times a judge has issued a risk protection order. Aronberg told us he got his number about the roughly 2,500 cases from an NPR story. (The Tampa Bay Times previously reported the same ballpark figure.) That works out to around five per day since the law took effect in March 2018. Since then through July 2019, there were 2,396 risk protection orders issued by judges statewide. Counties with the highest number of orders were Polk (378), Pinellas (350), Broward (327), Volusia (173) and Miami-Dade (127). We interviewed law enforcement officials in Broward and Pinellas counties about how they have implemented the law. Broward’s chief judge Jack Tuter said that when a law enforcement agency determines a person poses a threat to himself or others, the agency requests a risk protection order. A judge holds a hearing within 24 hours with the police officers who swear to the allegations. If the judge enters the temporary risk protection order, the judge will order a search of the respondent's home to secure any firearms or ammunition.  Within a couple of weeks, a judge holds a final hearing at which point a person can oppose the order. This is a civil process, so the respondent is allowed to hire a lawyer but there is no right to a court-appointed lawyer. Tuter estimated that in 90% of the cases, the orders are agreed to by the respondent. The order can last for up to a year and then law enforcement can seek to renew it. The person’s name is also entered into the national database to prevent federal dealers from selling the person a firearm.  Risk protection orders require judges to take a different outlook than they would for a typical criminal case in which a judge is evaluating past behavior. Judges are asked to predict a person’s future behavior ⁠— ""whether the person is going to carry out the threat,"" Tuter said.  Statewide data show that the vast majority of petitions lead to judges granting the orders. PolitiFact found no public record that showed the total number of guns surrendered, but Pinellas Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said in his county people surrendered about 700 firearms and over 135,000 rounds of ammunition. Gualtieri said that one man who was fired from his restaurant job for making inappropriate advances to female employees sent text messages indicating he planned to shoot the women and himself. He was arrested, and then law enforcement sought a risk protection order and found he had an AR-15 and 471 rounds of ammunition. Kristi MacKenzie, an attorney for the Broward Sheriff’s Office, estimated that around 25% of the risk protection order cases have a parallel criminal case. In other situations, the person has committed no crime, but has prompted concerns that the person poses a danger.  In a case handled by Lighthouse Point police, a man acted strangely and turned off electrical breakers in his condo building ""to prevent them from sending electrical impulses through his body and controlling him,"" according to court records. The man told police he was being targeted by a neighbor who looked like Osama bin Laden. He voluntarily surrendered his firearms. There have been some misconceptions that the law provides no due process or that police are simply seizing guns, but that’s not the case. When a Broward sheriff deputy flags a case, it must first be approved by higher-ups in the sheriff’s office and then reviewed by at least two attorneys before it goes to a judge. ""There are a lot of layers of protection there,"" MacKenzie said. Aronberg said Florida’s red flag gun law has been used ""about five times a day"" since it was enacted about a year and a half ago. His math is correct. Between March 2018 and July 2019, there were about 2,400 risk protection orders issued statewide. That means people were prevented from having a gun temporarily, but we don’t know in total how many guns were surrendered. We rate this statement True.

Yes, the U.S. gives billions to Israel every year – but Detroit receives federal aid, too
","Does the United States federal government send Israel billions of dollars a year in aid while giving Detroit nothing? That’s what one viral Facebook post is claiming. The post, which has gotten over 200 comments and reached nearly 10,000 shares since Aug. 16, says that the United States gives Israel ""$3 billion annually"" and gives Detroit ""zero."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is a mixed claim. Israel does receive billions from the U.S. in federal aid each year, but Detroit also receives federal funds annually.  Israel does, indeed, receive $3 billion from the U.S. annually, and has over the last decade, making it the ""largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War II,"" according to an August 2019 report by the Congressional Research Service.  That amount is going to go up, too. Signed in 2016, a new 10-year agreement between the two countries increased the annual aid to $3.8 billion, which will run from fiscal years 2019 to 2028, the CRS report says. Most of the money – $3.3 billion – will go to military financing. But the part of the claim that says Detroit receives zero federal funds is plain wrong.  When Detroit filed for bankruptcy in 2013, the largest city to do so in the country, the federal government pledged about $300 million in assistance, although that was only a fraction of the billions the city owed.  The amount of federal funds Detroit has gotten has fluctuated over the years and includes assistance through federal grants and programs. According to the city’s yearly Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR), it received $109.5 million in 2015, $93.1 million in 2016, and $97.6 million in 2017 in federal funds. In 2018, the most recently available report, the city received the lowest amount in recent years at $73.2 million. That doesn’t include other money spent by the federal government in Detroit on projects that help the community – like highways, airports and public transportation. Nor does it include any assistance provided by the federal government to residents and businesses of Detroit.  A social media post says that while Israel receives $3 billion from the U.S. in aid annually, Detroit gets ""zero."" It is true that Israel receives billions from the U.S. in foreign aid each year, making it the largest recipient of foreign assistance over the last several decades.  But it is not true that Detroit gets zero dollars from the federal government. The city receives much less than Israel directly, but it routinely collects tens of millions in revenue from federal funds. And that doesn’t include all the indirect federal funding that residents of Detroit benefit from.

"['Climate Change', 'Illinois', 'Sean Casten']","
Does science say time is running out to stop climate disaster?
","In a recent campaign email, U.S. Rep. Sean Casten repeated a talking point often used by Democrats about how little time remains to turn the tide on climate change. ""Most climate scientists agree that we only have less than a decade to turn things around or else we’ll be stuck with a 'worst case scenario' including rising sea levels, devastating droughts, and worsening famines,"" read the email, which was attributed to Casten. Casten, a former clean-energy entrepreneur who flipped Illinois’ west suburban 6th Congressional District for the Democrats in 2018, isn’t the first politician to contend the planet faces a hard deadline on climate change. Prominent Democrats, including presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, made similar claims earlier this year that were contradicted by scientists in fact-checks by The Associated Press and CNN. Casten’s claim and others like it trace back to a 2018 report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That report said nations must take ""unprecedented"" actions to reduce emissions, which will need to be on a significantly different trajectory by 2030 in order to avoid more severe impacts from increased warming. However, it did not identify the hard deadline Casten and others have suggested. In part, that’s because serious effects from climate change have already begun. The panel predicted that if warming continues at its current rate global temperatures are likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052. If temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees, the report cautioned, the planet will face greater disruptions, some of which ""may be long-lasting or irreversible."" To keep temperatures from rising above that temperature, the report stated with high confidence that carbon dioxide emissions would need to start dropping ""well before 2030"" and be on a path to fall by nearly half by 2030. Following the report’s release last October, a popular narrative began to emerge that there were only 12 years left to act in order to avoid the most extreme consequences of climate change. But experts say that conclusion overstates the report’s findings, which drew on the work of hundreds of scientists. James Skea, co-chairman of the IPCC report and a sustainable energy professor at Imperial College London, told The Associated Press in March that the panel ""did not say we have 12 years left to save the world."" We followed up with Skea, who confirmed the panel has not published any work since then that supports the hard deadline Casten suggested. In response to our inquiry, a spokesperson for Casten’s campaign sent us several sources, two of which focused on the IPCC report. One of them, a recent article from InsideClimate News, explained the timeline for reducing emissions laid out by the IPCC does not mean 2030 is the threshold for climate disaster. Framing it as a hard deadline is ""more of a messaging tool than a physical science reality,"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Center for Climate and Weather Extremes, who was quoted in the piece. ""The next decade is indeed a critical window in which to achieve enough technological, economic and policy momentum toward a carbon-neutral world while minimizing societal disruption,"" he told us. ""But on the other hand there's no geophysical cliff at the end of the decade that makes all our efforts moot if we don't make it all the way."" Duke University climate researcher Drew Shindell, a lead author of the IPCC report’s chapter on mitigation, told us the panel indeed found that ""if we are not on a greatly different path by 2030 than our current trajectory we cannot keep within the 1.5 [degree Celsius] warming target."" ""But we won't necessarily face a 'worst-case scenario' if we don't act in less than a decade as acting during the 2030’s is still better than waiting until say the 2040’s, so there's always an even worse case,"" he said. Shindell and others also pointed out that serious effects of global warming, including rising sea levels and worsening droughts, are challenges we already face today and will continue to grow regardless. Casten said that ""most climate scientists agree that we only have less than a decade to turn things around or else we’ll be stuck with a ‘worst case scenario’ including rising sea levels, devastating droughts, and worsening famines."" A 2018 UN climate report determined a significant decrease in carbon emissions by 2030 is necessary in order to keep global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in years to come, and to mitigate even more severe effects of a warming planet. Experts told us action taken to decrease emissions in the next decade will be critical. However, they said it’s an oversimplification to suggest we face a hard deadline of a decade to address climate change before crossing a threshold into climate disaster.

Trump misleads NC about Dan McCready's immigration stances
","A North Carolina Congressional race may provide some fresh clues about how Americans are feeling about President Trump ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Trump plans to hold a rally in Fayetteville on Sept. 9, the day before the special election for District 9, a race that pits Republican N.C. Sen. Dan Bishop against Democrat Dan McCready. But voters don’t have to wait for Trump to take the stage to hear his thoughts on McCready. Trump recently took to Twitter to weigh-in. ""Looking forward to being with Dan Bishop in two weeks, in North Carolina. His opponent believes in Open Borders and Sanctuary Cities, and won’t protect your Second Amendment!"" Trump tweeted on Aug. 27. Is it fair for Trump to say McCready has supported ""open borders and sanctuary cities?"" PolitiFact could find no evidence of McCready using those specific words, so we reached out to the Trump campaign. Samantha Cotten, a regional communications director for the campaign, sent a document that listed McCready’s comments about immigration. Cotten points to three instances that she said back up Trump’s claim: McCready supports the DREAM Act; he has been ""evasive"" when asked how he’d handle undocumented immigrants in the U.S.; and he opposes a state bill that would require sheriffs to comply with federal immigration authorities. While McCready opposed a bill that would crack down on sanctuary policies, that doesn’t mean he supports sanctuary cities. And Trump’s claim about open borders is unfounded. We’ll explain. OPEN BORDERS The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, better known as the DREAM Act, was first introduced in 2001 and never passed. It aimed to help immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. A similar bill introduced in by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., in 2017 would have granted a path to citizenship for law-abiding immigrants who met specific criteria, such as reaching certain levels of educational attainment, military service and employment. That bill mostly applies to children who were brought to the United States and are already here, so it’s not accurate to characterize it as an ""open borders"" policy. Now to McCready’s alleged ""evasiveness."" Cotten provided a link to a Charlotte Observer editorial board column from October 2018 to support her claim. The Observer wrote that McCready ""dodged direct questions"" about how he would handle immigrants who are currently in the U.S. illegally. But in that column, McCready was quoted saying that immigration reform ""starts with securing the border."" In fact, he has repeatedly said he wants to secure the border. His comments to WFAE and in a recent WBTV debate echo the position outlined on his website. When asked in the debate how he’d handle migrant families at the border, McCready said: ""We absolutely need a secure border. If some Democrats are saying we don’t need a secure border, that’s crazy. Now, I don’t think we need 3,000 miles of wall to do it. I think we can use the type of surveillance technology I used over in Iraq,"" he said, referring to his experience as a Marine. McCready’s plans for undocumented immigrants living in America might be vague. But that doesn’t mean he favors open borders. SANCTUARY CITIES Here, Trump has a little more of a case. There’s no single definition of what constitutes a ""sanctuary city,"" but the term is loosely applied to cities or states that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. California state law, for instance, prohibits law enforcement agencies from using local funds or personnel to investigate or arrest individuals for immigration purposes. In North Carolina, municipalities can’t block their law enforcement agencies from cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But sheriffs can decide independently whether they want to comply with ICE. A recent bill, HB 370, would have changed that by requiring North Carolina sheriffs to honor ICE detainers, but Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed the bill. If it had become law, sheriffs would have to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond the terms of their jail sentence if requested to do so by ICE. As PolitiFact NC has previously reported, ICE detainers aren’t valid warrants. In an Aug. 23 interview with WBT-FM, McCready said he thought Cooper’s veto ""was the right call."" But that doesn’t mean McCready supports sanctuary cities, said his spokesman Matt Fried. ""No, Dan doesn’t support a ‘sanctuary city.’ Violent criminals belong in jail in every city,"" Fried told PolitiFact in an email. An analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies isn’t convinced by McCready’s explanation. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for CIS, which favors low immigration, says she believes Trump’s tweet is fair. ""The only reason to oppose the bill is to facilitate sanctuary policies,"" Vaughan said, adding, ""If someone says that they want sheriffs to have the option to obstruct ICE, that is a statement that is explicitly in favor of sanctuary policies."" OTHER REACTION TO TRUMP TWEET Other experts believe Trump’s accusations come up short. One of them is Peter H. Schuck, an emeritus professor of law at Yale University and scholar-in-residence at New York University. In an op-ed for The Los Angeles Times July 2, he cautioned Democrats against embracing open borders. McCready’s position ""does not imply that he favors ‘open borders,’ though he would be open to a charge that his favored policies would ‘not do enough’ to secure the borders,"" Schuck told PolitiFact in an email. ""As for sanctuary cities, not cooperating with ICE detainers is certainly what ‘sanctuary cities’ do but whether that’s enough to qualify as creating sanctuary city depends on how one defines the term,"" he said. We asked Larry Sabato, founder and director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, whether he thinks Trump’s tweet is fair. ""Democrats will say it isn’t and Republicans will say it is. That’s where we are in the post-factual era,"" Sabato said in a phone interview. ""Personally, I think it’s a stretch by the White House. But it’s not completely fabricated which, given Trump’s tweets, is an accomplishment."" Indeed, the terms — ""open borders"" and ""sanctuary city"" — are ""both so amorphous they can mean whatever someone wants it to mean,"" said Jessica Bolter, an associate policy analyst for the Migration Policy Institute. But she doesn’t think McCready supports open borders, a term that implies no consequences for people who enter the country illegally. ""When someone is saying they’re interested in border security and pointing to technology he used in Iraq, that’s clearly not someone who believes there should be no consequences,"" Bolter said in a phone interview. And she doesn’t think supporting HB 370 — the vetoed North Carolina law on ICE detainers — is the same as endorsing sanctuary cities. ""Not having a policy of honoring detainers isn’t the same as telling sheriffs they can’t honor detainers,"" Bolter said. ""Sheriffs still have the ability to honor detainers, whereas in some other cities or states the policies say they can’t."" OUR RULING Trump tweeted that McCready ""believes in open borders and sanctuary cities."" There’s no evidence that McCready supports open borders. And, while McCready opposes a bill requiring sheriffs to comply with ICE, he hasn’t said he believes sheriffs should be prohibited from working with ICE. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Fact-checking whether FEMA funds were shifted to indefinite detention at the border
","As Hurricane Dorian bore down on Florida, Democrats accused President Donald Trump of taking money intended for natural disasters and using it instead for his priorities on the U.S.-Mexico border. Several Democratic presidential candidates tweeted criticism of the administration’s move. One — South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — tweeted on Aug. 28, ""Taking money Congress authorized to protect people facing disaster in order to indefinitely detain asylum seekers is unconscionable. It is unworthy of the presidency and unworthy of the United States."" Taking money Congress authorized to protect people facing disaster in order to indefinitely detain asylum seekers is unconscionable. It is unworthy of the presidency and unworthy of the United States. https://t.co/vHJYduZmMj On the matter of removing money from disaster relief, Buttigieg’s description of what happened is correct. But he’s off-base in what he says about the money being used to ""indefinitely"" detain asylum seekers. Facing an influx of asylum-seeking migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, including many families from Central America, Trump has pursued a variety of measures designed to limit the migrants’ ability to make it into the United States and to remain in the country as they await their judicial hearings. On July 26, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it was ""reprogramming"" some of the funds that Congress had allocated to the department. All told, the department said it would transfer a total of $271 million toward immigration efforts. About $112 million of this sum isn’t directly relevant for analyzing Buttigieg’s tweet, because it would be taken from the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, DHS management accounts, and several other offices within DHS. But the remaining $158.4 million would, as Buttigieg said, come from FEMA, the agency that handles disaster prevention and recovery.  Most of the FEMA money being reprogrammed to the border — $155 million — would come from the disaster relief fund base budget, which is spent on recovering from natural disasters. The remaining $3.4 million would be transferred from disaster mitigation, which includes grant funds that allow local jurisdictions susceptible to natural disasters to undertake infrastructure projects that limit future disaster risks. It’s worth noting that the funding shift won’t decimate FEMA’s available funding for disaster-hit areas; the federal government has a process in place to provide disaster relief. But it could have some effect, depending on the severity of the storm season. Migrants seeking asylum in the United States line up for a meal provided by volunteers near the international bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, on April 30, 2019. (AP) DHS has earmarked the $271 million being sent to the border for two specific purposes. One pot of money, worth $116 million (but only $3.4 million taken from FEMA accounts), would be used to pay for beds for adults who were detained and for transporting them to and from immigration hearings. ""These additional beds are required in order to manage the crisis at the Southwest border and expediently transfer aliens from overcrowded Border Patrol stations,"" DHS wrote. The remainder of this money would be spent on transportation — ""the safe and secure transfer of migrants from the Border Patrol to ICE detention facilities"" as well as transporting migrants to hearings with immigration judges. The second pot of money the department would transfer came to $155 million. This would fund the construction of hearing facilities under the Migrant Protection Protocol, or MPP.  Under the Migrant Protection Protocols, ""certain foreign individuals entering or seeking admission to the U.S. from Mexico – illegally or without proper documentation – may be returned to Mexico and wait outside of the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings, where Mexico will provide them with all appropriate humanitarian protections for the duration of their stay."" This additional workload demanded new courtroom infrastructure, DHS said. ""Current courts have infrastructure capacity and security limitations that are being exceeded by the addition of MPP cases to the existing non-detained docket,"" the department wrote. These funding shifts drew criticism. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who chairs the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, said she ""strongly"" disagreed with the department’s action. ""DHS has ignored the negotiated agreement with Congress by vastly exceeding the amount appropriated for immigration enforcement and removal operations,"" she wrote. And Steve Ellis, executive vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the shift amounted to ""robbing Peter to pay Paul."" He added that ""much of the major disaster funding is already targeted to previous disasters, such as Maria which savaged Puerto Rico in 2017."" The Trump campaign countered that Obama did something similar during a previous border crisis in 2014 and that Democrats have known about this decision for a month and only decided to complain with a hurricane approaching ""to score political points."" (Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator under Obama, told NPR that the part about Obama using a similar maneuver was accurate.) Overall, though, Buttigieg is correct to say that Trump has taken ""money Congress authorized to protect people facing disaster"" for other purposes. However, Buttigieg conflates the situation with the second part of his assertion – that the money taken from FEMA will be used ""to indefinitely detain asylum seekers."" Buttigieg’s notion isn’t conjured from whole cloth. The Trump administration has pursued a policy of directing immigration judges not to allow migrants to be released on bail after they have established ""a credible fear of persecution or torture"" in the home country. The Trump administration decision overturned a policy that had been in place since 2005, and given backlogs, it could lead to months or years of detention until their cases are heard. However, the Trump administration policy change was blocked by a federal judge in Seattle. The legal battle is continuing.  It’s also worth noting that, given how DHS divvied up the transferred money, just a small fraction of the money taken from FEMA — about 2 percent — would go toward detainee housing and transportation that could be considered the ""indefinite detention"" Buttigieg cited.  The other 98 percent of the money taken from FEMA would go toward building hearing facilities for individuals who are to be kept in Mexico while awaiting their proceedings. It’s a stretch to call that money spent on indefinitely detaining migrants. In theory, faster hearings would end indefinite detention, not encourage it. ""It is not exactly right to say that the money was reprogrammed for ‘indefinite’ detention,"" said Denise L. Gilman, director of the immigration clinic and a clinical professor at the University of Texas-Austin Law School. A more accurate statement would be that ""the $3.4 million is being reprogrammed to fund ‘expanded and prolonged’ detention of asylum seekers."" The Buttigieg campaign said it stood by the candidate’s tweet, citing the administration’s opposition to the judge’s ruling and its assertion that that the money is needed to fix shortages caused by its own policies. Buttigieg said Trump has been ""taking money Congress authorized to protect people facing disaster in order to indefinitely detain asylum seekers."" Buttigieg was correct about the money shift, which involves more than $158 million being taken from FEMA accounts. But he exaggerated somewhat when he said the funds taken from FEMA would be used ""to indefinitely detain asylum seekers."" That policy has been blocked by a federal judge, and all but a small fraction of the money taken from FEMA would be used for building new facilities for immigration hearings, not for indefinite detention.

Vos misses mark with claim over timing of disability accommodation dispute
","Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, believes there was an agenda behind the push by Democrats for accommodations for a new lawmaker under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The agenda, as Vos described it: To embarrass Vos as he stepped into a national-level post. Here is the background:  State Rep. Jimmy Anderson, elected in 2018, was paralyzed from the chest down in 2010 after a drunken driver collided with the vehicle he was traveling in, killing his family and permanently injuring him. The Democrat from Fitchburg uses a wheelchair to get around.  On Aug. 14, 2019, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel posted a story that said all 36 Democratic members of the Assembly asked Vos and Republican leaders to allow Anderson to call in to meetings he can’t attend in person, and make other adjustments to Assembly rules. The accommodations, they said, fell under federal ADA requirements. The letter was dated Aug. 8, 2019. No Republicans signed it. Additionally, Anderson and other Democrats have asked Vos to refrain from calling overnight floor sessions that aren’t an emergency and that an ADA coordinator be assigned to determine which accommodation requests should be granted.  The day after the story appeared, Vos told conservative radio host Jay Weber on 1130 WISN the timing of the request was fishy, since it aligned with his new position as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures.  ""The fact that they launched this during the same week I got to become the president of the nation’s largest bipartisan organization called the National Conference of State Legislatures, first person from Wisconsin, does not seem like an accident to me,"" Vos told Weber on Aug. 15, 2019. ""Everything they do is political and based on trying to make the other side look bad."" Vos told Weber he felt that lawmakers phoning in to meetings was disrespectful, because they are paid to be present. Additionally, Vos said, you wouldn’t be able to be sure they were really paying attention if they phoned in. Vos has said Anderson could listen to recordings of hearings and meetings he may miss, but that he would not be able to phone into them so he could participate and vote. So, Vos has claimed the accommodations request from Anderson and the Democrats was timed to embarrass him. We decided to take a closer look at the timeline of what happened. The timeline Anderson’s office provided a Jan. 23, 2019, email that Anderson sent to the chief of staff for Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, as the starting point.  That email, sent by Anderson at 12:55 p.m., asked that any meeting of the Assembly have 24-hour notice; that none extend beyond 24 hours; that all be held within reasonable hours; and that individuals with disabilities be allowed to attend by phone or teleconference. Here is a summary of what happened next: Feb. 7, 2019: Through a formal negotiation, or Memorandum of Understanding over rules for the session, Democrats bring the requests to Republican state leaders in further detail. April 16, 2019: GOP leaders reject Anderson’s request to call into sessions and meetings and that the Assembly recess no later than 10 p.m., reconvening the following day if debate went longer. Republicans say they would try to limit meetings to 12 hours and said if they were expected to go longer, would provide appropriate notice to members. This is based on a document outlining the negotiations provided by Anderson’s office. May 15, 2019: Democrats say the 12-hour parameters, and not allowing Anderson to call into meetings, do not address accessibility concerns. May 31, 2019: Anderson contacts reporter Patrick Marley of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  May 31, 2019: Marley asks Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer what Vos thinks of lawmakers being able to call into meetings, if he would introduce a policy that allows it and, if not, why not. June 4, 2019: Beyer responds to Marley saying Assembly rules don’t allow members to phone into committees and Vos does not support changing the rule. July 29, 2019: The Journal Sentinel publishes a story that describes the dispute after Vos tells the newspaper he thinks it is ""disrespectful for someone to be asking questions over a microphone or a speakerphone."" Aug. 8, 2019: The Democrats send their letter to Republican leadership.  That same day, Vos becomes president of NCSL. The story about the Aug. 8 letter -- and a suggestion by Anderson that he may file a lawsuit -- was published a week later. That story is what prompted Vos’ claim on the Jay Weber show that it was -- in essence -- a move timed to embarrass him. But the timeline shows that Anderson’s efforts began almost immediately after he took office in January 2019 -- nearly seven months before Vos took the post in question. Vos’ office did not respond to requests from PolitiFact. Our ruling Vos claimed the accommodation request for Anderson was timed to embarrass him as he took over as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures.  But records show the effort began months and months earlier. We rate Vos’ claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974648C0>],/factchecks/2019/aug/30/robin-vos/vos-misses-mark-claim-over-timing-disability-accom/

Bernie Sanders’ Half True claim on number of people in jail who can’t afford bail
","Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders recently claimed ""some 200,000 people are in jail for the crime of being poor and not being able to afford bail."" He made that claim during a campaign speech in Sacramento last week, just blocks from the California State Capitol, where former Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law last year to abolish cash bail and adopt a risk-assessment system. Sanders introduced legislation in the U.S. Senate in 2018 to end cash bail nationwide. It’s part of his criminal justice reform platform. But the issue remains unsettled, including in California.  In January, the bail industry qualified a referendum for the state’s November 2020 ballot, giving voters a say on whether to eliminate cash bail.  Given the focus on this topic, we wanted to know whether Sanders’ figure of ""some 200,000"" is accurate.  Our research  In the past, PolitiFact has reported there is no official national tracking of this number, though researchers have used data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics to extrapolate how many people might be in jail because they can’t afford bail.  They point to the bureau’s 2018 report which uses 2016 data. It says there were 458,600 ""unconvicted"" people held in jails across the country. Some, however, were held without bail and others were awaiting commitment to a mental-health facility.  For those reasons, PolitiFact rated Half True a related claim by California Rep. Ted Lieu last year. It found the Deomocratic congressman overestimated the total when he said: ""Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they've been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don't have high powered attorneys."" Sanders’ campaign said his 200,000 figure is ""a safe estimate"" based on a December 2018 report by the Hamilton Project, an arm of the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan research group. But that report puts the figure far higher.  ""There are more than 400,000 people in jail whom a judge would have allowed to be released had they been able to post bail,"" it says.  Ryan Nunn, one of the report’s authors, told us the 400,000 number ""is definitely a ballpark estimate."" He said his report relied on 2009 data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.  Shima Baradaran Baughman is a law professor at the University of Utah, where she’s written extensively about cash bail.  ""It seems like a low estimate,"" she said of Sanders’ figure.  Darren Hutchinson, a law professor at the University of Florida who has also studied the topic, emphasized that all the figures are estimates.  ""I am not aware of any national database that tracks the number of people who are in jail because they cannot pay bail,"" Hutchinson said in an email. ""Most of the recent studies on this issue continue to rely on projections that compare the average income and available assets of individuals detained in jails and an estimate of the average bail amount.""  ""It is entirely possible that the number of detainees who cannot afford bail exceeds the figure Sanders stated,"" he added.  Sanders was quoted last year in an article by The Guardian placing the number at ""400,000 people,"" which matches estimates in recent studies.  Our ruling  Sen. Bernie Sanders recently claimed ""some 200,000 people are in jail for the crime of being poor and not being able to afford bail."" Experts say there is no national database that tracks this figure, only estimates. The report Sanders cited placed the figure closer to 400,000. Still, experts told us Sanders’ overall point is right: Many Americans languish in jail for the sole reason they can’t afford bail.  In the end, we found his claim was partially accurate but underestimates the total.  We rate it Half True.  HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
