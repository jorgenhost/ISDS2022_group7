Doctored images in coronavirus post exploit boy’s suicide
","Stirring new grief for the family of a boy who committed suicide in 2017, people are sharing doctored images of the child in an apparent attempt to cast doubt on the coronavirus pandemic. ""Same little boy died of COVID-19 in three different countries,"" a Facebook post says facetiously. ""Still don’t believe the media is #fakenews?"" The post, which contains three screenshots of what appear to be portions of three different news reports, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo that is repeated in all of them, however, is of Conor Wilmot, a 13-year-old boy from County Clare, Ireland, who died after reportedly participating in a self-harm challenge. The story was covered by local media at the time after the boy’s loved ones spoke out. Let’s look at each image in the Facebook post: 1. Conor Wilmot The first screenshot includes a portion of a legitimate May 16, 2017, news article in the Irish Times about Conor’s death.  The boy’s father said in the article his son died from playing a ""choking game"" he had found on the internet and did not intend to take his own life. The photo of Conor in that article, visible in the screenshot, is authentic. 2. Isaiah Gonzales The second screenshot includes the same photo of Conor.  But the caption identifies the boy as Isaiah Gonzales and the photo credit is from a TV station in San Antonio, Texas.  Isaiah Gonzales is the name of a 15-year-old boy from San Antonio who hanged himself on July 8, 2017, news reports show. According to his family, Isaiah’s suicide was possibly tied to a sometimes-dangerous online game known as the Blue Whale Challenge, the Washington Post reported. Both suicides occurred more than two years before the coronavirus first surfaced in China. 3. Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab The third screenshot also has the same photo of Conor.  It includes the headline from an April 1, 2020, news article about the youngest person in the United Kingdom to die from COVID-19. That person is Ismail, who was 13 and lived in London.  AFP Fact Check and other websites have reported that social media posts have falsely included a photo of Conor with news articles about Ismail’s death. The newspaper in Conor’s home area, The Clare Echo, published a news article April 6, 2020 about the misuse of Conor’s photos. It included a screenshot of the same images in the Facebook claim we’re checking.  The article said Conor’s older sister, Melanie Wilmot, posted a message online that said: ""We’re devastated that they can do this, frankly had enough just let us be and leave Conor alone.""  This Facebook post does not show that the media is falsely suggesting that the same boy had died of the coronavirus in three different countries. Rather, it shows that someone used doctored images of a child who reportedly killed himself to falsely suggest a media conspiracy over COVID-19. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097304CC0>],/factchecks/2020/apr/13/facebook-posts/doctored-images-coronavirus-post-exploit-boys-suic/

Private messages sent to Zoom meeting hosts could appear in their transcript
","If the coronavirus pandemic has forced you to work from home, you’ve perhaps met with your fellow remote colleagues on Zoom, a videoconferencing software that is now both noun and verb. But is it safe to send private messages while zooming? A recent warning on social media advises users to be careful.   ""‘Private’ messages sent to individual people during a Zoom meeting show up in the end-of-meeting transcript along with all other public messages,"" reads the screenshot of a tweet. ""Tell your friends, save a life."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We emailed Zoom about the Facebook post and heard back from a public relations firm working for the company. An associate told PolitiFact that if a person with recording privileges — i.e., the person hosting the meeting — decides to record a Zoom meeting to the cloud, then public messages are saved. Public messages are those sent to everyone in the meeting. But if a person with recording privileges records a meeting locally, on their computer, the chats that are saved include those that were sent publicly ""as well as any private chat exchanges that the person recording participated in during the session.""  In short: If you send a private message to the person recording the meeting, it could end up on a transcript. If you send a private message to another person in the meeting — someone who isn’t able to record the meeting — those messages won’t end up in the transcript.  Some PolitiFact staffers recently tested this and found it to be true.   One editor, who had downloaded the Zoom app on his Apple computer, recorded a meeting with other employees. After downloading the transcript of the meeting to his computer, he could only see private messages that were sent to him — not private messages between the participants.  If the person who recorded the meeting decided to share the transcript, people could then see any private messages you or others sent that person. ""Remember that hosts can record audio and video from meetings in full, as well as keep a record of public chats,"" says one Wired story. ""If you (the meeting host) save the chat log for yourself, it will also include private chats you’ve been involved in, so be very careful about sharing that file with anyone else. Don’t just post it in the group chat for everyone to read. If a host chooses to enable this setting, Zoom will notify you and give you a chance to opt out."" There is no evidence that messages between people who don’t have recording privileges will show up in a transcript, however. We rate this post Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280973BCA40>],/factchecks/2020/apr/13/viral-image/private-messages-sent-zoom-meeting-hosts-could-app/

This is an old photo of Houston, not South Carolina during the pandemic
","Communities around the country have responded differently to social distancing recommendations, with some cities and states directing residents to shelter in place while others have resisted shutting down.  A recent Facebook post seems to pointedly illustrate these differences with three photos.  ""After they announce to everyone to ‘stay at home,’"" the text above three different images says. The first two show empty cityscapes and are labeled ""Chicago"" and ""New York."" The third shows a highway clogged with cars. This photo is labeled ""South Carolina.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That supposed photo of South Carolina? It’s Houston. The Houston Chronicle ran it with a 2017 story about traffic congestion. According to the caption, it shows traffic on Interstate 45 around downtown Houston during the afternoon rush hour.  The image labeled Chicago appears to be a photo of Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago — based on the architectural landmarks — but it’s not of the city under a stay-at-home order. We found it posted to a website called desktopbackground.org three years ago. The photo is reversed. Only the photo labeled New York actually shows Times Square in New York City during the pandemic.  It’s true that South Carolina was behind New York and Chicago in issuing statewide orders limiting the movements of its residents. Charleston and Columbia, S.C., told people to stay at home before the state issued its statewide mandate. Gov. Henry McMaster didn’t direct all South Carolinians to follow suit until this month. The order was effective on April 7.   But this Facebook post misrepresents what that looked like in South Carolina, using an old photo of Houston to claim that South Carolinians are flouting the law.

Robin Vos’ election protective gear was available to poll workers in Burlington, but not all of Wis.
","After Republicans fought to keep Wisconsin’s April 7, 2020 election on track as planned amid the coronavirus outbreak, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos worked at a polling place in his district covered head to toe in protective gear. Vos, R-Rochester, volunteered to work at a Burlington polling site after thousands of poll workers across the state stayed home to avoid potential exposure to the coronavirus. The election occurred despite efforts by Democrats to avoid in-person voting, and as health officials warned against such gatherings in the middle of a pandemic. ""You are incredibly safe to go out,"" Vos told the Racine Journal Times on Election Day. Vos’ garb drew swift criticism from voters who say the Republican-controlled Legislature forced the state to hold an unsafe election. One Facebook post shared more than 4,000 times articulated that anger. ""The election workers he forced to work today do not have equivalent protection,"" the April 7, 2020 post stated. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The City of Burlington provided workers at its one in-person polling site with the same gear that Vos wore. But many poll workers across the state did not have that same level of protection. Let’s see where the Facebook claim lands. Quick reminder: The April 7 election took place after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers tried first to move the election to all mail, but the Republican-controlled Legislature rebuked his request and ended a special session without action. Evers then issued an executive order that would have delayed in-person voting until June. Vos and Republicans took the matter to the state Supreme Court, where the conservative majority reversed the order hours later. Now, back to the Facebook post. A video from the Journal Times, along with photos that circulated on social media, show Vos wearing a face mask, gloves and protective gown. When asked about his personal protective equipment (PPE), a staffer for Vos referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to a tweet by the Assembly speaker. ""A requirement for working at the polls was to wear PPE to protect the public and the workers,"" Vos tweeted. ""EVERY single person working at the polling place wore the same gear, not just me."" Burlington City Administrator Carina Walters said the city consolidated two in-person voting locations into a single drive-thru site at its Department of Public Works garage. The city received PPE from the Racine County Emergency Operations Center, plus some from the Burlington Fire Department. Burlington provided all poll workers with the same equipment Vos wore and also took their temperatures before and after shifts, Walters said. ""Our PPE policy for the day was to treat all persons as if they had COVID-19,"" she said. Vos was not the only poll worker wearing a gown, mask and gloves in Burlington. Beyond that protection, Vos’ tweet also shows other workers (not him) wearing face shields.  But the Facebook post did not specify Burlington. The original poster told PolitiFact Wisconsin he preferred to let it speak for itself. So what kind of PPE did poll workers in other communities use? The Wisconsin Elections Commission provided surgical masks and gloves to local clerks, along with sanitizing products. Gowns and face shields were not included, per the commission’s April 3, 2020 memo. Milwaukee County provided municipalities with surgical masks and gloves but did not have access to gowns, said County Clerk George Christenson. Election workers in the city of Milwaukee had gowns, masks and gloves, but no eye shields, according to Election Commission Executive Director Neil Albrecht. Madison put poll workers behind a glass barrier and offered gloves, along with face shields for people working in close proximity. Poll workers in Green Bay also sat behind a glass barrier and wore masks, but not gowns. Vos’ wife, Michelle Litjens Vos, only wore gloves at a polling place in Rochester, the Journal Times reported. That means many people in Wisconsin worked the polls on Election Day and didn’t look at all like Vos. Still, poll workers outside Burlington had access to some of the same equipment he did. A Facebook post shared widely chastised Vos for wearing protective gear at the polls that ""election workers he forced to work today do not have."" Other poll workers in Burlington wore the same gear as Vos, so he didn’t receive any special treatment there like the claim implies. Poll workers in other parts of the state had some – but not necessarily all – of the same equipment used by Vos. That leaves us with a claim that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E986C0>],/factchecks/2020/apr/10/facebook-posts/robin-vos-election-protective-gear-was-available-p/

Florida governor falsely claims novel coronavirus hasn’t killed anyone under 25 in the US
","Health officials have long said that the novel coronavirus is particularly dangerous for older individuals and people with underlying health conditions. But Florida Gov. Ron Desantis made an even more staggering claim, that the virus hasn’t killed anyone under 25 in the United States. ""This particular pandemic is one where I don’t think nationwide, there’s been a single fatality under 25,"" DeSantis said during an April 9 meeting to discuss reopening Florida schools. ""For whatever reason, it just doesn’t seem to threaten kids. ""And we lose in Florida between five and 10 kids a year for the flu. This one (coronavirus), for whatever reason, much more dangerous if you're 65 and plus than the flu, no doubt about that, if you're younger it just hasn't had an impact. So that should factor into how we're viewing this. I think the data on that has been 100% consistent. I have not seen any deviation on that."" This is inaccurate. Florida hasn’t yet reported any deaths of COVID-19 patients under the age of 25, but several Americans in that age group have been killed by the virus.  PolitiFact reached out to Desantis’ office for comment but did not hear back. So far, the federal government’s count shows that four people between 15 and 24, and one child between the ages of 1 and 4, have died from the virus. This is an undercount, because it takes ""several weeks"" for death records to be processed. Reports by news organizations and various state health departments show more fatalities among younger Americans, though it’s hard to say with precision. New York state reported that 42 people who were 29 years or younger have died from the virus, as of April 10. Of those, six were 19 or younger and 36 deaths were people between 20 and 29 years old. A Washington Post investigation identified nine people under 20 who died from COVID-19. The newspaper found 45 deaths of people in their 20s.  All told, death remains rare for young, otherwise healthy people, but these numbers show it can and has happened. Relatively few children with COVID-19 are hospitalized, and they often exhibit milder symptoms, health experts say. Like adults, they can unknowingly spread the disease to others. DeSantis claimed that the novel coronavirus hasn’t killed anyone under the age of 25 in the United States. That’s wrong, according to the CDC, contemporaneous news reports and the counts of state health officials in places like New York. While we don’t have precise numbers, we can say with certainty that deaths in people 25 and under do exist.

Are bottling limitations on liquid milk to blame for milk dumping?
","Soaring milk production and plummeting consumption have dealt a series of devastating blows to Wisconsin dairy farmers in recent years. But the coronavirus pandemic has been a next-level gut-shot. Shuttered schools and restaurants have cut off much of the demand for dairy, even as panicked shoppers bought out milk and other dairy products — and just about everything else in sight — as the quarantine began. A heavily-viewed Facebook video painted the scene this way: ""Although grocery store dairy shelves remain sparse … dairy farmers are being forced to dump thousands of pounds of milk down the drain,"" says the two-minute clip from Courtenay DeHoff TV. The clip goes on to say it’s not as simple as shifting production from school products to grocery store ones. ""Production lines are shuttering, and they’re scrambling to suddenly mass produce jugs when they are used to mass producing the little cardboard boxes handed out at schools."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Are farmers really dumping milk even as grocery stores are short of it? And are production limitations on liquid milk to blame? We checked it out. Experts we spoke with said the factors cited in the video are accurate, but said a few other important elements are at play as well. The quarantine has affected both the way liquid milk is consumed and the kind of processed dairy products needed. The Wall Street Journal said that has left dairy producers with at least 10% more milk than the industry can use. Dennis Rodenbaugh, executive vice president at Dairy Farmers of America, the largest U.S. dairy cooperative, told the Wall Street Journal for an April 9, 2020, story that as much as 7% of the milk produced in the U.S. the prior week was dumped. Patrick Geoghegan, executive vice president of industry relations for Dairy Farmers of Wisconsin, said the market swings have been enormous. ""Milk is being disposed of because of a massive and sudden loss of markets — more than half the nation’s restaurants are closed, sales of cheese are down 70 percent and some 44 percent of the nation’s cheese is sold through foodservice channels,"" he said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, citing the group’s industry research. Some of the demand that remains is for products the industry isn’t set up to immediately produce. Shifting butter production, for example, from tiny packets for restaurants to large blocks for grocery stores can’t happen overnight. But the use of liquid milk had changed dramatically as well — and that’s the element the Facebook video focused on. Geoghegan said sales of fluid milk were up 55% for two consecutive weeks in March, though by early April it had fallen back to about 35% above norm. As of early April, grocery stores are more consistently stocked, but there simply wasn’t the space or production to meet that initial demand in time. ""The shelf just doesn’t hold enough and they (couldn’t) restock often enough,"" said Doug Adams, president of Prime Consulting, which researches the dairy industry. Dean Foods confirmed that their shift in production was in line with what the video described. They reduced production of paperboard milk cartons for schools by ""well over 50%"" after schools closed. ""As panic buying reached its peak, we shifted production to focus on products most in demand (whole and 2% milk for retail business) to maximize our output efficiency,"" said Anne Divjak, vice president of government relations & external communications. ""Demand has since normalized and we are back to normal production runs but still seeing significant declines in school milk and foodservice business."" School milk does comprise about 7% of all liquid milk sales, Adams said. But much of that demand remains since school feeding programs remain active. Geoghegan said there have even been intermittent shortages of school milk, since bottlers have diverted resources to meet grocery store demand. A Facebook video focused on liquid milk said bottling limitations mean grocery stores are short on milk even as farmers are dumping it. That is a factor, but it over-simplifies the situation a bit. Disappearing markets for cheese, butter and other dairy products in restaurants play a critical role in the suddenly changing dairy economy as well, experts say. Milk is being dumped not just because it can’t be bottled in the proper way, but because the overall demand for all dairy products is down. And because the forms of butter and cheese needed have changed with people largely confined to their homes. We rate this Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2A30C0>],/factchecks/2020/apr/10/facebook-posts/are-bottling-limitations-liquid-milk-blame-milk-du/

Donald Trump’s dubious claim that 'thousands' are conspiring on mail-ballot fraud
","The daily White House briefings about coronavirus sometimes veer into adjacent topics, and since Wisconsin voted on April 7, one of those topics has been voting by mail. Despite late pleas by Wisconsin’s Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to make the election mail balloting only, the state’s Republican Legislature, backed by a Republican-majority state Supreme Court, opposed Evers’ plan. In person voting was held amid social distancing, though with significantly fewer polling places. At briefings on April 7 and 8, President Donald Trump was asked about an expanded role for mail balloting at a time of a global pandemic. He responded by criticizing mail balloting as illegitimate and subject to widespread fraud (even though he had recently voted by mail for a Florida election). On April 7, Trump said, ""Now, mail ballots — they cheat. Okay? People cheat. Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they're cheaters. They go and collect them.  They're fraudulent in many cases."" When pressed, Trump went on to call mail-in voting ""horrible"" and ""corrupt"" and alleged that ""you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody’s living room, signing ballots all over the place."" At the following day’s briefing, a reporter asked Trump for evidence to support the ""thousands and thousands"" characterization. Trump responded, ""I think there's a lot of evidence, but we'll provide you with some, okay?"" (The White House did not provide PolitiFact with additional evidence.) Trump did cite a lawsuit by the conservative group Judicial Watch against the state of California, saying that ""a million people should not have been voting"" in the state. However, PolitiFact California previously rated a similar assertion by the president Pants on Fire, because the legal settlement in question required Los Angeles County to begin removing inactive voter registrations; it said nothing about voter fraud or people illegally voting. In recent years, Trump has repeatedly claimed the existence of massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we’ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again. In his most recent comments, we found no support for the notion that ""you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place.""  We did find that mail balloting does pose a potentially higher risk for fraud than in-person voting does. However, experts said the reality is much more nuanced than Trump let on. ""I can’t imagine any living room with thousands of people in it,"" said Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine law professor who specializes in election law. But even to the extent he’s saying that vote-by-mail efforts are rife with fraud, ""that is false,"" Hasen said.  ""There are more cases of absentee ballot fraud than other kinds of election crimes,"" he said. ""But the risk is relatively low, and the benefits, especially during the time of a pandemic, are quite great."" Voting and election specialists said there’s no evidence that ""thousands and thousands"" of Americans are collaborating on mail-ballot fraud, whether they’re sitting in one living room or not. ""There is no evidence that any candidate or group has executed a mail ballot fraud scheme of this magnitude in modern elections,"" said Michael P. McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist. ""In this day of social media, it is nearly impossible to keep anything secret, much less a scheme involving thousands of people."" If this was happening, McDonald said, voters would wonder where their ballots were. ""They would show up to vote and be told by election officials that they had already voted,"" he said. ""Election officials would see patterns in where mail ballots were being sent, the addresses they were being returned from, and the signatures on the ballot return envelope. If a mail ballot fraud scheme happened on the alleged scale, someone, somewhere, would notice."" More broadly, repeated efforts to uncover widespread voter fraud have produced little.  • Trump’s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, a panel to investigate voter fraud, was shuttered before it found significant patterns of fraud. • News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011. • In 2012, Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s administration tried to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. The Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives — including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the voter rolls. • The five states that hold all-mail elections (Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington) have reported little fraud. ""There’s just very little evidence that there is more than a handful of fraudulent (vote-by-mail) cases across the country in a given election cycle,"" Judd Choate, the director of elections in the Colorado Department of State, told the New York Times. Richard Winger, the editor of Ballot Access News and a frequent election volunteer in San Francisco, said ballot security measures in his state offer protections. ""We have a list of all the registered voters in our precinct,"" Winger said. ""The list indicates which voters have received a ballot in the postal mail. In every election, voters wander in and want to vote there, but we say, ‘It says here you already got a mail ballot.’ And they say, ‘Oh, yes, it's at home’ or, ‘I never received a ballot’ or, ‘Oh, I lost it.’ And we explain that every ballot must be accounted for. They can vote provisionally at the polls, but the vote will only be counted once it is clear their original ballot didn't get submitted for counting."" Steve Schale, a longtime Democratic consultant in Florida, said his state has improved its mail-ballot procedures in recent years. ""I think the controls that are in place today really limit the opportunities for fraud,"" Schale said. ""Back in the day, there was more ability for operatives to actually put their hands on ballots, such as collecting them and turning them in. Operatives on both sides will always push up to the legal line when it comes to all aspects of campaigns, but again, the laws now are so clear that one has to go out of their way to break the law."" President Donald Trump speaks at a coronavirus briefing on April 7, 2020. (AP) Rare doesn’t mean nonexistent. And experts agree that mail balloting does provide a greater potential for ballot fraud than in-person voting does. ""It's definitely easier to have fraud with absentee voting than in-person voting, and some cases of it have had a big impact,"" said Rob Richie, president of FairVote, a voting-access advocacy group. A congressional election was overturned in North Carolina in 2018 after evidence surfaced that the Republican candidate benefited from an effort to collect absentee ballots from voters. In South Florida alone, the Miami Herald cited examples of ballot fraud in Hialeah (1994, 2011, and 2012), Homestead (2014), and Miami and Miami-Dade County (1998, 2008, 2013). ""All this must be kept in perspective, and there are ways states seek to counter it, but it's not outlandish to say fraud is more likely with absentee voting than in-person voting,"" Richie said. Lonna Atkeson, University of New Mexico political scientist, told NPR  that ""where there is fraud in the system, it really seems to be in mail balloting. There's some, there's not a lot. I think there's a little bit."" While voting by mail might be necessary in an extended battle with coronavirus, voting experts acknowledge that it’s not a perfect solution. • There could be an increase in voter errors made at home, since election officials won’t be standing nearby to help. This means more ballots could be rejected and not counted.  • Voter education will be needed for people who are unaccustomed to absentee voting. Voters will need reminders to sign their ballots, and elections officials will need to increase public outreach to dispel myths about absentee ballots, such as the one that those ballots aren’t counted unless an election is close. • Some groups have less convenient access to mail than others do, such as residents of Native American reservations. Mail voting also poses challenges for voters who move frequently, or who have language or literacy issues. And some disabled voters, including those who are blind, cannot effectively cast mail ballots without assistance. • Voting at home could lead to coercion by abusive spouses or other relatives. Trump said that with voting by mail, ""you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place."" Voting fraud in general is considered to be rare, although voting experts agree that the risks are greater for mail balloting than for in-person voting. Still, Trump didn’t produce any evidence for the ""thousands and thousands"" claim, and voting experts said his assertion doesn’t square with what is known about the actual cases of voting fraud in the recent past.

Trump has a tiny financial stake in a company that manufactures hydroxychloroquine
","Some Facebook users think President Donald Trump’s recent interest in a lupus and arthritis drug goes beyond its potential to treat COVID-19. ""Trump himself has a financial stake in the French company that makes the brand-name version of hydroxychloroquine,"" reads one post published April 7. The image, which is a screenshot of a tweet from Ian Sams, the former national press secretary for Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was shared in a group for ""center left pragmatic progressives"" called The 47ers. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In the past few weeks, Trump has touted the potential of chloroquine and the related drug hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19. There is some preliminary evidence that the drugs could be effective in treating the coronavirus, but more rigorous tests have not been completed. There is currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for COVID-19. We’ve previously reported on alleged financial ties between the Trump administration and hydroxychloroquine manufacturers, so we wanted to look into this claim, too. Trump does have a small financial stake in a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine. But the implication of the post, that Trump could stand to profit from that stake, is misleading.  The New York Times reported on April 6 that the president has a personal financial interest in Sanofi, a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine, through a mutual fund from a firm called Dodge & Cox. At 3.3%, Sanofi is the largest holding of the firm’s International Stock Fund. But Trump’s stake in that fund is rather small. The president’s latest financial disclosure form indicates that he holds shares in the mutual fund through three different family trusts. The value of each of those holdings is between $1,001 and $15,000, which would put Trump’s stake in Sanofi at ""between about $100 and $1,500 in total,"" the Washington Post reported. ""That Sanofi investment would therefore constitute between 0.000003 and 0.00005 percent of Trump’s net worth,"" the newspaper wrote. ""If you were worth $100,000, it would be like worrying about the nickel in your pocket."" RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know Let’s pretend that Trump’s last financial disclosure form is up-to-date and that his total holdings in Sanofi are valued at $1,500 — the high end of the range. Since March 20, the day after the president first mentioned chloroquine during a press briefing, the company’s stock value has increased by about 17.3%. That would mean the value of Trump’s shares in Sanofi has increased by nearly $260. Given the president’s net worth, which Bloomberg estimates to be nearly $3 billion, $260 would be a comparatively small payoff for promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. Plus, it’s uncertain whether Trump’s remarks have affected Sanofi’s stock value; the company has performed about as well as the broader stock market. Legally, experts say Trump’s holdings in Sanofi don’t constitute a conflict of interest. Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University, said in an email that federal law prohibits executive branch officials from participating in matters in which they have a financial interest. But the law exempts diversified mutual funds like the Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund — and because he’s the president, Trump isn’t subject to the regulation anyway. ""When Congress amended the ethics laws in 1989, it exempted the president from the criminal financial conflict of interest statute. So the statute doesn’t apply to Trump at all,"" Clark said. ""And even if this statute did apply to the president, the regulation’s exemption would seem to apply here.

Viral post compares dates on when Trump admitted coronavirus was a problem
","President Donald Trump has received plenty of criticism for the timeline of his administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Now a Facebook post making the rounds seeks to scrutinize Trump’s actions in comparison to health officials’ warnings about the virus.  The post says that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning about COVID-19 as early as Jan. 8, but that Trump continued to hold campaign rallies and play golf before he ""admitted the coronavirus might be a problem"" on March 13. The post lists specific dates, saying ""Trump held campaign rallies on Jan 9, Jan 14, Jan 28, Jan 30, Feb 10, Feb 19, Feb 20, Feb 21, & Feb 28. He golfed on Jan 18, Jan 19, Feb 1, Feb 15, Mar 7, Mar 8."" This post was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We looked into the claim date by date and found that Trump did hold rallies and go golfing on those dates. But the CDC’s warning said the threat of the coronavirus to Americans was low, and Trump took action against the virus earlier than March 13. According to online archives of the events page on Trump’s website, rallies were held across the U.S. on the dates listed in the post, including the Feb. 28 rally in North Charleston, S.C., where he used the word ""hoax"" while talking about the coronavirus.  Trump also went golfing on the dates mentioned in the post. Social media posts and press reports in Palm Beach document visits the president made to his Florida golf course in the first three months of 2020. The dates when the CDC first warned the public about COVID-19 and when Trump ""admitted the coronavirus might be a problem"" are more ambiguous. On Jan. 8, the CDC announced in a health advisory that it was investigating a new coronavirus detected in Wuhan, China. The advisory stated that ""no human-to-human transmission has been reported."" As a precaution, it advised health officials to wear an ""N95 disposable facepiece respirator"" if they were treating a patient who had recently traveled to Wuhan and was experiencing respiratory problems.  The situation summary the CDC posted on Jan. 10 stressed that there were no deaths associated with the novel coronavirus at the time and that the health risk to the American public was low. On Feb. 1, the CDC updated its advisory and noted that there were seven cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. It detailed how doctors and caregivers should avoid being in close contact with patients who might have COVID-19, especially those who had traveled to China or had been in close contact with known cases. The Feb. 28 update from the CDC told doctors to assume that anyone with respiratory symptoms had COVID-19, even if they hadn’t had close contact with other patients or traveled to China recently. It’s hard to put a finger on when Trump ""admitted the coronavirus might be a problem.""   RELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic   On Feb. 27, Trump announced during a press conference that he was putting Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the Coronavirus Task Force. However, in the same conference, Trump told reporters that he didn’t think a widespread outbreak in the U.S. was inevitable, just that ""there’s a chance it could get fairly substantially worse.""  Trump gave an Oval Office address on March 11, the same day the WHO declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic, in which he banned travel from Europe for the next 30 days. He also reminded the public that on March 6 he had signed, and Congress had passed, ""an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies."" Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 during a press conference with his Coronavirus Task Force. This opened up $50 billion of funding that would be used to ""fight against this disease."" 
  Our ruling A recent Facebook post claimed that Trump was warned about COVID-19 on Jan. 8 but  continued to hold campaign rallies and play golf until he ""admitted the coronavirus might be a problem"" on March 13. While the golf and rally dates are accurate, the dates of the CDC’s first warning and Trump’s response to the coronavirus aren’t as clear cut.  There was a health advisory issued Jan. 8, though the threat to the U.S. was undefined and person-to-person transmission wasn’t established yet. It’s harder to determine the date on which Trump admitted there was a problem, but he did take specific actions before March 13. Those actions included creating a task force, signing a bill for health research funding and banning travel from China and Europe. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4C4640>],/factchecks/2020/apr/09/facebook-posts/viral-post-compares-dates-when-trump-admitted-coro/

Pandemics like COVID haven’t hit exactly every 100 years, despite claim
","According to this post on Facebook, pandemics like COVID-19 strike with eerie precision, every 100 years: ""1720 — Plague; 1820 — Cholera outbreak; 1920 — Spanish flu; 2020 — Chinese coronavirus. What’s happening? There is a theory that every 100 years, a pandemic happens. At first glance, nothing seems strange, but the accuracy with which these events take place is scary."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The plague cited wasn’t a pandemic; two of the other examples didn’t occur neatly in the years cited; and, most importantly, numerous other pandemics have occurred without such synchronicity. ""I am suspicious of the idea that pandemics operate to a railroad timetable,"" Yale University history professor Frank Snowden, author of ""Epidemics and Society,"" told PolitiFact, noting several problems with the post.  The World Health Organization defines pandemic as: ""The worldwide spread of a new disease.""  The definition from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is nearly the same: ""A pandemic is a global outbreak of disease. Pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people sustainably."" The Facebook post suggests that pandemics only occur every 100 years. But that ignores numerous pandemics, including the Great Plague of London, in 1665; yellow fever in the late 1800s; the H2N2/Asian flu in 1957-1958; the H3N2 flu virus in 1968; and the H1N1/swine flu in 2009. Now, a breakdown of the four outbreaks cited in the post: Plague, an infectious fever caused by a bacterium transmitted from rodents to humans by the bite of infected fleas, caused some of the worst pandemics in history, according to Britannica.com.  What was known as Great Plague of Provence, or Great Plague of Marseille, killed as many as 126,000 people in southern France starting in 1720, according to an article by Cindy Ermus, a history professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio who is writing a book on the outbreak. But because this particular episode of plague happened largely in France, it wasn’t a pandemic. The first pandemic of cholera began three years before the post claimed. ""Since first spreading from Calcutta along the Ganges Delta in 1817, it has killed millions,"" says the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which supports health research and programs.  During the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak in the Soho district of London, according to the foundation, English physician John Snow had, based on his theory that cholera was transmitted by exposure to contaminated water, ""used extensive interviews and intricately plotted maps to trace the source of the outbreak to a single water pump. Disabling the pump ended the outbreak almost immediately, in a poignant example of an early, effective public health intervention."" This influenza pandemic started two years before what the post claims and is more accurately called ""The Great Influenza"" by modern historians. The pandemic ""was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. Although there is not universal consensus regarding where the virus originated, it spread worldwide during 1918-1919,"" according to the CDC. ""In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States."" It was called the Spanish flu ""not because it originated in Spain but because it was World War I, and Spain was the only country being honest about the toll the pandemic took on the country,"" according to a Washington Post article on the deadliest pandemics in history. The post is more or less correct in saying this pandemic is from 2020. COVID-19 can be traced back at least to Dec. 31, 2019, when the government in Wuhan, China, confirmed that health authorities were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia from an unknown cause. Eight days later, China identified a new type of coronavirus. The first coronavirus case in the United States was confirmed on Jan. 21, 2020. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, saying it is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus.  A claim on Facebook that a pandemic occurs exactly every 100 years cites four outbreaks that it says occurred in 1720, 1820, 1920 and 2020. But the first example was not a pandemic and the second and third started a couple of years before 1820 and 1920.  More importantly, the claim ignores many other pandemics over several centuries that did not occur in such a neat pattern. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DA8E40>],/factchecks/2020/apr/09/facebook-posts/pandemics-covid-havent-hit-exactly-every-100-years/

Post about Bill Gates’ work on vaccine tracking distorts research, timeline
","If living through a pandemic doesn’t already make you feel like you’re walking around in a brave, new world, then conspiratorial social media posts about the global outbreak may push you to the brink. According to a claim we spotted on Instagram and beyond, Bill Gates ""is pushing"" an effort during the current outbreak to track Americans using bracelets and invisible tattoos that would be delivered alongside a vaccine.  The theory also insinuates the project came along ""days"" after Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, stepped down from the company’s board of directors. The post reads:  ""Bill Gates and other globalists, in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, are reportedly working to push tracking bracelets and ‘invisible tattoos’ to monitor Americans during an impending lockdown. MIT and Gates have ‘created an ink that can be safely embedded in the skin alongside the vaccine itself, and it’s only visible using a special smartphone camera app and filter.’ This comes days after Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has helped fund research into increased vaccine tracking, especially in under-resourced communities, but this post makes unsupported assertions and distorts the timeline of that research. Let’s take a look. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are seeking to address vaccine tracking challenges in developing countries by creating an invisible ink that could be injected into children along with vaccines. The study began in July 2016, MIT told us, more than three years before the first novel coronavirus cases emerged. It was not inspired by the current outbreak. The idea behind the research is that the dye would be visible under near-infrared light for up to five years and provide a quick, affordable way of helping health providers keep track of a child’s vaccinations, even when paperwork gets lost or parents forget whether their child is up to date. The dye wouldn’t monitor people’s habits or movements, as the Instagram post implies. It would essentially be a marker to see if someone received a vaccine upon inspection by a medical official. RELATED: Bill Gates warned in 2015 that we were unprepared for an infectious virus  Researchers say accurate vaccine record-keeping remains a major challenge in low-resource areas around the world, where ""well-maintained centralized databases do not exist,"" which ""contributes to 1.5 million vaccine-preventable deaths annually."" Scientists hope an invisible, embeddable medical record that could accompany vaccines could help solve that problem. The Gates Foundation has contributed funds for this research. Some governments such as Hong Kong are using electronic wristbands to track people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in order to enforce quarantines and reduce the spread of the virus. But we find no evidence in news archives or other internet searches that Gates specifically stated he is ""pushing"" or advocating for the development of tracking bracelets. The only mention of ""bracelets"" we could find associated with Gates came about in 2012, when the Gates Foundation funded a study into bracelets that would measure student engagement in classrooms.  That said, Gates has said he supports the idea of a national tracking system to monitor the virus that causes COVID-19. In a March 18 Ask Me Anything session on Reddit, Gates lauded South Korea’s tracking system, which  uses a smartphone app to gather information about COVID-19 spread. He said that, although thousands of tests are being offered per day at the University of Washington in Seattle, for example, ""no one is connected to a national tracking system"" and that ""whenever there is a positive test it should be seen to understand where the disease is and whether we need to strengthen the social distancing."" Gates has been interested in vaccinations and vaccination tracking, particularly in low-resource areas, for several years. He stepped down from Microsoft’s board of directors on March 13, 2020. And, as we mentioned, MIT’s research into a vaccination-related invisible ink program has been going on for several years as well.  MIT published a study on its research on Dec. 18, 2019, in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The research was submitted to the journal in July 2019, and an MIT spokesperson told PolitiFact that it began back in 2016 — years before the first cases of the virus were reported. The Gates Foundation told PolitiFact that it awarded a grant to MIT to improve the way childhood vaccinations are tracked; it had nothing to do with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak. Additional funding also came from the National Cancer Institute.  ""The researchers are exploring storing data in a pattern of dye, invisible to the naked eye, that is delivered under the skin at the same time as the vaccine. The technology is currently in the proof-of-concept phase,"" the foundation told PolitiFact in an email. ""If successful, governments could elect to incorporate this kind of tool in their immunization programs in place of, or in addition to, their current methods of tracking vaccinations."" None of the research is specific to America, as the Instagram post suggests. Nor is it tied specifically to COVID-19. An online post says that Bill Gates is pushing tracking bracelets and invisible tattoos to monitor Americans during the novel coronavirus pandemic. We find no evidence that Gates has supported the concept of ""tracking bracelets."" His foundation awarded a grant to MIT to study invisible dyes that could accompany vaccines to keep track of vaccinations in developing countries. But this research began in 2016, and there is no evidence that it has anything to do with the current coronavirus pandemic, or to ""monitor"" Americans specifically.  This post takes a small kernel of truth and frames it in a way that gives a misleading impression.

"['Elections', 'Supreme Court', 'Wisconsin', 'Facebook posts']","
Did Supreme Court vote remotely to “deny Wisconsin voters their right to vote remotely”? Yes and no
","A pair of high court rulings set the stage for Wisconsin’s April 7, 2020 pandemic election. The Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down an order from Gov. Tony Evers that would have moved the election back to June, which kept in-person voting in place. And the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that all absentee ballots had to be postmarked by Election Day, reversing a federal judge’s order, forcing thousands who requested but didn’t receive an absentee ballot to vote in person if they wanted their vote to count. A viral image on Facebook claims the latter ruling had some irony to it. ""Conservative Supreme Court Justices vote remotely to deny Wisconsin voters their right to vote remotely,"" the April 7, 2020, post says, accompanied by pictures of the five men comprising the conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  There are a couple elements here — the method of voting and the claim about voting rights. Let’s investigate. The highest court in the land did indeed issue its April 6, 2020, Wisconsin election ruling without meeting in person. Beginning with a March 20, 2020, conference, the Supreme Court has functioned remotely, according to Richard Wolf, who covers the court for USA TODAY. It has postponed all oral arguments for March and April. It’s been a while since that happened, the court said. ""The Court’s postponement of argument sessions in light of public health concerns is not unprecedented,"" a March 16, 2020, release said. ""The Court postponed scheduled arguments for October 1918 in response to the Spanish flu epidemic. The Court also shortened its argument calendars in August 1793 and August 1798 in response to yellow fever outbreaks."" The second part of this claim isn’t so simple, asserting there is a right to vote remotely that was stripped away. We’ll start by backing up a step. The issue before the U.S. Supreme Court was whether to allow ballots postmarked after Election Day to be counted as long as they arrived by April 13. A prior federal court ruling had extended the deadline by which clerks had to receive absentee ballots from April 7 — Election Day — to April 13. Republicans argued those ballots still had to be postmarked by Election Day in order to count, while Democrats argued anything that arrived by April 13 should be allowed — effectively extending the election by six days. By a 5-4 vote, with all conservative justices in favor, the Supreme Court ruled ballots had to be postmarked by Election Day. ""Extending the date by which ballots may be cast by voters — not just received by the municipal clerks but cast by voters — for an additional six days after the scheduled election day fundamentally alters the nature of the election,"" the majority opinion says. So did that amount to denying voters their rights to vote remotely? The longstanding remote voting availability in Wisconsin has been that voters are permitted to submit absentee ballots up to Election Day. That was not changed. The high court simply denied a request to extend beyond Election Day the period in which votes could be turned in. The nuance here is that thousands of Wisconsinites never received the absentee ballots they requested — in some cases well before the election. So those voters were denied the ability to vote remotely, but that was due to systematic errors in ballot distribution, not directly via Supreme Court action. Liberals argued accommodations should have been made for those people who did not receive ballots they requested in the required timeframe (up to the Friday before the election). A Facebook post says conservative Supreme Court justices voted remotely ""to deny Wisconsin voters their right to vote remotely."" The court vote involved did take place remotely. But the latter half of this claim overreaches. The traditional ""right"" to vote remotely involves submitting an absentee ballot by Election Day. That right was not taken away. The high court simply did not extend that right to days past the election as Democrats requested. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A1100>],/factchecks/2020/apr/09/facebook-posts/did-supreme-court-vote-remotely-deny-wisconsin-vot/
"['Texas', 'Louie Gohmert']","
No, a powder in Germany can't kill coronavirus on contact and for 14 days
","During a live interview on a local television station in East Texas, U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert discussed the coronavirus and measures he says some health care workers around the world are taking to stay safe while treating patients who have tested positive for the virus.  Gohmert, a Republican from Tyler, said he recently spoke with an Arizona-based company that is producing a powder that, when mixed with water, can kill the coronavirus on contact. He said the same product, or one like it, is already in use in Germany, and he is trying to get the Arizona-based product ""fast-tracked"" in the United States. ""It is being used in Germany as a mist,"" he said. ""Health care workers go through a misting tent going into the hospital and it kills the coronavirus completely dead not only right then, but any time in the next 14 days that the virus touches anything that’s been sprayed it is killed."" The problem with Gohmert’s statement? No such product exists and nothing similar is in use in Germany. ""What your congressman said is absolute nonsense,"" said Dr. Jörn Wegner, a spokesman for Deutsche Krankenhausgesellschaft, or the German Hospital Association. ""There are no such tents and there’s no powder or magical cure."" Gohmert’s office did not return a request for more information about his statement, including what substance constitutes this powder and the name of the company in Arizona that he says is working on such a product. It is possible Gohmert was thinking of recent news reports of sterilization stations in use in China — images show individuals being sprayed with mist as they walk through a tunnel — but experts said the bleach-type sprays being used at these stations are likely not effective against the coronavirus. Protective measures in Germany A search of top news publications in Germany and the United States revealed no recent articles published about a powder or disinfectant being used on hospital employees that kills the virus on contact and for 14 days after the fact. While Germany has been hit hard by the coronavirus, it is also among the countries with the lowest fatality rate. News outlets have explored why Germany has reported such a low fatality rate, including analyzing how its hospitals are handling the outbreak. But those reports have not mentioned a substance like the one Gohmert described. In Germany, health authorities at the state level are responsible for hospital planning and operation while the Federal Ministry of Health  drafts overarching policies and regulations. Sebastian Gülde, spokesman for the Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, or Federal Ministry of Health, said he is aware of some hospitals that are using tents for screening for symptoms of the virus, but he did not have knowledge of a product like the one Gohmert described. ""I did not hear of a disinfecting agent that keeps pathogens away for two weeks,"" Gülde said. Gülde directed PolitiFact’s inquiry to the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Krankenhaushygiene, the German Society of Hospital Hygiene, which issues recommendations on best practices for hospital hygiene and health. Thomas Ruttkowski, the organization’s spokesman, said there is no product like the one Gohmert described. ""I’m sorry, but we did not heard about that magic powder,"" he said in an email. ""Thank you for your mail. … Finally, something to laugh about."" Protecting against the virus During the interview, Gohmert mentioned that a company in Arizona was developing a similar product, but his team did not return a request for more information about the company or its product. A thorough web search did not return results for news stories or company websites for a business that may be working on producing this kind of powder-like product that can kill the coronavirus on contact. Currently, no disinfectant of this nature has been highlighted by the Environmental Protective Agency as being effective for use against SARS-CoV-2  (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19). None of these products registered with the EPA are approved for use on people. They are strictly surface disinfectants. Amy Cross, project coordinator at the National Pesticide Information Center, said she is not aware of a product on the list of EPA-regulated surface disinfectants that meets the description Gohmert offered. There are some products that are powder-based and can be combined with water and used in a liquid form, Cross said. But like all of the disinfectants on the list, the product is a liquid and has a set contact time — the amount of time a surface needs to stay wet with a product for it to be effective. Cross said this time varies by product, ranging from 15 seconds to 15 minutes. ""The idea that it would have residual activity after the surface is no longer wet to kill that virus is incredibly surprising to me, because I haven’t found any other products that have those similar claims,"" she said of the powder Gohmert described. When reached for comment, a World Health Organization spokesperson pointed to the group’s guidelines for ""infection prevention and control"" geared towards health care workers treating individuals who are likely infected with the coronavirus. The guidelines do not make mention of a disinfectant like the one Gohmert mentioned. They emphasize the need for workers to use personal protective equipment when necessary and practice rigorous hand hygiene. The WHO guidelines also emphasize the importance of ""environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures"" and state that washing surfaces with ""water and detergent and applying commonly used hospital-level disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite) are effective and sufficient procedures."" Wegner of the German Hospital Association echoed these recommendations. ""The only protection against the virus are personal protection equipment – masks, disposable coats and gloves – and proper hygiene,"" he said. Our ruling Gohmert said that there is a powder substance that, when mixed with water, is being used as a disinfecting mist in Germany. ""Health care workers go through a misting tent going into the hospital and it kills the coronavirus completely dead not only right then, but any time in the next 14 days that the virus touches anything that’s been sprayed it is killed,"" he said. But no such product seems to exist and no similar product is in use in Germany. There are no products currently in use as disinfecting agents in the United States that come close to meeting the description Gohmert offered. Gohmert did not return a request seeking more information about his statement. His statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim; we rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973CAEC0>],/factchecks/2020/apr/09/louie-gohmert/no-powder-germany-cant-kill-coronavirus-contact-an/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says utility prices have risen under Barack Obama
","
In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Mitt Romney sought to show how the economy has stumbled under President Barack Obama.

""In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class,"" he said. ""Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled.""

In this item, we’ll look at one of those claims -- that under the ""Obama economy ... utility bills are higher.""

When we contacted the Romney campaign, a spokesman said Romney was referring to electricity prices. But in his speech he said ""utilities,"" so we'll also examine other types, too.

We found data for electricity, natural gas, home heating oil, propane, telephone services, and combined data for water, sewer and trash services. We looked specifically at prices for residential customers rather than commercial or other sectors. We also attempted, where possible, to compare the same months in 2009 and 2012, in order to eliminate any impact from cyclical or seasonal variations. We’ll take each type of utility in turn.

Electricity

The Energy Information Administration, the federal agency that tracks energy statistics, offers data on average retail prices for electricity residential customers in cents per kilowatt hour.

In 2009, Obama’s first year, it was 11.51 cents, then rose in 2010 to 11.55 cents and again in 2011 to 11.80 cents. Through the first six months of 2012, it fell slightly to 11.79 cents.

So overall, electricity is up by about 2.4 percent over the three-and-a-half year period, or less than 1 percent a year. On this score, Romney is correct.

Natural gas

Obama does better if you look at natural gas. The agency has data for the first five months of 2012, as well as monthly data stretching back for years before that. Specifically, the agency measures dollars per thousand cubic feet for residential customers.

When you compare each of the five months in 2009 to its equivalent month in 2012, prices have dropped in every case.

For instance, in January 2009, natural gas was $12.49; by January 2012, it was $9.55. And in May 2009, natural gas was $12.86, a price that by May 2012 had dropped to $12.19.

So for natural gas, prices have consistently fallen under Obama, often by larger percentages than the rise in electricity.

Home heating oil

Data from the same agency shows that home heating oil was $2.42 per gallon during the week of Jan. 19, 2009, but rose to $3.94 by the week of Jan. 23, 2012. That’s a 62 percent increase over three years, or roughly 20 percent per year -- a big spike.

Residential propane

Agency data shows an increase for residential propane prices. For the week of Jan. 19, 2009, residential propane was $2.31 a gallon, a price that rose by the week of Jan. 23, 2012, to $2.86 a gallon. That’s a 24 percent increase, or about 8 percent a year.

Water, sewer and trash collection

The Consumer Price Index -- the government’s primary measurement of inflation -- calculates a combined measurement for water, sewer and trash collection. It’s an index, meaning that the raw numbers we report below don’t correspond to specific dollar amounts per unit but rather provide a way to compare the movements of prices over a given period of time.

In July 2009, the index stood at 161.4. By July 2012, it rose to 189.8. That’s an increase of 18 percent, or 6 percent a year.

Telephone services

The Consumer Price Index also studies telephone prices. In July 2009, the index stood at 102.6 and fell by July 2012 to 101.6. That’s a decrease, though by less than 1 percent per year.

Are the increases unique to Obama?

Over time, utility prices consistently go up, according to George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. In fact, rising prices are more the rule than the exception.

For example, we looked at how prices for each of these utilities moved during a three-year period of George W. Bush's presidency before Obama took office. We used the same data sources as we did above:

Electricity: Up 11 percent from 2006 to 2009, or almost 4 percent per year.

Natural gas: Down approximately 10 percent in each of the first five months of the year in 2006 and 2009, or a decline of a bit more than 3 percent a year.

Home heating oil: Down by less than 1 percent between January 2006 and January 2009

Residential propane: Down about 15 percent between January 2006 and January 2009, or about 5 percent per year.

Water, sewer and trash collection: Up about 18 percent between July 2006 and July 2009, or about 6 percent a year.

Telephone services: Up about 7 percent between July 2006 and July 2009, or more than 2 percent per year.

So under President George W. Bush, three of the six utilities we checked saw increases and three saw decreases – not radically different than the four increases and two decreases under Obama.

In fact, for the one measurement the Romney campaign specifically cited when we asked -- electricity prices – rates rose at a significantly faster pace under Bush than they did under Obama.

Assigning credit and blame

Finally, when speakers make claims that seek to assign credit or blame for a particular statistic, PolitiFact typically looks at the question in two ways: Is the statistic right? And is the claim accurate in its assignment of credit or blame?

As we’ve ruled in the past, presidential policies have some impact on the energy sector due to the government’s regulatory role. But the international marketplace and other factors play a role as well. Sinclair, the economist, agreed with that assessment.

Our ruling

Romney said that under the ""Obama economy ... utility bills are higher.""

Under Obama, electricity, heating oil, propane and water-sewer-trash prices did rise, as Romney indicated. But natural gas and telephone prices fell.

Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn touts drop in unemployment rate
","
Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn eschewed his political views and focused on Tampa’s improving economy during his welcome address at the Republican National Convention.

""We are leading Florida out of the recession,"" he said during his brief remarks. ""Unemployment is declining faster here than almost anywhere else.""

While there are several ways to take the economy’s temperature, Buckhorn is echoing a tactic by Gov. Rick Scott to tout the unemployment rate as a sign of success. Buckhorn later told us he used the unemployment rate as a yardstick because ""it shows we are emerging out of this recession. I think it’s progress.""

We wanted to know if unemployment is declining faster in Tampa than anywhere else in the nation.

Buckhorn’s evidence was a short article in the Tampa Bay Times that said that ""Tampa Bay tied for the second-largest drop in unemployment over the past year among major metro areas.""

We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government agency that tracks employment data, for more details. We first looked at the latest data Buckhorn had available to him when he spoke on Tuesday.

The agency, it turns out, doesn’t measure unemployment in ""Tampa"" as Buckhorn described but rather the metro area of Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater. The unemployment rate in the Tampa metro area dropped 2.2 percentage points from June 2011 through June 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That tied for thesecond-largest decline among 49 metro areas with a population of at least 1 million people.

(New data released Wednesday changed the 12-month decline in unemployment from 11.3 percent to 9.4 percent for the year ending in July. At a difference of 1.9 percentage points, it is the highest of all major metro areas.)

Even though construction jobs continued to languish, the area posted notable over-the-year gains in leisure and hospitality, and professional and business services, according to the Tampa Hillsborough Economic Development Corp.

So the statistic is largely accurate, though Buckhorn shorthanded the Tampa/St. Petersburg metro area as Tampa and used a figure that only compares major metropolitan areas.

There’s another thing to note.

The unemployment rate in the Tampa area remains higher than the national and state averages. Also, the unemployment rate does not account for Florida’s contracted labor force, which is smaller now because people have given up on finding work. The Florida Legislature’s economic research agency found that nearly 70 percent of the drop in Florida’s unemployment rate can be attributed to a shrinking workforce, not new jobs. The unemployment rate would be much higher had the workforce held steady, stated the August 2012 report.

""I would say nationally and statewide we want the unemployment rate to come down, but not because the labor force is shrinking,"" said Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist.

Economists say an increased unemployment rate actually could be a better economic indicator because it may signal that discouraged workers are coming back to the labor force.

Still, Snaith said, ""there's some real growth in (the Tampa area), granted we know it's not been everything that it should be or could be.""

Our ruling

Buckhorn said that the unemployment rate is declining faster in Tampa ""than almost anywhere else.""

We have a few quibbles with that. Buckhorn could have more clear that he was referring to a part of the Tampa Bay area and that the statistic only measures metropolitan areas.

Also, the real story behind a declining rate isn’t always so cheery. It doesn’t account for discouraged workers, which are the biggest drivers behind Florida’s falling rate.

On the flip side, he gives himself some cover with use of the word ""almost,"" and the metro area has seen a significant dip in the unemployment rate.

On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.

"['Oregon', 'Workers', 'Democratic Party of Oregon']","
Did Bruce Starr vote to throw 6,000 people off unemployment?
","
Oregon Labor Commissioner might be a nonpartisan office -- but that hasn’t stopped the Democratic and Republican parties from taking sides in the campaign fight between Bruce Starr (a Republican state senator) and Brad Avakian (a former Democratic state senator and the current commissioner).

In a recent press release, the Democratic Party of Oregon accused Starr of coming down hard on unemployed workers at the height of the recession.

Starr, the release said, revealed ""his hostility to the basic mission of the Bureau of Labor and Industries"" with one vote in particular.

Back in 2009, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3483. The bill did a few things. First up, it offered a 13-week extension in unemployment benefits. Second, it allowed those who were receiving unemployment benefits to turn down work, so long as they were enrolled in a worker training program and the job paid less than 110 percent of minimum wage.

The measure passed pretty overwhelmingly in the House with 47 members voting in favor. It was the same story in the Senate where 25 voted ""yes."" Starr, however, was one of four who voted ""no.""

""At the time, Bruce Starr's vote would have thrown 6,000 Oregonians off unemployment,"" the press release alleges.

PolitiFact Oregon decided to do a little digging.

First, we pulled up the legislative fiscal analysis of the bill. It mentioned that 2,400 additional claimants would be added to the program each year if the bill passed, but it didn’t say anything about 6,000 people losing their benefits.

We asked folks at the Democratic Party of Oregon where they got the number and they pointed us to a story that appeared in The Oregonian, which attributed the figure to ""the state.""Still, we needed the actual source.

After a few more phone calls, we were pointed toward Craig Spivey, a spokesman with the Oregon Employment Department. He confirmed the number. Back when the bill was passed, folks could stay on unemployment for about 100 weeks, thanks to a series of federal and state extensions passed for the recession. That time frame has since been reduced to the more standard 26 weeks.

We called Sen. Starr to see why he voted the way he did on the legislation. He said he was more concerned about the change in policy that allowed (albeit temporarily) those on unemployment to turn down work.

""That's a significant departure,"" he said. ""The goal is, we need people to get back to work, we need to create an environment where people have jobs.""

Without the bill, it’s clear, based on numbers from the Unemployment Department, that 6,000 people would have been cycled off unemployment. (In fact, that number is closer to 12,000 if you consider the full life of the extension.) That said, we think there’s a difference between voting against an extension and actively voting to kick people off of something -- as the Democrats allege. Moreover, the bill wasn’t a matter of a simple extension; it also temporarily allowed certain beneficiaries to turn down work.

In the end, we think the claim is partially accurate but leaves out some important context. We rate this claim Half True.


CORRECTION: Democratic Reps. Mary Nolan and Brad Witt sponsored House Bill 3483, legislation passed in 2009 that extended the number of weeks an individual living in Oregon could collect unemployment benefits. Rep. Bill Garrard, a Republican from Klamath Falls, had initially sponsored a different bill under the same number, but dropped his support after the content was changed.

"['New Hampshire', 'Education', 'Barack Obama']","
 Romney/Ryan budget would be end of the road for college American Opportunity Tax Credit
","
As a battleground state, New Hampshire sees its share of campaign attacks as national candidates try to catch the eye of Live Free or Die voters. 

The latest shot came in an email from President Barack Obama to New Hampshire reporters titled, ""New Report: Impact of Romney-Ryan Plan on Education in NH.""

""Disappointingly, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan support a plan that would give millionaires tax breaks while cutting college scholarships and other key resources in education that help create a strong middle class,"" Obama said in the email sent Aug. 21. ""Romney thinks that students should ‘borrow money’ or get help from their parents to help pay for college, and under the Romney-Ryan budget, college aid would be cut for nearly 10 million students nationally and the American Opportunity Tax Credit for college tuition would be eliminated.""

PolitiFact already checked Obama and actress Eva Longoria -- a national co-chair for Obama’s re-election campaign -- about part of this claim, which says the plan from Ryan, the House Budget Committee Chairman, would cut Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students.

They each got a Half True.PolitiFact concluded that Obama’s statement was fair using his set of assumptions--that spending cuts called for in Ryan's budget plan would be made evenly across federal programs--but they ignored what House Republicans said was a preference that Pell grant maximums not be reduced.

But the so-called Romney-Ryan budget also would eliminate the American Opportunity Tax Credit? That’s one we hadn’t examined yet, so we decided to check it out.

First, we contacted Obama’s campaign to get sources behind the claim. They didn’t get back to us. We also reached out to Romney’s people, who had no response.

The Urban-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center did give us an answer, however.

Through the Romney campaign website and email exchanges with campaign policy advisors, the Tax Policy Center has issued an analysis of Romney’s ""Fairer, Flatter, and Simpler"" tax plan.

According to the center, Romney’s economic advisers say that the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) would be reverted back to the Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) tax credit if Romney is elected president this year.

HOPE was among higher education tax incentives initiated in 1997 to combat soaring college expenses. Along with the Lifetime Learning Credit, and a deduction for tuition and fees, federal tax subsidies for college students jumped from zero -- before their enactment -- to roughly $6 billion in 2005-2006.

In 2009, an Obama-backed Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which temporarily replaced the 1997 tax credits with the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which was worth more, and available to more families, through a few changes: 
- It increased the amount of student expenses that were eligible for the credit and the types of expenses allowed; the AOTC credit includes expenses for course-related books, supplies and equipment that are not necessarily paid to the educational institution. 
- It extended coverage to a student’s first four years of school--versus just the first two years allowed by HOPE. After the first two years under the HOPE plan, the student switches over to the Lifetime Learning Credit for their last two years of college. 
- It made the tax credit partially refundable. The tax credit is worth up to $2,500 of the cost of tuition, fees and course materials paid during the taxable year, or $10,000 over four years. A cool 40 percent of it, up to $1,000 a year, is refundable, so money became available to more low-income students, even if they owed no taxes. In contrast, the HOPE and LLC credits are nonrefundable. 
""It's basically more generous,"" said Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate with the Tax Policy Center, referring to the American Opportunity Tax Credit. 

Both of the tax credits currently exist, but they can’t be used together.

""No one would’ve opted to take the HOPE over AOTC,"" Rosenberg added.

IRS statistics show that in one year, the number of tax returns claiming education credits increased, from 2008, when 7,740,979 households claimed some education tax credit totaling $7.6 billion, with HOPE, to 2009, when 10,598,706 households claimed total credits of $10.8 billion, with AOTC.

Although the American Opportunity Tax Credit was only intended to be temporary, President Obama’s annual budget proposals extended the tax credit through 2012 and proposed making it permanent, Rosenberg said.

If Romney were elected, however, he would allow it to lapse as scheduled under current law.

""The AOTC was only ever enacted as a temporary provision, so that’s slated to expire with a lot of other tax related things at the end of this year,"" Rosenberg said. ""Absent of any further legislative changes, the AOTC would expire. Without anything else happening, the HOPE would again be available for people to take up.""

But does allowing a tax credit to expire warrant Obama’s characterization as ""elimination?""

""There’s always a sort of debate,"" Rosenberg said. ""People change the way they phrase it depending on how they want it to look, whether an expiring tax provision, to expire as scheduled, is action or not.""

Either way, if no action is taken on the American Opportunity Tax Credit, it puts an end to to the program.

Obama has used this a major talking point in his campaign. In some ads, he has been as vague as to say that Romney will ""eliminate the tax deduction for college tuition."" And he has tried hard to characterize Romney’s budget as favorable to the rich and weakening the middle class, including on the topic of education.

It’s important to keep in mind that even though Romney would allow the credit to expire, that doesn’t mean all tax deductions for college students would be lost.

If Romney does not renew the American Opportunity Tax Credit, students would revert back to using the less generous, nonrefundable alternatives. Because the four-year program is refundable -- it gives something back to students who don’t have enough income to owe taxes -- losing it would impact the lower income population.

Before the American Opportunity Tax Credit was created, low-income students could get little or no benefit from the two nonrefundable tax credits available. And critics complained that they didn’t really impact college enrollment, because it provided subsidies for people who would have pursued secondary education anyway.

Our ruling

Romney’s campaign has said that the former Massachusetts governor will not renew the American Opportunity Tax Credit if he is elected in November. And because it’s slated to expire at the end of 2012, it would no longer be available to college students and their families if no action is taken to extend it, as Obama has done since it was enacted in 2009.

But the AOTC is not the only tax deduction out there for students, as Obama’s ads may lead voters to believe. So while Romney would allow the deduction to end, it does not mean all college tax deductions would be lost. In fact, it would revert back to a previous program that has been in place since 1997. As a result, we rate Obama’s claim Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DB1EC0>],/factchecks/2012/aug/31/barack-obama/romneyryan-budget-would-be-end-road-american-oppor/
"['Abortion', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says those identifying themselves as 'pro-life' are at highest levels ever
","
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., answered questions about abortion on Face the Nation on the eve of the Republican National Convention.

Here is part of Rubio’s response:

""Yes, Mitt Romney is pro-life, and the Republican Party -- although it has diversity on this issue -- is the home of the pro-life movement in American politics,"" Rubio said. ""So are a growing number of Americans, by the way. There is an increasing amount of evidence from public polling that the highest number of Americans ever identify themselves as pro- life.""

We wanted to check to see if Rubio was correct that there is increasing evidence that the highest number of Americans ever identify themselves as pro-life.

Polls that ask respondents to identify as ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice""

The Gallup poll asked this question regularly between 1995 and 2008: ""With respect to the abortion issue, would you consider yourself to be pro-choice or pro-life?"" Those responding ""pro-life"" were anywhere from 33 percent to 46 percent between 1995 and 2008.

In May 2009, there was a change: 51 percent said they were ""pro-life"" and 42 percent ""pro-choice.""

Just two months later in July 2009, the pro-life percentage dropped to 47 percent and stayed in that ballpark for a couple of years.

The most recent Gallup data available -- May 2012 -- shows 50 percent referring to themselves as ""pro-life"" and 41 percent ""pro-choice.""

So that means between 1995 and 2012, the percentage considering themselves pro-life rose from 33 percent to 50 percent. And the percentage identifying as ""pro-choice"" dropped from 56 percent to 41 percent.

Gallup said that the ""pro-choice"" response was at a record low in 2012. It stated that identification with the labels had shifted ""from a wide lead for the pro-choice position in the mid-1990s, to a generally narrower lead for ‘pro-choice’ -- from 1998 through 2008 -- to a close division between the two positions since 2009.""

Gallup found the pro-life position ahead twice -- in May 2009 and May 2012 -- but said it remained to be seen whether those were temporary spikes or would be sustained.

Gallup noted that Democrats’ positions changed the least on abortion, while the percentage of Republicans and independents identifying as pro-life increased. The recent shift in abortion views is not due to a change in the political composition of the samples, Gallup said.

We found one other poll that asks respondents if they identify with ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice.""
PollingReport.com, which lists multiple polls from different organizations, showed that a Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll in 2011 asked ""on the issue of abortion, would you say you are more pro-life or more pro-choice?"" Starting in 2009, each year more respondents chose ""pro-life"" than ""pro-choice."" (This poll showed occasionally pro-life edged out pro-choice narrowly in a few additional years.) For the most recent year listed, 50 percent said ""pro-life"" while 42 percent said ""pro-choice"" in 2011.

 Polls that ask other abortion-related questions

But there are lots of different ways pollsters ask Americans for their opinions on abortion that don’t ask respondents to characterize themselves as ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice.""  These questions show that the abortion debate isn’t black and white -- the results change if pollsters ask Americans if they support abortion under certain circumstances, support Roe v. Wade or other questions about abortion.

Gallup's longest-running measure of abortion views, established in 1975, asks Americans if abortion should be legal in all or certain circumstances or illegal in all circumstances. That middle position of legal in certain circumstances has almost always been in the 50 percent range. The number was 52 percent in May 2012, while 25 percent chose ""legal under any circumstances."" Abortion-rights supporters emphasize that combined statistic to argue that most Americans support abortion in all or some circumstances.

But opponents of abortion rights point to the poll question that shows when asked to narrow ""certain""  circumstances, more choose ""only a few"" rather than ""most"" circumstances. When you add those who chose ""illegal in all circumstances"" and those who said legal in ""few"" that adds up to a majority, said David O’Steen, director of National Right to Life.

Wellesley economics professor Phillip Levine, who wrote a book on abortion policy, said that Rubio’s claim is technically correct since it simply refers to Americans using the ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice"" labels.

""How people label themselves as pro-choice or pro-life is probably of secondary importance to what sorts of policies they support,"" he said. ""In that view of the world there has been very little movement. I would be hard-pressed to imagine other policies that have that level of stability.""

Most Americans have fallen into the middle category for decades of supporting abortion in certain circumstances.

 Our ruling

Rubio said, ""There is an increasing amount of evidence from public polling that the highest number of Americans ever identify themselves as pro-life.""

Rubio’s claim is carefully worded. He referred to Americans identifying themselves as ""pro-life,"" so that would allow him to zero in on polls that specifically ask questions about labels.

Gallup polls show that the percentage of Americans that consider themselves ""pro-life"" has increased from 33 percent in 1995 to 50 percent in May 2012.  

But policy matters more than labels. When pollsters ask respondents other questions about abortion -- such as if they favor abortion in limited cases -- the answers become more complicated, and it’s not easy to categorize those positions as ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice."" Rubio has avoided those nuances, however, by carefully wording his statement.

We rate this claim Mostly True.

"['Debt', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Voting Record', 'Texas', 'John Cornyn']","
John Cornyn says when Democrats controlled Congress and White House, federal spending as share of economy leapt to 25.2 percent -- a record post-war increase
","
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, recently declared an ""inconvenient factoid"" about Democrats and spending. 
Cornyn’s Aug. 21, 2012, Facebook post says next that ""when Ds controlled Congress and WH: federal spending as a share of GDP leapt from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.2 percent in 2009 (this was the largest such increase in ANY 8 year period since WWII).""

That is, Cornyn says, federal spending in comparison to the nation’s economic production, or Gross Domestic Product, spiked.

Asked how the senator reached his conclusion, his spokesman, Scott Gosnell, pointed us to a chart in a report by the Office of Management and Budget, the budget-policy arm of the executive branch. And according to the chart, federal outlays were equivalent to 18.2 percent of the GDP in 2001 and 25.2 percent of the GDP in 2009, as Cornyn says. Such spending dipped to 24.1 percent of the GDP in 2010 and 2011, according to the chart, which appears on a White House web page in connection with President Barack Obama’s proposed budget for the 2013 fiscal year.

And was the 39 percent increase over that period the greatest since World War II?

Seems so.

Federal outlays were equal to 9.8 percent of the GDP in 1940. They were 43.6 percent of the GDP in 1943 and 1944, the chart says, or more than quadruple the 1940 ratio..

From 1947 through 1974, by our calculation, the ratio averaged 18 percent. It was 20 percent to nearly 24 percent each year from 1975 through 1997, dropping to 18.5 percent in 1999. In other words, we did not spot any eight-year post-WW II spikes bigger than the one underscored by Cornyn.

Then again, we noticed, federal spending as a share of GDP averaged 20 percent over his cited years, not much greater than in previous years. Also, in two years, 2004 and 2007, federal spending compared with the GDP was slightly down from the previous year.

Next, we looked into whether Democrats controlled Congress and the White House over the cited years, as Cornyn says.

Not exactly.

A Democrat, Bill Clinton, was president for about four months at the start of the 2001 fiscal year. But George W. Bush, a Republican, was president from Jan. 20, 2001, until Obama, a Democrat, was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2009. Obama accounts for a little more than eight months of the cited years.

And did Democrats rule Congress over those years?

Occasionally, though Republicans were dominant for longer spells.

As we noted in an earlier fact check, the GOP controlled the House from 1995 through 2006, while Democrats controlled the House from 2007 through 2010, as detailed on a House web page. According to a Senate web page, Republicans were the upper chamber’s majority party in 2000 through early June 2001 and again from Nov. 12, 2002, through 2006. Democrats have comprised the majority since 2007.

So, a Republican was president for all but one of the cited years and Republicans held the House majority for six of the nine years and a Senate majority for about four years and seven months of the nine years -- with Democrats holding the Senate majority for four years and five months.

Still, Democrats held House and Senate majorities from 2007 through 2010 -- and Obama was president for 2009 and 2010. Over this more limited time period, the ratio of spending to the GDP escalated from nearly 21 percent to 25.2 percent before dropping to 24.1 percent.

We asked Cornyn’s office about the mixed-bag dominance of Democrats in his cited period. Gosnell replied by email that Cornyn ""was making the point that out of the 8-point increase in outlays between 2001-2009, the majority of that increase (5.5 points) occurred in just three years – 2007-2009 – the same three years the Democrats controlled both chambers and then the WH in 2009. The point is: the huge jump in outlays occurred with D’s in charge.""

That’s an interesting focus, yet not what Cornyn wrote on Facebook.

The theme of Gosnell’s reply, that the brunt of the spending-to-GDP uptick occurred when Democrats were dominant, was explored in a June 4, 2012, article by our colleagues at FactCheck.org, headlined: ""Obama’s Spending: ‘Inferno’ or Not?"" That article says the one-year 19 percent spending surge in fiscal 2009 ""was mostly due to appropriations and policies that were already in place when Obama took office"" in January 2009, the fourth month of the fiscal year. Obama’s spending initiatives, the story says, increased that year’s spending by up to $203 billion, or well under half the year’s overall increase, which was caused in part by bank bailout legislation approved by President Bush.

The FactCheck.org article mentions a May 24, 2012, analysis in Forbes by Daniel J. Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, giving responsibility for even less of the 2009 increase to Obama. Generally, Mitchell concluded that since President Lyndon Johnson’s tenure, George W. Bush shakes out, like Johnson and Richard Nixon, a ""relatively profligate"" president.

We asked Mitchell about Cornyn’s recent statement blaming Democrats for the spending-to-GDP increase. Mitchell replied by email that while most of the key spending increases occurred after Democrats won control of Congress in the 2006 elections, the bumps also had Bush’s approval, ""so both parties deserve blame.""

Finally, the story by FactCheck.org says that the health care overhaul Obama signed into law in 2010 calls for a new spending wave, starting in 2014, to subsidize coverage for millions of Americans who would otherwise lack it -- adding an estimated $110 billion to federal outlays in fiscal 2015, and more in later years. Significantly, too, the story says, government revenue receipts are running well below historical averages.

""It is the combination of historically high spending and low revenues that is producing the current string of trillion-dollar annual deficits, and piling up debt,"" FactCheck.org said. ""Those who blame deficits solely on spending ignore the other side of the ledger.""

Our ruling

Cornyn said that when Democrats controlled Congress and the White House, federal spending as a share of the GDP leapt from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.2 percent in 2009 -- the largest such increase in any eight-year period since World War II.

Those percentages and the claim to a post-war record are correct. However, Democrats were in control of Congress solely in the last few years of the period and held the presidency for only eight of the 108 cited months. All told, Cornyn’s claim has the math right but errs significantly by laying all the blame on Democrats. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A7B040>],/factchecks/2012/aug/31/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-when-democrats-controlled-congres/
"['Message Machine 2012', 'State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Crossroads GPS']","
Crossroads says state spending increased under Tim Kaine, causing budget shortfalls
","
Crossroads GPS, a conservative advocacy group, has been airing a TV ad accusing Democrat U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine of being a big spender.

""When Tim Kaine was governor, spending soared, blowing holes in the budget every year,"" the commercial begins. There’s a grainy picture of of the former governor on the screen with the words, ""Tim Kaine’s Record: Spending Up $5 Billion.""

The ad cuts against the image Kaine claims as a taskmaster who slashed spending when he was governor from 2006 to 2010 to balance the state budget during the Great Recession. Kaine has often compared his fiscal record to that of his opponent, Republican George Allen, whom he criticizes for casting votes in the U.S. Senate that expanded the nation’s debt.

Fact-checking Crossroads’ statement requires us to make two determinations: 1) Did spending soar under Kaine and, if so; 2) Did increased spending create holes, or revenue shortfalls, in the budget each year of Kaine’s administration?

Did spending soar under Kaine?

Nate Hudson, a spokesman for Crossroads, said the super PAC got its $5 billion figure from the 2009 Comprehensive Annual Report conducted by the Virginia Department of Accounts. Hudson pointed to a table that shows ""general government expenditures"" were $25.3 billion when Kaine took office midway through the fiscal year that started July 1, 2005. The chart shows spending rose to $30.4 billion during the budget year that began July 1, 2008.

The total increase in spending during those three years comes to $5.1 billion.

But the DOA report is not a good source for computing state spending, according to Secretary of Finance Ric Brown. It is an audit of most -- but not all -- government revenues and expenditures.

So we turned to the actual budgets under Kaine.

When Kaine became governor, the total state budget was $32 billion. It rose to $37.1 billion in during fiscal 2008-09, the last year Crossroads counted. Under this measure, total spending increased by $5.1 billion -- the same figure in the auditing report.

This, however, is a conservative tally. Crossroads does not count the final $37.9 billion budget that was approved while Kaine was in office and went into effect on July 1, 2009. When we include it, the total increase in spending comes to $5.9 billion. That’s an 18.4 percent rise in raw- dollar outlays over four years; 9 percent when adjusted for inflation. Total spending during the terms of the six governors before Kaine rose by an average of 32.1 percent in raw dollars; 16.1 percent when adjusted for inflation.

As we’ve noted before, judging governors by overall spending may be unfair. That’s because more than half of the state’s outlays over the last three decades have come from the non-general fund, over which governors have little or no control.

Roughly two-thirds of the fund consists of earmarked federal grants, tuition payments set and received by state colleges and medical fees set and received by state hospitals. The rest comes from a variety of taxes earmarked for transportation, the sale and rent of state properties, interest on accounts, unemployment compensation taxes paid by employers and payments from a 1998 legal settlement with tobacco companies.

A cleaner measure of a governor’s fiscal record comes from examining the general fund, which supports public education, health and public safety. It’s mostly supported by state income and sales taxes over which a governor has strong influence.

Kaine, in promoting his record as a budget slicer, refers to cuts he made to the general fund. We recently rated as True his claim that the general fund shrank during his governorship; it stood at $15.1 billion at the start of his administration and dropped to $14.8 billion at the end. That’s a 2 percent decrease. Under the six governors before Kaine, the general fund grew by an average 33.8 percent.

Kaine’s success in cutting the general fund, however, relied in part on the growth of the non-general revenues. Towards the end of his administration, the non-general fund was boosted by $2.4 billion in federal stimulus money to help Virginia get through the recession. About $1.5 billion of it was used to support general fund programs.

In addition, state general fund support for higher education was $80 million a year less at the end of Kaine’s term than it was at the beginning. State colleges and universities more than made up the difference with tuition and fee hikes totaling $474 million, which accrued to the non-general fund.

There are two key points to keep in mind in considering Crossroads’ statement that spending soared under Kaine: 1) All of the increase took place in the non-general fund over which governors have little or no control, and; 2) The increase in total state spending during Kaine’s term was roughly half the average of the six governors who preceded him. 
Did the spending increase cause budget shortfalls?

Kaine, as we’ve noted, became governor in January 2006, midway through a fiscal year. The budget he inherited closed out with a $1.6 billion surplus on June 30, 2006.

Trouble began the next year, as Virginia and the nation began to slide into a deep recession that ran from December 2007 to June 2009. Revenues from income and sales taxes began to dip, creating general fund shortfalls in each of the four final budgets during Kaine’s term.

Again, all of the shortfalls occurred in the general fund budget -- which the governor and the General Assembly fully control.

In fiscal 2007, state revenues began falling off. That year, revenues fell short by $300 million. In fiscal 2008, there was as $641 million shortfall. The next year, Kaine and the General Assembly faced a $1.8 billion revenue gap, followed by a $4.5 billion shortage at the end of Kaine’s term in early 2010.

The cumulative total of the shortfalls over the final four budgets was about $7.2 billion. Kaine and the General Assembly -- constitutionally required to keep the state budget balanced -- took many steps to close the gap. They cut funding to education, health and public safety programs. They withdrew about $900 million from the state’s emergency reserve fund, transferred funds through complicated bookkeeping maneuvers and -- as we said before -- used $1.5 billion of federal stimulus money to help support general fund services.

Virginia was hardly the only state in distress during the recession and its aftermath. Data from the National Association of State Budget Officers shows 13 states faced shortfalls in 2008, 43 in 2009 and 39 in 2010.

But here’s where Crossroads’ ad claim unravels: There’s no connection between the overall rise in the state budget under Kaine and the revenue shortfalls he faced.
All of the increase in spending occurred in the non-general fund, over which governors have little or no control. As we mentioned, money in this fund mostly comes from federal grants, college tuition payments, state hospital fees and several Virginia taxes dedicated to transportation.

On the flip side, all of the shortfalls occurred in a different portion of the budget supported by a separate set on revenues. The problems were in the general fund, which is largely supported by by state income and sales taxes which pay for schools, public safety and health programs.

Our ruling

Crossroads said, ""When Tim Kaine was governor, spending soared, blowing holes in the budget every year."" Let’s sum up our two-part test for fact-checking this claim:

1. Did spending soar under Kaine? The total state budget went up by $5.9 billion during Kaine’s term, representing an 18.4 percent increase increase in raw dollars and 9 percent rise adjusted for inflation. Kaine had little control over the growth, which was largely the result of increases in federal grants, college tuition and fees charged by state hospitals. Overall spending did increase under Kaine; whether it ""soared"" is a matter of opinion. The total budget under Kaine increased at half the average rate of the six governors who preceded him.

2. Did spending growth cause the shortfalls? The answer is no. All of the budget growth occurred in the non-general fund and were largely the result of actions by the federal government and state universities. All of the shortfalls occurred  in the general fund that depends on a separate set of revenues to pay for public education, public safety and health programs. Lower-than-expected receipts from Virginia’s sales and income taxes blew holes in the general fund -- a blight that afflicted all but a few states at the end of the recession. Virginia’s general fund decreased during Kaine’s term.

So there is an element of truth in the first part of the statement. But Crossroads fails to establish a critical link between the spending increase and the revenue deficits. As a result, the claim is misleading and we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097083480>],/factchecks/2012/aug/31/crossroads-gps/crossroads-says-state-spending-increased-under-tim/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Mitt Romney']","
In his first TV interview as president, Obama said we ""should talk to Iran,"" Romney charges
","
The only good thing Mitt Romney had to say about President Barack Obama’s foreign policy record was he ""gave the order, and Seal Team Six took out Osama bin Laden.""

From that point in Romney’s speech accepting the Republican Party presidential nomination, he quickly pivoted to zinging Obama for his policies on Israel, Cuba, Russia, Poland and, possibly worst of all, Iran.

""On another front, every American is less secure today because he has failed to slow Iran's nuclear threat,"" Romney said on Aug. 30, 2012. ""In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to Iran. We're still talking, and Iran’s centrifuges are still spinning.""

Here, we’re fact-checking whether Obama said we should ""talk to Iran"" in his first TV interview.

Obama’s first interview as president came on Jan. 27, 2009, with Hisham Melhem, Washington bureau chief for Al Arabiya. The Dubai-based network is considered less radical than Al Jazeera. News organizations from the New York Times to the Washington Post to MSNBC billed it as his first formal TV interview in the White House.

Obama, who pledged a much different approach with the Middle East than his predecessor, was coming off selecting former Maine Sen. George Mitchell as special envoy to the Middle East. He made calls on his first day in the Oval Office to Arab and Israeli leaders, we’ve noted in a previous fact-check.

""My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy,"" the network quoted Obama as saying.

The question about Iran’s nuclear status was the last one in the interview. Obama stressed diplomacy while frowning on Iran’s threats against Israel and its pursuit of a nuclear weapon that ""could potentially set off an arms race in the region.""

Here is the full exchange, pulled from Al Arabiya’s 2009 story:

Melhem: Will the United States ever live with a nuclear Iran? And if not, how far are you going in the direction of preventing it?

Obama: You know, I said during the campaign that it is very important for us to make sure that we are using all the tools of U.S. power, including diplomacy, in our relationship with Iran.

Now, the Iranian people are a great people, and Persian civilization is a great civilization. Iran has acted in ways that's not conducive to peace and prosperity in the region: their threats against Israel; their pursuit of a nuclear weapon which could potentially set off an arms race in the region that would make everybody less safe; their support of terrorist organizations in the past -- none of these things have been helpful.

But I do think that it is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran, to express very clearly where our differences are, but where there are potential avenues for progress. And we will over the next several months be laying out our general framework and approach. And as I said during my inauguration speech, if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us.

Again, we’re not evaluating in this fact-check whether Obama’s policies on Iran have worked to slow Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons.

But Obama said in his first presidential interview that we should ""be willing to talk to Iran."" Romney’s characterization of that interview is very close. We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972BA4C0>],/factchecks/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney/obama-first-interview-talk-iran/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney said Barack Obama began his presidency with an apology tour
","
In his speech accepting the Republican nomination for president, Mitt Romney repeated a charge he’s made before: that Obama has traveled the world apologizing for America.

""I will begin my presidency with a jobs tour. President Obama began with an apology tour. America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No, Mr. President, America has freed other nations from dictators,"" Romney said.

We first fact-checked this claim back in 2010, when Romney published a book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness.

Obama’s apology tour, Romney wrote, ""is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them.""

""In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations, and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy.""

It’s a common theme for some anti-Obama websites and commentators. But is it accurate?

Obama’s early travels and remarks

We looked at the seven separate speeches Romney mentioned in his book as apologies. (We've compiled those passages in a separate document.)

At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he tends to employ right before he talks about two sides coming together.

At a town hall meeting in France in 2009, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States ""has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive."" But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a ""casual"" and ""insidious"" anti-Americanism.

At a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, ""I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.""

At a speech in Cairo on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply ""move forward.""

Looking back at those 2009 speeches, we noticed that Obama was most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Typically, Obama would say that the U.S. must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama ""unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year.""

 Apologies -- or diplomatic language?

In 2010, we quizzed several experts about whether Obama had apologized. Here’s a brief recap of what they had to say (read more here):

• Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama was definitely apologizing. He co-wrote an analysis on the topic: ""Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower.""

""Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies,"" Gardiner said. ""It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership.""

• John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama used conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing.

""It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,"" Murphy said. ""Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology.""

• Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it.

She said Obama's words fell short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words ""sorry"" or ""regret."" ""I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there,"" Bloom said.

Obama's remarks were really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy.

""Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal,"" Bloom said. ""For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable.""

• We spoke with Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who tracked international human rights issues via the website Political Apologies and Reparations. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery.

""To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent,"" Howard-Hassman said. ""A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it.""

Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said.

""Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect,"" she said. ""But a gesture of respect is not an apology.""

Actual apologies

In the years since we first looked into this matter, Obama or someone in his administration has formally apologized for U.S. actions. In 2012, Obama apologized for the accidental burning of copies of the Quran, the holy book of Islam. Obama sent the apology in a letter to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Officials hoped the formal apology would quell violent reactions against U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

A few months later, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized to Pakistan for a Nov. 26, 2011, incident involving the death of Pakistani troops. The apology was made as part of an effort to re-open supply routes to U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

We should note that these apologies came toward the end of Obama’s first term, while Romney said Obama ""began"" his presidency with an apology tour.

Our ruling

Romney said Obama began his presidency ""with an apology tour.""

But a review of Obama’s foreign travels and remarks during his early presidency showed no evidence to support such a blunt and disparaging claim. (In later years, we found two formal apologies, but they were not at the start of his presidency and not part of a tour.)

While Obama's speeches contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, he typically combined those passages with praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries had erred as well. We found not a single, full-throated apology in the bunch.

Calling those remarks ""an apology tour"" is a ridiculous charge. So we rate his statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097085880>],/factchecks/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-barack-obama-began-his-presidency/

Romney says majority of Americans now pessimistic about next generation
","
Mitt Romney made his case for the presidency by reminding his audience of the optimism they felt four years ago when Barack Obama was elected -- and the pessimism they feel now.

""The majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future,"" Romney said Aug. 30 at the Republican National Convention in Tampa.

We wondered if he was right about Americans’ gloomy outlook.

A poll of 500 adults nationwide conducted in May for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal asked, ""Do you feel confident or not confident that life for our children's generation will be better than it has been for us?""

A majority -- 63 percent -- responded that they were ""not confident"" while 30 percent answered ""confident."" Seven percent were unsure.

But this is not a new phenomenon, as he suggests. A majority has said that nearly every time the poll has been conducted -- 10 times since 1992. Only in December 2001 did more respondents (49 percent) say they were confident about their children’s future than were not confident (42 percent).

A similar poll conducted for CBS News and the New York Times in April asked 957 adults, ""Do you think the future of the next generation of Americans will be better, worse, or about the same as life today?""

The ""worse"" answer had a plurality: 47 percent. Twenty-four percent answered ""better"" and 23 percent said ""about the same."" That poll, conducted six times since 2009, also reflected widespread pessimism, with ""worse"" being the most frequent answer every time.

Finally, a USA Today/Gallup poll of 1,012 adults conducted in May surveyed whether Americans are satisfied with ""the opportunity for the next generation of Americans to live better than their parents."" Nearly six in 10 Americans -- 58 percent -- said they were dissatisfied, while 40 percent said they were satisfied.

 Our ruling

Romney said that ""the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future.""

We found three polls that support his claim. Americans are indeed pessimistic about their children’s prospects. But that’s nothing new, according to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. For at least the last 20 years, Americans have expected that our kids would be worse off than we are. Romney cast this national outlook as specifically an Obama-era phenomenon.

"['National', 'Education', 'Jeb Bush']","
Jeb Bush says Romney narrowed achievement gap in Massachusetts
","
Jeb Bush, who put education at the forefront during his two terms as Florida’s governor, used his pulpit at the Republican National Convention to talk up Mitt Romney’s education record in Massachusetts.

""Because he is a former governor, Mitt Romney understands that states must lead this national movement. In Massachusetts, Gov. Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races, raised testing standards, and put into place a merit scholarship ... He's a champion for bringing hope to education,"" Bush said in the Aug. 30 speech.

We have examined the claim about Massachusetts’ achievement gap in July, when Romney himself said it. Here’s another look.

A little on Massachusetts schools

In 1993, lawmakers in Massachusetts passed a landmark reform law that included the groundwork for the state accountability system (later called Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS), authorized charter schools and invested more money in local school districts. Its universal goal was to raise educational standards for all Massachusetts kids.
   
But it’s worth noting that the Bay State is already a leader in student achievement. Massachusetts, which has a disproportionately high number of colleges and universities, some of the nation’s wealthiest ZIP codes and a well-educated workforce, churns out many high-performing students.
       
But the glare of those top achievers makes the shadow of struggling students that much darker. That is to say, Massachusetts still has a significant achievement gap. And because the kids at the top do so well, it’s that much harder for everybody else to catch up.
   
""Our scores are high, so as they get higher it’s pretty hard to move up,"" said Kathleen Skinner, a policy director at the Massachusetts Teachers Association, a teachers union.
   
Narrowing the gap
   
When we checked this claim before, the Romney campaign pointed us to a 2007 MCAS test results summary, and specifically cited the 10th grade scores:
   
    10th Grade Proficiency In Math
    o    2005, White: 29%; Black: 19%. Gap = 10 points
    o    2007, White: 29%; Black: 26%. Gap = 3 points
   
    10th Grade Proficiency In English
    o    2005, White: 46%; Black: 30%. Gap = 16 points
    o    2007, White: 52%; Black: 40%. Gap = 12 points
   
That shows the achievement gap narrowing by 7 percentage points in math and by 4 percentage points in English.
   
But the gains in other grades are smaller.
   
Among eighth-graders, the gap tightened by only 1 point in math and 2 points in English. For seventh-graders, the change was 3 points in math, 5 points in English. Sixth grade: 1 point in math, no change in English. In fourth grade scores, the gap narrowed by 1 point in math and widened by 1 point in English. (Some of those are comparisons between 2006 scores and 2007, the only years provided in the test results summary.)
   
Skinner noted an important point about the MCAS: 10th-graders have to pass it in order to graduate.
   
""They start paying attention,"" she said.

We also took a look at scores for the following year, comparing the achievement gap between 2007 and 2008. (These charts offer a slightly different comparison from the previous year, which looked at students who scored ""proficient"" on each test. The 2007-08 chart includes those scoring proficient and higher.) The best gains again were made by 10th graders who narrowed the gap by six points in English. But there was no change in the gap in math scores, and lower grades showed only one- or two-point gains, or no improvement at all, and the gap widened in a couple of instances, such as eighth-grade science scores. The 2008-2009 test score summary reflected a similar trend: small gains in some subjects and small setbacks in others.
   
Beverly Miyares, also with the Massachusetts Teachers Association, added that the dropout rate among black students in Massachusetts increased from 2002 to 2004, rising from 4.9 to 6.3.
   
That means more under-performing students who dropped out of school didn’t drag down the overall average test scores.
   
Romney’s role
   
In claims such as this, we don’t just consider the accuracy but also whether the speaker deserves credit: How responsible was Romney for narrowing the achievement gap?
   
""The most important point to make with Gov. Romney’s record is that the reform he initiated was part of a much larger and longer movement that existed in Massachusetts,"" said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent research about public education reform in Massachusetts.
   
Glenn Koocher, executive director with the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, which represents school boards, was less generous: ""He had nothing to do with it. It’s the teachers in the classrooms who are making the difference.""
   
Skinner, the expert with the teachers’ union, added that Romney was ""a somewhat absent ‘education’ governor. He was very agenda driven.""
   
""We would argue that he didn’t put anything in place"" to narrow the gap, she said.
   
We also wondered whether Romney had pushed any initiatives specifically aimed at helping minority students. Koocher and Skinner both mentioned charter schools, which are favored by many Republicans.
   
""The charter school program was always popular among minority parents (and) any parents that wanted to get their kids out of the public schools,"" Koocher said, adding that vouchers commonly used to pay tuition at charter schools are unconstitutional in Massachusetts. Instead, the per-pupil state spending is deducted from the public school district’s budget.
   
Ryan Williams, spokesman for the Romney campaign, said protecting the 1993 reform legislation was an important effort by Romney. He said there were attempts to repeal the requirement that 10th graders pass the test in order to graduate, and Romney ""stood firm on that and did not back down.""
   
""It was one of the bigger things we had success in blocking,"" Williams said. ""A lot of what Romney did when he was governor was to preserve that legislation. He said, ‘I’m not going to roll these standards back.’""

Skinner mentioned another, perhaps less obvious, initiative from Romney that helped many minority students: universal health care. Romney signed a health care reform law in Massachusetts that led to a 98 percent coverage rate.
   
""In Massachusetts, all of our kids have health insurance, and I don’t think anybody should underestimate the impact that has on learning. Our kids get vaccinated, they can go to the dentist, they can go to the eye doctor,"" she said. ""Their health is less of an issue than it is in other places.""
   
Our ruling
   
Bush said, ""in Massachusetts, Gov. Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races.""

State education figures over two years support Bush’s claim about learning gains when Romney was governor, although it’s worth noting that some areas declined on Romney’s watch, such as the drop-out rate. And it’s always somewhat dubious to take a snapshot of statistics from only one or two years, when, as d'Entremont said, ""significant gains in student achievement don’t happen overnight, and the gains in Massachusetts are the result of a 20-year reform effort.""
   
What’s more, Romney, a single-term governor, should not get all the credit for improvement in the achievement gap, which is influenced by myriad factors.
   
Bush’s statement about Romney is partially accurate but omits a lot of important information and overstates the former governor’s impact. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A21C0>],/factchecks/2012/aug/31/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-romney-narrowed-achievement-gap-mass/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Callista Gingrich']","
Callista Gingrich says Barack Obama has “weakened the respect for America abroad”
","
During a joint speech with her husband, Newt Gingrich, at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Callista Gingrich criticized several aspects of Barack Obama’s presidency, including his global leadership.

Newt Gingrich said, ""It's striking how President (Jimmy) Carter and President Obama both took our nation down a path that in four years weakened America's confidence in itself and our hope for a better future.""

Callista Gingrich continued, ""Both weakened the respect for America abroad.""

We wondered whether that was correct. So we turned to international polling data from the Pew Global Attitudes Project. The surveys were based on telephone and face-to-face interviews conducted under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International. We didn’t find any data that went back to the Carter administration, but we did find surveys that allowed us to assess global views before and after Obama became president.

While surveys are currently being undertaken in 20 nations, only 14 of those have been done for long enough to shed light on Callista Gingrich’s claim.

The question asked is, ""Please tell me if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of ... the United States."" While favorability isn’t exactly identical to respect, we think it’s very close and a good approximation.

A crucial issue in analyzing Callista Gingrich’s claim is determining the right timing. The polls are typically taken in the spring or early summer, so the 2008 numbers refer to the nation’s standing under President George W. Bush, while the 2009 numbers refer to attitudes in the early days of the Obama administration. The 2012 numbers give us a snapshot of the current moment

Let’s look at each of them.

Comparing 2008 to 2012

Looking at the 14 nations in question, 10 gave the U.S. higher favorability rankings in 2012 than under Bush in 2008, compared to four that recorded declines. The nations that gave improved favorability ratings were primarily in Europe (Great Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Poland and Russia) and Asia (China and Japan). Turkey and Mexico also recorded increases.

The declines were primarily in the Middle East -- Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon -- as well as Pakistan.

Lumping together all of the increases with all of the decreases, America’s favorability went up an average of 7.4 points among the countries polled. So by this measure, Obama has made views of America around the world more favorable than under Bush.

Comparing 2009 to 2012

While this measurement is less relevant for the issue Callista Gingrich raised, it still provides some useful context.

In 2009 -- when Obama was a fresh face -- approval ratings of America in many countries were unusually high. Since then, they’ve fallen.

Since 2009, America’s favorability has risen in four countries, fallen in nine and remained constant in one. The only countries to see a rise were Poland, Russia, Turkey and Japan.

On average, America’s favorability declined 3.7 points among the countries polled. So the view of America in the world has declined from its unusually high peaks at the beginning of the Obama administration.

Our ruling

Callista Gingrich stated that Obama has ""weakened the respect for America abroad.""

Using the most reasonable yardstick -- comparing Bush’s last number to Obama’s most recent number -- the United States on average has higher favorability ratings in most countries Pew surveyed. However, America’s favorability has eroded somewhat since Obama’s first year in office, though it’s still above the final levels of the Bush administration. On balance, we rate Callista Gingrich’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967A7AC0>],/factchecks/2012/aug/31/callista-gingrich/callista-gingrich-says-barack-obama-has-weakened-r/

Did Clackamas County negotiate a $19.9 million TriMet deal, down from $25 million?
","
A majority of the Clackamas County Board of Commissioners recently approved a new agreement that reduces the county’s share of paying for TriMet’s new Orange line project, better known as Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail. This prompted many pats on the back from the county. 

Here’s the first sentence from the county media release sent out to press: ""Clackamas County Commissioners on Wednesday approved a re-negotiated agreement to lower the county’s contribution to TriMet’s Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project to $19.9 million from $25 million and approved the sale of bonds to pay the obligation.""

The three commissioners who voted in favor put out statements congratulating their financial savvy. The re-election campaign of commission Chair Charlotte Lehan issued a press release that stated that ""the new terms are expected to save Clackamas County taxpayers at least $6.6 million in general fund obligations.""

Commissioner Jamie Damon, also up for re-election in November, issued a campaign release that stated that the settlement would ""save over $5 million -- a reduction of over 20 percent from the original $25 million project.""

Commissioner Ann Lininger, who is retiring, submitted a guest column to The Oregonian in which she said the county approved a $19.9 million financing plan and settlement terms to fulfill its obligations to TriMet. She also said the agreement enables the county ""to avoid a late-payment penalty of as much as $1.25 million.""

Cool, right? Taxpayers love saving money. And commissioners probably think this is a good way to placate residents who are on the fence about a MAX line between Portland and Milwaukie. The agreement comes before a Sept. 18 election on a county ballot measure, which, if approved, would require voter approval before officials can spend money on light rail.

Instead of singling out a commissioner, we will focus on the statement put out by the county since it sums up nicely the numbers on which the three-member majority wants to focus: $19.9 million versus $25 million.

The new agreement with TriMet does slice $2.4 million from the $25 million. But that leaves a balance of $22.6 million, not $19.9 million. The county also agrees to other actions that are in-lieu of cash payment:
  

The total value of the listed in-kind contributions comes to $2,665,962 -- resources that could be used for other county services if they weren’t going toward light rail. Subtracting those contributions leaves a cash balance of $19,934,038 the county owes TriMet. In other words, $19.9 million. (The county isset to sell $19.1 million in bonds Sept. 6, toward the balance due.)

The Oregonian’s Clackamas County reporter has consistently characterized the cost of the new agreement with TriMet as $22.6 million, even if the new amount that requires financing is lower.  We think that’s more accurate, despite politicians’ inclinations to inflate. So does Dan Chandler, strategic policy administrator and the county’s point man on the subject.

""The reduction in borrowing is $5 million, but the actual savings are less than that,"" Chandler said.

The original agreement signed in February 2010 called for Clackamas County to pay TriMet $25 million toward the cost of the $1.5 billion project. Section 4.1 of the contract states the county could meet that amount by lump-sum payment or payments or in-kind contributions, or any combination.

Let’s return to the statement: Did the commission approve a new deal that lowers the county’s contribution to $19.9 million, down from $25 million? It did not.

The county’s financial contribution to TriMet for the new Orange line is now $22.6 million, much of which will be financed by borrowing. The in-kind contributions come from money the county will now forgo or must spend to meet its obligations. Those are real dollars.

We find the statement to be False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C9F100>],/factchecks/2012/aug/30/clackamas-county-commission/did-clackamas-county-negotiate-199-million-trimet-/
"['Children', 'Education', 'Florida', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum says Barack Obama wants to ""nationalize curriculum""
","
Who should decide how to teach children to write a sentence or multiply numbers -- local leaders or the feds?

Rick Santorum, who dropped out of the GOP presidential primary, touched on that theme in his Aug. 28 speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa:

""A solid education should be the second rung on the ladder to success, but the system is failing. President Obama's solution has been to deny parents choice, attack private schools and nationalize curriculum and student loans. Mitt Romney believes that parents and the local community must be put in charge -- not the Department of Education.""

Has Obama tried to ""nationalize curriculum""? We could not track down Santorum to ask him to explain his statement, but Education Week wrote that his statement was ""an apparent dig at the Common Core State Standards, which are not an initiative of the federal government, but have been embraced by the federal Department of Education.""

‘Common Core' standards

The movement toward Common Core standards pre-dates Obama’s presidency. The Council of Chief State School Officers -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Obama won the presidency. In 2009, the council and the National Governors Association agreed to create the Common Core State Standards, developed them with the help of teachers, parents, and experts, and unveiled them in 2010.   

The council’s website described it as a ""state-led effort spearheaded by governors and school chiefs"" to set expectations for language arts and math in order to help students prepare for college and work. To date, 45 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards in language arts and math, and one state, Minnesota, adopted only the language arts standards. Most of the states plan to implement the standards over the next few years. Texas, Virginia, Nebraska and Alaska did not adopt the standards.

We should note that standards are not the same thing as curriculum, but the standards alone have sparked lots of debate. Critics say the efforts amount to federal overreach and question whether the standards were sufficiently rigorous.

The Pioneer Institute, a Boston think tank that focuses on individual responsibility and limited government, wrote a paper in February arguing that the Common Core standards were a ""road to a national curriculum."" It also argued the federal government is herding states into accepting the standards (more on that in bit). Conservative Washington Post columnist George F. Will echoed the institute’s views in a widely distributed March column.

The federal government has had a role in encouraging states to adopt the standards. For states to get either federal Race to the Top grants or waivers from the mandates of No Child Left Behind, they have to prove they have standards to prepare students for college and work. They don’t have to adopt the Common Core Standards -- but that works as one way to qualify for grants or waivers. (A Center for Education Policy survey found that the rigor of the standards was the top consideration in states’ decisions on adopting the standards, although Race to the Top grants were also a factor.) So far, 33 states have received waivers -- and all but one of those adopted the Common Core standards.

Though the standards were not written by the federal government, there is a perception among some that the feds are driving it. U.S. Secretary of Education Secretary Arne Duncan rejected that idea, telling South Carolina legislators ""the idea that the Common Core standards are nationally-imposed is a conspiracy theory in search of a conspiracy."" But he does favor the standards.

""We have 50 different standards, 50 different goal posts,"" he said in 2009 before the Common Core standards were unveiled. ""And due to political pressure, those have been dumbed down. We want to fundamentally reverse that. We want common, career-ready internationally benchmarked standards.""

Obama has appeared to take credit for states adopting the standards while avoiding the issue of whether states did that due to the financial incentives, reported Education Week in its Curriculum Matters blog. ""For less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year, almost every state has now agreed to raise standards for teaching and learning—and that's the first time it's happened in a generation,"" Obama said in August 2012.  

The blog noted that Santorum’s comment about nationalizing curriculum ""hit that local-control nerve that's so raw at the moment, raising the specter of little children everywhere turning the same page in their history books at the same moment on the same day in November, all because of ‘the feds,’ or, at the very least, ‘outsiders.’""

 Education experts

We interviewed five education experts about Santorum’s claim and they all disagreed that Common Core standards nationalize curriculum. Our experts included education professors at the University of Florida, Columbia and Harvard; Chester Finn, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Education in the 1980s who is president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, which works to reform education; and Andy Rotherham, co-founder and partner at Bellwether Education Partners. All of them disagreed with Santorum’s claim.

Experts generally emphasized that the standards are voluntary. And setting standards -- such as understanding decimals or reading comprehension -- isn’t the same as telling educators what curriculum to use to teach those standards.

""It describes a destination -- again, voluntary for states -- not the means of getting there,"" Finn said. ""Yes, if a bunch of states faithfully implement it (45 have signed up but many won't seriously implement them), it will bring greater commonality to what is taught across the country in those two subjects. In my view that's a good thing. Why should 5th graders in Portland, Maine, and Portland, Ore., be learning different math?""

Columbia Professor Jeffrey Henig said the movement toward Common Core standards pre-dates Obama and has had considerable bipartisan support.

""The Obama administration is broadly supportive of this movement and has used some of its ability to use grant funds to leverage state reforms, but it is not accurate to characterize it as leading the initiative,"" Henig wrote in an email.

Our ruling

Santorum said Obama has tried to ""nationalize curriculum."" Santorum appears to be adopting an argument from critics of the Common Core standards.

But Santorum’s statement is misleading for several reasons. For starters, the discussion about common standards pre-dates Obama. Although the vast majority of states have adopted those standards, they are voluntary. The states don’t have to adopt the Common Core standards to apply for Race to the Top grants or waivers from No Child Left Behind, although that’s been the preferred route so far.

Finally, it’s important to note that standards aren’t the same as curriculum. States can agree on a standard about multiplication or reading but create different curriculums to teach those skills.

Santorum has oversimplified a complex topic and fed into the generic ""federal takeover"" argument. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"['Social Security', 'Florida', 'Bill Nelson']","
Bill Nelson said Connie Mack wants to take Social Security money, give it to seniors, and them invest it in the stock market
","
We’ve heard plenty about U.S. House budget chairman and vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan’s plans for Medicare lately, but what about his efforts to reform Social Security? U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson would sure like to discuss it -- and tie his opponent, Rep. Connie Mack IV to Ryan’s largely unpopular past plans for the program.

""My opponent co-sponsored a bill with none other than congressman Paul Ryan, a bill to privatize Social Security,"" Nelson said. ""Specifically what they did was they were going take a third of the Social Security Trust Fund, they were going to give it in individual accounts to the senior citizens who then were to invest it in the stock market.""

Never mind for a moment the claim that the GOP wants to privatize Social Security -- we’ve found that particular Democratic condemnation of personal savings accounts to be Mostly False, since they would be voluntary. Let’s delve into the specifics Nelson is citing, and find out how clear he is on the whole Republican plan.

A taxing analysis

Although Mack wasn’t mentioned by name, Nelson’s office told us the senator was referring to Ryan’s Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act of 2005, which was co-sponsored by Mack and 12 others. The proposal, which never became law, aimed to reform Social Security by allowing workers to divert some of their contributions away from the traditional Social Security program and into personal savings accounts. (Ryan has proposed several versions of this plan over the years.)

That’s enough for Nelson to try to fire up his liberal base, but the specifics of his claim are off base.

Nelson said this would rob the trust fund, which is funded through payroll taxes. But that fund was never going to have money taken directly from it, nor was the fund going to be abolished. The Ryan plans called for the fund to be compensated with general tax revenue in order to maintain benefit levels for people who stayed in the traditional system.

We should note that the plan Mack co-sponsored would have allowed people to divert half their payroll taxes, not a third as Nelson said.  

 An age-old debate

More critically, Nelson said the Ryan-Mack plan would have senior citizens invest payroll taxes in the stock market. This gives the wrong idea about who would be affected.

Every plan advanced by Ryan has stated the changes in the system would only affect workers younger than 55, with no changes in Social Security for workers and retirees older than that. No one older than 55 would even be eligible for the personal savings accounts, let alone be given an account to invest on their own.

Among younger workers who chose to invest in the accounts, government oversight of the accounts would not allow them to invest on their own. The Social Security Administration would have ensured future retirees with those accounts would receive at least the equivalent in payouts as the traditional system, if not more so, if the investments had a higher rate of return.

If the accounts fell short due to losses from the stock market, general revenue tax money was slated to cover the difference, which was a source of criticism after the Great Recession savaged investments in 2008.

The accounts are no longer part of Ryan’s budget resolutions, the most recent of which passed the Republican-led House but not the Democratic Senate.

The ruling

Nelson said that Mack ""co-sponsored a bill with none other than congressman Paul Ryan, a bill to privatize Social Security. Specifically what they did was they were going to take a third of the Social Security Trust Fund, they were going to give it in individual accounts to the senior citizens who then were to invest it in the stock market.""

There are few things wrong with this.

The 2005 proposal Mack co-sponsored allowed one-half of payroll taxes to be used, not a third.

Payroll taxes do replenish the Social Security Trust Fund, but the money to fund personal savings accounts would have been replaced with general revenue taxes to pay out traditional benefits.The trust fund would have remained balanced, with fewer people entering the system by using personal accounts instead. Redirecting one third of payroll taxes from the trust fund does not constitute removing one third of the total trust fund, in any case.

Those accounts also wouldn’t have gone to senior citizens, as Nelson alleges, because no one over the age of 55 would have been eligible for the accounts in the first place. Every version of Ryan’s plan maintains this age limit.

Nelson had a point that Mack has supported Ryan’s plans for private or personal accounts in the Social Security program.

But his comments gave the wrong impression to a roomful of seniors that it would have affected them. A constant in Ryan’s budget proposals is the exclusion of senior citizens to any changes in the current system.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Regulation', 'Nikki Haley']","
Nikki Haley ties Obama to Boeing labor dispute
","
For Republicans, one of the clearest examples of ham-fisted government is a dispute last year between the airplane maker Boeing and the National Labor Relations Board. GOP candidates talked about it during the presidential primaries, and the story re-emerged during the first night of the Republican National Convention in Tampa.

Nikki Haley, governor of South Carolina, said the state was ""blessed"" in 2009 when Boeing opened a plant to build the 787 Dreamliner in her state.

""And what did President Obama and his National Labor Relations Board do?"" Haley asked. ""They sued this iconic American company.""

PolitiFact has examined the NLRB-Boeing conflict before. Just before the New Hampshire primary, Mitt Romney said the NLRB had told Boeing it couldn’t open a plant in a non-union state. We rated that False. Now, by calling it ""his NLRB,"" Haley wants to tie Obama to the labor board's action against the company. So we will assess the accuracy of her statements.

Boeing vs. the union

About seven years ago, Boeing was ramping up to build its newest passenger jet, the 787 Dreamliner. The company explored making all the planes at its factories in Washington state, but in 2009, it decided to start a second, smaller production line in South Carolina. The union plants in Puget Sound would make seven planes a month; the non-union facility in North Charleston, S.C. would produce three a month.

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers complained. The NLRB’s general counsel tried to bring the parties together, but failed. In April 2011, the general counsel’s office formally started a hearing process against Boeing on the grounds that the company built its factory in South Carolina in order to punish the union. Retaliation of that sort, if proven, violates federal labor law.

In December 2011, the union and Boeing struck a four-year deal that that provided raises, job protections and a commitment to make more planes in the Puget Sound area. With the South Carolina plant no longer seen as a threat to jobs in Washington state, the union dropped its complaint and the NLRB general counsel ended the hearing process.

The president and the NLRB

Haley cast the NLRB as an agency that is a direct extension of presidential power. Rob Godfrey, the governor’s spokesman, told us that this is accurate ""because the NLRB is appointed by the president, entirely.""

He said that it is similar to ""the thousands of boards that Governor Haley appoints and is then held accountable for the actions of.""

But the composition and presidential influence varies among different federal agencies, and it's a stretch to portray NLRB actions as directly managed by the Obama administration.

""It’s not Obama’s NLRB,"" said William Gould, who chaired the labor board for over four years during the Clinton administration and is now a law professor at Stanford Law School. Gould disagreed with the NLRB decision to open hearings against Boeing but says the White House would be far removed from those activities.

""It’s an independent quasi-judicial administrative agency,"" Gould said. ""I am sure that the White House had absolutely nothing to do with this. During my 53-plus months, we never heard anything from the White House.""

Indeed, we could find no evidence that the White House intervened. The president’s spokesman, Jay Carney, told reporters ""this was not something the president was involved in.""

The president does have a strong influence on the composition of the board itself. He alone nominates members who are then subject to Senate confirmation. Confirmation votes are easily blocked, and only two of the current members were approved by the Senate. The other two took their posts when the Senate was in recess and could not object. (Obama nominated all four.)

But the Boeing case never came before the four current board members at all. The prime mover within the NLRB was its general counsel, Lafe Solomon. Obama appointed Solomon.

The call for a hearing came when Solomon, who acts independently of the board, filed a complaint because there seemed to be enough evidence to make it stick. Based on such a complaint, the case went before an administrative judge. Had there been a ruling, only then would the case have gone to the NLRB to be voted up or down or changed.

When the union and Boeing settled their dispute, Solomon said, ""this is the outcome we have always preferred."" The goal, Solomon said, is to foster negotiations between management and unions that protect workers’ rights. ""The parties’ collective bargaining agreement does just that,"" he said.

Later in her convention speech, Haley referred to fighting the lawsuit -- which technically was a hearing, not a suit -- and said that ""we won."" In reality, the company struck a deal with the union. That ended the legal process.

Our ruling

Haley said Obama and his National Labor Relations Board sued Boeing over its decision to open a plant in South Carolina.

This oversimplifies a complex set of practices and relationships. The practices of the NLRB keep it many steps away from the president. In keeping with that process, the board members themselves did not take any action regarding Boeing. Obama’s greatest influence on the NLRB in this case can be found in his temporary appointment of the NLRB general counsel. The counsel decided to bring the case before an administrative judge.

Haley refers to the government suing, whereas the process is best described as a hearing in which the NLRB represents the interests of the party making the complaint.

There is a measure of truth given the president’s role in appointing the general counsel. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C128480>],/factchecks/2012/aug/30/nikki-haley/haley-ties-obama-boeing-labor-dispute/
"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says national health care law puts “bureaucrats between American citizens and doctors
","The truth can be difficult.

So difficult that even as Gov. Chris Christie said Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would ""tell us the hard truths,"" Christie himself slid into misleading territory.

""Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the debacle of putting the world’s greatest health care system in the hands of federal bureaucrats and putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor,"" Christie said during his keynote address Tuesday night at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla.

In his capacity as a top Romney surrogate, Christie has previously criticized the health care reform passed by President Barack Obama, repeating the thoroughly debunked Republican talking point that the law is ""a government takeover of health care.""

Here, we decided to check Christie’s statement that the law, formally called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- or as some call it, Obamacare -- puts federal ""bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor."" (In a separate fact-check, we evaluated Christie’s claim that the United States has ""the world’s greatest health care system."")

PolitiFact National recently fact-checked a nearly identical statement from Romney and rated it False. Romney said that ""Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor.""

PolitiFact found Romney’s claim overstated the level of government control under the new law, which keeps intact the private-sector delivery of health care.

The law requires insurance plans to carry a minimum benefits package and sets up virtual exchanges where individuals can purchase insurance. The law also creates incentives and penalties to promote better care.

But none of that prevents doctors and patients from making healthcare decisions together, as they do now.

And while some doctors are critical of the law, the leading physician advocacy group, the American Medical Association, supports the reform.

The group’s president, Jeremy Lazarus, said in a June 28 news release after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act that the law ""simplifies administrative burdens, including streamlining insurance claims, so physicians and their staff can spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork.""

Other physician advocacy groups have also expressed support for the law. But, as PolitiFact noted, there are concerns among specialists about the legislation’s impact, specifically in relation to the Medicare program.

Many opponents of the law have said the 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board or IPAB  -- which will recommend ways to prevent Medicare’s spending growth from exceeding certain targets -- will lead to health care rationing.

But the board is specifically forbidden from submitting ""any recommendation to ration health care."" Though it can decrease government payments to health care providers for services and recommend ways to cut wasteful spending.

In a March fact-check, U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos, whom Christie has endorsed, pointed, in part, to IPAB to support his claim that under the health care law ""the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated."" That statement rated a Pants on Fire on the Truth-O-Meter.  

Our ruling

Christie said Romney will be able to tell the hard truths necessary to end the debacle of putting federal ""bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor.""

We found no solid evidence to support Christie’s sweeping claim, which overreaches on the role of the federal government under the new law.

With the reform, the private health care delivery system remains in place. While there are significant changes to the health insurance market and incentives and penalties to promote better care, that doesn’t mean the government is inserting itself in between doctors and patients.

We rate this statement False.
