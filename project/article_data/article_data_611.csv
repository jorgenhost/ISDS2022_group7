Washington Redskins weren't stranded by police at a game
","An online story says the Washington Redskins had an unplanned locker room slumber party. The article’s headline reads, ""Cops take a knee then walk out on Redskins, leaving them stranded in their locker room overnight."" Clickbait site Universaleinfo posted the story on Aug. 5. It says that Redskins players knelt during the national anthem, angering the police officers providing security at the game. The cops decided to stage a counter-protest: they got down on one knee, yelled ""blue lives matter"" and then left the team in the locker room. Unable to get past the angry fans outside, the players were stuck all night. The Universaleinfo article was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s a compelling story, aside from the fact none of it happened. NFL protests have been in the national spotlight since 2016, when Colin Kaepernick, former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, knelt during the anthem to oppose police brutality. Since then, over 200 players throughout the league have chosen to kneel or sit in protest. Protests spiked in September 2017, when President Donald Trump encouraged NFL owners to fire players who didn’t stand for the anthem. Two days after Trump spoke against Kaepernick, some Redskins players knelt before their game. Since then, there have been no reports of Redskins players refusing to stand during the anthem. The Universaleinfo article was posted on Aug. 5, 2018. It says that the Redskins knelt before their game on ""Monday night"" in Philadelphia. Aug. 5 was a Sunday, so previous Monday would have been six days before, on July 30. The Redskins did not play a game on July 30. In fact, they hadn’t even started pre-season yet. The article also said that the Philadelphia Police Department released a statement after the incident, but there were no recent press releases about the Redskins online. A spokesperson for the Redskins confirmed that there was no game on July 30. As far as we can tell, this article was entirely fabricated. Where did this article come from, if not any actual news sites? It seems to be a repeat of a hoax from October 2017. An identical article was posted on Freedum Junkshun, a satire site meant to anger conservatives. The article is ""a boatload of bullhonkey,"" according to the disclaimer at the bottom of the Freedum Junkshun page. The related articles linked on the page are more of the same: football teams across the country, being punished in creative ways for not standing during the anthem. Universaleinfo posted an article that claimed, ""cops take a knee then walk out on Redskins, leaving them stranded in their locker room overnight."" None of the dates or information in the article match up to reality. This article is copied directly from a satire site and presented as though it was true.

Voter fraud claim in Ohio special election lacks evidence
","A website raised the specter of voter fraud in a hotly contested Ohio special election by saying dozens of people older than 116 are registered to vote in the district. ""Red Alert: Major Signs of Voter Fraud Uncovered In Ohio,"" read the headline of the American Journal Review. But the facts are less sinister than the headline makes it sound. Here’s what you need to know. The post borrows heavily from an article posted on Breitbart by Eric Eggers, research director at the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit. Eggers wrote a story, which begins: ""Republican Troy Balderson clings to a narrow margin in last night’s special election for Ohio’s 12th Congressional district, underscoring the impact voter fraud can have in key elections around the country,"" Eggers wrote. Eggers raised the prospect that people were impersonating dead voters, claiming that ""72 voters over the age of 116 who ‘live’ in Balderson’s district cast ballots in the 2016 election."" The Breitbart article links to a list of voter IDs of Ohioans whose birthdates are listed in 1901 or earlier. Eggers sent us the same information when we reached out to him.  ""Take into account the fact that there were 170 voters in the state of Ohio that were listed as older than 116,"" American Journal Review wrote. ""These names still sat in Ohio’s 12th Congressional district’s rolls when the data was collected by GAI in August of 2017. ""This is equivalent to 10 percent of the margin that Balderson is currently leading by, without provisional ballots. More than 72 percent of Ohio voters over 116 years old who are ""living"" in the district Balderson is running in voted in the 2016 election…"" Considering the fact that the world’s oldest living person is 115 years old, and that the vote counts of the Democratic and Republican candidates were separated by roughly 1,700 votes the day after the election, we wanted to look into the allegation of the American Journal Review article that there were ""major signs"" of voter fraud. (At the time of this story’s publication, it appears that Republican Troy Balderson leads Democrat Danny O’Connor by 1,564 votes, but some absentee and provisional ballots still need to be counted. The results will be sent to the Ohio Secretary of State on Aug. 24. Balderson and O’Connor will face off again in November.) Indeed, there are 170 voters in the district listed with birthdays from 1901 or earlier. But the story builds a misleading impression by tying that fact to ""voter fraud,"" where there is no evidence that dead people or people over 116 years old voted in the race. The story overlooks a plausible explanation for turn-of-the-century birthdays of 170 registered voters: Ohio didn’t require citizens to provide their dates of birth when registering to vote until 1974. The list of Ohio voters shows 170 voter IDs and corresponding dates of birth, all of which are listed as being in 1901 or earlier. But if you look closely, you’ll notice that almost all of the voters’ dates of birth are listed as one of three dates: Jan. 1, 1800, Jan. 1, 1900, or Jan. 1, 1901.   The office of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted responded to several misleading stories about the special election in a press release. ""State law has not always required Ohioans to provide their date of birth when registering to vote,"" they wrote. ""Prior to June 1974, when House Bill 662 was passed requiring date of birth to register to vote, county boards of election used placeholder dates. This is why some registrations have dates like 1900 or 1800 listed."" Husted doubled down in a tweet: ""No one 116 or older is voting in Ohio elections. Voters who registered when DOB wasn't required have a placeholder date as their DOB. Often the year 1900 was used.""  Enough misinformation: Time for the facts. No one 116 or older is voting in Ohio elections. Voters who registered when DOB wasn't required have a place holder date as their DOB. Often the year 1900 was used. https://t.co/RMMuIh29tf Outside elections experts said Husted’s explanation was valid. ""Husted’s explanation is entirely credible and unremarkable,"" said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School. The practice isn’t unique to Ohio. Other states have used placeholder dates of birth. In New Jersey in 2005, the birthdates of seven voters were listed as Jan. 1, 1880. A Brennan Center for Justice report concluded that the date ""is most likely a system default for registrations lacking date-of-birth information.""   The fact that only 170 out of 8 million registered voters (0.002 percent of voters) in Ohio had incorrect birthdates is ""pretty good,"" Levitt said. Our colleagues at Factcheck.org, debunking a similar article, actually spoke with some Ohio voters listed as 116 or older. ""Although we couldn’t talk to everyone registered in the 12th District who was listed as being born in 1800 or 1900, we did talk to some of them and can confirm that they are living, breathing, eligible voters,"" Factcheck.org wrote. ""Charles Hacker, of Mansfield, Ohio, is one of them. He registered to vote in 1973, according to the voter roll, and his birthdate is listed as Jan. 1, 1800. But he was actually born in 1944, he told FactCheck.org in a phone interview. He’s 74 years old."" An article from the American Journal Review claimed, ""Red Alert: Major Signs of Voter Fraud Uncovered In Ohio,"" and went on to say that ""170 voters in the state of Ohio that were listed as older than 116."" The reality isn’t as fishy as the headline sounds. The story manipulates an oddity about Ohio’s voter database into a misleading narrative about voter fraud. While there are 170 voters listed as over 116 years old, that is almost definitely not their real birthdays. That’s because those voters likely registered to vote in Ohio before 1974, when they weren’t required to provide their date of birth. Because the voting record lacked these voters’ dates of birth, placeholder dates from 1800 and 1900 were used, the state’s Republican secretary of state said. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Correction Aug. 22, 2018: After we published this item, we heard from Eggers that his point wasn't accurately covered in this fact-check. As a result, we added additional information from Eggers and clarified the point of this fact-check, which was a suggestion made by some bloggers that Ohio's voter rolls were a sign of voter fraud.",/factchecks/2018/aug/20/americanjournalreviewcom/no-evidence-anyone-over-116-years-old-was-voting-o/

Beto O'Rourke says he doesn't accept PAC donations
","After Beto O’Rourke said on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher that he wants to help get the country back on track, Maher asked: ""And you don’t take PAC money?"" O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman nominated by Democrats to face Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in November 2018, replied during the program’s March 16, 2018, episode: ""I don’t take a dime of PAC money--no corporations, no special interests."" MAHER: ""First of all, for those, anybody who’s watching that might not be a political junkie, what is PAC money? What does that mean?"" O’ROURKE: ""So, political action committees represent the corporations and interests that have business before Congress — so the pharmaceutical industries, the telecom industries, the energy industries, the insurance industries — and they give money to members of Congress not just for access, although that’s part of it. ""They’re also buying outcomes, actual legislative language that appears in the bills, and in the bills that become laws,"" O’Rourke said. ""When you wonder why Congress is so dysfunctional, why it doesn’t represent the interests of the people it purports to serve, it’s because it’s so tied to the sources of money that are coming in."" O’Rourke, initially elected to the House in 2012, accepted PAC donations through his 2014 re-election. In 2017, we rated Half True an O’Rourke claim that he was one of two members of Congress taking no corporate cash or political action committee money. (There were five, and no member of Congress can legally take corporate cash.) O’Rourke had received about $297,000 in PAC donations in his House bids of 2012 and 2014 but hadn’t accepted PAC aid from 2015 into 2017. O’Rourke, who announced his Senate candidacy in March 2017, has since out-raised Cruz in all but one quarter. O'Rourke campaign's finance reports So, has O’Rourke also not taken PAC money? Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign replied to our inquiry about this claim by noting in an email that for the second quarter of 2018, O’Rourke reported raising more than $10.4 million from individuals and absent PAC donations. Evans said all of O’Rourke’s 2017-18 filings with the Federal Election Commission would show a similar pattern--all contributions from individuals, none from PACs. On the FEC’s website, we checked O’Rourke’s seven campaign finance reports covering 2017 through June 2018. In the period, the reports state, O’Rourke’s campaign reported raising more than $23.5 million entirely from individuals. Each report shows a zero for contributions from PACs. Cruz’s Senate campaign reported raising more than $14 million in the same period--counting a little over $1 million from PACs, according to its finance report filed in July 2018. A PAC’s bundling Months after O’Rourke made his claim to Maher, Cruz’s campaign suggested that O’Rourke had benefited from a PAC’s--running afould of his no-PACs self-description. In July 2018, as noted in a Dallas Morning News account, Cruz said O’Rourke had accepted $167,408 in contributions collected, or bundled, from individuals by the J Street PAC, which says it endorses candidates based on goals including a focus on American diplomacy ""toward a two-state outcome between Israel and the Palestinians."" To our inquiry, Evans defended the PAC-bundled donations, saying by email: ""Each contribution was made by an individual following individual contribution limits and the reporting requirements mandated for individuals such as name, address, employer."" We separately heard back from the Center for Responsive Politics, which has long tracked the influence of money in politics. Andrew Mayersohn told us by email that the center doesn’t consider PAC earmarking/bundling of donations by individuals to be the same as a PAC contribution. Mayersohn also pointed us to an Aug. 6, 2018, Associated Press fact-check confirming that $170,000 in donations by individuals were routed to O’Rourke’s campaign through the J Street PAC, ""which also hosted an event to collect individual donations to put directly toward his campaign."" That story quotes an unidentified FEC spokeswoman saying the commission doesn’t consider individuals’ donations delivered through ""conduit"" PACs to be PAC money. The AP story went on: ""Neither do campaign finance experts, who say the donations are more transparent than PAC donations. ‘No, it's not a PAC donation,’ said Victoria Farrar-Myers, an expert on campaign finance at Southern Methodist University in Dallas."" Noted too:  By law, individual donations are capped at $2,700 per election while PACs may donate up to $5,000. Our ruling O’Rourke told Maher: ""I don’t take a dime of PAC money."" O’Rourke’s campaign finance reports from the launch of his candidacy in 2017 through June 2018 show no PAC contributions. O’Rourke didn’t object to a PAC focused on Israel bundling donations for his campaign, but all of those were made by individuals. We rate this claim True.

Rudy Giuliani gets facts wrong about Trump Tower meeting
","Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s attorney, said that members of Trump’s campaign had no reason to believe a key participant in the controversial Trump Tower meeting was working on behalf of the Russian government. Giuliani even suggested they may not have known she was Russian. ""You asked me did they show an intention to do anything with Russians?"" Giuliani told Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd. ""All they knew is that a woman with a Russian name wanted to meet with them. They didn't know she was a representative of the Russian government, and indeed, she's not a representative of the Russian government. So, this is much ado about nothing. ""I don't even know if they knew she was Russian at the time,"" Giuliani added during the Aug. 19 interview. Giuliani’s claim is starkly at odds with the facts. Emails between Donald Trump Jr., and his father’s business associate — emails that the younger Trump himself published on Twitter — directly contradict Giuliani’s assertion.  Here's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ On June 3, 2016, Donald Trump Jr. received an email from Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump senior. Their correspondence set in motion the Trump Tower meeting that would take place six days later. In emails, Goldstone told the younger Trump that Moscow supported his father’s candidacy, and that a Russian government official could pass on incriminating evidence against Clinton. ""The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary (Clinton) and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,"" Goldstone wrote. ""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,"" he added, noting that a ""Russian government attorney"" would be willing to meet with Trump Jr. The younger Trump replied: ""If it’s what you say I love it."" Trump Jr. forwarded the email chain to then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the elder Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Days later, on June 9, Trump Jr. and campaign members met with a Russian national and several others. According to reports, at least eight people attended the meeting. The key Russian national was Natalia Veselnitskaya, who Goldstone referred to in his email to Trump Jr. as a ""Russian government attorney."" Veselnitskaya later acknowledged having close connections with Russian prosecutors. In her capacity as an attorney, she has counted Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior government official among her clients. Veselnitskaya has denied having ever worked for the Russian government. But around the time of the meeting — and contrary to Giuliani’s claim — she entered the Trump orbit based on a promise that she was acting as a Russian government agent who could bruise the Clinton campaign. This fact may prove legally significant. While experts cautioned against drawing any premature legal conclusions, they told us the Trump Tower interaction raised serious concerns about whether U.S. federal election law was broken. Giuliani said the Trump campaign ""didn’t know"" that Natalia Veselnitskaya ""was a representative of the Russian government"" or even Russian. Emails between Trump Jr., and his father’s business associate — emails that the younger Trump himself published — directly contradict Giuliani’s assertion. Those emails show Trump senior’s business associate Rob Goldstone telling the younger Trump that a ""Russian government attorney"" would be willing to meet with Trump Jr. to supply the campaign with incriminating evidence against Clinton.

Did Mike Braun endorse three initiatives to end coverage for pre-existing conditions?
","Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana is accusing his Republican challenger of flip-flopping on health care. ""Mike Braun now says he’s for pre-existing conditions,"" Donnelly said in a video he posted to Twitter on Aug. 13. ""There’s only one problem. Mike has said time, after time, after time, he’s against it."" Donnelly said Braun has supported a House and Senate bill, as well as a lawsuit that ""would have ended coverage for pre-existing conditions."" Is that true? Braun indeed supported these actions, but Braun also maintains he supports coverage for pre-existing conditions. During a meeting with Republican Party activists in Indiana’s conservative Hamilton County on Aug. 7, Braun answered a question on whether insurance companies should cover pre-existing medical conditions. ""Definitely; yes. Nobody should go broke because they get sick or have a bad accident,"" Braun said. Braun’s campaign repeated this talking point to us. ""Mike Braun supports covering pre-existing conditions, and believes plans that work for Hoosiers will come from market-driven solutions, not more of what big government and the insurance industry force upon them,"" campaign spokesman Josh Kelley said. But health care experts told us that’s nearly impossible. ""It is hard to make private competitive health insurance work for people with pre-existing conditions absent government intervention,"" said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""That’s just the nature of risk spreading -- it doesn’t work without subsidies or a mandatory market."" Braun’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on how he could square opposing Obamacare yet supporting one of its central tenets. In August 2017, just after joining the race, Braun urged his two Republican primary opponents who are representatives in the U.S. House, Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, to sign a discharge petition that would force Congress to vote on an Obamacare repeal bill. ""The people of Indiana want a full repeal of Obamacare and every Republican in Congress needs to sign the petition forcing leadership to bring this bill up for a vote,"" Braun wrote in a letter to the editor of the Kokomo Tribune on Aug. 16, 2017. ""Congressman Messer and Rokita voted for the same legislation before, so why not do everything possible to get something done? … When I’m in the Senate, I’ll take action and keep pushing for the full repeal of Obamacare."" The bill in question would have ended the most important Affordable Care Act subsidies: tax credits for premiums, cost-sharing subsidies, the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. ""So it would take away coverage for everybody, it’s not specific to whether you have a pre-existing condition, but by removing the subsidies, you would get a death spiral that would make coverage in the individual market unaffordable for everybody,"" Pollitz said. Braun similarly supported the Senate version of the bill. In several interviews, Braun criticized Donnelly for voting in favor of the Affordable Care Act and opposing repeal of the Affordable Care Act. ""They want somebody that's going to be independent when they get to D.C. and I think that and attacking my business is when you've got a record that says you voted for Obamacare and then you were the deciding vote to repeal it,"" Braun said on the Ed Morrisey show on Aug. 14. ""So, all of us as Republicans I think have a better message and we have the message of tax reform. I don't think Joe Donnelly had passed one piece of legislation in 12 years. He voted for Obamacare as a congressman, was the deciding vote against repealing it,"" Braun said during an IN Focus interview with Dan Spehler on July 22. ""So, all of us as Republicans I think have a better message and we have the message of tax reform. You know, Joe Donnelly voted for Obamacare, you know back when he was a congressman and was a deciding vote against it (the GOP healthcare plan),"" Braun said in an interview with Abdul Hakim-Shabbaz on July 23. There were several versions of the Senate bill depending on amendments. Regardless of which one we look at, Linda Blumberg, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute, told us in June coverage for people with pre-existing conditions would have been more expensive and less accessible under the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. On Feb. 26, 2018, 18 attorneys general and two governors challenged the Affordable Care Act as unlawful in a lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in Texas. Braun told Politico reporter Burgess Everett he endorsed the lawsuit. That, too, would effectively end mandatory coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. ""There would be much more damage beyond the issue of people with health problems being denied coverage, but that would in fact be one outcome,"" Blumberg told us. Donnelly said Braun has supported two proposals and a lawsuit to end coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. His campaign referred us to Republican proposals in the Senate, House and a lawsuit to end the Affordable Health Care Act, which entails ending key provisions like mandatory coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Braun’s campaign reaffirmed such positions, but argued for a non-Obamacare way to cover pre-existing conditions.

Will being single kill you faster than obesity?
","Finding a date can feel like a life or death situation. According to Wonderneed, an clickbait news site, it actually might be.  An article has the headline, ""Science says that being single will kill you faster than obesity."" Facebook users shared the #relatable content over 9,000 times in less than a week. This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We decided to find out if being single was a health risk. The article focuses on a 2017 press release about the 125th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association. Dr. Julianna Holt-Lunstad, professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, gave a presentation about the public health hazard of loneliness. Her team analyzed 218 studies that examined the connection between social isolation and mortality. In these studies, researchers would track a group of subjects over the course of years. In some studies, participants would report how lonely they felt. In others, their loneliness was measured more objectively, based on the number of social connections an individual had or whether they lived alone. Holt-Lunstad and her team found that lonely people were 50 percent more likely to die during the period of observation than those with good social connections. For comparison, obese individuals have a 45 percent higher risk of death, based on a 2016 Harvard study. So, based on these stats, loneliness is just as much as, if not slightly more, of a health risk than obesity. The Wonderneed article, though, doesn’t say loneliness is more dangerous than obesity; it says being single is. Holt-Lunstad’s study didn’t focus on romance. Romantic relationships were included as social connections, she explained to us, but the result ""wasn’t specific to being single."" Based solely on her meta-analysis, the article cannot conclude that a lack of romance is the health risk. Phew. The headline also mischaracterizes what these stats mean in practice. It claims that being single ""will kill you faster"" than obesity. The mere act of being single is not killing anyone. It is the loneliness associated with being single that might carry the risk. Second, none of these studies mention the element of time. Researchers measured the number of isolated people who died over the course of the study and compared it to the number of well-connected people who died. Because significantly more isolated people passed away, they concluded that loneliness was a health risk. The same method would be used to measure the risk of obesity: If 15 percent of the obese sample died, and only 3 percent of the non-obese sample did, researchers would know that obesity was a health risk. It is misleading to say that one would kill faster than the other. While the Wonderneed claim is incorrect, we’re sure you’re wondering: Are single people at a higher risk for death than those who are married? Other research has taken on the question of romance and health more directly. A study from 2011 showed that single people had a 24 percent increased risk for mortality. Especially within younger, healthier age groups, a single person is significantly more likely to die than someone married. Researchers found that, among 30-somethings, being single increased health risks by 128 percent. It’s unclear why this phenomenon exists. It could be because risk-takers are less likely to marry, and more likely to do stupid nonsense (emphasis ours). Or, unmarried people may have less access to health care and resources that married couples have. Perhaps, seriously ill people are getting married less often than healthy people, so it just seems like singles are more likely to die. Regardless of the underlying reason, though, the statistics paint a dark future for the unlucky-in-love. The health risks for being single are lower than those of being lonely or obese, but still significant. The article by Wonderneed claimed that ""science says being single will kill you faster than obesity."" But the article cites an analysis on loneliness, not on romantic relationships. Studies have shown that loneliness can be a significant health concern, increasing a person’s risk of death by 50 percent. This is a higher rate than that of obesity, which increases health risks by 45 percent. But none of the studies actually examine the speed at which someone dies.

LGBTQ advocates back Sen. Baldwin's statement on Trump stance on transgender people in the military
","Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay person to the serve in the Senate, has been a champion of LGBTQ rights.    At a June 2018 Human Rights Campaign event, Baldwin gave a speech in which she praised volunteers on the front lines of the ""fight for equality"" and also aimed a couple barbs at the Donald Trump administration. On August 17, 2018, PolitiFact Wisconsin did a fact check on the first barb: The Trump administration ""has banned the CDC even using the word ‘transgender,’"" Baldwin told the crowd, which booed in response. The statement was based on a Washington Post report. But that story was later countered by several other published reports that indicated the words were not banned. Rather, it was suggested that other words be used in some cases — in part to temper controversy during the budget process. We rated the claim False. See that claim here.   Now, PolitiFact Wisconsin turns its attention to the second part of Baldwin’s claim: ""President Trump continues to disrespect patriotic transgender Americans who want to serve their country."" Evidence When asked to back up Baldwin’s claim, campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to news reports of nationwide demonstrations that erupted following the proposed transgender ban.
  Background Trump, citing concern over military focus and medical costs, announced on Twitter in June 2017 that he would ban transgender individuals from serving ""in any capacity"" in the U.S. military. The president tweeted the following: After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you. The action was aimed at reversing an Obama administration decision to begin allowing transgender troops to serve openly in the U.S. armed forces. Several groups filed lawsuits against the ban, including Lambda Legal and OutServe-SLDN in Seattle, according to The Hill. ""A federal court in Seattle thwarted an administration request for a stay of an earlier injunction that halted the ban while a government appeal is heard,"" the report said. On July 18, 2018, The Hill reported that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld a block on the implementation of the ban, which was first announced by President Donald Trump in 2017.   ""The court's move enables transgender people to continue enlisting in the military until the opposing parties go to trial, expected in April 2019,"" The Hill stated. On August 6, 2018, Reuters reported that a U.S. court ruled the Trump administration could not enforce an updated policy barring certain transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, becoming the second court in the country to rule against the government since it unveiled the policy. ""A federal court in Seattle thwarted an administration request for a stay of an earlier injunction that halted the ban while a government appeal is heard,"" the report said. Gerald Coon, president & CEO of Diverse & Resilient, a Wisconsin organization working to end violence against LGBTQ+ people, commented on the position of military leaders. ""All four military service chiefs have gone on record to state that there is no harm in having transgender personnel serving in the military,"" Coon said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Efforts to disqualify transgender people from serving in the military do not improve our national security."" Peter Renn, Lambda Legal western regional office senior attorney, supported Baldwin’s claim. ""Yes, Senator Baldwin’s statement is correct,"" Renn said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.  ""The Trump administration has been unrelenting in its crusade to ban qualified transgender people from serving our country, but every federal judge to consider the ban has halted the administration’s efforts at every turn, finding that the ban unconstitutionally targets a minority group for discrimination."" Tom Warnke, media relations director of Lambda Legal, confirmed that the organization filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. Lambda Legal is a nonprofit legal organization: ""Lambda Legal is the oldest and largest national legal organization whose mission is to achieve full recognition of the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and everyone living with HIV through impact litigation, education and public policy work,"" according to its mission statement.
  Our rating Tammy Baldwin told a Human Rights group that ""President Trump continues to disrespect patriotic transgender Americans who want to serve their country.""

No, Nancy Pelosi didn't tell Democratic candidates to lie
","A tea party website took an interview on MSNBC with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and leapt to a conclusion about the message she was sending to midterm candidates. ""Pelosi sinks to new low, tells Dems: if you have to lie to voters to win, do it,"" said an Aug. 15 headline on teaparty.org, which attributed the story to the Conservative Tribune. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story quotes part of Pelosi’s interview on AM Joy on MSNBC Aug. 12. Much of the interview focused on the midterms and the Democrats’ message to voters. The interviewer, Jonathan Capehart, also asked Pelosi if she planned to give up the speakership if the Democrats take back the House. (NBC reported Aug. 10 that 50 Democrats running for the House say they won't support the California lawmaker for speaker. The New York Times then found 60 Democratic House candidates have said that they prefer new leadership if the party wins back the House in November.) The Conservative Tribune story combined actual quotes from Pelosi with its own extrapolation of what she ""essentially"" meant. Here’s what Pelosi actually told MSNBC: ""Well first of all, let me just say this, and I know NBC has been on a jag of this. This is one of their priorities to undermine my prospect as speaker. But putting that aside, I have not asked one person for a vote. ""I haven’t asked a candidate or an incumbent for a vote. What’s important, and I know better than anybody how important it is for us to win this election because I see up close and personal what the Republicans and this president are doing. ""I do not think our opponents should select the leaders of our party. The Republicans are spending millions -- tens of millions of dollars against me because they’re afraid of me, because I outraise them in the political arena, because I outsmart them at the negotiating table and because I’m a woman who’s going to be a seat at that table. ""And that, for me, is very important. If Hillary Clinton had won and had sat at the head of that table, it’d be different. But I’m not yielding - I’m not yielding that. Now I do believe that none of us is indispensable, but I think I’m the best person for the job and I won’t let the Republican ads, which are just flooding these districts."" ""And I say to the candidates ‘do whatever you have to do, just win, baby.’ I know one in five children in America lives in poverty. We must win this. When the caucus decides, it will decide whose name they will send to the floor - only then, after the election, will I ask people for their support."" So Pelosi did say that candidates should ""do whatever you have to do"" when asked to respond to Democratic candidates saying she should hand over the gavel, but she didn’t tell them to lie to their constituents.   Later in the interview, Pelosi shared some other advice she gives to candidates: ""don’t even mention Donald Trump. It’s not about him, he’s self evident. It’s about your relationship to the constituents. Their financial security, which is related to health care, cost of prescription drugs, cost of premiums, Medicare, Medicaid, pre-existing condition as a benefit. ..."" Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill said he had nothing to add. We sent an email to the teaparty.org website and a Facebook message to the Conservative Tribune and we did not get a response by deadline. A headline said, ""Pelosi sinks to new low, tells Dems: if you have to lie to voters to win, do it."" Pelosi said in an interview on MSNBC that she says to ""candidates do whatever you have to do, just win, baby"" but we found no evidence she told them to lie. Pelosi’s additional advice to candidates was to not make the election about Trump but make it about voters’ financial security and health care.

Did the U.S. have a record tax haul after Trump tax cuts spurred economic growth?
","One of President Donald Trump’s favorite talking points is to tout the economic impact of the tax cut bill he signed into law last December. Web posts at friendly outlets have taken up the rallying cry. One of those sites was Patriot News Alerts, a site that says it opposes ""the Deep State, the liberal media, social-justice Hollywood, leftist colleges."" One post was headlined, ""U.S. government reports record tax haul after Trump tax cuts spur economic growth."" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the story is pegged to a real number, but not a number that holds up well to close scrutiny. (Our inquiry to the website was not answered.) The underlying data point is ""very misleading,"" said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The body of the Patriot News Alerts article said, ""For the first 10 months of the 2018 fiscal year, the federal government has collected a record amount of income and corporate taxes. … As Trump promised, more people are going back to work. That being the case, the government is collecting more money in income taxes from citizens."" This number comes from the most recent monthly Treasury report through July 2018. The report organizes its data based on the fiscal year, so the 2018 numbers include 10 months -- from October 2017 to July 2018. According to the report, individual income tax receipts were up by 7.8 percent compared to the equivalent 10-month period in 2017. So that provides some support for the claim. But the same Treasury report shows that corporate taxes were down during the first 10 months of the fiscal year. In fact, they were down by 28.5 percent -- a whopping plunge, but not a surprising one, given the sweeping corporate tax cuts included in the new law. Total receipts, which include individual and corporate income taxes as well as estate taxes, excise taxes, and tariff duties, were up between the first 10 months of 2017 and the first 10 months of 2018. The rise was modest -- less than 1 percent -- but it was an increase. Still, there are several other concerns undermine the significance of the finding. Every year, the U.S. population grows, and -- except during a recession -- the size of the economy grows, too. ""So you’d expect receipts to be higher every year, all other things equal,"" said Benjamin R. Page, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. We compiled a chart showing the year-to-year changes in receipts from individual income taxes (in blue), corporate taxes (in red), and all other receipts (in yellow). The data, from 2008 to 2018, comes from the archive of monthly Treasury reports and includes only the first 10 months of the fiscal year, in order to keep it comparable to the data cited in the articles we’re checking. The chart shows that receipts sagged during the recession years of 2009 and 2010 but have otherwise risen steadily. If you look at the data in a more useful way -- the percentage increases from year to year, rather than the raw dollars taken in -- the chart shows that other years have exceeded Trump’s 10-month performance between 2017-18. Three times, President Barack Obama presided over double-digit annual increases in individual tax receipts: up 23.8 percent between 2010-11, up 17.4 percent between 2012-13, and up 11.6 percent between 2014-15. If you look at when the tax bill passed, it’s not clear at all that an increase in tax receipts followed the bill’s passage. Because the Treasury report also includes month-by-month data, it’s possible to drill down to measure trends during more specific time periods. For the three months of fiscal 2018 prior to the tax cut, individual income tax collections rose by 10.8 percent over the equivalent period from 2017. But the rise for the seven months after the tax cut was 6.7 percent. And if you look at total tax collections from every category, rather than just individual income taxes, the picture is even worse. During the seven-month period after the tax bill passed, total receipts actually fell slightly compared to the equivalent period in 2017, by about a tenth of a percentage point. Perhaps the most revealing comparison takes in the May-to-July period, because it excludes the spike in payments in April, when most Americans pay taxes on income generated in 2017, before the tax law was passed. During that period, individual income tax collections fell by about 1 percent compared to 2017. ""I don’t have a great story for why individual receipts are up so much, but I don’t think it means what Patriot News Alerts thinks it means,"" Page said. Patriot News Alerts said, ""U.S. government reports record tax haul after Trump tax cuts spur economic growth."" One notable category of tax receipts, individual income taxes, did rise in fiscal 2018, and total tax receipts rose by a smaller amount. But the closer you look, the less meaningful these statistics become. In particular, the data doesn’t provide support for the idea that the Trump tax bill juiced tax collections. If you drill down further to periods when the new tax law was in effect, individual income tax receipts actually fell compared to 2017.

Sen. Tammy Baldwin's claim about Trump administration word ban a bit of a Scrabble
","Transgender rights have become an issue in many aspects of American society, from Hollywood actors seeking recognition and roles, to the state of Vermont, where Democrat Christine Hallquist is vying to become the nation's first transgender governor. In Wisconsin, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay person to the serve in the Senate, has been a champion of LGBTQ rights. At a June 2018 Human Rights Campaign event, Baldwin gave a speech in which she praised volunteers on the front lines of the ""fight for equality"" and also aimed a couple barbs at the Donald Trump administration. The administration ""has banned the CDC even using the word ‘transgender,’ "" Baldwin told the crowd, which booed in response. What’s more, she continued: ""President Trump continues to disrespect patriotic transgender Americans who want to serve their country."" For this fact check we will look at the first claim on the CDC word ban.   (We checked the second claim, on transgender people and the military, separately. You can find it here).  The background On December 15, 2017,  The Washington Post published a story headlined ""Words banned at multiple HHS agencies include ‘diversity and ‘vulnerable.’ "" HHS is the department of Health and Human Services. The CDC is a federal agency under the HHS and is headquartered in Atlanta. The agency in question is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (You may remember that in the wake of the story, the Human Rights Campaign and artist Robin Bell projected some of the words onto to the side of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.) When asked to provide backup for Baldwin’s statement, campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to that Washington Post report. ""The Trump administration is prohibiting officials at the nation's top public health agency from using a list of seven words or phrases — including ‘fetus’ and ‘transgender’ — in official documents being prepared for next year's budget,""  the news report said. A day later, The New York Times reported on the ""uproar"" over the purported word ban: The Department of Health and Human Services tried to play down on Saturday a report that officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been barred from using seven words or phrases, including ""science-based,"" ""fetus,"" ""transgender"" and ""vulnerable,"" in agency budget documents. ""The assertion that H.H.S. has ‘banned words’ is a complete mischaracterization of discussions regarding the budget formulation process,"" an agency spokesman, Matt Lloyd, told The New York Times. The Times story noted officials said the proposal was not a ban on words. Rather it was a recommendation to avoid some language to ease the path toward budget approval by Republicans in Congress. In a Jan. 9, 2018, report in The Hill, CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald said the agency ""has not banned, prohibited, or forbidden"" the use of certain words in official documentation. The statement came in response to concerns from Senate Democrats. Later that month, CNN published a follow-up report, which said news reports about the ""banned"" words may have been overstated and cited a document, along with interviews with officials from the Department of Health and Human Services.   They describe not a ban or prohibition on words but rather suggestions on how to improve the chances of getting funding.""Words to avoid: vulnerable, diversity, entitlement."" The other four words on the list  — ""transgender,"" ""fetus,"" ""evidence-based"" and ""science-based""  — were brought up by employees at the meeting who wanted to know if they could be used, according to the two HHS officials, who were familiar with what transpired at the meeting. ""Nobody ever told them they couldn't use these seven words. It was just said, 'if you think these words would cause someone to jump to a conclusion, then use a substitute. But if there isn't a good substitute, then go ahead and use the word,' "" said one of the officials. Likewise, CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, refuted the idea of a ban. ""CDC has not banned, prohibited, or forbidden employees from using any words,"" Harben said. ""CDC uses the best scientific evidence available and strongly encourages evidence-based programs."" Our rating Baldwin told a human rights group that the Trump administration ""has banned the CDC even using the word ‘transgender.’ "" The statement was based on a Washington Post report. But that story was later countered by several other published reports that indicated the words were not banned. Rather, it was suggested that other words be used in some cases — in part to temper controversy during the budget process. And despite The Washington Post headline, the first paragraph of the story does not mention the word ""banned"" instead saying ""they should avoid using certain words or phrases in official documents being drafted for next year's budget.""

Would Heller cut Social Security or Medicare to pay for tax cuts?
","The popularity of Social Security and Medicare cuts across party lines, so it’s no surprise their future comes up in campaigns. Nevada’s Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate Jacky Rosen took a shot at incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller as she received the endorsement of the Social Security Works PAC. ""Social Security successfully lifts millions out of poverty and helps ensure economic security for Nevada seniors when they retire after a lifetime of hard work,"" Rosen said Aug. 13. ""Unfortunately, Sen. Heller is yet another Washington politician who wants to cut programs like Social Security and Medicare to pay for tax cuts for his ultra-wealthy donors."" Ever since passage of the Republican Tax Cut and Jobs Act, Democrats have leveled this sort of charge at Republicans. We’ll walk you through whether cuts to Social Security and Medicare are needed to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy. Heller voted for a Senate budget resolution, which over 10 years slowed the growth of Medicare by $473 billion less than projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Opinions differ on whether a slower growth rate is the same as a cut. Heller cosponsored a Senate balanced budget amendment, which would put pressure on lawmakers to curtail Social Security and Medicare spending. Nearly half of the benefits of the tax cut law (including both individual and corporate cuts) flow to the top 5 percent of taxpayers in the first year, and in the final year, about 83 percent goes to the top 1 percent of taxpayers. Neither the tax cuts nor a balanced budget amendment necessarily force cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Heller’s campaign defended his record on protecting Medicare. ""During his time in Congress, Dean has voted to prevent more than half a trillion dollars in Medicare cuts and has opposed changes to Medicare that would impact current and near-retirees who were promised they can rely on the program,"" said campaign spokesman Keith Schipper. The pivotal phrase there is ""current and near-retirees."" In the debate over Social Security and Medicare, it’s hard to find any lawmaker who would trim benefits in the short term. Both programs touch many lives, and as entitlement programs, they automatically lay claim to more and more of the federal budget. Together, they account for about 40 percent of all spending. Efforts to bring down that share very much focus on more gradual shifts that delay benefits or reduce them for people who are years away from retirement. Heller has said and done various things over the years that are subject to interpretation. Most concretely, in 2017, he supported a Senate budget resolution that set the stage for the tax cut bill. That resolution allowed the deficit to rise by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and included a spending path for Medicare that was $473 billion less than the baseline projected by the Congressional Budget Office. To be clear, Medicare spending would still increase, but not as quickly as the CBO said it would, all things being equal. Here’s a chart from the Senate Budget Committee:  So there are a couple of points to highlight. We’ve noted before that since the resolution allowed deficits to rise by $1.5 trillion, you can’t say that any trims to Medicare help pay for the tax cuts. You could look to borrowed money as the source of cash. And then there’s the question of whether a slower rate of growth is the same as a cut. With more people retiring, the price tag goes up. If Washington were able to push health care costs down, more people could get the same benefits for less money. That’s a big if. If wealthy retirees got lower benefits, they might not feel the pain. But they could still see that as a loss. The devil, as they say, is in the details. Heller voted for a plan by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., in 2011 that would have converted Medicare into a voucher program in which Washington would help people pay for premiums charged by private insurers. The CBO found that ""under the proposal, most elderly people would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system."" Heller is an original cosponsor of a 2017 Senate balanced budget proposal. Would that amendment force cuts in Social Security and Medicare? Potentially. ""It doesn’t cut those programs directly,"" said Marc Goldwein with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""But it may force Congress to take action that would cut these programs. "" On the other hand, Heller spokesman Schippen said that in 2011 ""Heller was the only Republican senator to vote in support of a Democrat Balanced Budget Amendment that protected the revenue and outlays of Social Security from any balanced budget requirement."" In short, Heller’s record presents a mixed bag for both his critics and his supporters. The distribution of the GOP tax law benefits come with a measure of uncertainty that hinges on several factors but mainly how the economy and employers respond over time. The clearest estimate we have at hand comes from the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban and Brookings Institutions that draws on economists who have served in both Democratic and Republican administrations. By its estimate, about 45 percent of the tax benefits flow to the top 5 percent of taxpayers in the first year. By 2027, about 83 percent go to the top 1 percent. Schipper with the Heller campaign counters that ""the majority of the individual tax cuts go to taxpayers making less than $200,000 a year, and the share of taxes paid by the top 5 percent under the new tax law is greater than it was under previous law."" That has merit, although his emphasis on individual tax cuts overlooks the impact of corporate rate cuts, which tilt heavily toward the wealthy. Rosen said that Heller wants to cut programs like Social Security and Medicare to pay for tax cuts to the ultra-wealthy. Overall, his policies could make it more likely that spending on entitlements would be reined in. There is reasonable debate whether those changes would lead to a cut in benefits. And while the tax cuts favor the rich, it isn’t inevitable that the lost revenues will be made up for by trimming Social Security and Medicare.

Did Kelli Ward attack Donald Trump's plans to crack down on illegal immigration?
","Rep. Martha McSally told Arizona voters that her top Republican opponent for U.S. Senate is a former liberal who stood in the way of President Donald Trump’s plan to tackle illegal immigration. ""Who will stand with President Trump? Former Democrat Kelli Ward attacked President Trump's plans to crack down on illegal immigration, saying Trump was making a mistake. And Ward supports amnesty,"" said the narrator in an ad launched by McSally’s campaign. The ad claims that contrary to Ward, McSally does stand with Trump, and features a brief clip of Trump calling McSally ""the real deal."" McSally, former state senator Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio are all vying in the Aug. 28 Republican primary for the seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Jeff Flake. Has Ward attacked Trump, as McSally claimed? The ad misleads. Ward did say Trump was mistaken — but not on his overall plan to combat illegal immigration. Her comment was about Trump’s support of bills backed by McSally. Ward, who supports Trump’s border wall promise and strategy to deter illegal immigration, criticized those bills as granting ""amnesty without border security first."" Here are the facts. Let’s clear whether Ward is a former Democrat, as McSally called her. Ward registered as a Democrat in West Virginia when she was 18 years old, but switched to the Republican Party in her early 20s, said her spokesman Zachery Henry. Ward is now 49. McSally’s claim that Ward attacked Trump’s immigration plan goes back to a July 2018 candidates’ interview with the editorial board of the Arizona Republic. We listened to the audio. In the interview, Ward makes it clear that her criticism is of legislative proposals — not of Trump or his goal of stopping illegal immigration. McSally: ""(Ward’s) been attacking me on my leadership on border security issues and attacking the bills that I led on and voted for, those are bills that President Trump supported, so you are attacking President Trump’s supported bills."" Ward: ""As I said, when President Trump goes down the wrong way, he has to have the right guidance and the right advisers nearby to say, ‘Hey, let's take another look at this,’ not in a way that’s attacking him."" McSally: ""Ah, so he was mistaken by supporting these bills?"" Ward: ""Well, I think so, because they were amnesty bills. I don't know how they were presented to him, but I can tell you that in reading the bills they were big amnesty bills, between 69,000 and 2.2 million granted amnesty without border security first. So, those bills should be attacked and they will continue to be attacked because they need to be exposed for what they are."" Ward’s spokesman said Ward was referring to two measures: Securing America’s Future Act of 2018 and the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2018. Securing America’s Future Act, cosponsored by McSally and supported by Trump, included a $38 billion trust fund for border security and $18 billion for the wall. The bill came up for a House vote in June as lawmakers attempted to find a solution for ""Dreamers,"" immigrants in the country illegally who came to the United States as children. The bill would have allowed certain Dreamers to get a three-year renewable nonimmigrant status; but immigrant advocates criticized it for not laying out a path toward citizenship, and conservatives said it offered amnesty. The bill failed 193-231. The Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2018 also failed in the House in June, 121-301. It included about $25 billion for border security, a path toward citizenship for Dreamers under a points-based system, proposed keeping children in immigration detention with their parents, and eliminated some avenues of legal immigration, such as the diversity visa program and certain family-based visa categories. Conservative opponents of the bill said it would grant amnesty to millions of immigrants, while immigrant advocates said it did not cover enough Dreamers and allowed indefinite detention of immigrant children. Ward’s opposition to these bills wasn’t about border funding; she believed they provided amnesty to immigrants in the country illegally. McSally's campaign argued that Ward supports amnesty because Ward has said she'd let Dreamers, beneficiaries of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, stay in the United States. In a January 2018 opinion piece, Ward wrote, ""Only after the border wall is completed should Congress work on a path to potential legalization of individual DACA recipients, and only current DACA recipients who have been properly vetted."" Overall, Ward has campaigned in support of Trump’s border wall and against illegal immigration. A McSally campaign ad against Ward said, ""Former Democrat Kelli Ward attacked President Trump's plans to crack down on illegal immigration, saying Trump was making a mistake."" Ward registered as a Democrat when she was 18 years old but became a Republican in her early 20s. Ward supports Trump’s border wall promise. She opposed bills that included funding for border security, because she believed they provided amnesty, not because they included border security measures. Ward said Trump’s mistake was supporting the bills. McSally’s ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Did Nevada's Jacky Rosen skip a key veterans vote for a photo op? Not so fast
","Judging by the number of video testimonials on his YouTube channel, Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller is proud of the work he’s done to help veterans get their benefits. In contrast, he says his Democratic opponent has let them down. In June, he charged in a press release that Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., failed to vote on benefits for victims of Agent Orange, a Vietnam-era toxic herbicide. ""Congresswoman Jacky Rosen went AWOL on Nevada’s veterans once again yesterday when she skipped work to attend a publicity stunt instead of voting to expand coverage for Vietnam War heroes who are literally dying from exposure to Agent Orange – a bill Dean Heller has cosponsored in the Senate. ""If a trip to the southern border was so important to her, Rosen could’ve traveled over the weekend. Instead, she chose to pal around Nevada with Elizabeth Warren and — at the expense of these veterans — ignore the job she was elected to do."" A PAC tied to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., targets the same issue in an ad now playing in the Las Vegas market. A reader asked us about Heller’s initial press release, so we decided to find out whether Rosen, in Heller’s words, skipped work at the expense of veterans to attend a publicity stunt. Yes, Rosen was absent for the vote. The bill had 330 cosponsors, including Rosen, and no opposition. It passed 382-0 under rules reserved for sure-to-pass bills, a status known three days before the vote. On the day of the vote, Rosen was on an official visit to a child detention center near the Mexico border at a time when the Trump administration’s family separation policy faced intense scrutiny. Agent Orange is a catchall term for a blend of herbicides the U.S. military sprayed over the jungle during the Vietnam War to reduce enemy cover. The Veterans Affairs Department links exposure to a long list of diseases, including leukemia, diabetes, Parkinson’s, prostate cancer and many more. On Jan. 5, 2017, a bipartisan group of three Republican and two Democratic congressmen introduced the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act. The bill said any sailor who served in the Vietnam theater was eligible for treatment for diseases tied to Agent Orange. They wouldn’t need to prove a connection. A connection would be presumed. The measure quickly gained cosponsors. Rosen added her name about five weeks after introduction. In the months that followed, another 123 lawmakers signed on and ultimately 330 of them stood behind the bill. So if Rosen wasn’t among the very first, she was in one of the earlier waves of supporters. On Dec. 22, 2017, Rosen co-signed a letter with her colleagues (see her signature on page 5) to House Speaker Paul Ryan asking that the bill be allowed to move forward even though it lacked a specific way to pay for its cost. On June 25, 2018, the House passed the bill by a vote of 382-0, with 45 members not voting. A couple of points bear noting. With 330 cosponsors, little short of an act of God would have prevented passage. In line with that, there’s a special place within House procedure for non-controversial legislation. When at least two-thirds of members back a bill, it can pass under a fast-track motion to suspend the rules. That’s important because in order for a bill to get that treatment, it has to be posted as such three days before the vote, in this case, by June 22, 2018. That day, House Democratic leadership emailed that schedule to Rosen and other Democrats. Rosen took her trip on June 25, or in other words, after it was known that the bill was on the suspension calendar. ""Bills are scheduled under suspension because they are suspected to secure a two-thirds vote easily,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center. ""Most pass on voice votes."" With a voice vote, the presiding officer calls for the ayes and the nays and that’s it. But in this case, they had a roll call vote, which was announced the morning of June 25. As the Heller campaign sees it, Rosen didn’t do her job on behalf of veterans. ""She skipped the vote,"" said Heller spokesman Keith Schipper. ""The Monday of the vote, she decided it was more important to shoot a commercial than showing up to do the job she was elected to do, which was voting to expand coverage for veterans suffering from the effects of Agent Orange."" Rosen’s physical vote would have had no impact on the outcome. Heller’s press release said she ""skipped work."" So what was she doing on the day of the vote? On June 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to reverse his previous policy and stop the separation of families at the border. By that time, the government had placed about 2,000 children in facilities spread across the country. There were questions about the conditions the children were living in, and even more questions about how the government would reunite them with their parents. Rosen, along with 15 other House Democrats, introduced a bill directing the Homeland Security Department to reunite families. That came the day after Trump had reversed course. On June 25, the day of the Agent Orange vote, she started her day in El Paso, Texas, to meet with the American Civil Liberties Union, a group that was monitoring the separation policy. Rosen toured a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing facility, and an unaccompanied minor facility in Tornillo, Texas. She went with another House Democrat, Salud Carbajal from California. ""This visit to the border was for official business in her role as a member of Congress who has been proactively working to fix our broken immigration system and end President Trump's heartless family separation policy,"" said Ilse Zuniga, press secretary in Rosen’s congressional office. Zuniga added that immigration has been a priority for Rosen during her time in office. Official visits are part of congressional work. Each member gets an allowance and so long as it’s for work, they can spend it pretty much how they like. Staff salaries, office expenses, printing and travel are all fair game. It would have been one thing if Rosen were on vacation, but she wasn’t. Heller’s campaign takes issue with a campaign ad Rosen made using photos and footage from her trip to the border. That’s the ""publicity stunt"" part of their claim. That would be in the eye of the beholder. Gaining useful first hand knowledge can come alongside picking up images that work well in a campaign. The two are not mutually exclusive. Heller said that Rosen skipped work at the expense of veterans for a publicity stunt. Heller highlighted his own support as a cosponsor of a companion measure in the Senate — but he forgot to highlight the same of Rosen. Rosen did miss the vote.  The bill faced zero opposition, was on a formal fast-track for passage, and passed 382-0. Rosen didn’t skip ""work."" She made an official visit, along with another congressman, to sites near the Mexican border that were relevant to legislation she introduced related to family separation at the border.

A post on the Roswell Republican’s Twitter page summarized his objections. 
""POTUS’ budget adds 2 new tax increases to IRA & 401(k) savers. A total tax increase of $14billion. #ObamaTaxHike,"" it read. 
POTUS is an acronym for president of the United States. 
A PolitiFact Georgia Twitter follower was skeptical about whether Price had his facts right and asked us to investigate. 
Price spokesman Ryan Murphy explained the congressman’s claim. Price was referring to two changes in the proposed budget. The first would require some beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts to take their inherited distributions over a five-year stretch. The second change would limit the accrual of tax-favored retirement plans. It would cap how much money people could accumulate in tax-deferred retirement accounts at $3.4 million.  
""The total revenue impact comes to $14.253 billion over ten years,"" Murphy said via email.  
A White House report Murphy forwarded us detailed Murphy’s claim. The report includes both proposed changes that Murphy mentioned. It also contains a table that says changing the rules for beneficiaries would bring in an additional $4.9 billion in revenue to the federal government over 10 years. By creating the cap, the chart shows the federal government would pocket an additional $9.3 billion over 10 years. Together, it’s slightly more than $14 billion, as Murphy said. 
The White House communications department asked us to send our questions in writing. We did so twice and did not get a response. 
Grover Norquist, the outspoken leader of Americans for Tax Reform, wrote about these proposed changes in a list of the top 10 tax increases in Obama’s budget. 
Some experts say the percentage of Americans who would be affected by these changes is small. Less than 1 percent of IRA and 401(k) account holders have more than $3 million in their portfolios, one study shows. 
Eric Toder, an expert at the Tax Policy Center in Washington, agreed these changes would affect a small number of Americans. Toder said by limiting the beneficiary withdrawals to just five years, ""you are going to be paying more taxes."" Tax experts say the five-year requirement makes recipients withdraw a larger sum of money, but it could also put that person into a higher tax bracket and make him pay more in income taxes. 
Currently, there’s no limit on how much you can accumulate in a retirement account. If approved, investors would have to put more money in taxable accounts once they exceed the limit, Forbes.com says. 
Toder said there’s been some discussion on Capitol Hill about limiting the accrual, but he doesn’t think there’s much interest in Congress to make either one of these changes. 
Still, is it accurate to label these as tax increases since they’re not typical changes in a tax rate? Toder compared it to changing the mortgage interest deduction on income taxes, an idea that was discussed during last year’s presidential race. For homeowners, he said, such a change would be a tax increase. 
""Technically, they are tax increases,"" he said of the proposed changes. 
William McBride, the chief economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation in Washington, agreed with Price’s assessment. 
""Yes, these count as increases,"" McBride said via email. 
To sum up, Price claimed on Twitter that the president’s budget includes two new tax increases that would total $14 billion. The changes could add that much money to Uncle Sam’s coffers over a 10-year period.  
Calling them tax increases is a matter of semantics. That could imply it would affect large numbers of people who got Price’s tweet. The changes would affect a very small percentage of account holders, studies show. That’s important context that is missing.

Talk Radio host John DePetro says Boston Marathon bombing suspect is buried ""not far"" from President John Kennedy
","The announcement on May 9, 2013, that a burial site had been found for the body of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev led to speculation about the location of the grave. The next day, after media outlets confirmed that Tsarnaev had been interred in a Muslim cemetery 15 miles from Richmond, Va., WPRO talk show host John DePetro weighed in. DePetro, at first, seemed to ask his talk-show audience if the site was near John F. Kennedy's grave. But then he simply declared to his listeners that it was. ""You know, in a way, think of who else is there. That is, President Kennedy is buried not far from there, in Virginia,"" he said. Kennedy is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. So was Tsarnaev really interred nearby? When we contacted DePetro, he said he wasn't sure what the distance was. We used the Google Maps Distance Calculator to find the actual span between Kennedy's grave at Arlington and the Al-Barzakh Cemetery on Sadie Lane in Doswell, Virginia. Driving distance: 87 miles. Bee-line distance: 74 miles. That's about 55,817 casket lengths. When we informed DePetro of the distance and asked if he was still bothered, he wrote in an e-mail, ""Yes. Insult to bury him so close to JFK. Johnston landfill was my choice or out to sea."" Our ruling Saying that Kennedy is buried ""not far"" from Tsarnaev is like saying Newport is not far from the eastern tip of Cape Cod, that Rhode Island's State House is not far from Derry, N.H., or that the site of the Boston Marathon bombing is ""not far"" from the the southernmost tip of Narragansett, R.I. And to say that such a distance should somehow spark offense strikes us as mildly ridiculous, so we rate his statement Pants on Fire!

"['Ohio', 'Candidate Biography', 'Ken Lanci']","
Ken Lanci claims he is a 'lifelong Clevelander'
 ","
What makes a Clevelander? 
  
By one standard, it's geographic proximity to the city that gives the region its name. The Cleveland metropolitan statistical area, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, encompasses Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain, Geauga and Medina counties. The Cleveland combined statistical area adds Portage, Summit and Ashtabula. 
It's one reason why suburbanites who might properly be called Greater Clevelanders skip the
""greater."" 
By another standard, it's a matter of identity and attitude. By that  measure, a Clevelander might be someone who can name starters on the '48 Indians or '64 Browns, define the terms lake effect squall, Moondog or Polish Boy, and can instantly identify the world's greatest orchestra while singing a verse from the I-X Indoor Amusement Park jingle. 
Strictly speaking, however, a Clevelander is defined by residence, as someone living within the city limits and Cleveland Metropolitan School District might remind you with pride, defiance or irritation. 
Until the Ohio Supreme Court in 2009 upheld a state law that prohibits municipalities from enforcing residency rules, municipal workers had to be Clevelanders as specifically defined by residence. 
By city charter and state law, the requirement remains for such officials as council members and mayor. 
That requirement is met by Ken Lanci, the businessman and philanthropist who announced his candidacy for mayor earlier this month. He lives in a downtown apartment. 
But PolitiFact Ohio was surprised by the declaration on his website and campaign materials that he is ""a lifelong Clevelander"" -- largely because Lanci described himself as a Gates Mills resident when he ran for Cuyahoga County executive in 2010. 
We asked his campaign how the statement is backed up. They answered with his official biography. 
Lanci was born to a family that relied on public assistance in his early years and lived in East Side neighborhoods on East 110th and East 117th streets. The family moved to Maple Heights when he was eight. 
Lanci started working part-time in Cleveland for his father at age 13, at Offset Color and Printing on East 30th Street, and worked full-time in Cleveland after graduating from Maple Heights High School. 
""In 1987,"" the biography says, ""he began making substantial real estate investments within the city. For over 40 years, he has worked hard to create jobs and build businesses."" 
The bio says Lanci's Consolidated Graphics Inc. and Consolidated Technologies Group have more than 150 employees, many of them Cleveland residents, and that their $25 million in annual sales translate into Cleveland jobs and taxes. 
""Ken's city payroll tax is consistently over $130,000 per year. His annual real estate tax is over $85,000 per year,"" the bio says. ""While other firms were shutting down or migrating out of greater Cleveland, Ken Lanci stayed put on East 40th Street."" 
Also noted is his work in Cleveland as a philanthropist. In 2007, he and his wife began sponsoring OneSight Cleveland, which provides free eye exams and glasses to underprivileged children in Cleveland schools. More than 4,000 children have received the eyeglasses, the campaign said. 
Lanci has been involved for more than 17 years in the character-building education and training program Project Love. 
The candidate also provided a list of more than 100 local organizations to which he has contributed support. 
Looking at past news coverage, we found even more. Lanci has, for example, sponsored the large annual Family Unity Day event at Luke Easter Park in Cleveland. 
We also found from past coverage that Lanci's experience in office came on the Northfield Village Council in the 1970s and '80s, when he lived in that Summit County community. 
He sold his home in Gates Mills in 2011 and became a renter in Brecksville, where he voted in the general election last November. 
Residency may say little, if anything, about a candidate's merits. It could be argued that making a move demonstrates commitment. But the limited history suggests that it can matter. 
James M. Carney, a lawyer, developer and former state legislator with extensive interests in downtown Cleveland, moved his voting residence from Fairview Park to run for mayor in 1971 and 1973. Ralph Perk, who was elected with a plurality in a three-way race, called him a ""suburban carpetbagger."" 
Seth Taft, a prominent attorney and civic reformer who later served as county commissioner, moved to Cleveland in 1967 to challenge Mayor Ralph Locher. Locher lost the Democratic primary to Carl Stokes, who branded Taft as ""the Pepper Pike candidate."" 
A current mayoral candidate in Toledo told the Blade this month that it was an ""oversight"" to say she was a ""lifelong Toledoan"" who lived in the city her whole life: ""It should be 'the majority of my life since 1969,'"" she said. 
We tapped the experience of John Grabowski, professor of history at Case Western Reserve University, historian at the Western Reserve Historical Society and editor of ""The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History"" and ""Dictionary of Cleveland Biography."" 
""I've heard that if you choose to root for a Cleveland sports team, you are a Clevelander,"" he said with a chuckle. ""All sorts of ex-Clevelanders living all around the country still refer to themselves as Clevelanders. 
""It's an affinity. It's an origin story for a lot of people involving birthplace and family connection."" 
Grabowski, born in Cleveland and a resident of Cleveland Heights, calls himself a Clevelander. 
Where does that leave the campaign statement that Lanci is a ""lifelong Clevelander""? 
His claim is partially accurate. The record shows that Cleveland is Lanci's birthplace and hometown. He has spent his entire life in the Cleveland area, working in the city. His charitable works demonstrate community mindedness and commitment. 
Anyone from another part of Ohio, much less another part of the country, would reasonably call him a Clevelander. 
But perspective changes in close-up and in context. In this context, being a Clevelander is more than a state of mind. Specific residency requirements attach to running for mayor, and in those terms, there are specific details that are important to consider in evaluating his claim. 
As both supporters and opponents of regionalism will attest, municipal boundaries matter. Lanci leased an apartment within Cleveland’s boundaries to meet the residency requirement for mayor. 
He graduated from high school in another community. He has had residencies and voted in other communities. At one point he served in local government in another community. 
In running for mayor of the city, Lanci is seeking the votes of an electorate he has never previously been part of. 

A statement that has some accuracy but is lacking important details that are needed to put it into context gets one rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Half True.",/factchecks/2013/may/16/ken-lanci/ken-lanci-claims-he-lifelong-clevelander/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Nancy Pelosi says Obamacare is bringing down health care costs
","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says Democrats care about frugality — and the president’s health care law is one example. It’s bringing down the cost of health care, she told MSNBC host Chris Hayes. While key elements of the Affordable Care Act don’t go into effect until 2014, we wondered if the law has already brought down the cost of care. It depends partly on what you mean by ""down."" Growth rate Hayes and Pelosi chatted May 13, 2013, about Republicans’ focus on reducing the deficit. ""It strikes me that they have been remarkably successful in doing that,"" Hayes said. ""When you look at the debt ceiling debacle that led to the Budget Control Act, which has now led to the sequester, that actually …"" Pelosi interrupted. ""Oh, please, thank you for this question. This is so far off the course. ""First of all, the actions taken by President Obama and the House Democratic Congress, House and Senate, when he became president was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. ""Many of the initiatives that he passed are what are coming to bear now, including the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is bringing the cost of health care in our country down in both the public and private sector. ""And that is what is largely responsible for the deficit coming down."" We asked Pelosi’s office for evidence that the Affordable Care Act ""is bringing the cost of health care in our country down."" She meant that the law has reduced the speed of growth in health care costs — not that they’re actually lower than before, a spokesperson said. ""Down does not mean below zero,"" said spokesperson Drew Hammill. ""It means below recent projections and compared to historical trends."" U.S. health care spending has grown at historically low levels, just 3.9 percent a year in 2011 and 2010. But it was also at 3.9 percent in 2009, before the law passed. ""Health care costs have not been going down. They have been rising more slowly,"" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who’s a vocal critic of the law. What’s behind the change? There's controversy among health care economists over just why that slowdown's happening, whether it'll continue, and what role the law may play. The recent slowdown actually began in 2003, noted Jessica Stone, a policy analyst for budget-hawk group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, and continued to fall as the economy weakened. But four recent studies agree that there’s more at work than just the economy. Does the Affordable Care Act play a role? It might. ""They all agree that the unexplained part is large, making the ACA one likely explanation,"" said David Cutler, a Harvard economist who advised Obama during the 2008 campaign. His study, published in the May issue of Health Affairs, says the 2007-09 recession accounted for 37 percent of the slowdown. Eight percent he attributes to a decline in private insurance coverage and cuts to some Medicare payments. That leaves 55 percent of the slowdown ""unexplained."" He points to a few ways the Affordable Care Act is involved, including a reduction in Medicare Advantage payments and greater efficiency from health care providers — such as a reduction in hospital-acquired infections and readmissions, which he says are directly related to payment incentives in the health care law. ""So, the ACA is a big deal in this — not the only factor, to be sure, but one important factor,"" he said. A second analysis, by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Altarum Institute, found a much larger role for broader changes in the economy: 77 percent. Structural changes in the health care system ""may be playing a modest role."" And, it noted, changes yet to come under the Affordable Care Act could also affect such trends ""significantly."" Savings in Medicare and creation of health insurance exchanges could curb growth. Meanwhile, spending might bump upward as people who were previously uninsured get covered next year. (Indeed, the Medicare actuary assumed back in 2009 that increasing the number of folks who are insured would for a time outweigh the law’s downward impact on growth rates.) But that will likely happen around the same time as the economy strengthens, which may raise health care spending on its own. So once again, it’ll take closer study to tease out the role of changes under the law. ""We will only know a couple of years after robust economic growth is occurring and the current round of innovation has had some time to play itself out,"" said Gail Wilensky, a health care analyst who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush. ""Everything until then is reading tea leaves — frequently through a biased filter."" Our ruling Pelosi said ""the Affordable Care Act is bringing the cost of health care in our country down."" But it’s the rate of growth that’s dropped, not the actual cost of care — which is still rising. Meanwhile, recent studies agree that something more than just the recent recession has driven that lower growth rate. Some experts argue that includes provisions of the health care law, such as lower Medicare Advantage payments and incentives for greater efficiency from hospitals. Others say it's simply too soon to say. Spending may increase as more people become insured, but for now, there's divided support for Pelosi's statement.

Will Weatherford says expanding Medicaid would 'drastically' expand country's deficit
","
The Florida House did the nation a solid by refusing to expand subsidized health insurance to 1 million low-income Floridians, argues Speaker Will Weatherford. 
Weatherford was instrumental in blocking a proposal favored by the Florida Senate and Gov. Rick Scott that would have used $51 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over 10 years to provide private health insurance to people below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. In 2013, that is $15,865 for an individual and $32,499 for a family of four. 
People arguing in favor of Florida expanding Medicaid, one of the biggest facets of President Barack Obama’s health care law, argued it is paid for by taxes Floridians already sent to Washington. Weatherford tried to diffuse that, saying he could not support widening the program because more federal spending by an unreliable government will escalate the country’s debt woes. 
""Congress has not passed a budget in four years, and each year the federal government spends over a trillion dollars more than it has, leading to a national debt approaching $17 trillion,"" he wrote in a May 9 column. ""Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit."" 
Does the Medicaid expansion drastically raise the deficit? We wanted to check it out. 
The deficit is not the same thing as the debt. The deficit is how much the government spends in a year versus what it has on hand to pay what is owes. The debt, at $16.8 trillion and climbing, is the sum of annual deficits. 
Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy responded to our inquiry with a document that includes a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Christina Corieri, a health care policy analyst at the Goldwater Institute, a free-market research group that opposes the expansion of Medicaid. 
Her column does not say that expanding Medicaid as outlined in the health care law will drastically increase the deficit. Instead Corieri says the Supreme Court ruling presents fiscally conservative states with a ""the unique opportunity to veto hundreds of billions of dollars in new federal spending."" She said that the nearly 30 states that have either opted out or are considering it could save the government $609 billion over the next eight years. 
""The more than $609 billion in total savings from these 30 states would represent over 50 percent of the expected federal spending on the Medicaid expansion,"" she wrote. ""A drop in the bucket? That's more than seven times the $85 billion in 2013 sequester cuts and more than half the projected federal deficit for this fiscal year."" 
We sought our own answers, starting with the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office. CBO has not assessed our specific inquiry about how the Medicaid component of the law influences the deficit, but the office has evaluated the short- and long-term cost of the whole health care law a few times. 
In short, what CBO determined is the law as a whole reduces the deficit, and repealing the law would increase the deficit. That's because the includes a host of new taxes on high earners and the health care industry. 
U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., requested the CBO perform a new analysis for the cost of repealing the health care law, but the CBO director said they essentially did not have time to do it, as ""there are hundreds of provisions in the ACA and those provisions are already in various stages of implementation,"" CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote May 15. He referred Ryan to a July 2012 analysis completed for Speaker John Boehner for pretty much the same thing. 
On balance, the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated then that repealing the law would result ""in a net increase in budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013–2022 period."" 
""Although CBO and JCT have not updated that estimate to reflect the most recent baseline projections, we anticipate a similar result were we to do so,"" Elmendorf wrote. 
So basically what the government will pay out to subsidize health insurance for the uninsured, such as through tax credits to go on health exchanges or Medicaid, is more than offset by new revenues coming from reduced payments to Medicare providers and insurers as well as new taxes on high-income earners and the health care industry, said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. 
While Park considers the CBO estimate of the health care law key to our research, a couple other experts questioned its relevance and pointed out it relies on a lot of assumptions. 
Corieri, for instance, said CBO has not factored in how removing some unpopular taxes from the law, such as a tax on medical devices, would affect the law's fiscal impact. She also questioned CBO including time before the law takes effect in 2014 into its analysis. Overall, she agrees with Weatherford's point. 
""Obviously if they're not spending that money, then the deficit will be smaller,"" she said. 
Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, said CBO’s analysis does not factor in which specific states will expand coverage, so it’s impossible to know whether Texas and Florida were included in its post-Supreme Court analysis. The researchers assumed 70 percent of beneficiaries would be in states that opted to expand. 
""Any decision in isolation to expand or not expand Medicaid could result in higher or lower overall deficits than if the decision went the other way,"" he wrote by email. ""The fact that the bill as a whole reduces the deficit doesn’t change that."" 
""The best we can say is that expanding Medicaid will require borrowing more money than not expanding Medicaid,"" he said. The deficit, he added, will be modestly higher if a state elects to expand Medicaid. 
CBO assumes all laws will be enacted exactly as written, included the component that reduces Medicare cuts to physician payments, ""which we all know never happens,"" said Gail Wilensky, a health care analyst who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush. 
""What is clear is that some of Florida’s poorest uninsured people could have had Medicaid coverage at no direct cost to Florida for at least the first three years,"" she said, adding that Weatherford’s logic is ""hanging on a theoretical and abstract principle."" 
As for Weatherford’s statement, Goldwein says it’s accurate to say expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money ""so long as you qualify that means more money than would otherwise be borrowed."" Goldwein said it’s hard to assess the ""expanding the deficit"" part of Weatherford’s statement. 
""That really raises the question – compared to what?"" Goldwein said. 
Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, took a broader read of Weatherford’s claim, saying the health care law is too complicated to tease out the budgetary impacts of any one policy without noting the impacts elsewhere. 
""The speaker talked about it as if expanding Medicaid was the only policy change instead of being coupled with many others in a package that had net deficit reduction and wouldn’t require borrowing more money or expanding the deficit,"" Ellis said. 
Our ruling 
Weatherford defended his key role in blocking federal money to help insure more low-income Floridians by pointing to the effect of all that extra health care spending on the country’s national deficit and debt. 
""Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit,"" Weatherford said. 
There’s no doubting the federal Medicaid expansion is a lot of dough, with the government slating about $900 billion over 10 years for each state to expand the program, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Ramping up federal spending for Medicaid, one of the biggest long-term deficit-drivers, will not be cheap. 
Weatherford’s commentary, however, is vague. He ignores nonpartisan research showing the cost of expanding Medicaid coverage is offset by other parts of the health care law. And yes, states that decide not to expand Medicaid can prevent more federal spending, but it would just further reduce the deficit -- by how much is unknown -- on top of its already slated contraction. Saying Medicaid expansion will ""drastically"" enhance the deficit is unproven. 
Weatherford’s claim hits a note about federal spending but omits key information.

Democratic ad targets Chris Christie on hikes for tolls, public transportation and tuition, as well as the millionaire's tax
","
Few things anger New Jerseyans more than higher costs – and that just may be the point of a recent radio ad critical of Gov. Chris Christie’s time in office. 
One New Jersey, a Democratic grass-roots group, released the ad May 3. It uses the sound effects of a deck of cards being shuffled and cut to emphasize a theme that Christie’s gubernatorial tenure thus far has stacked the deck against taxpayers. Christie is up for re-election in November. His lone challenger is state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex). 
The ad goes after Christie in a number of areas but we’re looking at issues that are near and dear to many New Jerseyans: toll costs, public transportation, education and the wealthy paying their fair share in taxes. 
""Under Republican Governor Chris Christie, tolls cost more. Train and bus rides cost more. College tuition goes up. But Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires,"" a portion of the 60-second ad states. 
Most of the claims are accurate but some details are lacking. 
Let’s start by reviewing toll hikes. 
One New Jersey is correct that tolls are higher under Christie, but doesn’t mention that the state has had two major toll increases in recent years – the larger of which was courtesy of Democrat Jon Corzine, not Christie. 
In August 2011, Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo agreed to raise trans-Hudson tolls by $1.50 starting in September 2011, followed by additional hikes of 75 cents annually through 2015 to fund a $33 billion capital plan for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Those increases affected the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the Outerbridge Crossing and the Goethals, Bayonne and George Washington bridges. 
The Corzine-approved hike that took effect Jan. 1, 2012 increased tolls 53 percent on the New Jersey Turnpike and 50 percent on the Garden State Parkway. Those hikes were the second part of a two-phase toll increase adopted by the Turnpike Authority in October 2008, when Corzine was governor. 
And costs also have increased for train and bus rides since Christie became governor in January 2010. 
Three months after Christie took office, NJ Transit approved its largest fare hike in history to help close a $300 million budget gap for the fiscal year beginning that July 1. 
The hikes, the first since 2007, amounted to 25 percent for train and some bus riders and 10 percent for local bus riders and light rail commuters. 
In February 2010 Christie called NJ Transit a ""political patronage pit"" that needed to cut costs and said fare hikes would be unavoidable since drivers of the state’s roads had just experienced another toll hike. 
Next, let’s look at college tuition. 
Christie cut funding for county colleges by 10 percent in 2010, a year that also saw record enrollment increases at the state’s two-year schools. Tuition increased an average of 4.4 percent. Also, 24 of New Jersey’s four-year colleges and universities raised tuition and fees in 2010 faster than the inflation rate, according to a Star-Ledger survey that year. Still, tuition generally increases annually at most schools. 
Finally, did Christie protect a tax cut for millionaires? 
Democrats approved a bill in May 2010 renewing a one-year tax rate increase of 10.75 percent for those with taxable income above $1 million. The rate had expired before Christie became governor. Christie, who campaigned that he wouldn’t raise taxes, vetoed the surcharge -- protecting the rich, some claim -- and Democrats couldn’t override it. 
""Plain and simple, Christie picks and chooses when and how to use his power – and on whose behalf,"" One New Jersey spokesman Joshua Henne said in an e-mail. ""He used his power to roll back a tax hike on millionaires, but chose not to use his power to roll back toll, tuition and fare increases that disproportionately hurt New Jersey’s middle-class and working families."" 
Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts declined comment. 
Our ruling 
Part of an ad about Christie claims, ""Under Republican Governor Chris Christie, tolls cost more. Train and bus rides cost more. College tuition goes up. But Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires."" 
The ad is correct that tolls, train and bus fares, and college tuition increased on Christie’s watch but disregards that some of those increases resulted because the governor slashed funding in an effort to close budget gaps. As for protecting a tax cut for millionaires, we’ve heard this one before and we’ll point out again that Christie technically didn’t cut the millionaire’s tax since it expired before he took office. Still, opinions vary wildly on that claim. We rate this portion of the ad Mostly True.

Talk show host Jeff Wagner says state requires 28 hand washings for making peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches
","
Conservative talk show host Jeff Wagner teased a few topics at the top of his show on May 8, 2013, then he posed a question and made a claim. 
""How many times do you wash your hands while making the same peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich? Maybe once, right? Maybe?"" he asked on WTMJ-AM (620) in Milwaukee. 
""Well, the State of Wisconsin thinks you should have to do it at least 28 times to make one peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich."" 
We happened to be driving to a lunch appointment (for Ethiopian food, not PB&Js) when we heard Wagner’s claim, so it caught our attention. 
Wagner’s evidence 
The former federal prosecutor replied promptly to our request for evidence to back his statement. He even went to the trouble of posting on his blog both the request and his response (which included the requisite dig at PolitiFact). 
The evidence consisted of two things: 
-- A four-paragraph Associated Press news article, headlined ""Outagamie County sues over food code inspections,"" that was posted on JSOnline.com the day before Wagner made his claim. 
-- A copy of a federal court lawsuit Outagamie County filed against the state over state inspections of the county-owned nursing home. 
Wagner also noted in his email that he discussed the lawsuit later in his show. (By the way, both the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which produces PolitiFact Wisconsin, and WTMJ are owned by Journal Communications.) 
That means listeners who only heard Wagner’s tease might have thought the state was poking its nose into their kitchen. But he made it clear half an hour later that his claim had to do with the nursing home lawsuit. 
The lawsuit 
Outagamie County sued the state Department of Health Services in March 2013, objecting to code violations cited in 2011 and 2012 at Brewster Village, a county-owned nursing home. 
State inspectors enforce both state and federal regulations governing nursing homes. And some of the violations cited at Brewster Village involve federal codes for food preparation. 
After the state issued its violation notices in 2011, according to the lawsuit, workers at the nursing home conducted ""time studies."" They wanted to see -- based on how they said the state interpreted federal food regulations -- how long it would take ""to provide for the number of hand washes, glove changes and other steps."" 
The county concluded that in order to comply, nursing home staff would need to wash their hands 28 times to safely make peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches -- rather than the nine times they normally do. 
Of course, in the context of a lawsuit, it’s in the county’s interest to claim the state-required number is as high as possible. Whether it’s nine times or 28 times, the impression for most will be the same: Really? 
Wash, wash, wash 
It’s important to remember we’re not talking about a person at home making a PB&J for their lunch, but multiple workers making sandwiches for medically fragile people in a 204-bed nursing home. 
Still, it seems like a whole lot of washing going on. 
State inspectors cited a number of instances at Brewster Village they said violated the federal food code. For example: workers adjusting knobs on a device that was soiled with a brown substance; pouring hot water into a pitcher without first washing hands; touching a drawer handle soiled with grease to remove a clean utensil from the drawer; and donning a pair of gloves and opening a drawer to get a clean utensil and, without hand washing, cutting open two bags of gravy mix. 
What does the state say about all this? 
State inspectors didn’t declare in their reports that nursing home staff needed to wash hands a particular number of times during food preparation. 
And the Department of Health Services wouldn’t comment to us on Outagamie County’s claim that, according to the state’s interpretation of federal rules, 28 hand washes are necessary during sandwich making. 
It seems likely, though, based on the violation notices the state issued, that the state believes the hand washing should have occurred more than nine times. 
Our rating 
Wagner said ""the State of Wisconsin thinks you should have to"" wash your hands ""at least 28 times to make one peanut butter and jelly sandwich."" 
Wagner later made it clear he was referring to food preparation in a county-owned nursing home. But although the state indicated it wanted nursing home staff to wash their hands more than nine times, it didn’t specify a number. 
Wagner’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2013/may/16/jeff-wagner/talk-show-host-jeff-wagner-says-state-requires-28-/

Mayor Leffingwell, with Spelman, says nearly a million people are ""coming to town"" in next 20 years
","
Austin’s city-owned utility, Austin Energy, needs more expert oversight than the Austin City Council can provide, Mayor Lee Leffingwell suggested in an opinion article he wrote with Council Member Bill Spelman.

""We’ve got 20-odd departments to watch over and — with nearly a million people coming to town in the next 20 years — incredible housing, land use, and transportation problems,"" the pair said in the piece placed online by the Austin American-Statesman on May 5, 2013.

A million people on the way?

Pack.

The.

Bags.

Leffingwell spokeswoman Amy Everhart guided us to a Spelman aide, Ashley Fisher, who said by phone that the 1 million figure reflected what the city projects to be the metropolitan region’s population gain within 20 years. Fisher said the reference to all those people ""coming to town"" was in keeping with how people think of Austin. Her point: ""We’re part of a region growing really fast,"" she said.

Separately, Ryan Robinson, the city’s demographer, told us he has estimated the city’s population at 824,750 as of April 1, 2013, which he said closely tracks the U.S. Census Bureau’s estimate of 820,611 as the city’s population as of July 2011.

Robinson said he projects the city to gain 330,000 residents, reaching a population of nearly 1.2 million, by April 2035.

That’s not a gain of nearly 1 million. But Robinson, who also pointed out that Austin Energy has customers outside the city limits in Travis County burgs including Pflugerville, Manor, Manchaca and Westlake Hills, said he projects the population of the counties immediately around Austin--Travis, Bastrop, Caldwell, Hays and Williamson--to increase by about 1.6 million by April 2035. As of April 2013, he said, the same metropolitan area was home to an estimated 1.87 million residents.

About one third of the increase, Robinson said, is expected to come from area births outpacing deaths, what demographers call the natural increase. The remaining margin would trace to more people moving into the counties than moving out, he said.

Robinson’s projections, dated January 2013, indicate the city’s population, which was under 500,000 in 1990, will crest 1 million by 2025.

Hunting other population projections, we touched base with Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein, who said the agency does not project the population of individual cities. Next, we consulted Rafael Gonzalez of the Texas State Data Center in San Antonio, who said similarly that the center does not project city population changes. 
But Gonzalez helped us download a projection suggesting that the five-county Austin region’s population, estimated at 1.8 million in 2013, would total nearly 2.6 million in 2033, assuming that migration occurs at half the pace of the first decade of this century--which Robinson, the city demographer, described as too conservative a rate for projecting Austin-area changes.

Under the slower growth scenario, the Austin region would see an increase of about 800,000 residents in 20 years. 
Using the center's interface, we also checked population projections assuming the same migration into the counties that the region experienced during the century's first decade. Under this scenario, the counties would have more than 3.3 million residents in 2033, a nearly 1.5 million increase from 2013. Finally, we inquired into Travis County’s estimated population on the interface. If the county experiences the same in-migration levels as the first decade of the century, its population would total nearly 1.6 million in 2033, up nearly 480,000 from 2013, according to the results. 
Spelman, elaborating on the 1-million statement, told us by email: ""If you want to split hairs and define ‘town’ as ‘the current Austin city limits,’"" then it’s correct that the city’s population is expected to increase by 332,244 by 2035.

""But please consider that our statement wasn’t about residency; it was about demand for city services and the scope of the problems we need to solve,"" Spelman said in a footnoted statement. He added that according to a 2007 economic census by the Census Bureau, some 70 percent of jobs in the five-county Austin region were in Austin, an indication, he said, that the vast majority of more than 1 million additional residents of the region will depend, at least in part, on the city for their livelihoods.

""Even if new residents of San Marcos, Georgetown, Luling or Bastrop don’t work in Austin,"" Spelman said, ""many of them will visit Austin regularly to shop, find health care or have a good time. While they’re here, these people will depend on the"" city ""for public safety, water and sewer, solid waste, flood control, parks and, of course, electricity."" Spelman added that Austin also will share stresses on the region’s housing and transportation infrastructure. 
Our ruling

Leffingwell and Spelman wrote that nearly a million people are ""coming to town"" in the next 20 years. 
Don’t pack those bags just yet; the city projects Austin’s population to increase by about 330,000--far short of a million--by 2035. 
The claim retains an element of truth, though, in that the city stands to confront pressures related to many more additional residents expected in the region. Regardless, all those newbies are not predicted to be moving to town, making the published statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/16/lee-leffingwell/leffingwell-spelman-says-nearly-million-people-are/
"['Ohio', 'Social Security', 'Marcy Kaptur']","
Rep. Marcy Kaptur says Social Security trust fund is sound into future
","
There’s a reason that Social Security is called the ""third rail"" of politics.  When President Barack Obama issued a 2014 budget proposalthat would cut Social Security’s spending growth by using a ""chained CPI"" to calculate inflation-related benefit increases, he was promptly zapped by many in his own political party, including Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Toledo. 
Kaptur denounced Obama’s proposal on the House of Representatives floor, arguing that the ""formula change that is being proposed would add up to a big cut for America’s senior citizens who have earned their benefits,"" and would harm struggling senior citizens. 
""The Social Security trust fund is sound,"" Kaptur said on April 11, 2013. ""Without anything being done, it would function well into 2038; and even after that time with no changes, we could pay 80 percent of the benefits that people have earned."" 
Given claimsfrom othersthat Social Security is bound for bankruptcy, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at Kaptur’s claims that the Social Security system can function without tweaking into 2038 and beyond. 
Kaptur’s spokesman Steve Fought referred us to an Oct. 2012 reportfrom the Congressional Budget Office. It projects the Social Security’s Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund will be exhausted in 2016 under current law, and its Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) fund will run out in 2038. 
The report notes that in past years when the disability fund ran short of cash, legislators allowed money from the old age fund be to be spent on the disabled, leading many people to consider the funds in tandem. If future legislation again shifts money from the old age fund to those with disabilities, CBO projects the joint fund would be exhausted in 2034. 
The report stressed its forecast is somewhat uncertain. It said the trust funds were exhausted in 2029 or earlier in 10 percent of the simulations it examined, and lasted until 2045 or later another 10 percent. 
In an email, Fought said Kaptur’s remarks referred to the Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. He noted that her speech only discussed the the elderly without mentioning the disabled. 
""Social Security is commonly associated, at least in layman’s circles, more so with OASI (old  age benefits) than with DI (disability benefits),"" Fought’s email said, adding it was that context in which Kaptur made her remarks. 
The CBO report notes that after the combined trust funds are exhausted in 2034, revenues the following year ""are projected to equal 81 percent of scheduled outlays. Thus, payable benefits will be 19 percent lower than scheduled benefits. The gap between scheduled and payable benefits will shrink slightly for the following decade, falling to 16 percent in 2050. It will then widen, and by 2086, payable benefits will be 24 percent smaller than scheduled benefits."" 
Fought said the CBO was referring to the combined funds, not just the Old Age and Survivors Insurance fund. He said it’s possible revenues would be higher than the 81 percent figure if only the OASI were examined, but said Kaptur’s speech used the more conservative 80 percent figure. 
The most recent Social Security trustees report, issued for 2012, didn’t echo Kaptur’s confidence about the trust fund’s long term health. The figures in it’s forecast were close to Kaptur’s numbers, but not identical. The reportpredicted the joint trust funds’ reserves would be exhausted in 2033, and  ""thereafter, tax income would be sufficient to pay only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2086."" If each program was considered alone, the trustees said the disability fund would be exhausted in 2016, and the old age fund would run out in 2035. The report urged lawmakers to address ""the long-run financial challenges facing Social Security and Medicare."" 
""If they take action sooner rather than later, more options and more time will be available to phase in changes so that the public has adequate time to prepare,"" the report said. 
The proposal Obama made to use the the chained CPI as Social Security’s inflation index is one of many ideas that’s been suggested to improve the program’s long term health and reduce the federal budget deficit. ""Chained CPI"" refers to the ""Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers."" It differs somewhat from the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, which the Social Security Administration currently uses to adjust benefits for inflation. 
The chained CPI  reflects substitutions that consumers make when prices rise. As the Congressional Budget Officeexplains it, ""many people can lessen the impact of inflation on their standard of living by purchasing fewer goods or services that have risen in price and, instead, buying more goods or services that have not risen in price or have risen less."" 
  
Using the chained CPI to adjust government benefits such as Social Security is would be estimated to save the government about $130 billionover the next decade. If such a proposal took effect next year, the CBO predictsSocial Security benefits would be roughly $30 a month lower, on average, by 2023 than they would be under current law, representing a reduction of about 2 percent of average benefits. A Social Security trustee told the House Ways and Means Committee the change would have a small beneficial impact on Social Security’s total financing shortfall, but won’t solve long term problems. 
""Accomplishing long lasting Social Security financing reforms will require far more substantial action to align the program’s basic benefit formula and eligibility rules with future tax schedules,"" trustee Charles Blahous told the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security.. 
Kaptur’s claim is partially accurate. She cited numbers from statistics compiled by the Congressional Budget Office. They don’t mesh precisely with the Social Security Administration’s numbers, but are fairly close. 
She’s on shakier ground with her contention that the fund is ""sound."" Without corrective action, Social Security’s old age trust fund will be exhausted in 25 years, the CBO projects, and its lack of funding could impact benefits for future senior citizens. That’s an important contextual factor. 

On the Truth-O-Meter, her statement is Half True.",/factchecks/2013/may/15/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-says-social-security-trust-/

PAC ad says Kelly Ayotte voted to fix background checks on gun sales
","
New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte saw her poll numbers drop after she voted against a proposal to expand background checks on gun sales. 
Now coming to her rescue is Marco Rubio’s Reclaim America PAC. The Florida senator’s group is out with an ad that says Ayotte ""voted to fix background checks."" 
What gives? Did she vote against them or vote to fix them? 
The answer depends on how you define the fix. Gun control groups say background checks won’t be fixed unless they are expanded to cover more types of gun sales. The bill Ayotte voted for did not do that, but it would have added more records to the database used to run background checks in hopes of keeping guns from criminals and the mentally ill. 
Let's explore. 
Manchin-Toomey amendment 
The background check amendment, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was a compromise intended to replace stricter language in Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. 
Current law requires checks on purchases only from federally licensed gun dealers. Reid’s bill would have expanded them to all transfers, even private ones among family members, with few exceptions. The Manchin-Toomey amendment attempted to find middle ground -- expanding the checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but not requiring them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. 
Ayotte joined Republican colleagues in a mostly partisan vote, defeating the measure 54-46. (Procedurally, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass). 
Ayotte, in declaring opposition to the measure, said: ""I believe that restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will not prevent a deranged individual or criminal from obtaining and misusing firearms to commit violence. While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales."" 
The Republican alternative 
The same day as the vote on Manchin-Toomey, Republican Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a substitute amendment. Like Manchin-Toomey, that amendment won a majority of votes (52-48), but not the needed 60. 
The Grassley amendment would have provided incentives for states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and required federal courts to do so. It also would have allocated money for prosecuting violations of the background check requirement. But it did not expand the requirement to cover any new firearms sales, such as at gun shows or over the Internet. (Editor's note: We looked more into the details of the Grassley amendment after we published this report. See our story for a more detailed discussion on the how the amendment would have worked.) 
Eight senators ended up voting in favor of both background check measures. 
In an op-ed several weeks after the votes, Ayotte said Manchin-Toomey would have expanded ""the broken background check system we have now."" 
""In my view, we shouldn’t be expanding a flawed system. The focus should be on fixing the existing system, which criminals are flouting. We need to make sure we are enforcing current law and prosecuting those who attempt to illegally obtain firearms,"" she wrote. ""And we must ensure that NICS includes records currently not being entered in the system, including mental health adjudications where an individual is found to be a danger to themselves and others."" 
Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a pro gun-control organization founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said the amendment Ayotte supported did ""nothing to close the gaping loophole that allows criminals to buy guns without background checks."" 
Our ruling 
The PAC ad said Ayotte voted to ""fix background checks."" 
But we found differing opinions on what would actually fix the system. 
Reclaim America’s evidence is her support for a measure that would have put more records into the instant criminal check system, with the aim of capturing more people whose gun applications should be rejected. But to many in the gun-control debate, fixing background checks means requiring them on firearms bought at gun shows and over the Internet. 
The ad, as you might expect, only portrays one side of the background check debate. The other side could reasonably argue that Ayotte stood in the way of fixing the loopholes in background checks. On balance, we rate the statement Half True. 
Update: After this story was published, we looked into more details about the Grassley amendment and how it would have worked, specifically the incentives to states to send mental health records to the federal background check database. We published our additional findings in this story. The ruling on this fact-check remains the same.",/factchecks/2013/may/15/reclaim-america-pac/pac-ad-says-kelly-ayotte-voted-fix-background-chec/

Jason Chaffetz says Americans ready to save men 'getting killed' in Benghazi were told to stand down
","With Americans under attack in Benghazi, did the U.S. military do all it could to save lives? Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, says no. Four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, were killed in attacks that began Sept. 11, 2012, on U.S. compounds in Benghazi, Libya. Meanwhile, four special forces troops ""willing to risk their lives to go save them"" were ""told to stand down,"" Chaffetz told Fox News host Sean Hannity. Did the U.S. fail to send life-saving help? Who knew what, when? Gregory Hicks was deputy chief of mission in Libya the night of the attacks, working from the capital, Tripoli, more than an hourlong flight away. He testified before lawmakers May 8, 2013, about a four-person team he had hoped would fly from Tripoli to Benghazi — but didn’t get permission to get on the plane. Chaffetz, the national security chairman for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, previewed Hicks’ testimony two days earlier for Fox News: Hannity: ""Congressman Chaffetz, there was — we now have discovered through testimony, Greg Hicks among others — that there was a C-130 ready to bring reinforcements during the attack to help those that were under fire and they were ordered to stand down?"" Chaffetz: ""The administration including (Defense) Secretary (Leon) Panetta were very crystal clear, there were no military assets, but I got to tell you, we had proximity, we had capability, we had four individuals in Libya armed, ready to go, dressed about to get into the car to go in the airport to go help their fellow countrymen who were dying and being killed and under attack in Benghazi and they were told to stand down. ""And Sean, of all the things I've seen, that's as sickening and depressing and disgusting as anything I have seen. That is not the American way. We had people that were getting killed, we had people who are willing to risk their lives to go save them and somebody told them to stand down."" But Hicks’ testimony and a State Department review board report show it was clear the ""people that were getting killed"" were already dead when the security team was ready to go. Here’s the time line: Attackers streamed into the State Department’s temporary mission on Sept. 11 at around 9:45 p.m. The ambassador called Hicks to alert him to the attack. As Tripoli and Washington scrambled to respond, attackers set a diesel-fueled fire that killed Stevens and information officer Sean Smith. Around 11:30 p.m., the surviving Americans drove an armored vehicle to an ""annex"" — a CIA facility — a few miles away. They fought off attackers for about an hour and a half, and were able to ""repulse them,"" Hicks said, by about 1:30 in the morning. Americans in Tripoli sent a seven-person security team to Benghazi, which landed around 1:15 a.m. Held up by lack of transportation and escort from Libyans, it got to the annex around 5 a.m. — just in time for a second attack. Mortar rounds rained, killing American security officers on the roof, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. Hicks said there ""was every reason to continue to believe that our personnel were in danger,"" so he wanted to send more help. ""We determined that we needed to send a second team from Tripoli to secure the airport for the withdrawal of our personnel from Benghazi after the mortar attack,"" he said. The order of what happened next isn’t clear. In Tripoli, cars took Americans to meet a Libyan C-130 (a military transport plane) that would fly to collect evacuees in Benghazi. In Benghazi, Libyan militia members helped Americans evacuate around 6:30 a.m. to the airport, with a Defense Department drone watching overhead. A charter plane took a first group. The second group waited for the C-130. Here’s what Hicks told lawmakers: ""The defense attache had persuaded the Libyans to fly their C-130 to Benghazi. ... Since we had consolidated at the annex, and the Libyan government had now provided us with external security around our facilities, we wanted to send further reinforcements to Benghazi. ""We determined that Lieutenant Gibson and his team of special forces troops should go. The people in Benghazi had been fighting all night. They were tired. They were exhausted. We wanted to make sure the airport was secure for their withdrawal. As Col. Gibson and his three personnel were getting in the cars, he stopped. And he called them off and told me that he had not been authorized to go. The vehicles had to go because the flight needed to go to Tripoli, I mean, to Benghazi. Lt. Col. Gibson was furious. I had told him to go bring our people home. That's what he wanted to do. … So the plane went. I think it landed in Benghazi around 7:30."" So the four men that Chaffetz talked about would have arrived more than two hours after the final deaths, after one group had already evacuated by charter plane. The C-130 landed back in Tripoli with the last evacuating Americans around 11:30 a.m. Chaffetz’s office says he never claimed that the ""four individuals"" would have saved lives — but that they were willing to go save people. ""What is clear is that at the time they were told to stand down, it was not known whether they could/would have played a role in saving lives,"" said spokesperson MJ Henshaw. Panetta told senators in February that the Defense Department ""employed every asset at our disposal that could have been used to help save lives of our American colleagues."" During Hicks’ testimony last week, Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., read from a Defense Department press release explaining the security team was directed to stay in Tripoli because those in Benghazi ""had shifted to evacuation."" ""We continue to believe that there was nothing this group could have done had they arrived in Benghazi, and they performed superbly in Tripoli,"" she read. ""In fact, when the first aircraft arrived back in Tripoli, these four played a key role in receiving, treating and moving the wounded."" Chaffetz’s spokesperson says it’s not clear exactly when the order was given that the special forces team stay in Tripoli, who gave it, or what was known about the safety of Americans in Benghazi when the order was given. ""We have asked for exact times repeatedly, but haven’t received answers,"" she said. Our ruling Chaffetz told Fox News that ""we had people that were getting killed, we had people who are willing to risk their lives to go save them and somebody told them to stand down."" But it’s clear from Hicks’ testimony that four Americans ""getting killed"" in Benghazi were already dead when the decision was made to keep the special forces team in Tripoli. The mortar attack was over. A Defense Department drone watched overhead in Benghazi as Libyan militia members helped Americans get to the airport. Chaffetz, however, says the team was available to go save ""people that were getting killed,"" calling the order to stand down ""sickening and depressing and disgusting."" His office clarifies he meant that the team might have prevented additional casualties if attacks had continued — an explanation utterly missing from his national TV appearance.

Barack Obama says review of Benghazi attack ""investigated every element""
","
President Barack Obama has been facing tough questions from journalists about recent congressional hearings that addressed the Sept. 11, 2012, attack against a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya. The attack, which left four Americans dead, has led to months of criticism by members of Congress about how the administration handled the incident. 
During a joint appearance with British Prime Minister David Cameron on May 13, 2013, Obama said Benghazi is being politicized by some members of Congress. ""The day after it happened, I acknowledged that this was an act of terrorism,"" Obama said. ""And what I pledged to the American people was that we would find out what happened, we would make sure that it did not happen again, and we would make sure that we held accountable those who had perpetrated this terrible crime."" 
Obama said that a review board headed by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering ""investigated every element of this. And what they discovered was some pretty harsh judgments in terms of how we had worked to protect consulates and embassies around the world."" 
The office of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, jumped on Obama’s comments in a Web post and in an email to reporters. Boehner’s office contended that Obama was wrong to argue that the review board co-chaired by Mullen and Pickering ""investigated every element"" of the Benghazi incident, contending that the review was actually quite limited. 
So who’s right? 
First, we turned to the publicly released report of the Accountability Review Board. The report states that it looked specifically at ""whether the attacks were security related; whether security systems and procedures were adequate and implemented properly; the impact of intelligence and information availability; whether any other facts or circumstances in these cases may be relevant to appropriate security management of U.S. missions worldwide; and, finally, whether any U.S. government employee or contractor, as defined by the Act, breached her or his duty."" 
That’s a pretty broad purview, but it doesn’t include everything related to the Benghazi incident. For starters, the FBI -- not the review board -- was charged with determining who exactly attacked the embassy, as Pickering noted in a Dec. 19, 2012, briefing in which the board’s final report was released. The FBI is tasked with determining whether the incident stemmed from a pre-planned terrorist attack, a demonstration against an anti-Islamic film, a combination of the two, or something else entirely. 
In addition, the report covers security-related issues leading up to the attack as well as the attack itself -- not what happened afterward, as the administration was explaining what had taken place to the American public. 
This distinction is important because some of the most pointed questions that have been raised since the attack include how the administration portrayed the incident in its public announcements and the talking points administration officials used on television. (See a related fact-check on the talking points here.) 
Critics of the administration get some support on this point from Pickering himself, who went on three Sunday-morning shows on May 12 and offered a consistent argument that the board he co-chaired had a limited purview, looking only at security issues, not communications with the public. 
• ""With full respect,"" he told David Gregory on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""the Accountability Review Board was there to look at the question of security. We did not examine talking points after the fact."" 
• On CBS’ Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer asked Pickering why the board didn’t look at the talking points. He responded, ""Because we were asked to look in under the law at five questions, all of which had to do with security, with the adequacy of security, with the preparation of security, with intelligence and whether anyone breached their duties. That was in effect, our mandate. At the time, and still now, I find it hard to see how the talking points issues relate to the security at the Benghazi mission."" 
• On CNN’s State of the Union, host Candy Crowley asked a similar question. ""Candy, that was not in our mandate,"" Pickering replied. ""We were looking into security, security warnings, security capacity, those kinds of things. And so, I have been very clear that since it wasn't our mandate, I didn't do the investigation."" 
Our ruling 
Obama said, ""Over the last several months, there was a review board headed by two distinguished Americans, Mike Mullen and Tom Pickering, who investigated every element of"" the Benghazi incident. 
The definition of what constitutes ""Benghazi"" is a highly politicized bone of contention between the administration and its critics. Obama’s apparent decision to define the Benghazi incident as the security concerns before and during the attack is understandable, given that Obama said at the same briefing that ""the whole issue of talking points, frankly, throughout this process has been a sideshow."" But this isn’t the only definition, nor is it an unassailable one. 
While the board did investigate numerous angles of the security issues, it didn’t look at who perpetrated the attack, nor did it probe the administration’s public communications afterward. No less an authority than the board’s co-chairman undercut Obama’s sweeping claim that the board ""investigated every element"" with repeated comments on three Sunday shows. On balance, we rate Obama’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/14/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-review-benghazi-attack-investiga/

The lottery is a hot topic around these parts. Many Georgians are daily players of the various high-odds games. For the state, the Georgia Lottery also funds the HOPE college scholarship program and Georgia’s pre-kindergarten program. 
The lottery’s high-energy radio and television advertisements fill airtime on several local stations, touting its games and payouts. 
One such ad caught the attention of Politifact Georgia reader Greg Queen, who asked us in an email to check out the numbers. 
The ad says that the Georgia Lottery Corp. paid out $2.3 billion in prizes during the last fiscal year. 
""I find (the figure of $2.3 billion in prizes paid) hard to believe,"" Queen emailed us. 
Queen also questioned whether the Georgia Lottery was including money paid out as part of multistate games such as Mega Millions and Powerball. 
PolitiFact Georgia has previously checked a couple of state lottery claims. We researched the experience of its director in relation to that of other state lottery leaders. We also checked another reader’s request about whether the lottery was overstating its odds by claiming prizes of another ticket or the face value of a ticket as ""wins."" 
  
We wondered whether the lottery’s $2.3 billion figure was accurate and exactly what was included in that amount. 
Our reader, Queen, saw the ad first on Atlanta’s ABC affiliate, WSB-TV; he later heard it on the station’s radio partner, AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB. PolitiFact Georgia happened to be up late one night consulting our psychic for winning Powerball numbers when we also saw the ad on TV. 
In addition to the $2.3 billion statement, the ad also includes information about payouts and winnings for some of its games. 
We checked with lottery representatives for more information. 
Spokeswoman Tandi Reddick told us that the $2.3 billion paid out in prizes for the last fiscal year (July 1, 2011-June 30, 2012) includes prizes paid to Georgia winners of games played in multiple states, such as Mega Millions and Powerball. For Mega Millions, the prizes won in Georgia reached $79.5 million; the total was $55.5 million for Powerball. 
The jackpot prizes for those multistate games are funded proportionately by all member states based on that state’s games sales for the particular drawing, Reddick said. All other prizes for Mega Millions (played in 42 states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands) and Powerball (played in 43 states, D.C. and the Virgin Islands) are also shared by participating states. Those games are administered by the nonprofit Multi-State Lottery Association, made up of member state lotteries that offer one or more of the multistate games. 
Also of note, the $2.3 billion figure quoted in the ad does not include tickets paid as prizes, Reddick said. 
So how does the lottery pay for all those prizes? On the income side, the Georgia Lottery recorded total ticket sales for fiscal 2012 of $3.835 billion, according to the lottery’s 2012 financial statements. 
So does the Georgia Lottery’s claim hit the jackpot? 
In TV and radio ads, the Georgia Lottery Corp. claims that it paid out $2.3 billion in prizes during the last fiscal year. The figure appears to be true but is padded to include amounts paid out for Georgia winners of the multistate games, Powerball and Mega Millions.

"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says record level of boots on ground near border and illegal crossings down nearly 80%
","In his weekly radio address May 4, 2013, President Barack Obama revisited an administration message that tends to draw attention in Texas.

""The truth is, right now, our border with Mexico is more secure than it’s been in years,"" Obama said. ""We’ve put more boots on that border than at any time in our history, and illegal crossings are down by nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000.""

Obama went on to extol a developing Senate effort to overhaul immigration laws, potentially enabling U.S. residents lacking federal permission to be here to qualify for citizenship.

We've explored proclamations about border security before. For this article, we wondered about Obama’s references to boots on the ground and illegal crossings.

Boots on the border

By email, Heather Wong, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, pointed us to a Border Patrol chart indicating that in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2012, the agency had 18,516 agents stationed in its Southwest sector, which sweeps in the southern border region. Those agents, up by 10 from the year before, comprised 87 percent of 21,394 agents nationally, according to the chart, which indicated the 2012 count in the border region was at least greater than at any time since 1983, the earliest year shown, when there were about 3,500 agents in the region of about 4,000 nationally.

In the year that began Oct. 1, 2012, the chart indicates, the nation’s total number of Border Patrol agents dipped 2 percent to 21,394.

As PolitiFact has noted before, the biggest bump in Border Patrol staffing came under Obama’s predecessor, President George W. Bush. Between 2001 and 2009, Bush’s tenure, the number of agents posted nationally rose from about 9,800 to a little more than 20,000. In May 2011, PolitiFact quoted Jack Martin of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter illegal immigration guidelines, as saying: ""There has been a steady buildup of BP officers for several years given impetus by the 9/11 attacks.""

We’d snap-shut this portion of our review except the country has historically put boots on the ground near the southern border for other reasons, as PolitiFact colleagues have explored. There was the Mexican-American War of 1846 and the lesser known Mexican Expedition of 1916.

Should those military activities count as ""boots on the ground"" on the border?

Our thinking is that neither event quite matches modern-day circumstances. The Mexican-American War was a war that happened after the United States annexed Texas in 1845, making it more of a battle to define the border than defend it.

At first glance, the Mexican Expedition seems a bit different. Those events occurred during the Mexican Revolution, when Pancho Villa launched a surprise attack inside the United States at Columbus, N.M. History books say that President Woodrow Wilson sent somewhere between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the border in 1916, far more personnel than the Border Patrol has ever dispatched.

But historians previously told PolitiFact the Mexican Expedition isn't directly comparable with the 21st-century border situation. ""During the Mexican insurrection, Pancho Villa raided into U.S. territory. It was, then, not about attempts by Mexicans to get into the U.S. individually for various personal reasons, or drug smuggling, etc.,"" Richard H. Kohn, a professor emeritus of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said by email.

Clemson University historian Paul Christopher Anderson agreed that current concerns with immigration are very different from worries of the early 1900s. ""The U.S. involvement on the border and in Mexico from 1913 to 1917 was tied primarily to questions of diplomacy, imperialism and Mexican sovereignty,"" he said by email.

Illegal crossings

Setting aside boots, are illegal crossings of the border down nearly 80 percent from 2000?

It’s impossible to pinpoint that, given that the crossings are often secretive.

Homeland Security’s Wong offered an indirect indicator, U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions, which in the year that ran through September 2012 totaled nearly 365,000, the government says, which was 78 percent less than the nearly 1.7 million apprehensions in fiscal 2000. That percentage reduction in apprehensions also occurred in the region near the U.S.-Mexico border.

A Border Patrol chart shows that while 2000 was the latest peak year for apprehensions, 1986 was the overall peak year; the agency that year reported 1.69 million apprehensions, a tally not topped by the 1.68 million apprehensions 14 years later.

Then again, another chart shows there were nearly 28,000 fewer apprehensions in the southern border region in 1986 than in 2000, when the 1.64 million apprehensions set a record for the Southwest sector. Apprehensions near the border have not exceeded 1 million since 2006, the chart indicates, and they decreased every year from 2006 through 2011 when they totaled 327,577, the least apprehensions in the sector since 1972.

In 2012, the nearly 357,000 apprehensions in the region reflected a one-year uptick of 9 percent.

We asked Homeland Security if this means there also was a recent increase in illegal crossings. Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard emailed us a statement attributed to Michael Friel, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, that did not address our question head-on. Friel said the agency has noted increased apprehensions in South Texas, particularly of individuals from Central American countries. Increases in manpower and technology, Friel said, give the agency confidence it’s apprehending more illegal border crossers.

Linking boots on the border to illegal crossings

Generally lower levels of apprehensions are one thing. But do they signal the extent of illegal crossings, what Obama highlighted?

By email, Boogaard called Border Patrol apprehensions the ""best measure of illegal or illicit border crossings.""

When demographers try to measure the number of people crossing the border illegally, they usually refer to the net flow -- arrivals to the United States minus departures. Lately, that number has been essentially a wash, according to statistics from the Pew Hispanic Center.      

In its April 2012 report, the Pew center estimated that between 2010 and 2011, the number of immigrants from Mexico declined so much that the flow into Mexico was bigger than the flow out of Mexico for the first time since ""probably in the 1930s,"" Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for Pew, told PolitiFact in October 2012.

Still, apprehension statistics are an imperfect gauge of population flow, since they can be affected by the magnitude of the border patrol effort. Passel said that while this statistic is not a ""direct measure of flow across the border,"" it is ""widely accepted as an indicator of the magnitude of the flow.""

There is disagreement, at least, over how changes in enforcement levels near the border affect illegal crossings.

Passel has said that Obama has a point that law enforcement -- something the president has influence over -- has a major impact. ""We know from various surveys that the cost of hiring a smuggler to get into the U.S. has increased significantly as enforcement has been ramped up,"" he said. ""We also know that Mexicans have been pushed into more remote areas to try to cross where it is physically more difficult and dangerous.""

But Doug Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research who has studied immigration issues, considers the economy the overriding factor. The recession, he said, had an immense effect on border crossings. Dwindling prospects of finding a job in sectors such as construction, which traditionally attract a disproportionate number of Latinos, dampened the urge for potential Mexican migrants to undertake a difficult journey, Massey said.

Massey, saying the government could achieve substantial savings by reducing border patrols, has called intensified border enforcement ""counterproductive. Rather than discouraging the entry of undocumented workers, it lowers their rate of departure and thereby raises net immigration,"" he wrote in a 2007 paper. In a 2011 book, Massey attributed the reduction of undocumented migration to near zero to a combination of ""harsh enforcement, expanding guest worker migration and economic turmoil.""

Finally, as PolitiFact colleagues have noted, other significant factors have been out of Obama’s control -- namely, the state of the economy in Mexico (which has been relatively healthy) and the activity of the drug cartels (which has increased violence on the Mexican side of the border).

Our ruling

Obama said: ""We’ve put more boots on"" the U.S.-Mexico ""border than at any time in our history, and illegal crossings are down by nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000.""

There are more Border Patrol agents than ever along the border and while there once were more troops there, we do not see those military pursuits as comparable to existing day-to-day border enforcement.

But the claim has other flaws. For starters, most of the surge in agents that Obama said ""we"" put on the border occurred under Bush. Also, there is no count indicating illegal border crossings are down nearly 80 percent. Obama evidently put a fine point on an indirect indicator, Border Patrol apprehensions, which were 78 percent lower in the border region in 2012 than in 2000, the year the Southwest sector experienced its peak level of apprehensions. Finally, his statement fails to acknowledge there is at least debate over whether economic conditions, rather than enforcement, drive ebbs and flows in such migration. Notably, too, those conditions aren’t independently controlled by any president.

There is sufficient missing context here to make Obama’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/may/13/barack-obama/obama-says-record-level-boots-ground-near-us-mexic/

Jay Carney says Susan Rice didn't play down terrorist involvement in Benghazi
","
Journalists peppered President Barack Obama’s press secretary, Jay Carney, with a series of tough questions about Benghazi at a White House press briefing on May 10, 2013.  The incident, in which four Americans were killed at two U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, was the topic at a congressional hearing on May 8. 
Members of Congress have criticized how the administration handled the Sept. 11, 2012, incident, both in the immediate aftermath and in the months since. One of the issues receiving the most attention is whether, or to what extent, Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice misled the American public about the incident when she offered talking points on five Sunday morning talk shows on Sept. 16, 2012. 
The criticism has focused on whether Rice was playing down the possibility that the attack in Benghazi was a pre-planned event carried out by terrorists, as opposed to flowing organically from a series of public protests at U.S. facilities throughout the Arab world following the news reports about a movie made in the U.S. that mocked Islam. 
At the press briefing, Carney responded to questions about Rice’s talking points by saying, ""If you look at the issue here, the efforts to politicize it were always about were we trying to play down the fact that there was an act of terror and an attack on the embassy.  … Susan Rice, when she went out on the Sunday shows using the very talking points that we're discussing now, talked about the possibility that we knew that, or believed based on the intelligence assessment, that extremists were involved, and there were suspicions about what affiliations those extremists might have, but there were not … hard, concrete evidence. And so Ambassador Rice, in those shows, talked about the possibility that al-Qaida might be involved, or other al-Qaida affiliates might be involved, or non-al-Qaida Libyan extremists (might be involved), which I think demonstrates that there was no effort to play that down. It was simply a reflection of we did not, and the intelligence community did not, and others within the administration did not, jump to conclusions about who was responsible before we had an investigation to find out the facts."" 
So was Carney correct that she mentioned al-Qaida and did not try to ""play that down""? 
We asked the White House for evidence, but didn't hear back by publication time. So we went back to the transcripts of Rice’s appearances on five shows -- CBS’ Face the Nation, CNN’s State of the Union, NBC’s Meet the Press, Fox News Sunday and ABC’s This Week. We’ve collected the relevant exchanges from each show below and, to show the repetition of her talking points, highlighted them in bold, as well as her one reference to al-Qaida. 
You'll see that Carney did not accurately describe what Rice said and that she in fact did play down the possible involvement of al-Qaida. 
• • • • • 
CBS’ Face the Nation 
Rice: ""Based on the best information we have to date, what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy sparked by this hateful video. But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution. And that it spun from there into something much, much more violent."" 
Host Bob Schieffer: ""But you do not agree with (Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.) that this was something that had been plotted out several months ago?"" 
Rice: ""We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned."" 
Schieffer: ""Do you agree or disagree with him that al-Qaida had some part in this?"" 
Rice: ""Well, we'll have to find out that out. I mean I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence. Whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine."" 
• • • • • 
CNN’s State of the Union 
Rice: ""Let’s recall what has happened in the last several days. There was a hateful video that was disseminated on the Internet. It had nothing to do with the United States government and it's one that we find disgusting and reprehensible. It's been offensive to many, many people around the world. 
""That sparked violence in various parts of the world, including violence directed against western facilities including our embassies and consulates. That violence is absolutely unacceptable, it's not a response that one can ever condone when it comes to such a video. And we have been working very closely and, indeed, effectively with the governments in the region and around the world to secure our personnel, secure our embassy, condemn the violent response to this video. 
""And, frankly, we've seen these sorts of incidents in the past. We've seen violent responses to (Salman Rushdie’s novel, The) Satanic Verses. We've seen violent responses to the cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in an evil way. So this is something we've seen in the past, and we expect that it's possible that these kinds of things could percolate into the future. What we're focused on is securing our personnel, securing our facilities. ... 
""(It was a) horrific incident where some mob was hijacked ultimately by a handful of extremists."" 
• • • • • 
NBC’s Meet The Press 
Rice: ""We can't predict with any certainty, but let's remember what has transpired over the last several days. This is a response to a hateful and offensive video that was widely disseminated throughout the Arab and Muslim world. ... 
""Let me tell you the best information we have at present. First of all, there is an FBI investigation, which is ongoing, and we look to that investigation to give us the definitive word as to what transpired. But putting together the best information that we have available to us today -- our current assessment is that what happened in Benghazi was, in fact, initially a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo -- almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video. 
""What we think then transpired in Benghazi is that opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as this was unfolding. They came with heavy weapons, which, unfortunately, are readily available in post-revolutionary Libya, and that escalated into a much more violent episode. Obviously, that's our best judgment now. We'll await the results of the investigation."" 
• • • • • 
Fox News Sunday 
Host Chris Wallace: ""The top Libyan official says that the attack on Tuesday was, quote, his words ‘preplanned.’ Al-Qaida says the operation was revenge for our killing a top al-Qaida leader. What do we know?"" 
Rice: ""Well, first of all, Chris, we are obviously investigating this very closely. The FBI has a lead in this investigation. The information, the best information and the best assessment we have today is that in fact this was not a preplanned, premeditated attack. That what happened initially was that it was a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired in Cairo as a consequence of the video. People gathered outside the embassy and then it grew very violent and those with extremist ties joined the fray and came with heavy weapons, which unfortunately are quite common in post-revolutionary Libya and that then spun out of control. 
""But we don't see at this point signs this was a coordinated plan, premeditated attack. Obviously, we will wait for the results of the investigation and we don't want to jump to conclusions before then. But I do think it's important for the American people to know our best current assessment."" 
• • • • • 
ABC’s This Week 
Rice: ""First of all, it's important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired. But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what this began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated. 
""We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate, rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons, weapons that as you know in the wake of the revolution in Libya are quite common and accessible. And it then evolved from there. We'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have at present."" 
• • • • • 
How do these comments speak to Carney’s claim? Here are a few key points. 
Did Rice talk about ""the possibility that al-Qaida might be involved"" or that ""al-Qaida affiliates might be involved""? 
Barely. In only one of the five interviews did Rice speak the words ""al-Qaida"" -- on Face the Nation -- and even then she urged caution in jumping to conclusions. ""Whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine,"" she told Schieffer. 
Did Rice talk about whether ""non-al-Qaida Libyan extremists"" might be involved? 
Yes -- repeatedly. But it’s worth noting that Rice portrayed these extremists as opportunists who seized the moment during a public uprising, which is something quite different from the pre-planned terrorist attack that the administration’s critics are charging the White House initially played down. Indeed, Rice explicitly, and repeatedly, shot down speculation that the attack was planned in advance, for instance telling Schieffer, ""We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned."" 
Did Rice play down any of the three listed scenarios? 
Yes. In the one interview of the five in which she mentioned al-Qaida at all, she urged caution about assuming they were involved. And while she did allow that ""extremists"" appeared to have been involved in the attack, she made a point of saying in every interview that these extremists got involved only by hijacking an ongoing event that protested the anti-Islam film, a narrative that gives almost a secondary role to the extremists. Meanwhile, in three of the five interviews, Rice specifically rejected the idea that Benghazi amounted to a preplanned terrorist attack. 
Our ruling 
Carney said that Rice ""talked about the possibility that al-Qaida might be involved, or other al-Qaida affiliates might be involved, or non-al-Qaida Libyan extremists (might be involved), which I think demonstrates that there was no effort to play that down."" 
It’s true that Rice offered those three scenarios, but Carney is wrong to say she didn’t play them down. Rice barely mentioned the potential role of al-Qaida or one of its affiliates, and she urged caution about jumping to conclusions on the one occasion in which she did. 
And while she did point to a role for ""extremists,"" Rice made clear that the extremists didn’t pre-plan the attack, but instead hijacked a demonstration that was already under way. 
Both decisions played down, to one degree or another, each of the three scenarios she mentioned. We rate Carney’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/13/jay-carney/jay-carney-says-susan-rice-didnt-play-down-terrori/

Kathy Castor says 70,000 children will lose access to Head Start including 2,000 in Florida
","
Faced with complaints about airport delays, members  of Congress (who happen to be frequent fliers) took action to halt sequester-related furloughs for air traffic controllers. 
Some Democrats want to know why other groups aren’t getting similar relief from the sequester. 
U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, railed against cuts to Head Start on MSNBC’s Hardball. Host Chris Matthews said Head Start ""faces a $406 million cut, which would kick 70,000 kids out of the program."" 
Castor responded: ""70,000 three-year-olds and four-year-olds across America will lose access to the preschool Head Start classroom. Now Head Start is intended for students who don’t have every advantage in life to ensure that they are ready for elementary school. It’s also important because it ensures that their parents are ready to work. (That’s) 70,000 students across America and 2,000 in the state of Florida alone because the Republicans refuse to replace the sequester or sit down with us to negotiate a balanced plan."" 
Castor only mentioned Head Start and provided specific numbers. Two months into the sequester, we wondered what evidence supports the claim that 70,000 preschoolers will lose access to Head Start. We were especially interested whether it would be 2,000 in Florida. 
Head Start sequester 
Head Start is an early education program that aims to increase kids’ ""school readiness"" with whole or half-day programs. Head Start serves more than 1 million kids a year. The program offers contracts to local providers, so sometimes multiple groups will offer Head Start programs, even within a single county. That's why claims about the program are estimates, because decisions about how many children to enroll are made on the local level. 
Before the sequester, Head Start enrollment was at record highs because the Obama administration nearly doubled the number of children enrolled in Early Head Start through the economic stimulus, leading to a dramatic rise between 2009 and 2010. Congress decided to spend more money on Head Start in the next two years to keep enrollment at that level. 
A month before the sequester took effect, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote in a Feb. 1 letter that ""up to 70,000 children"" would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start. The White House released estimates that stated Head Start would be eliminated for 2,700 Florida children. (Castor's office pointed us to federal estimates as evidence for her claim.) 
The 70,000 estimate hasn’t changed, HHS spokesman Ted Froats told PolitiFact Florida. The agency came up with the number through a formula based on appropriations, past levels of children served and the cost to serve a child. The number is not based on responses from programs about how they will handle the cut -- or have already. The federal Office of Head Start is collecting information on how programs are handling the cuts and expects to have that data in June. 
""We do know that many programs have closed services early for this year and others have begun reducing the number of children served,"" Froats said in an email. 
Programs were notified of their 5.27 percent budget cut in late April, and many are still determining how to implement the cut, according to the National Head Start Association. (For months they had been expecting around a 5 percent cut.) 
We read multiple media reports about Head Start; many stories reference predictions of lost spots, repeating the federal government’s pre-sequester estimates. Some programs found ways to maintain enrollment, such as by reducing teacher in-service days. 
The New York Times cited a few examples of the various impacts: In Colorado Springs, children decorated chairs to sell at $500 apiece; so far the fundraiser had saved two seats. Meanwhile a Head Start program in the Maine community of Pejepscot is being closed, as are programs in two Texas towns. 
We should explain that losing ""access"" can also mean anywhere from closing one day a month to switching from a full year program to nine months. Many programs are offering spots to fewer new children next school year. 
We checked in with some Head Start programs around the state of Florida. Here’s what we found: 
• Broward County: The program run through the Broward school district will not reduce enrollment. Broward plans to cut nine staff positions -- mostly retirements, plus two will get laid off -- and shorten Early Head start from 11 months a year to 10 months to achieve cuts of about $1 million. About 2,100 children attend the programs. Matching funds from the school district are helping Broward avoid cutting services to children. 
""We are not cutting any seats,"" said Broward head start coordinator Claudia Dean. 
• Miami-Dade County: More than 7,000 students are served by the program. County Mayor Carlos Gimenez’ proposed fiscal year 2013-14 budget includes an additional $2.9 million for Head Start to offset the federal reduction. The investment will allow the county to maintain the number of children served by the program.   
• Hillsborough County: The Hillsborough County School District, the county’s largest Head Start provider,  has so far avoided cutting spots by holding off on building two covered play areas and canceling field trips. 
But it will reduce the number of children it serves by 40 in its next budget, district spokesman Steve Hegarty told PolitiFact Florida. ""That will require five fewer staffers,"" he said. 
The district will lose $551,000 from sequestration in its current budget, and it expects to lose more in the new one that begins in October. 
The county, which oversees the federal grant, dealt with budget cuts by cutting vacant positions and training, said Maria Mason, deputy director of program operations for the county's Head Start/Early Head Start program. The county is still assessing how a $1.4 million cut will affect its 2013-14 budget, but Mason is certain it will result in fewer slots for kids and lotteries to determine who gets access. 
""We don't have any true numbers at this point,"" she said. 
Lutheran Services Florida also works as a subcontractor for Hillsborough County’s Early Head Start program. It serves 120 kids but will eliminate eight spots next year. 
• Hernando, Sumter and Volusia counties: The staff agreed to forgo contributions to retirement accounts, eliminate staff training and reduce cleaning services to avoid reducing services this year, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Next year, the number of children accepted will drop by about 50. One program in Seville will close two weeks early, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. 
• Palm Beach County: The Head Start program in Belle Glade, a city within Palm Beach County, plans to cut up to 30 spots for the 2013-14 year, according to David Yarborough, a vice president for Lutheran Services Florida. The Palm Beach Post reported that bus service would end for hundreds of children in Head Start in Palm Beach. 
• Pinellas County: Lutheran Services Florida will soon take over Pinellas County’s Head Start grant, but Yarborough said he didn’t yet know how it will handle the cuts there. 
Our ruling 
Castor said, ""70,000 three-year-olds and four-year-olds across America will lose access to the preschool Head Start program. … 2,000 in the state of Florida alone."" 
Castor omitted that important qualifier ""up to"" 70,000 children that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provided in February. Her Florida figure comes from the White House (2,700 for Florida) and the National Head Start Association (2,000). 
HHS hopes to provide data in June that will show how many spots for Head Start are actually being cut based on reporting by the programs. Until federal officials share that data, it is difficult to come up with an accurate nationwide number based on anecdotal evidence in news articles. 
Also, Castor used a vague term by saying the children will lose ""access."" Access could mean a number of things, from scaling back weeks of operation, removing bus service, or cutting enrolled kids. News reports show many programs are finding ways to completely avoid or at least reduce the number of affected children by cutting other parts of the program, such as staff retirement funds and cleaning services, and holding fundraisers.

Ron Meyer says 30 percent of Americans under 30 have full-time jobs
","
Republican Ron Meyer, Jr., 23, recently announced on Fox News that he will challenge incumbent Democrat Gerry Connolly in the 11th District congressional race next year. 
Meyer had a quick answer for those who wondered whether he is too young to run: He’ll turn 25 shortly before the 2014 general election, which is the U.S. Constitution’s minimum age for holding a congressional seat. And should he win, Meyer said his youth would give him valuable insight into issues facing young Americans, including a lackluster employment outlook. 
""Only three in 10 young Americans under 30  -- 30 percent under 30 -- have full-time work,"" Meyer said while announcing his candidacy in a recent interview on Fox News. 
We wondered whether Meyer was correct. 
Meyer told us he based his claim on a February 2013 report about civic engagement among 18-29 year olds that was sponsored by the National Conference on Citizenship, Harvard University’s Institute of Politics and several other groups. 
One of the findings is that the Millennial Generation -- which the study defined as those born between 1983 and 1994 -- has been hit hard by the sluggish economy. Researchers, computing data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, looked at 18-29 year-olds  and found ""62.9 percent are currently working, of which 31.2 percent work on a part-time basis."" 
Meyer interpreted those figures to mean that the remaining 31.7 percent who were employed had a full time job. 
But his interpretation ""isn’t quite right,"" according to Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, a co-author of the report and lead researcher at CIRCLE, the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.  
She pointed out the study said that of the 62.9 percent employed, 31.2 percent held part-time  jobs -- or slightly less than a third of those in the age group who are working. 
So when all Americans in that age group are considered -- those employed and those who are not  -- about 20 percent have part-time positions and 43 percent have full time jobs, Kawashima-Ginsberg said. 
There’s another issue to consider. The figures were compiled using November 2011 data. 
Kawashima-Ginsberg ran new figures for us, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau. For March 2013, she came up with a similar result: 42 percent of people age 18-29 had full-time jobs. 
Of people 30 and older, 50.4 percent had full-time job in March, according to figures compiled by Kawashima-Ginsberg. 
Craig Copeland, a senior research associate at the Employee Benefits Research Institute, said economic changes have made it harder for young people to find jobs. But there’s another important factor to consider when looking at full-time employment among the 18-29 age group -- many of them are working part time until they leave college. 
""There is a significant percentage of those people who are (working) part-time for a reason, not because they can’t find a job,"" Copeland said. ""If they’re working part-time, they’re most likely a college student."" 
Over the last decade or so, the number of young people holding a full-time job has trended downwards, even before the Great Recession, Copeland said. The reason is that a higher percentage of that group has been going to college and because members of the Baby Boom generation are staying in jobs longer, Copeland said. 
But the recession, which ran from December 2007 to June 2009, certainly caused the percentage with full-time jobs to go down faster, he said. 
Copeland pulled annual average employment figures from the U.S. Census showing that in 2004, 54.1 percent of people age 18-29 had a full-time job and that dropped  to 52.6 percent by 2008. By 2011 -- the latest yearly figures available -- the percent of 18-29 year olds with a full-time job was 45.6 percent, he said. 
Our ruling 
Meyer said that 30 percent of the Americans younger than 30 had full-time jobs, but he misinterpreted data in a report. The study actually indicates that 43 percent of the age group had full time jobs. 
While Meyer’s number is off, his point holds up: a smaller portion of 18-29 year olds hold full time jobs today that before the recession. We rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2013/may/13/ron-meyer/ron-meyer-says-30-percent-workers-under-30-have-fu/
