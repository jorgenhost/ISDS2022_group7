What Obama said about Islamic State as a 'JV' team
","President Barack Obama granted an exclusive sit down to Meet the Press for new host Chuck Todd’s inaugural show. As expected, Todd and Obama had a long discussion about the administration’s strategy for dealing with Islamic State, the terrorist group responsible for the beheading of two American journalists, with Obama stating ""we’re going to defeat them."" Todd then remarked that Obama’s response was a ""long way from when you described them as a JV team."" ""Was that bad intelligence or your misjudgment?"" Todd asked. ""Keep in mind I wasn’t specifically referring to (Islamic State),"" Obama replied. ""I've said that, regionally, there were a whole series of organizations that were focused primarily locally, weren’t focused on homeland, because I think a lot of us, when we think about terrorism, the model is Osama bin Laden and 9/11."" Is Obama editing his remarks or did Todd misrepresent what Obama said? We decided to take a look. Critics have maligned Obama’s ""JV"" remark in recent weeks as the Islamic State continues to wreak havoc throughout Syria and Iraq. The origin of the comment is a New Yorker profile of Obama by editor David Remnick. The New Yorker published Remnick’s profile on Jan. 27, 2014. In it, he wrote, ""In the 2012 campaign, Obama spoke not only of killing Osama bin Laden; he also said that Al Qaeda had been ‘decimated.’ I pointed out that the flag of Al Qaeda is now flying in Fallujah, in Iraq, and among various rebel factions in Syria; Al Qaeda has asserted a presence in parts of Africa, too."" Obama responded: ""The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant."" (For the nonsports fan, JV stands for junior varsity, and it usually means a high school or college's secondary team.) Remnick confirmed to PolitiFact that the interview took place on Jan. 7 and he was referencing a specific event that had happened just days before: the overtaking of the Iraq city of Fallujah on Jan. 3. At the time, Islamic State (often referred to as by its acronyms ISIS or ISIL) was not a household name. It was often referred to as an al-Qaeda-linked group in press reports. But reports from the time clearly indicate that the group was responsible for taking over the city. Al Jazeera America reported on Jan. 4: ""On Friday, ISIL gunmen sought to win over the population in Fallujah, one of the cities they swept into on Wednesday. A commander appeared among worshippers holding Friday prayers in the main city street, proclaiming that his fighters were there to defend Sunnis from the government, one resident said. "" ‘We are your brothers from the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant,’ gunmen circulating through the city in a stolen police car proclaimed through a loudspeaker. ‘We are here to protect you from the government. We call on you to cooperate with us.’ "" Officials within the Iraqi government told the ""Agence France-Presse that ISIL, the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, remained in control of parts of the two cities on Thursday,"" according to NBC. So when Remnick referenced an al Qaeda group taking over Fallujah, it’s clear whom he was talking about. On Aug. 25, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest claimed Obama’s comment was being taken out of context and that the ""president was not singling out"" Islamic State in that interview, but rather Islamic extremist groups in general. The Washington Post Fact-Checker compared that with the previously unreleased transcript and gave Earnest’s comment four Pinocchios, his worst rating. (For what it’s worth, Remnick told PolitiFact that the Post fact-check ""got it right."") A transcript of the conversation provided to the Post (and verified by Remnick) also confirms as much. Remnick:  ""You know where this is going, though. Even in the period that you’ve been on vacation in the last couple of weeks, in Iraq, in Syria, of course, in Africa, al-Qaeda is resurgent."" Obama:  ""Yes, but, David, I think the analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant. I think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian."" Remnick: ""But that JV team just took over Fallujah."" Obama:  ""I understand.  But when you say took over Fallujah –"" Remnick:  ""And I don’t know for how long."" Obama:  ""But let’s just keep in mind, Fallujah is a profoundly conservative Sunni city in a country that, independent of anything we do, is deeply divided along sectarian lines. And how we think about terrorism has to be defined and specific enough that it doesn’t lead us to think that any horrible actions that take place around the world that are motivated in part by an extremist Islamic ideology is a direct threat to us or something that we have to wade into."" This pretty much leaves no doubt. Obama may not have specifically said Islamic State, but it’s clear he was talking about them. Remnick was referencing events in Syria and Iraq, particularly the takeover of Fallujah, which was conducted by Islamic State, and Obama referred to the group responsible for that as ""a JV team."" Our ruling Obama said his JV comment ""wasn’t specifically referring to ISIL."" He was not specifically asked about Islamic State, but it’s pretty clear this is the group that was being referenced in the conversation. The transcript backs this up, as do news events from the time of the discussion. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2014/sep/07/barack-obama/what-obama-said-about-islamic-state-jv-team/

Chuck Todd said 8 of 9 states with toss-up Senate races are less than 10 percent Hispanic
","Chuck Todd kicked off his hosting duties on Meet the Press by landing an interview with President Barack Obama. But because he’s widely known as a politics junkie, the show also spent a lot of time discussing the 2014 Senate races. Over the weekend, the White House announced Obama wouldn’t be taking executive action on immigration reform before the midterms. Obama told Todd it wasn’t about the upcoming elections, but the Meet the Press pundits disagreed. ""Democrats are playing defense this year in the race for the Senate. They’re playing in red states where this issue is always going to red hot,"" said Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report, one of the show’s panelists. ""Taking executive action on anything Republicans could call amnesty would boost the Republican base."" Conversely, if you look at demographics, action on immigration may not play a significant role for boosting Democratic turnout in the Senate races, Todd pointed out. ""Look at this map, you have this great stat,"" Todd said. ""Eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races, Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate."" We thought Todd’s statement was interesting, so we decided to take a deep dive into the numbers. Competitive seats  Out of the Senate seats up for election this year, the Cook Political Report rates nine races as toss-ups, meaning either party has a chance of winning. The Cook Report also counts three more races as competitive but leaning toward one party. There is some deviation on the number of competitive races. On the high end, CNN considers 12 races competitive, dividing them into six seats ""up for grabs"" and six with ""tilts"" towards a party. On the low end, FiveThirtyEight, which doesn’t label the races competitive or otherwise, lists five seats in which leaders have less than a 60 percent chance of winning. Cook Political Report FiveThirtyEight CNN Alaska Toss-up Toss-up Toss-up Arkansas Toss-up Leaning Republican Toss-up Colorado Toss-up Toss-up Leaning Democrat Georgia Toss-up Leaning Republican Leaning Republican Iowa Toss-up Toss-up Toss-up Kansas Leaning Republican Toss-up Safe Republican Kentucky Toss-up Leaning Republican Toss-up Louisiana Toss-up Leaning Republican Toss-up Michigan Toss-up Leaning Democrat Leaning Democrat New Hampshire Leaning Democrat Leaning Democrat Leaning Democrat North Carolina Toss-up Toss-up Toss-up West Virginia Leaning Republican Safe Republican Leaning Republican   Nonetheless, while projections of tilts and toss-ups differ, nine seems to be a popular number of competitive states, the same number reported by the New York Times, Huffington Post, and the Rothenberg Political Report.    Hispanic voters Todd’s chart on Hispanic voter numbers listed the source as a New York Times article, which extrapolated figures from past Census Bureau surveys to project 2014 elections. For good measure, we’ll compare the Times’ estimates for the nine states to 2012 Census results for 12 states considered to be competitive.  Actual Hispanic voter turnout in 2012 and the projected number of likely Hispanic voters in 2014 are both lower than the share of eligible voters. By both sources, Todd is right to say that Hispanic voters comprise less than 10 percent of the total voters in states that are toss-ups.  Whether that’s out of the top five, top nine, or top 12 most competitive states, only one, Colorado, has a Hispanic voting population above 10 percent. Mindy Romero, director of the University of California-Davis Civic Engagement Project, agrees with the Times’ conclusion that the Hispanic voting population will only have a little impact in the competitive 2014 Senate races. But that’s not without caveats. ""Latinos will still impact congressional races, though they may not change the outcomes in these races,"" Romero said. In the short term, Latino voters may not alter the toss-up races significantly, but Romero said they’ll definitely matter in the long run. Take a look at California, a once red and then purple state that’s now solidly blue, in part thanks to Latino voters. ""(California senators) Boxer and Feinstein are very safe, and Latinos are a large part of the story of why those two seats are safe, Romero said. The ruling Todd said, ""Eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races, Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate."" Though there’s some deviation in the number of competitive states, nine seems like a pretty safe bet, and the number reported by a good portion of news sources. As for the share of Hispanic voting population, Todd is right on the money. We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/07/chuck-todd/chuck-todd-said-8-9-states-toss-senate-races-are-l/

Scott Walker cut school funding more than any governor, Greater Wisconsin Committee claims
","A TV ad released Aug. 28, 2014 by the Greater Wisconsin Committee, a group funded by labor unions and Democratic ideological groups, starts with three children looking into the camera and each asking: ""Why?"" Then an adult narrator says: ""Why did Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America? Where did the money go? To Scott Walker's friends. Walker gave his corporate friends half a billion dollars in tax breaks and giveaways."" We've already rated False an earlier Greater Wisconsin Committee claim, that Walker gave $570 million in job-development incentives to his ""cronies"" or ""corporate friends."" Much of that money went to firms whose employees have given to Democrats in the past, many of the donations were small and Walker’s jobs agency has a limited role in dealing with firms associated with a big chunk of the $570 million. But what about the claim of Walker cutting school funding, on a per-student basis, more than any other governor? What we know There's no dispute that shortly after taking office in January 2011, Walker made a dramatic reduction in school funding. In fact, in February 2012 we rated True a broader claim -- that Walker had enacted ""the biggest cuts to education in our state's history."" The $1.2 billion in reductions included $792 million in direct state aid to kindergarten-through-12th grade schools, which is the focus of the new Greater Wisconsin Committee ad. But that fact-check didn't calculate the K-12 school cuts on a per-student basis in comparison to other states. And Walker later restored some of the state aid to schools. The committee’s evidence Before we dig in, a few words about wording. The Greater Wisconsin Committee’s claim refers to funding of public schools. But, as we’ll see, the evidence the committee cites is overall spending by the schools -- in other words, what was spent in total from state, federal and local money. So, in addition to checking the overall spending figures the committee cited to us in support of its claim, we’ll examine state revenue figures -- the amount of money given to public schools strictly from the state. What the Greater Wisconsin Committee cited is a table from a solid source, the latest annual report from the U.S. Census Bureau comparing all 50 states (and the District of Columbia) on public school financing. Issued in May 2014, the report covers the Wisconsin state fiscal year of 2011-’12, which is the first full fiscal year during Walker’s term in office. (The state’s fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30; in other words, roughly the same as the traditional school year.) On a percentage basis, Wisconsin’s reduction in overall per-pupil spending -- of state, federal and local money -- was at the top of the chart when compared with the previous year. In terms of cuts, here are the top five:   State/District Per-pupil SPENDING in 2011-’12 from ALL sources Change from 2010-’11  Wisconsin $11,042 -6.2 percent Florida $8,372 -5.8 percent District of Columbia $17,468 -5.4 percent Texas $8,261 -4.7 percent South Dakota $8,446 -4.1 percent   In contrast, the census report shows that in the four years before Walker took office, Wisconsin’s per-student spending rose -- by 3.6 percent in 2010-’11, 2.6 percent in 2009-’10, 3.7 percent in 2008-’09 and 4 percent in 2007-’08.  In terms of blaming Walker for the cuts, the governor, along with the Republican-controlled Legislature, had direct control over state money, which amounted to 48 percent of the spending by Wisconsin schools in 2011-’12. Through the Act 10 collective bargaining reform law, Walker and the Legislature required employees to pay more toward their pension and enabled school districts to charge employees more for health insurance as a way to offset some of the state aid cuts. But as we noted in rating the biggest cuts in state history claim, the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s statement was not about net impact, just the state funding side of the equation. Walker and the Legislature also had significant influence over local funding, which amounted to 44 percent of the schools’ spending, because they essentially froze the amount of property tax revenue that local school districts could raise. Walker had no real control over federal funding, which amounted to 8 percent of total spending by Wisconsin schools. Other measures Now, using the same census report, let’s look at the revenue figures, focusing on how much state money went to Wisconsin schools. Once again, Wisconsin was at the top in terms of cuts.   State Per-pupil REVENUE in 2011-’12 from STATE GOVERNMENT Change from 2010-’11   Wisconsin  $5,544 -8.33 percent Idaho $4,630 -6.79 percent Arizona $3,018 -6.46 percent Wyoming $9,466 -5.05 percent Florida $3,273 -4.84 percent   So, the state revenue measure also supports the Greater Wisconsin Committee claim. But there some newer figures available. A May 2014 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C., examined state funding of schools in 2013-’14. Those figures show Wisconsin was among 15 states that reduced state per-student spending from the previous year. Wisconsin's 0.6 percent reduction (adjusted for inflation) wasn’t the largest cut, but rather the third-smallest. (Alaska’s 3.2 percent cut was the largest.) Wisconsin state funding was $5,747 per student in 2013-’14, versus $5,783 the previous year. As for comparing states on school funding for the entirety of Walker’s term, those figures simply aren’t available yet. Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Committee said: ""Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America."" Based on the latest census figures, for 2011-’12, the Wisconsin cuts were the largest based on two measures -- state revenue provided to local schools and overall spending by schools of state, federal and local money. But more recent figures indicate that Wisconsin’s school spending cuts are no longer the largest, at least for a more recent period. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/07/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/scott-walker-cut-school-funding-more-any-governor-/

Ted Cruz says ISIS crucifying Christians in Iraq, nailing them to trees
","We were unaware of a horrible turn against Christians in Iraq until U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz brought it up. The Texas Republican, a possible 2016 presidential candidate, recently told a reporter for WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, that the Islamic State group, in the news for numerous acts including killings of two U.S. journalists, is ""right now crucifying Christians in Iraq, literally nailing Christians to trees."" Crucifixions as in killing someone by nailing or tying his or her hands and feet to a cross or, as Cruz said, a tree? Cruz, news stories offer no evidence We emailed Cruz’s office about how he knew of the crucifixions and received no evidence in reply. Our own research did not uncover news stories confirming the crucifixion of a Christian in Iraq or elsewhere while U.S. advocates and experts on the bloody conflicts in Iraq and Syria expressed unfamiliarity with such actions. But Christians, along with people of other faiths, have been in the crossfire of the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. On Aug. 8, 2014,  a CNN news story said Iraq's largest Christian town had been overrun by ISIS, causing thousands of Christians in the city to flee, just as other minority groups targeted by ISIS had done, as well as Shiite Muslims, the story said. CNN said the French government confirmed the Iraqi city of Qaraqosh had fallen into the hands of ISIS. The story said ISIS earlier took over Mosul, another city in Iraq, prompting many residents to flee to Qaraqosh. In Mosul, CNN said, ISIS issued an ultimatum to Christians living there: Convert to Islam, pay a fine or face ""death by the sword."" CNN’s story noted the Pope saying on Twitter Aug. 8, 2014: ""I ask all men and women of goodwill to join me in praying for Iraqi Christians and all vulnerable populations.""    
A few weeks later, CNN described young boys being trained by ISIS at a camp in Syria and, according to a participant identified only as Mohammed, witnessing a crucifixion. According to the Aug. 29, 2014, news story, some boys were forced to watch hideous things. ""They used to bring young (kids) to the camp to lash them,"" Mohammed said. ""When we go to the mosque, they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to [watch] heads cut off, lashings or stonings."" ""We saw a young man who did not fast for Ramadan, so they crucified him for three days, and we saw a woman being stoned (to death) because she committed adultery,"" Mohammed said. Experts: Crucifixions possible, not observed yet Close observers of the turmoil in Iraq and Syria said they could imagine ISIS doing crucifixions. No one expressed awareness of Christians already being crucified. By email, Daniel Sullivan of a Washington, D.C.-based group, United to End Genocide, noted the CNN story before telling us he hadn’t seen ""confirmed reports in either Iraq or Syria"" of Christians being crucified. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said Cruz’s claim went overboard, as far as he knew, though he said ISIS has been ruthless about hurting or killing resistant residents. ""There have been people put on crosses,"" Landis said. ""But it’s not Christians."" Landis guided us to an April 29, 2014, Fox News story accompanied by photographs of men slung on crosses in Raqqa, a town in northern Syria. The story cited a Syrian opposition group,  Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, saying ISIS jihadists were hanging the bodies of executed enemies on crosses crucifixion-style in the town. The story, citing ""multiple reports,"" said ISIS had ruled over Raqqa for the previous year, killing its remaining rebel population and demolishing national relics. The news story said Ibrahim Alrquaoui of the opposition group said the killed men were rebels that had previously fought against the Syrian government of Bashir al-Assad. The story said that according to Alrquaoui, the ISIS charged the seven men with espionage and attempted assassination of the group’s leaders. According to the story, Alrquaoui said he witnessed the executions himself and took photographs, which were then posted on the group’s Facebook page and circulated on the Internet. The photographs showed different men bound to crosses in what appeared to be a public square area, though the Fox News story said it could not be independently confirmed the subjects were dead or, if they were, by what means the executions had been carried out. ""The pictures do not show any apparent signs of the men nailed to a cross, nor are there any obvious, visible signs of fatal wounds,"" the story said. Landis also pointed out a Feb. 26, 2014, online post by Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, an Oxford University student, describing a traditional practice in Islam for a Jew or Christian living under the authority of an Islamic state agreeing to pay a jizya, or poll tax, in return for protection from the state. The Feb. 26, 2014, post, on Landis’ website devoted to Syrian politics, history and religion, said the tax is equivalent to Mafia racketeering; a failure to pay leads to the loss of protection. ISIS similarly imposes the tax, the post said, in northern Iraq and Syria. By telephone, Jeffrey White, a defense fellow at The Washington Institute specializing in the military and security affairs of the Levant and Iran, told us he monitors videos from Iraq and Syria and is familiar with the ISIS practice in Syria of hanging a body from a post after a killing. (That’s not a crucifixion as that act is commonly defined.) But, White said, he hasn’t seen videos of anyone nailed to a tree -- in Iraq or elsewhere. Cruz’s claim ""doesn’t accord with what I’ve seen,"" White said. Our ruling Cruz said ISIS is ""right now crucifying Christians in Iraq, literally nailing Christians to trees."" Earlier this year, ISIS strung up the bodies of individuals already executed on cross-like posts in a Syrian town. We did not confirm ISIS crucifixions of Christians in Iraq nor did Cruz give factual backup. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Jeanne Shaheen says 'Big Oil' gave Scott Brown $454,260
","Former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown -- now running to return to the Senate -- hasn’t officially made it through the Republican primary yet, but he’s long been considered the frontrunner to take on incumbent U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., in November’s general election. Brown has been the subject of numerous attack ads by outside groups, including a recent ad by the Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic-aligned group, that claimed that he voted to give oil companies huge tax breaks and, in exchange, took more than $400,000 in campaign contributions. PolitFact New Hampshire rated the claim in that ad Half True.    Now, Brown finds himself the target of a similar ad, this time directly from the Shaheen campaign. ""The big oil companies are the most profitable on the planet,"" a narrator says at the beginning of the 30-second ad titled ""Profitable."" ""Scott Brown voted to give them more than $20 billion in taxpayer subsidies. Big Oil gave Scott Brown thousands of dollars within days of his votes."" Meanwhile, a visual in the ad puts a number on those ""thousands of dollars"" that Brown received: ""Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260,"" the ad declares. This seemed like something PolitiFact should sort out. Since we’ve already fact-checked Brown’s ""big oil"" votes, we’ll focus here on the breakdown of contributions to his campaign and the specific number cited in Shaheen’s ad. The Shaheen campaign pointed us to OpenSecrets.org, an independent website run by the Center for Responsive Politics that tracks money in politics. The site tracks donations of at least $200 in congressional and other elections. At the time Shaheen’s ad first aired, OpenSecrets’ website showed $454,260 in campaign contributions from oil- and gas-industry donors for Brown over the course of his career. That was precisely the number cited by Shaheen. By now, that’s actually a little out of date; updated figures show Brown has received $488,010 from donors associated with the oil and gas industry. The total makes the oil and gas industry the 14th most popular sector giving  to Brown. The biggest sectors Brown receives money from are retired individuals, securities and investment, lawyers and law firms, and real estate, each of which account for at least $1 million. But these numbers don’t tell the whole story. Calling Brown’s donors ""Big Oil"" isn’t entirely accurate, since many such donors are not huge corporations or high-powered CEOs. OpenSecrets defines oil and gas companies as ""multinational and independent oil and gas producers and refiners, natural gas pipeline companies, gasoline service stations and fuel oil dealers."" So while this category includes what would widely be understood as ""big oil,"" it also includes smaller, independent companies, as well as low-level individuals who happen to work for an oil company. In fact, a breakdown of the contributions made to Brown from the oil and gas industry shows that only $52,550 of the total came from ""major multinational oil and gas producers."" That’s just 11.5 percent. One other quibble: The ad makes it sound like the companies themselves are donating, but that’s true only for a minority of the dollars donated. Overall, $168,000 came from political action committees, which pool employee dollars and make donations in the employer’s name. The other $287,760 came from individuals associated with oil and gas companies. The reasons for an individual’s donation may have everything or nothing to do with the industry’s policy agenda. Our ruling Shaheen’s ad said that ""Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260."" Independently collected data shows that while Brown received roughly that much from donors categorized under the ""oil and gas industry,"" only about 11.5 percent of that haul came from companies and individuals affiliated with the biggest multinational companies -- what most viewers would consider ""Big Oil."" The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. So we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/05/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-big-oil-gave-scott-brown-45426/

Mike Collier says opponent Glenn Hegar ""is proud of"" legislated cuts in public school funding
","Houston businessman Mike Collier, the Democratic nominee for state comptroller, launched a video ad in August 2014 suggesting the Republican candidate, state Sen. Glenn Hegar of Katy, took pride in big cuts to public education. In Collier’s ad, the narrator says Hegar ""voted to cut more than $5 billion from Texas schools, money for teachers, computers,  even books -- all cut."" This was a reference to actions taken by the Republican-majority 2011 Legislature in the face of a multi-billion-dollar projected revenue shortfall. ""And Hegar is proud of it,"" Collier’s narrator says. Next, the ad shows Hegar saying: ""Some people are saying, 'Oh, we’ve put more money into education.’ No we didn’t. There’s no way you can spin that. No we didn’t. But I was not ashamed to say we didn’t. I was proud that we did not."" We waded into this after noticing a news account with a dash of doubt about why Hegar was proud. It wouldn’t necessarily shock if Hegar took pride. In June 2011, he issued a press release expressing pride in lawmakers balancing the 2012-13 budget in the face of a projected $27 billion revenue shortfall without tapping the rainy day fund or raising taxes; his release called the result ""amazing"" and ""remarkable."" And while Hegar made no direct reference to the school cuts, he hailed ""a fiscally sound and responsible budget that funds essential services and forces state government to live within its means, just as Texas families must do."" By email, Collier spokeswoman Chaille Jolink said Collier based his claim on Hegar’s comments some 38 minutes into his videotaped 2013 meeting with the Montgomery County Tea Party, which was posted on YouTube Dec. 31, 2013. Roll tape! In a question-and-answer period with group members, Hegar said he favors delivering education smarter and cheaper, perhaps online. The comptroller plays a role managing dollars, he said. ""You’re really the watchdog for the taxpayers,"" he said. Our transcribed excerpt picks up with a member’s follow-up comment. Montgomery County Tea Party: ""I think our whole education system needs to come under an audit because there’s somebody getting a lot of money and it’s not teachers. And education isn’t getting any better."" Hegar (nodding): ""Whenever -- I mentioned this to somebody the other day -- I said that whenever we did the cut; you mentioned earlier (gesturing away from the questioner) the cuts to education, and some people went out and said -- (gesturing in another direction) it was almost like your question earlier, was the budget balanced or was it not balanced? -- some people were saying oh, we’ve put more money into education. ""No we didn’t (shaking head back and forth). There’s no way you can spin that. No, we didn’t. But I was not ashamed to say we didn’t. I was proud that we did not. ""I had a lot of"" school district ""superintendents come up to me and tell me, you know what, thanks, because I’ve been needing to cut something over here and I’ve never been able to and you gave me the excuse. Now one, I’m about to jump on you because you just told me you wanted to and you should have, but you didn’t?… It really opened my eyes when somebody would say that we really needed to cut this stuff but I didn’t have a good excuse and you just gave it to me."" MCTP: ""So you were a scapegoat."" Hegar: ""That’s fine. I was happy to be the scapegoat; it didn’t bother me."" We let Hegar’s campaign know we were checking on his declaration of pride. Spokesman David White emailed us a statement saying: ""As a father of three children in public schools, Sen. Hegar believes in adequately funding our education system."" White also urged us to read an Aug. 8, 2014 news blog post by the Dallas Morning News presenting a slightly different recap of Hegar's comments to the tea-party group. White then said Collier presented Hegar’s remarks ""out of context."" According to the tea-party video, the News’ story said, Hegar ""recounts what apparently are constituent comments about last year’s restoration of nearly $4 billion of the earlier cuts. That’s when he says he was proud not to have ‘put more money in education. … There’s no way you could spend that.’"" In our views of the video, we didn’t hear the senator referring to money restored. Also, we heard Hegar’s latter remark as: ""There’s no way you can spin that."" Our ruling Collier said Hegar was proud to cut public school funding. In 2013, Hegar said he was unashamed and proud to stand behind the cuts that Republicans passed into law.

Obama says he has cut national deficit in half
","In 2012, PolitiFact twice rated True claims that President Barack Obama failed to keep a promise to cut federal deficits in half by the end of his first term. At that point, the budget gap topped a trillion bucks and Republican congressmen called out Obama because the deficit had been reduced by just 15 percent. But there was the president at Laborfest 2014 in Milwaukee proclaiming ""we cut our deficits by more than half.""

It compares the yearly deficits under Obama, expressed -- as they often are -- as a share of the nation’s entire economy, which is measured by the Gross Domestic Product. At the start of Obama’s term, the chart showed, the figure was 9.2 percent. The latest figure was 4.1 percent. That appears to back Obama's statement. But let's examine this in detail. To do that, we reviewed figures published by the Congressional Budget Office as well as the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. We also consulted with independent fiscal experts. The baseline year for comparison is fiscal year 2009, which ended Sept. 30 of that year. This was the last budget from President George W. Bush, as Obama took office in January of that year. The most recent complete fiscal year is 2013. Those are the same years Obama's chart showed. Our analysis showed the drop easily topped 50 percent, and was actually somewhat higher than Obama's chart would indicate. As a share of the economy, we found -- and our experts confirmed -- the drop was from 9.8 percent in 2009 to 4.1 percent in 2013. Obama’s chart actually reflects a lower deficit figure for 2009, and therefore a lower share of GDP, 9.2%. That’s because instead of using the actual 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion, Obama lowers it by the $200 billion in increased deficit spending that he -- not Bush -- pushed through in the stimulus plan to address the crisis that became the Great Recession. That resulting figure is what Obama calls the deficit he ""inherited"" from Bush. But no matter which figure is used, the deficit as a share of the economy still fell by more than half. Show me the money There's another way to look at this. That is, in raw dollars -- the way attendees at the union event probably would. Indeed, deficits are often expressed that way as well. The White House and CBO figures each show that in 2009 the deficit reached $1.4 trillion. As a share of GDP, it easily topped any year since World War II, said Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. By the end of fiscal year 2013, the deficit figure had fallen to $679.5 billion in dollars unadjusted for inflation. That’s a 52 percent drop. Here’s the year-by-year trend in 2009 dollars: Fiscal year Deficit Deficit as share of GDP 2009 1,412,688,000,000 9.8 percent 2010 1,294,373,000,000 8.8 percent 2011 1,299,593,000,000 8.4 percent 2012 1,086,963,000,000 6.8 percent 2013 679,502,000,000 4.1 percent There is one wrinkle. When you use Obama's methodology to compare the deficit Obama inherited -- the 2009 result minus the stimulus package to that in 2013 --  the drop in the deficit is slightly under half, at 48%. Ellis and Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, both included an additional year, the 2014 fiscal year, which is just a month from completion. The Aug. 27, 2014 CBO estimate for this year’s budget, fiscal year 2014, is a continued shrinking of the deficit to $506 billion, or 2.9 percent of GDP. Those figures would put Obama's claim over the top no matter the number-crunching method. Looking ahead Ellis cautioned that talking about deficit amounts in raw dollars doesn’t really give a good sense of the scale: ""A $400 billion deficit in a $10 trillion economy is a lot bigger than a $400 billion deficit in $17 trillion economy."" And he and Goldwein emphasized that while the deficit has been halved, it’s been halved from a skyscraping peak. In the decade before deficits exploded in 2008 and 2009, they averaged just over 1 percent of GDP, including three years of surpluses, we calculated. As of 2013, that figure was at 4.1 percent. The growth in the deficit from 2007 to 2009 was due mainly to factors related to the Great Recession, said Goldwein. Tax collections fell as people lost jobs and corporate profits dropped; spending on food stamps and other aid programs rose with increased need; stimulus and tax break legislation passed, as did bailouts of financial firms. ""The economic recovery, wind-down of stimulus, reversal of TARP/Fannie transactions, and lower interest rates are really what has caused our deficit to fall so much,"" Goldwein told us. He mentioned cuts in discretionary spending as well. Looking ahead, the CBO warns that later in the next decade deficits as a share of the economy will grow and federal debt will climb without changes in current policies. But Obama, it’s fair to say, was speaking of the change during his presidency. And his claim dovetails with one PolitiFact National checked in July 2013, rating True Obama’s claim that the deficit is falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. Our rating At a union rally on Labor Day, Obama declared ""We cut our deficits by more than half."" The numbers back up Obama’s claim:  Thanks to income tax revenues rising and spending on emergency assistance dropping, America’s deficit has fallen by more than 50 percent from its highest point since World War II to a level $733 billion lower.

Claim about Perdue's former firm hits mark
","Two political newcomers running in a closely watch battle to represent Georgia in the U.S. Senate  share the title CEO. Democrat Michelle Nunn characterizes herself as a problem solver and consensus builder from her leadership at Points of Light, a nonprofit volunteer group. Republican David Perdue highlights his tenure as an executive with Fortune 500 firms as the experience needed to tackle free-market problems in Washington. In her first round of ads, Nunn aims to sharpen that distinction by criticizing her opponent’s experience. ""In Georgia, Perdue’s company closed plants and moved jobs to China,"" the ad says. Given the winner of the Senate race will help decide which party will control the Congressional chamber, PolitiFact Georgia decided to drill down on the claim. To do so, we have to jump back to a time of dial-up Internet and grunge music at the top of the charts. It was 1992 when Perdue was named a senior vice president for Sara Lee. He told PolitiFact that he was sent to Hong Kong for two years to increase manufacturing and contracts in Asia for the firm. ""I was sent to Asia to open those markets for Sara Lee, and we did,"" Perdue said. ""That was the direction of the company at the time."" Perdue’s effort to open the region for Sara Lee was a success, as was the firm for part of that time. Sara Lee was founded in 1939 as a food processing and distribution company. Its iconic name came from the 1956 purchase of the Kitchens of Sara Lee, a Chicago bakery known for its cheesecake. By the early 1990s, though, Sara Lee had expanded worldwide and into other industries with its purchase of Hanes Corporation and Coach leather goods, among others. For the first three years of the decade, the company rapidly splurged even more, focusing on foreign firms and other well-known brands such as undergarment maker Playtex, Investors began to question the company’s broad vision, though. The result was the first of several major restructuring plans and layoffs in 1994, Perdue’s last year with Sara Lee. The 1994 overhaul eliminated 9,900 jobs worldwide, while ""realigning production and distribution facilities throughout the world,"" according to SEC filings. Among the casualties were 540 jobs at apparel plants in Cartersville, Milledgeville and Wrightsville. A fourth Georgia plant, in Midway, was also shut down, though the number of jobs lost was not published. Sara Lee’s annual report from 1994 does not break down how many of its 144,900 employees were domestic or foreign. However, a statement from the company at the time said most of the eliminated jobs were at European operations. The annual report does note the company’s success in manufacturing and sales in Asia, especially in China, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong, now part of China. ""David Perdue says he's the better candidate because he's spent his career in the 'real world,' but at too many stops along the way, he seemed to prosper while the people who worked for him saw their livelihoods taken away,"" said Nunn spokesman Nathan Click. By all indications, the outsourcing effort at Sara Lee did have that effect. The company expanded what it made and sold in Asia, at a time when it was closing facilities elsewhere, including in Georgia. As a senior vice president, Perdue had limited input on that direction. But he did execute Sara Lee’s effort, which the company lauded in its own annual report to federal regulators. Nunn’s claim is carefully worded to say Perdue’s company, not the candidate himself, was shutting Georgia plants at a time it was adding jobs in Asia.

Did Mark Pryor vote 'to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants'?
","The National Republican Senatorial Committee -- the GOP’s Senate campaign arm -- is attacking Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., for becoming a creature of Washington after 12 years in the Capitol. But the ad now airing relies on an eight-year-old charge that we and other fact checkers have debunked multiple times over the years. Pryor is one of the Senate’s endangered Democratic incumbents and a top target for Republicans. Here’s the narration of the NRSC’s ad: Narrator: ""When Mark Pryor went to Washington 12 years ago, he promised to put Arkansas first."" Video of Pryor speaking: ""As your senator, I’ll always put Arkansas first.""  Narrator: ""But something happened. Mark Pryor changed. Voting to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants. Voting to give members of Congress special benefits to purchase Obamacare. Twelve years ago, Mark Pryor promised to change Washington. Instead, Washington changed him."" We have already fact-checked several claims about lawmakers voting to give themselves special benefits to purchase Obamacare. Almost a year ago, we checked a claim by Pryor’s Republican opponent, Rep. Tom Cotton, that Pryor had voted for ""special subsidies"" for lawmakers and staff in Congress ""so they’re protected from Obamacare."" We rated that claim False. So here, we will look at the ad’s other main assertion, that Pryor voted ""to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants."" There are two problems with this claim. The claim is worded much more broadly than what was actually voted on. The ad makes it sound like Pryor was voting to create a vast new entitlement for illegal immigrants by allowing them to qualify for Social Security. In reality, the 2006 vote concerned a much narrower issue -- the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by former illegal immigrants who would have become legal under an immigration overhaul bill (a bill that never made it into law). At the time, illegal immigrants had a right to receive credit in their benefits calculation for Social Security payments they had made while working illegally, typically while using an unauthorized Social Security number. They received such credit only after they had received legal working papers and a genuine Social Security number. During a Senate debate over the broader immigration bill in 2006, then-Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., offered an amendment to prevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security number -- a provision that would have mostly (if not entirely) affected illegal aliens. This is what was cited in the ad. On May 18, 2006, the Senate voted on a motion to table (that is, to stop consideration of) the Ensign amendment. By a bare one-vote majority, the chamber voted to table the amendment. Pryor’s was one of the 50 votes in favor of tabling. So while the ad is correct that Pryor cast that vote on that date, the way the ad described it -- that Pryor had voted ""to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants"" -- is substantially misleading. The ad ignores two cases in which Pryor supported a similar amendment. It’s important to note that the May 2006 vote on Ensign’s amendment is not the end of the story. Ensign continued to push the issue, offering a substantially similar amendment on at least two other occasions. The first time, on July 19, 2007, Ensign proposed a similar amendment to the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. Under the rules, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass but only got 57, so it failed. However, Pryor voted for the amendment. The second time, on Oct. 23, 2007, Ensign offered a similar amendment during another immigration bill debate. This time, the Senate passed it by an overwhelming 92-2 vote. And once again, Pryor voted for the amendment. So the ad cherry-picks the one time Pryor voted against the measure and ignores two times he voted for it. That, too, is substantially misleading. Our ruling The NRSC’s ad claims that Pryor voted ""to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants."" That’s wrong for two reasons. First, the provision was much more narrowly targeted than the ad suggests -- it addressed the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by legal Social Security beneficiaries who at one time had been illegal immigrants. Second, the ad cherry-picks one vote Pryor cast against this provision while ignoring two separate votes he cast for the provision.

Facebook meme claims McDonald's burgers are made with 85 percent 'meat filler,' which causes cancer
","An unsavory Facebook meme is reigniting alarm about the content of Big Macs. According to the meme, the patties at McDonald’s are skimpy on real beef and heavy on ""meat filler,"" which the meme links to cancer. Meat filler is also called ""pink slime"" -- a nickname the beef industry insiders consider pejorative -- and made waves with consumers several years ago after a 2011 episode of Jamie Oliver’s Food Revolution and an 11-part ABC News investigation. McDonald’s said back then that it pulled the product from its grills. But a meme circulating this summer suggests otherwise. The claim has been around in some form since 2002. One of the most recent versions, sourced from an anonymous blogpost on Raw For Beauty, says ""McDonald’s hamburgers are only 15 percent ‘real beef,’ the other 85 percent is meat filler cleansed with ammonia, which causes stomach and intestinal cancer."" We wanted to know more about this ""meat filler,"" what place, if any, it has in McDonald’s burgers, and if it is linked to cancer. Big Mac smack First, McDonald’s says it no longer uses the ""meat filler"" in question. This claim has been debunked numerous times since 2011, and it has also been addressed multiple times by McDonald’s. In an FAQ about its meats, the fast food giant acknowledged that it once used ""pink slime"" -- or the industry preferred term, ""lean, finely textured beef"" -- in its products but has since stopped the practice: ""McDonald’s USA had begun the process of removing it from our supply chain prior to widespread media coverage on its use and it was completely removed from our supply in 2011. While select lean beef trimmings are safe, we decided to stop using the product to align our global standards for beef around the world."" As for what exactly is in the patties, McDonald’s writes, ""Our burgers in the US are made using only 100 percent USDA-inspected beef. There are no preservatives, no fillers, no extenders and no so-called ‘pink slime’ in our beef. The only thing added to our burgers is a bit of salt and pepper during grilling."" The ""pink slime"" rumor oozed its way to Down Under, too, forcing McDonald’s Australia to release a video and tell a concerned customer, ""Rest assured, Dana, it’s not true. Our beef patties are all 100 percent export quality Aussie beef, free of preservatives, additives, fillers and binders."" Despite rising costs of beef, McDonald’s has no plans to reintroduce lean, finely textured beef (the preferred industry term term for what critics call ""pink slime""), said McDonald’s spokeswoman Lisa McComb. Primer on ""meat filler"" But what exactly is lean, finely textured beef, and is it considered ""real beef""? When Beef Products Inc., began making the product in 1991, the industry cheered it as revolutionary. Essentially, the goal is to get every piece of meat off of the bone, and then sanitize it so it is safe to eat. Here’s how the process works: About 25 percent of the carcass remains after taking whole muscle cuts (sirloins, briskets, ribs, etc). The remaining fat trimmings with bits of meat still attached are then put through a heat and centrifuge process, which separates the fat and produces 93 to 97 percent lean meat, according to BPI. Because the trimmings often are more susceptible to contamination, the meat is then treated with ammonium hydroxide gas to kill pathogens, like salmonella and E. coli. The U.S. Department of Agriculture does not require ammonium hydroxide to be included in the ingredients, considering it part of the process rather than part of the meat. The resulting meat has a finer texture. ""That’s why you wouldn’t have a hamburger that would be made from nothing but LFTB – the texture would be softer,"" said Eric Mittenthal, a spokesperson for the American Meat Institute, a national trade association. The lean beef typically comprises no more than 15 percent of a burger, which consumers actually prefer over 100 percent coarse muscle meat, according to Edward Mills, a professor of meat science at Pennsylvania State University. At 25 percent, most people will notice an obvious difference in taste. So a burger with 85 percent of the lean product -- the amount pinpointed in the meme -- is not realistic. Several meat science professors we interviewed consider this product to be ""real beef,"" even if consumers don’t. That perspective aligns with the U.S. Department of Agriculture definition of meat, which is meat ""derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery which is comparable in appearance, texture and composition to meat trimmings and similar meat products derived by hand."" Under this definition, lean, finely textured beef -- the official term for ""pink slime"" -- is real beef, and a hamburger containing it could still be labeled 100 percent beef. The USDA does not require disclaimers of lean, finely textured beef in meat labels, but some companies, such as food giant Cargill, have opted to sticker their products if it includes this product. A cancer link? Now let’s look at the potential health effects of eating this kind of beef. Could it really lead to stomach and intestinal cancer? PolitiFact Georgia looked into a claim that ""pink slime"" is safe and rated it Mostly True.  A 2009 New York Times piece detailed how the much-lauded sanitation process behind lean, finely textured beef was not as effective in killing pathogens as BPI said --  even as the meat spread to school cafeterias through the federal school lunch program. Between 2004 and late 2009, the product tested positive for salmonella 36 times out of 1,000, a rate four times greater than other suppliers, the Times reported. The story also quoted a USDA scientist referring to the product as ""pink slime."" Gerald Zirnstein wrote to USDA colleagues in 2002, ""I do not consider the stuff to be ground beef, and I consider allowing it in ground beef to be a form of fraudulent labeling."" The story raised a lot of eyebrows, spurring petitions and additional coverage from Oliver’s food show and others. McDonald’s joined Taco Bell and Burger King in no longer using meat treated with ammonium hydroxide in 2012, the Daily Mail reported.  But meat experts said BPI’s product is just as safe -- or unsafe -- as all other beef products. The poultry industry has used meat from fat trimmings for 40 years, said Ted LaBuza, a professor of food science at the University of Minnesota. And ammonium hydroxide is used in many food products, such as puddings and cheese, and at levels 10 times higher than in meat, said Mittenthal and Mills. We could not find any studies to suggest that ammoniated beef can lead to stomach cancer or other intestinal disease. Even if you eat a burger with lean, finely textured beef every day, ""you wouldn’t even come close"" to posing a serious hazard to your health --  at least, not because of the ammonium hydroxide, said Mills. And it’s fairly common to use ammonia and other chemicals -- such as citric acid, which can leave a sour flavor -- to treat meat, LaBuza said. Chances of becoming sick are actually lower with beef from McDonald’s compared to a local butcher, who is beholden to less stringent standards than fast food restaurants, he said. Our ruling An Internet meme accuses McDonald’s of using hamburger meat that contains only 15 percent ""real beef,"" with the rest made up of a ""meat filler cleansed with ammonia, which causes stomach and intestinal cancer."" McDonald’s stopped using the ""filler"" in question -- lean, finely textured beef or its somewhat misleading nickname ""pink slime"" -- back in 2011. When the product was on the grills, the burger most likely contained nowhere near 85 percent of meat filler, as experts said most consumers would notice a difference in taste after 25 percent.  What’s more, the lean beef does not have any documented links to cancer.",/factchecks/2014/sep/03/facebook-posts/blogger-claims-mcdonalds-burgers-are-made-85-perce/

Can you make $45,000 per year at McDonald's in Denmark?
","As President Barack Obama spent the Labor Day weekend stumping for a hike in the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, a Facebook message was making the rounds that made that goal look like chump change. A liberal group called The Other 98% posted an image that showed two people in McDonald’s uniforms looking utterly astonished. (The image is a screenshot from a Saturday Night Live skit.)  In headline type were the words, ""McDonald’s workers in Denmark have a union. Earn $45,000/year."" The text in the post itself was a bit more detailed. It said, ""McDonald's employees in Denmark have a union, are paid $21/hour ($45,000/year), and enjoy 5 weeks paid vacation."" The post included a link to an opinion piece for Reuters from a Danish McDonald’s worker, Louise Marie Rantzau. ""I work for McDonald’s and I make $21 an hour,"" Rantzau wrote. ""An agreement between our union and the company guarantees that workers older than 18 are paid at least $21 an hour. Employees younger than 18 make at least $15."" We wanted to check whether Danish McDonald’s workers are unionized and really make $45,000 a year. We found the union contract so that part is simple. As for the $45,000 a year, there are issues but if the number isn’t spot on, it’s pretty close. A 2012 annual report from McDonald’s Denmark gives some overall figures. (We used Google Translate to understand the key sections.) Nearly 4,000 Danes work under the Golden Arches, almost all, about 3,500, are hourly employees, and very few are full-time. In its report, the company bundled those part-time hours and converted them into full-time equivalents. In 2011, it paid wages of 530 million Danish kroner to what would be equal to 2,040 full-time workers. That’s different from talking about what the typical worker actually got. Still, when you do the math, the company paid the mathematically average full-time worker about $46,700 that year. Statistics Denmark is the government agency that tracks labor information. For the category of food service counter attendants, the annual pay in 2012 was over $41,000. That is for all companies, not just McDonald’s. On an hourly basis, that translates to about $20 an hour. This lines up with a survey run by two economists, Orley Ashenfelter at Princeton University and Stepan Jurajda at CERGE-EI, an economic research center in Prague. Since 1998, they have tracked hourly wages of McDonald’s workers worldwide. (They use the price of a Big Mac as a way to compare worker pay to the cost of living, as in, how many Big Macs does a person get paid an hour.) Jurajda told PunditFact that their most recent survey found Danish McDonald’s workers make about $20 an hour. The catch here is that those hourly wages only deliver an annual income of $41,000 or more if a person works full-time, and we know that most people are part-timers. We asked the McDonald’s corporation, both in Denmark and America, for the median yearly earnings. A company spokesman sent us the statement, ""Our hourly rates of pay depend on the role the employee is doing and their age""  Lars Esbjerg, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark, studies low-wage jobs in his country. Esbjerg said the median earnings are not publicly available, but he sent us a copy of the latest McDonald’s union contract. The lowest hourly rate is 115 DKK, or $20.70. Anyone who works after 6 p.m. or on Sundays is paid more. ""Given that many will work odd hours, the full-time equivalent wage of $45,000 sounds about right to me,"" Esbjerg said. Trimming the pay advantage Typically, when the pay scale at McDonald’s in Europe comes up, the most common rebuttal is that people there pay higher taxes. That’s accurate, but while wages are more than double what they are in the United States, taxes are not. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American fast food worker makes about $9 an hour. Compare that to the $20.70 paid in Denmark. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average tax burden in Denmark is 38.2 percent, while in America, it is 31.3 percent. So taxes are about a fifth higher. Most people, if given the choice, would accept a 20 percent hike in taxes in exchange for making twice as much. That still doesn’t quite make it an apples-to-apples comparison because the cost of living is higher in Denmark. Both Jurajda and Esbjerg said that this also cuts into the wage advantage that Danish McDonald’s workers enjoy over their American counterparts. But at the end of the day, according to Princeton economist Orley Ashenfelter, they still come out ahead. ""I'm sure that the Danish McWorkers are pretty happy,"" Ashenfelter said. Ashenfelter added that as a fraction of the workforce, Denmark has far fewer McDonald’s employees than does the United States. He also said that for many decades, the Danes have used wages as part of a conscious policy to reduce inequality. Our ruling The group The Other 98% said that Danish McDonald’s workers have a union and make $45,000 a year. The union membership is totally accurate. The matter of pay is true for some workers, but certainly the majority work too few hours to make that much. Still, the average numbers provided by McDonald’s Denmark, government statistics, and data analyzed by economists who have studied the earnings of Danish McDonald’s workers, generally support that figure. The post did not specifically say that all McDonald’s workers made $45,000 a year, and the broader point, that it is much better to flip burgers in Copenhagen than in Cleveland, holds up. We rate the claim Mostly True. Update: The McDonald's Corporation sent a statement after this check was published",/factchecks/2014/sep/03/other-98/can-you-make-45000year-mcdonalds-denmark/

Sen. Begich wrongly ties Republican opponent to horrific crime in inflammatory ad
","Sen. Mark Begich, the incumbent Democrat from Alaska, has been forced to pull a television ad that said his Republican opponent’s actions as the state attorney general led to a gruesome murder -- a serious charge based on paper-thin evidence. Begich released an attack ad the Friday before Labor Day that said Dan Sullivan was soft on sex crime during his 18-month tenure as attorney general. Begich and Sullivan are locked in a toss-up race, one of several that could decide which party controls the Senate come November. ""(Sullivan) let a lot of sex offenders get off with light sentences,"" says the ad’s narrator, identified as a retired police officer, standing outside of an Anchorage apartment complex. ""One of them got out of prison and is now charged with breaking into that apartment building, murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter. Dan Sullivan should not be a U.S. senator."" The ad is talking about a crime allegedly committed by a man named Jerry Andrew Active on May 25, 2013 -- just hours after Active was released from prison. Active should have spent several more years behind bars for a prior sexual assault conviction, according to an Alaska Department of Law investigation, but a clerical error led to a shorter sentence. Active is currently awaiting trial on the May 2013 charges. The ad did not mention Active by name, but it gave a detailed description of the crime -- which received significant coverage in the Alaska media last year -- in front of the building where it occurred. The Sullivan campaign retaliated almost immediately with its own ad (in which they identify Active), defending his record and calling Begich’s ad ""shameful."" Both campaigns have pulled the videos down at the request of the victims’ family, who claimed the ad was insensitive and could affect upcoming prosecution. (PolitiFact obtained a copy of the ad in order to fact-check it; a TV report in Alaska shows a clip of it.) Even though the ads are no longer on the Alaska airwaves, the skirmish points to serious criminal justice issues. So we decided to dig in and see if Sullivan bears any responsibility for Active’s alleged crime. We found that the timing just doesn’t line up. Doing time Begich’s campaign declined to talk with us about the ad -- citing the pending trial -- so we asked the Alaska Democratic Party for evidence tying Sullivan to events leading to Active’s sentencing and the May 2013 crime. The party pointed out that Sullivan was attorney general in March 2010, when prosecutors negotiated a plea agreement with Active, who at the time was charged with sexual abuse of a minor, among other charges. (Sullivan’s name is stamped on the plea agreement, though it bears the signature of an assistant district attorney.) The Alaska Department of Law later found that Active’s 2010 plea agreement was based on incorrect information and should have come with a longer sentence. If Active had received the longer sentence, he likely would have still been in jail on the day he committed the murders. But Sullivan is not personally responsible for this plea agreement mistake. Let’s take a look at the course of events, according to the Department of Law. Keep in mind that Sullivan was attorney general from June 2009 to December 2010. In January 2009, state troopers arrested Active for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl and then physically assaulting the girl’s mother and brother. In March 2010, Active pled guilty to those charges, accepting a deal with prosecutors that sentenced him to about four years of jail time (including the time he had served up to that point, since his arrest in January 2009). Active was released in 2012. From then on, he was in and out of prison on probation violation charges until May 25, 2013, when he committed the murder referenced in Begich’s ad. When drawing up Active’s plea agreement in 2010, the state looked at his criminal history. As is customary, they received this information from the Alaska Public Safety Information Network. However, Active’s report failed to identify a 2007 felony conviction for providing a minor with alcohol. (That’s typically a misdemeanor, but Active’s charge was treated as a felony due to some nuances in the law.) Because of the inaccurate report, the Department of Law miscalculated Active’s presumptive sentence. They believed it to be between two years and 12 years -- leading to his four-year sentence and release in 2012. If their calculation had included his 2007 felony charge, he would have had a presumptive sentence of eight years to 15 years. The Department of Law said at the time that they are not sure how the mistake happened, though the information network sometimes has blind spots when it comes to offenses that happen in rural villages, like the one where Active was arrested in 2007, according to the Alaska Dispatch. Regardless, this chain of events happened before Sullivan became attorney general. The Alaska Public Safety Information Network pulled Active’s report the day after he was arrested in January 2009 -- Sullivan took office the following June. So although Active’s plea agreement and sentencing happened in 2010, while Sullivan was in office, the mistake that led to Active’s shorter sentence happened more than a year earlier. (At the time, Sullivan was on active duty for the U.S. Marine Corps, according to his campaign.) Additionally, it’s highly unlikely that Sullivan was personally involved with Active’s case and plea agreement at all, said John Skidmore, director of the Department of Law’s criminal division. The state handles about 40,000 cases each year, at least half of which are felonies -- so it’s ""unrealistic"" for an attorney general to be involved with individual cases, he said. ""There is no way that (any attorney general) would be involved in that sort of decision at that level at that time,"" Skidmore said. Part of a trend? The Alaska Democrats said that under Sullivan, there was a trend of the state giving sex offenders light sentences -- pointing to a dozen cases in which Alaska prosecutors negotiated sentences with sex offenders that fell at the low end of the sentence-length spectrum. They also noted that Alaska local television station CBS 11 produced a story in March 2010 about what happens to criminals who fail to register as sex offenders with the state. The story includes examples of convicted rapists receiving the minimum sentence for failing to register, and others having charges against them dropped. However, Alaska’s sentencing structure encourages prosecutors to negotiate sentencing agreements, leaving judges with little influence over sentencing, said former Alaska Chief Justice Walter Carpeneti in 2012. And these presumptive sentencing policies had been in place since the late 1970s -- so when Sullivan entered the office, these practices were already well-established. During his time as attorney general and subsequent role as commissioner of natural resources, Sullivan was one of the main faces of the ""Choose Respect"" campaign, started in 2009 by Republican Gov. Sean Parnell to address domestic violence and sexual assault in Alaska. The ""Choose Respect"" campaign passed several pieces of legislation while Sullivan was attorney general, which his campaign said exemplifies his commitment to the issue. The laws passed include harsher sentences for people involved with child pornography or human trafficking, revision of bail laws for people charged with serious crimes, and specified procedures for DNA retention in murder and sexual assault cases. The campaign also said Sullivan hired the Department of Law’s first cyber-crimes prosecutor whose focus is combating child pornography. Following Active’s arrest for the May 2013 crimes, the state changed its plea bargaining policies, so Alaska prosecutors are no longer permitted to negotiate lower sentences with people charged with violent felonies or sexual crimes. Our ruling Begich said Sullivan approved a ""light sentence"" to a sex offender who is now charged with ""murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter."" Active, who is awaiting trial, received a shorter sentence than he was supposed to, but the mistake that led to this sentence happened before Sullivan became attorney general. So to pin the error on Sullivan is wrong, and to suggest that he actively approved the sentence is a fabrication.  The ad is not only inaccurate, it makes an inflammatory accusation.

Greater Wisconsin Committee says Walker gave $570 million in job creation money to his cronies
","A TV ad by a liberal political group blames lagging job growth on Gov. Scott Walker, charging that millions in precious job-development funds went to his pals and campaign donors. The ad begins with snippets of TV news reports highlighting Wisconsin’s employment struggles compared with its neighbors, then a narrator does the rest: ""What’s Scott Walker doing wrong? Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies … corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns … $570 million of our jobs money to Scott Walker’s friends. That’s how things work in Scott Walker’s Wisconsin."" The ad, which began airing Aug. 20, 2014, is from the Greater Wisconsin Committee, a group funded by labor unions and Democratic ideological groups, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. Is the group right to say $570 million went to Walker ""cronies?"" The figure comes from a document released in May 2014 by the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now. It was entitled ""W is for WEDC: Gov. Scott Walker’s privatized Commerce Department: A case study in corruption, cronyism and incompetence."" Early in his term, Walker replaced the public Commerce Department with the private-public Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC). His stated rationale was to narrow the focus to job creation. In 2013, state auditors found the agency didn't adequately follow up to see if jobs were being created by companies granted incentives; didn't clearly report the jobs numbers it did have; and gave awards to ineligible businesses and projects. In the wake of that, One Wisconsin Now sought to connect Walker’s gubernatorial campaign donors to the loans, grants, bonds, tax credits or other financial assistance granted or overseen by the WEDC agency, which is chaired by Walker. The group said it found $570 million in financial incentives to 192 firms whose employees were a source of campaign donations to Walker. It said Walker received more than $1 million between 2009 and 2013 from people associated with the firms, and in some cases their spouses. (The incentives are paid in full over several years, unless goals are not met.) We ran our own checks on the $570 million figure and talked to One Wisconsin Now, the Greater Wisconsin Committee and the Walker campaign about the ad. Bottom line: There is a way to get to that number, but it’s a big stretch to characterize it as the Greater Wisconsin Committee did in its ad. Looking at the contributions There’s no doubt that people associated with companies that received WEDC help have given to Walker’s campaigns. One example: In 2011 and 2013, WEDC gave Sargento Foods access to $1.5 million in tax credits to support capital projects. From 2009 to 2013, Sargento company executives and their spouses, and other company employees, gave more than $81,000 to Walker’s campaigns. They gave nothing to Walker’s opponents in that period. All of that’s nothing new -- Walker’s Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle, received such donations, as no doubt every governor has. And it is perhaps particularly unsurprising in Walker’s case, given that the Republican’s natural base of support is business. But the TV ad plays fast and loose in describing all these donors as Walker ""cronies,"" which it defines as ""corporate friends."" The use of the word ""crony"" itself, of course, carries a negative spin. And when the ad cites two media sources to back the language it uses, it misleads on both. The ad lists WKOW-TV in Madison as the source of the ""friends"" description in relation to the incentives. But the station’s online story cited in the ad just called them donors. The ad cites Isthmus, Madison’s free weekly newspaper, for the ""cronies"" term. The publication did use the phrase, but in a story from July 18, 2013 -- a year before the $570 million number came out. Equal opportunity givers More significantly, the research that underlies the $570 million figure counts numerous companies whose employees have also given to Democrats. Indeed, major candidates from both parties typically receive backing from business -- money flows to the party in power, and its allies. The Greater Wisconsin Committee itself has received money from groups supported by wealthy business interests, according to data from the Democracy Campaign. Our examination found that 35 companies that received more than $295 million in help from Walker’s WEDC have in the past supported Doyle through employee donations. That includes givers at major firms such as Menards, Ashley Furniture and Kohl’s. If you knock out just those Doyle-connected firms, the $570 million is already down to about $275 million. Similar connections can be found for contributions to Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett (who faced Walker in 2010 and in the 2012 recall) and other Democrats, including to a much lesser extent Walker’s 2014 opponent Mary Burke. Even more revealing is the case of biotech firm Promega Corp. of Fitchburg, which got $75 million in bonding authority overseen by WEDC. That put it on the ad's ""crony"" list. But the firm’s founder, William Linton, has given nothing to Walker. In  contrast, he gave $6,000 to Doyle, $17,500 to Barrett for his two campaigns against Walker and $1,000 to Burke, late last year. Promega employees have given overwhelmingly to Democrats and liberals for years, to the tune of more than $30,000. Just two employees gave a total of $600 to Walker, based on our check of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign’s searchable campaign finance database. Yet the company makes the list. More issues To be sure, donations from workers at some firms have been sizeable. Donations totalled $5,000 or more to Walker from employees at 45 firms that won $172 million in assistance. But the analysis used in the ad didn’t distinguish between CEOs making maximum donations and rank-and-file workers whose small donations may have had nothing to do with any desire of the company to stay in Walker’s good graces. Nor did it matter if donors gave right around the time of getting an award, or made a small gift three years earlier. Eleven firms that received $14 million in help were counted even though their employees gave $100 or less in total. Was Walker rewarding ""friends"" when WEDC awarded retail giant Amazon $7 million in tax credits in October 2013? An Amazon software engineer in Ohio did give Walker’s campaign a total of $160 that year in two donations, the only ones identified as from Amazon employees to Walker. That alone put Amazon on the list. A contribution that size is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Walker’s $56 million, 50-state fundraising take since mid-2009. We tried an exercise, selecting $1,000 in donations as a minimum ""crony"" threshold -- surely your close friends at one firm would give that much over 5 years. Companies whose owners and employees cumulatively gave less than $1,000 -- and didn’t give to Doyle -- account for $160 million in aid out of the $570 million. If you take out that $160 million, the bottom line falls to around $115 million. 275 from above - 160 Plus, we found that $7.5 million in deals were wrongly attributed to the Walker era when they were made under Doyle. One last note: More than $295 million of the $570 million in WEDC aid cited by the ad came from flood-relief loans for developers as part of the federal  flood-relief program known as Midwest Disaster Area Bonds. The Walker campaign protests that it’s misleading to include those in the WEDC aid total because local communities, not WEDC, issue the bond funds. Still, the agency assists developers in some cases, allocates bonding authority and reviews the deals, even bragging that the program helps toward Walker’s goal of 250,000 new private-sector jobs. Our rating The liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee PAC claimed that ""Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies: corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns"" and got $570 million in incentives. The list of companies that won $570 million and gave to Walker is a starting point for trying to spot instances in which a true Walker crony got a sweet deal. But that’s all it is. Much of that money went to firms whose employees have given to Democrats in the past. Many of the donations were small, and Walker’s jobs agency has a limited role in dealing with firms associated with a big chunk of the $570 million. The ad makes a red-hot charge that suggests corruption, even putting a dollar figure on it, but can’t deliver the goods.

"['Rhode Island', 'Energy', 'Stimulus', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
Rep. David Cicilline is responsible for the federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, the failed solar company
","
There’s been a lot of finger-pointing lately in Washington over the Obama administration’s 2009 decision to give a $535-million federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, a now-defunct solar power manufacturer.

The Republican-controlled House has launched an investigation into how the Department of Energy could guarantee such a large loan to a company that would file for bankruptcy only two and a half years later. What sort of examination of the California start-up company’s finances did the government do before taking such a big risk?

According to a news release we received the other day, the National Republican Congressional Committee has found a scapegoat for the debacle: U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island.

""Once the poster child for David Cicilline's stimulus boondoggle, the bankrupt Solyndra company is now a symbol of how his failed scheme wasted taxpayer money on political payback and failing companies instead of creating the jobs promised,"" the Jan. 13 release said.

The NRCC sent out the release in response to a Washington Times report that senior Solyndra executives were set to receive bonuses despite the company’s troubles.

""It’s outrageous enough that David Cicilline supported a $1-trillion failed stimulus package, but it’s even more outrageous that hundreds of millions were spent to fund a failing company like Solyndra,"" NRCC communications director Paul Lindsay went on to say in the release. ""Not only is Cicilline responsible for this irresponsible investment, but he’ll also have to explain to his Rhode Island constituents why Solyndra’s senior employees are receiving bonuses at the expense of hard-working American taxpayers.""

We’ve heard a lot of allegations in connection to Solyndra’s problems, but never one laying the blame at Cicilline’s doorstep. This puzzled us because Cicilline took office in 2011, well after the federal stimulus package that financed Solyndra’s loan guarantee was passed and well after the decision was made to award Solyndra the loan guarantee. How could he be responsible?

We checked the NRCC’s website and saw that the same news release had been sent out to 49 other Congressional districts, but each time, the name of the Democrat in office was inserted where Cicilline’s name was. (The Democrats included Rep. Bill Keating, of Massachusetts, who also took office in 2011).

We then called the organization seeking an explanation of how Cicilline made it on the list. (Curiously, Rep. James R. Langevin, Rhode Island’s other congressman who is also a Democrat, wasn’it on the list even though he was in office at the time the stimulus bill was passed and voted for it.)

An NRCC spokesman said the release was accurate because Cicilline voiced support for the stimulus package when he was campaigning for Congress.

""I think the important thing to note is we didn’t say Cicilline voted for the stimulus,"" Nat Sillin said. ""We say he supported it.""

It’s true that Cicilline did back the stimulus package. When he was mayor of Providence, he was quoted numerous times saying that the bill would create sorely needed jobs.

And although it’s technically true that the release didn’t say that Cicilline voted for the stimulus, it did say that he’s responsible. That didn’t add up to us. Let’s run through some dates to make it clear why:

Feb. 13, 2009: Congress passes the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Under the $787-billion stimulus package, Solyndra received its loan guarantee.

March 20, 2009: Solyndra receives conditional approval for the loan guarantee, according to a timeline from the Department of Energ,.

Sept. 3, 2009: The Department of Energy makes the final decision to approve the loan guarantee for Solyndra.

Nov. 2, 2010: Cicilline elected to Congress.

Jan. 5, 2011: Cicilline takes office.

Our ruling

The full name of the legislation under which the stimulus package was approved gives this one away -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

Cicilline took office in January 2011, a full 23 months after passage of the bill enacting the loan guarantee program that benefited Solyndra.

The National Republican Congressional Committee has every right to call the stimulus a ""boondoggle."" And it’s fair to say that Cicilline supported the stimulus before taking office.

But Lindsay said that Cicilline is ""responsible for this irresponsible investment."" No, he’s not.

We’d say that Lindsay and the National Republican Congressional Committee simply used overheated rhetoric, but that’s an understatement. Their claim is so wildly inaccurate that we give it a Pants on Fire.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Silvestre Reyes']","
Silvestre Reyes says says 282 Texas school districts requested class-size waivers because of 'unprecedented fiscal challenges'
","
In a Jan. 9, 2012, press release, U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, urged Republican Gov. Rick Perry to convene a special legislative session so lawmakers can provide more money to ""under-served schools."" 
Citing the Legislature's 2011 decision to give school districts $4 billion less through August 2013 than they would have gotten under previous funding formulas, Reyes said: ""Our school districts are now experiencing unprecedented fiscal challenges and being forced to take drastic measures, like increasing class sizes and cutting instructional supports. In fact, the Texas Education Agency is reporting that 282 school districts have requested emergency waivers to increase class sizes."" 
That would be nearly a third of the state's 1,000-plus districts. Is the congressman right? 
His statistic checks out, we found, but it's unlikely that all the requests were driven by financial difficulties. 
Texas has capped the size of classes in kindergarten through fourth grade since 1984, when the Legislature passed a measure setting the limit at 22 students per teacher. The thinking at the time was that smaller classes would result in greater student achievement. 
But the caps had an out. Currently, a school district may receive a waiver if the state education commissioner ""finds the limit works an undue hardship on the district."" In an interview, Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us that state education officials originally set two scenarios under which waivers would be granted: if a district were unable to hire enough teachers or lacked the classroom space to meet the 22:1 ratio. Later, she said, the agency added an additional factor — if a district had experienced unanticipated enrollment growth. 
From fall 1993 through spring 2010, the number of districts granted class-size waivers generally fluctuated between 90 and 150 each semester, according to information in two reports from the education agency. Ratcliffe told us that over the years, the agency approved ""virtually every waiver (request) that was submitted."" 
To support Reyes' claim that the number of Texas school districts seeking waivers rocketed to 282 this school year, his office sent us a Jan. 3, 2012, El Paso Times article containing figures attributed to the state. As of Dec. 21, 2011, the article says, 282 districts had requested waivers for 1,643 campuses and 8,186 classrooms. When requesting a waiver, a district must designate how many classes at each campus will exceed the cap. 
Ratcliffe, confirming the 282 figure, told us that of those requests, 266 were granted outright while 16 districts were given partial approval, meaning some campuses could exceed the limit while others could not. The education agency generally rejected waivers for campuses rated ""academically unacceptable"" under the state's education accountability rating system, Ratcliffe said. 
As of Jan. 10, 2012, a total of 286 districts had sought class-size waivers. Of those, 270 — including the Austin, Del Valle, Eanes, Hays, Lake Travis, Leander, Manor, Pflugerville and Round Rock districts — had been granted waivers outright. 
That's an all-time high, Ratcliffe said. For comparison, she said, there were 168 waivers granted to districts in the 2010-11 school year. So, as of early 2012, district class-size waivers had increased 61 percent since the previous school year. 
What’s going on? 
Even before the 2011 legislative session began in January, state funding for education was expected to be stressed because of lawmakers' vow to balance the 2012-13 state budget without raising taxes. In addition to the $4 billion drop in formula-based funding to districts, lawmakers also did not renew about $1.3 billion in grant funding for education programs. 
Some districts had local funding problems as well, Ratcliffe said, as declining property values reduced property tax revenue. 
To help districts deal with the budget-tightening, lawmakers considered softening the 22-to-1 class-size cap. They did not agree on any change, but in the fall, Education Commissioner Robert Scott made it easier for districts to exceed the limit by adding ""financial hardship"" as a fourth reason districts could qualify for a waiver. 
Ratcliffe told us that this school year is unusual because some districts had enough classroom space to adhere to the class-size rule and had access to qualified teacher candidates, but still lacked the funds to hire them. 
Ratcliffe speculated that districts' financial difficulties are what led to the big uptick in waiver requests this school year. Another likely factor, she said, is that some districts built their budgets assuming that lawmakers would loosen the class-size cap — and when that didn't happen, they were too far along in budgeting for the year to adjust. 
We asked the education agency whether all the districts that had requested waivers as of early 2012 had cited ""financial hardship"" in their applications. Ratcliffe said the agency had not crunched the data that way. 
On Jan. 19, 2012, we looked at the data ourselves after generating a report on this school year’s waivers from the education agency’s website. The report had 2,911 entries, one for each grade level of each school that would be affected by a waiver. For example, if a district received a waiver for kindergarten and fourth grade at one elementary school, there would be two entries in the report for that campus. 
Our overview: 
** At least 163 school districts that had received waivers cited ""financial hardship"" as the reason for seeking the exception for at least one campus. That's 60 percent of the total number of districts that had received waivers as of early January. 
** Some districts that requested waivers hadn't cited ""financial hardship"" as a reason, including Houston, the state's largest school district, which had received waivers for 441 grade levels over 146 campuses, and Austin, which had received waivers for 18 grade levels in 16 elementary schools. 
** Some districts exclusively cited the ""financial hardship"" reason in their requests, including Dallas, which had received exceptions for 45 grade levels on 34 campuses, and Bexar County's Northside, which had received waivers for 150 grade levels on 63 campuses. 
Our ruling 
Reyes accurately recaps how many districts had requested class-size waivers from the state education agency as of late December 2011 — a number that subsequently grew. Yet, his suggestion that financial difficulties born from the 2011 Legislature’s actions are responsible for all of the waiver requests is an overstatement, considering that historically, dozens of districts have sought and received waivers each year. 
Then again, 60 percent of districts that had received a waiver as of early January cited the new ""financial hardship"" reason when seeking permission to exceed the class-size law.

Does Suzanne Bonamici support a plan that reduces choice for Medicare Advantage seniors?
","
Republican Rob Cornilles continues his attack on Democrat Suzanne Bonamici, claiming once again this week on Think Out Loud that her support of President Obama’s 2010 health care reform act means that she supports cuts to seniors on Medicare and Medicare Advantage.

""…She supports taking $500 billion away from Medicare. I don’t support that. It would largely affect those seniors who are on Medicare Advantage, which is about a quarter of a million Oregon seniors. They’ve chosen that option. I want to maintain they have that choice. She does not.""  

Cornilles and Republicans nationally have refused to back off their erroneous claim that Obama’s Affordable Care Act cuts $500 billion from Medicare. As we reported in November 2011 and in October 2010, the act reduces Medicare spending by $500 billion over the next 10 years.

But those dollars don’t come out of the current budget, they are not actual cuts, and nowhere does the bill actually eliminate any current benefits. As PolitiFact Oregon’s Ryan Kost reported: ""The $500 billion is all in future spending reductions and come through the law’s attempts to slow projected growth, not cut spending.""

An initially estimated $136 billion of the $500 billion in future savings is to come from Medicare Advantage. What is Medicare Advantage? Let’s back up for a moment. Every person 65 or older gets what’s called original Medicare or traditional Medicare. It consists of Part A, which covers hospital care, and Part B, which covers doctor visits. You can get these services from any provider who sees Medicare patients. Part A is free; Part B premiums usually come out of your Social Security check.

Some private insurers also offer what’s called Medicare Advantage, Part C, where seniors can pay an extra monthly premium for services not covered by plain Medicare A and B, such as vision, hearing and dental. Often, these plans will include Part D, which is the prescription drug plan pushed by then President George W. Bush in 2003.

Some seniors prefer Medicare Advantage plans because they are comprehensive, with all billing through one entity, said Joe Baker, president of the nonpartisan advocacy group Medicare Rights Center. Other seniors might prefer traditional Medicare because they travel a lot and don’t stick to one region, or they want services that aren’t covered by advantage plans.

""There are trade-offs with both,"" Baker said.

Now, why would Congress want to reduce future growth in Medicare Advantage spending? Because it’s considered bloated. As the Kaiser Family Foundation reported in a 2010 video primer, Congress in previous years had increased payments to private insurers who offer Medicare Advantage plans in order to increase enrollment in those plans. Insurers used that extra money to offer more benefits to those people, such as vision and dental care.

""However, as a result of this payment system Medicare actually pays more for beneficiaries who enroll in Medicare Advantage plans than it pays for beneficiaries in traditional Medicare,"" says Tricia Neuman, a vice president  of the Kaiser Foundation and director of the Medicare Policy Project.

""This has increased costs to the Medicare program. These over-payments also contribute to Medicare’s fiscal problems, shortening the life of the Medicare trust fund and actually increasing payments paid by other beneficiaries.""

(Kaiser Health News reported in December 2011 that according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, the government spent in 2011 ""10 percent more for beneficiaries enrolled in (Medicare Advantage) plans than if those beneficiaries were in fee-for-service Medicare."")

Ah-ha! So private insurers are making out nicely off of Medicare Advantage plans, leaving traditional Medicare recipients to pick up the slack. We can see why government would want reform.

Mary Anne Ostrom, Cornilles’ campaign manager, says that’s besides the point. Bonamici supports the Affordable Care Act. Ostrom says that means Bonamici supports eliminating choice for seniors.

""Whether services are cut, contracts terminated or out-of-pocket expenses grow unaffordable, it is completely reasonable to suggest that when people must drop from a plan they like, they are forced out. A $900-a-year increase in out-of-pocket costs would be considered unaffordable by many seniors. They have no choice,"" Ostrom said in an email to PolitiFact Oregon in November 2011.

Is Ostrom correct on that front?

Richard S. Foster, chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, projected in an April 2010 memo that ""[t]he new provisions will generally reduce (Medicare Advantage) rebates to plans and thereby result in less generous benefit packages."" He estimated that by 2017, enrollment will be 7.4 million rather than the originally projected 14.8 million. (As of September 2011, 11.9 million were enrolled.)

A follow-up from Foster, as posted to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance website in October 2010, states that out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries should grow to $873 a year by 2019.

Yet, the Kaiser Family Foundation cautions against sweeping predictions inits October 2010 report: ""The HHS Actuaries predict a decline in enrollment between 2011 and 2019, and an erosion of extra benefits. However, such predictions are difficult, and at the present time, Medicare Advantage appears to remain an important part of the Medicare program.""

It turns out that enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans increased 6 percent from from 2010 to 2011, according to the Government Accountability Office. Enrollment was projected to increase again in 2012 and average premiums decrease.

In the past we gave Cornilles a False for perpetuating the inaccurate statement that Bonamici and other Democrats support $500 billion in cuts to Medicare, hurting seniors. Here, however, he’s making a more specific point about seniors on Medicare Advantage.

It’s hard to know what will happen to Medicare Advantage, but it’s undeniable that reduced payments to insurers could result in higher costs or decreased benefits for seniors. We acknowledge that truth in the statement.

Still, there’s significant information missing. The Affordable Care Act was designed to save money by slowing future spending, including future spending on Medicare Advantage plans. But spending still goes up. In addition, many outside factors can affect the cost and range of benefits, making it impossible to know how Medicare Advantage might change.

While the statement from Cornilles is partially accurate, it is taken out of context and ignores important details on a politically volatile subject. We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/21/rob-cornilles/does-suzanne-bonamici-support-plan-reduces-choice-/

Mitt Romney says he didn't inherit money from his parents
","
Multimillionaire GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney says he built that wealth himself, ""the American way.""

Romney, the son of a corporate CEO, made his own fortune leading private equity firm Bain Capital.

But as the product of a wealthy Michigan suburb, private prep school and ultimately Harvard, Romney still faces accusations of silver-spoon privilege.

""I know the Democrats want to go after the fact that I've been successful,"" Romney said at a Republican presidential debate in Charleston, S.C. on Jan. 19, 2012, as he explained why he would wait to release his tax returns. ""I'm not going to apologize for being successful.""

His father, George Romney, who led Detroit automaker American Motors Corp., was a three-time governor of Michigan and himself ran for president in the 1960s.

""I could have stayed in Detroit like him and gotten pulled up in a car company,"" Romney said at the debate. ""I went off on my own. I didn't inherit money from my parents. What I have, I earned. I worked hard, the American way.""

We were curious. Did Romney, the last of George and Lenore's four children, receive no inheritance on his path to wealth?

Romney's words 
We asked Romney's campaign about his claim. 
According to a short history of the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management at BYU, the family provided an endowment in 1998, within a few years of George Romney's death.

So, in Romney's own words, he did ""inherit some funds"" from his dad. But he gave them away.

Why?

""I figured we had enough of our own,"" he said.

He probably did. By 1995, Romney had already led Bain Capital for more than a decade, where shrewd investments made him millions. He stepped down in 1999.

He now says he's worth somewhere between $190 million and $250 million.

How Romney got rich

""I went off on my own,"" Romney said at the debate. ""... What I have I earned. I worked hard, the American way.""

So while he didn't ultimately benefit from an inheritance, we wondered: Had Romney's parents' wealth helped build his own fortune?

There's no evidence we saw that Romney's parents helped buy him a business career. But there were certain advantages to Romney's comfortable upbringing. 
Romney started college at Stanford, where his ""allowance"" was big enough for frequent plane tickets to sneak home to Michigan see his girlfriend, Ann, according to a recently published book by two Boston Globe journalists, ""The Real Romney.""

After a two-year missionary trip to France, where he lived sparely as he proselytized door-to-door, he finished his undergraduate studies at BYU, where he married Ann in 1969. He was 22, his wife 19. His parents' wedding gift? A car. Meanwhile, the students — who started a family a year later — lived in a modest, $62-a-month basement apartment, Ann later told the Boston Globe. But they didn't have to work.

Rick Santorum says Rick Perry requested 1,200 congressional earmarks
","
Rick Santorum, who once took fire from Rick Perry for seeking earmarked spending while in Congress, lashed back after a town hall meeting in South Carolina.

On Jan. 11, 2012, eight days before the Texas governor suspended his presidential campaign, Santorum said: ""Rick Perry requested 1,200 earmarks as governor of Texas,"" according to a blog posted by MSNBC. ""It’s sort of hard for somebody who’s been in public life and elected office for 25 years to be the outsider when he also requested over a thousand earmarks from Washington,"" he added.

We wondered how Santorum arrived at Perry’s 1,200, a figure the former Pennsylvania senator aired again a few days later, according to a Jan. 16, 2012, post on ABC News’ blog The Note.

A refresher: According to the nonpartisan group Taxpayers for Common Sense, an earmark is a legislative provision that sets ""aside funds within an account for a specific program, project, activity, institution or location. These measures normally circumvent merit-based or competitive allocation processes and appear in spending, authorization, tax and tariff bills.""

Earmarks, which Congress banned from its budgeting and appropriations process in 2011, draw fire in some quarters because they enabled individual lawmakers to carve out funding for pet projects without public scrutiny. Some advocacy organizations say they’re still finding earmarks--sometimes called pork--in legislation.

Earmark requests that raised some eyebrows include: the so-called Bridge to Nowhere project in Alaska--something for which Santorum voted, says a Perry ad (that’s Mostly True, PolitiFact found); $522,000 for cranberry and blueberry disease and breeding in New Jersey, and $1 million for a Woodstock museum, honoring the 1969 music festival in upstate New York.

Santorum’s campaign didn’t reply to our requests for his backup.

It would not be a shock, though, if Perry was involved in seeking earmarks. As noted in a Dec. 29, 2011, Austin American-Statesman blog post, headlined  ""Texas has sought its own earmarks under Perry’s leadership,"" a July 2006 strategic plan for the Texas Office of State-Federal Relations, which then lobbied for the state in Washington, said that with the Texas Department of Transportation, it had secured ""over $669 million in highway earmarks for the state, $78 million in bus and bus facility earmarks, and $505 million in New Starts transit earmarks in the five-year surface transportation bill.""

At the time, the blog post says, Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and then-House Speaker Tom Craddick, comprised the advisory board for the state-federal office.

For this article, we looked for signs of Perry seeking Santorum’s proclaimed 1,200 earmarks.

Steve Ellis, who studies earmarks as vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that says it works to advance government transparency and cut wasteful spending, told us that from October 2007 through September 2010, Texas received 1,342 earmarks valued at $1.7 billion. That money could have gone to projects anywhere in Texas, he said, from Fort Hood to county governments. ""It’s the entire state of Texas so it could be Democrats, Republicans, whomever, asking,"" Ellis said. ""Whether Gov. Perry wanted them all, didn’t want them all, I have no idea.""

Ellis said that after October 2007, federal disclosure laws required Congress to list any earmarks in each piece of legislation. Staffers at Taxpayers for Common Sense would comb the legislation for additional earmarks and do their own calculations to determine things like the number of earmarks that went to each state.

Citizens Against Government Waste, which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization that started when Ronald Reagan was president, also tracks earmarks. Its president, Tom Schatz, told us by email that between 2008 and 2010, Texas received 1,151 earmarks worth $1.4 billion, according to the organization’s earmarks database. The database, also known as the ""Congressional Pig Book,"" is compiled by staffers at the organization who review legislation in search of earmarks, Schatz said.  

But there’s no way of telling how many of the earmarks originated with any governor, Schatz said, because earmarks are requested by members of Congress. ""I’ve never seen a letter from any governor asking for a specific earmark,"" Schatz said, adding: ""The only way to say that Gov. Perry ‘requested’ 1,200 earmarks, or more than 1,000 earmarks, is to attribute all of the (Texas) earmarks over that three-year period to him.""

Full disclosure: In 2010, the group’s political arm, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, endorsed Perry for governor and, Schatz said, the council might endorse a presidential hopeful later this year. Schatz said he was speaking about earmarks on behalf of the group, not its PAC.

The figures Schatz gave us--1,151 earmarks worth $1.4 billion--differed some from those we received from Taxpayers for Common Sense: 1,342 earmarks valued at $1.7 billion. Ellis said the discrepancy is likely the result of slightly different definitions of earmarks. He said that everyone would have the same initial list of earmarks, provided through disclosure laws, but additional searching of legislation could yield findings that some groups would call an earmark and some wouldn’t. Citizens Against Government Waste lists seven criteria for determining earmarks.

According to news accounts, some Texas-tied requests for earmarks during Perry’s time in office were claimed by Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. A Feb. 4, 2010 news article in The Houston Chronicle said that Hutchison, a ""senior Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, points with pride to the $2.3 billion in Texas earmarks she has obtained over the last two years. Among the projects delivered by the senator are highway construction, NASA funding and expansion of Fort Hood and other military installations in an era of base cutbacks.""

In November 2010, PolitiFact Texas examined Hutchison’s record on earmarks by citing a study by Taxpayers for Common Sense, which ranked Hutchison 19th out of the 100 U.S. senators for steering tax dollars to specific home-state projects. The state’s junior senator, John Cornyn, ranked 54th.

In October 2009, The Dallas Morning News reported that by Hutchison's accounting, she had steered $8.7 billion to Texas over the previous five years. ""And as Congress finalizes the 2010 budget,"" the News' story says, ""the haul will probably exceed $10 billion – a staggering sum that has never been tallied before. It ranks her among the most successful earmarkers in congressional history.""

Ray Sullivan, a Perry campaign spokesman, said the governor has a history of rejecting earmarks, something Perry noted when he faced off with Hutchison in the 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary. ""Perry has long been opposed to congressional earmarks and other irresponsible spending in Washington,"" Sullivan said in an email.

We asked Sullivan how many earmarks Perry sought. ""I was chief of staff for two years and recall no such requests from the Governor’s Office during that time,"" Sullivan said in another email.  ""From time to time Gov. Perry asked the federal government to return Texas taxpayer money to Texas for priority needs, including disaster assistance and border security.""

Upshot: We failed to come up with a count of earmarks pursued or supported by Perry.

Put another way, the only count we found that might potentially support Santorum’s 1,200 figure was the total earmarks that went to all of Texas over a recent period. 
State government may have played a role in requesting some of that funding. But it’s more than a stretch to say that Perry himself sought all the earmarks. It’s Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/jan/20/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-rick-perry-requested-1200-congr/
"['National', 'Deficit', 'Veterans', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum says President Barack Obama wants to cut veterans’ benefits
","
Rick Santorum says the president wants to solve the budget deficit by picking the pockets of America’s military veterans.

In a debate on Jan. 19, 2012, in Charleston, S.C., Santorum said he grew up in VA housing and saw Vietnam vets who were badly in need of medical and psychological care. He said service members returning from war now should have better support.

""We need to be much, much more aggressive. We have the president of the United States who said he is going to cut veterans' benefits, cut our military, at a time when these folks are four, five, six, seven tours, coming back, in and out of jobs, sacrificing everything for this country,"" Santorum said.

We decided to check: Does President Barack Obama intend to cut benefits for veterans?

Expansions to benefits

Obama’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 increases the overall Veterans Affairs budget by more than 10 percent. The numbers are big: from $53 billion in FY 2010 to almost $59 billion in FY 2012.

It provides new benefits for veterans’ caregivers, including health care and mental health services, and invests nearly $1 billion in VA services for homeless veterans and those at risk of becoming homeless.

The White House pointed us to several examples of how VA services have been beefed up, summed up in a comment Obama made in 2009:

""We dramatically increased funding for veterans' health care: more care for women's veterans, for our wounded warriors from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries,"" Obama said at a 2009 signing of a bill that funds veterans’ medical care a year in advance.

Separately, PolitiFact has given Obama seven Promise Kept ratings on pledges he made to improve services to veterans, compared with zero Promise Brokens.

Proposed cuts

Santorum’s campaign did not respond to our email about his statement, but he may have been referring to Obama's deficit reduction plan, which increases fees for some programs.

In September 2011, Obama submitted his outline for how to pay for his American Jobs Act. It was intended to serve as a guide to the joint committee tasked with finding savings in the federal budget.

In that plan, Obama proposed three possible ""reforms"" or increases in fees in military programs:

* A new $200 annual fee for TRICARE for Life recipients. Open to veterans 65 and older, TRICARE for Life pays out-of-pocket expenses not covered by Medicare. This proposed fee is estimated to save approximately $6.7 billion over 10 years, according to the plan.

* Increases in pharmacy co-pays. The plan says ""co-payments for military members have lagged behind other federal and private plans. For example, the average co-payment for a costly brand-name drug purchased at a drug store by a federal retiree in the most popular medical plan option is estimated to be $45, compared to $9 for a military retiree.""

* Review and reform military retirement benefits. The current system, the plan states, ""provides generous benefits to the relatively few members who stay for at least 20 years and no benefits for the roughly 80 percent of service members who stay less than 20 years. To consider reforms the Administration plans to set up a commission to develop recommendations for reforming the current military retirement system."" We should add that the president suggests grandfathering in those now serving so that major reforms don’t affect them.

What others say

We contacted a few veterans groups to get their take on how the president has served veterans.

Joe Davis, director of public affairs for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said Obama ""has been consistent in statement and action on protecting the Department of Veterans Affairs budget.""

But the changes Obama has floated are a concern.

""We are, however, concerned that budget cuts currently under consideration by the Department of Defense could undermine the viability of the all-volunteer force by changing the current military retirement system and by diverting more health care costs—higher enrollment fees and prescription co-payments—onto the backs of military retirees who were first required to donate 20 or more years of their youth to their nation. This is in addition to previously announced plans to shrink the size of the active-duty force,"" Davis said in an email.

Joe Violante, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, echoed that sentiment.

""The president has increased vet funding over the years and has expanded many programs, women vets, caregivers and PTSD and TBI (traumatic brain injury), to name a few. He is also responsible for supporting advance appropriations for VA health care funding. While you are correct in saying there are proposals to TRICARE fees, these are not usually considered vet programs and come under DOD. Thus far, vet programs have done well under this administration,"" Violante said in an email.

Our ruling

Santorum said that Obama has pledged to cut veterans’ benefits.

That is not the case with the VA budget, which Obama wants to increase.

But there are some proposals for programs in the Defense Department budget that might shift more expenses to veterans. On balance, we rate Santorum's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/20/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-obama-wants-cut-veterans-benefi/
"['Foreign Policy', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz says Obama made “a worldwide apology tour”
","

U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz all but channeled Mitt Romney during the Jan. 12, 2012, Republican Senate debate hosted in Austin by the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Empower Texans.

Saying the federal government’s first obligation is to provide for national security, Cruz referred to President Barack Obama, saying: ""This is a president who began his presidency going on a worldwide apology tour.""

Is that right?

Cruz’s claim reminded us of a comment by Romney in the Sept. 22, 2011, GOP presidential debate when he said Obama ""went around the world and apologized for America.""
   
Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, had earlier made this charge several times including in his 2010 book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness.

In the book, Romney gave seven examples: ""In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy.""

PolitiFact in Washington rated that Romney claim False, later rating Pants on Fire Romney’s statement in June 2011 implying that delivering apologies was the purpose for Obama’s visits.

In checking Cruz’s reference to Obama’s travels as a ""worldwide apology tour,"" let’s start by revisiting what Obama said after taking office -- and if he apologized. We’ll share what our PolitiFact colleagues learned from experts on foreign policy and apologies, and also compare statements from Obama predecessors President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton.

First, what constitutes an apology? ""A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it,"" scholar Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann told PolitiFact in 2010.

Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the website Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery.
   
An illustration: ""To say the United States will not torture is not an apology; it is a statement of intent,"" Howard-Hassman said.

Merriam-Webster defines an apology as ""an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret.""

And one word is the universal hallmark of apologies: ""Sorry.""

Bush and Clinton each used ""sorry"" in speaking of certain past American actions.

Clinton gave a forceful apology to the survivors and families of the experiments conducted in Tuskegee, Ala., in which government doctors left sick men untreated as part of a research study on syphilis. ""The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong,"" Clinton said at a formal ceremony in 1997. ""To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can ... finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry.""

In contrast, a 1998 Clinton statement that was described as an apology listed missteps, but did not include his saying ""sorry."" ""The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well,"" he said in remarks about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. ""We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope.""

Bush privately apologized to King Abdullah of Jordan in 2004 for the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Soon after, at a Rose Garden press conference, Bush said, ""I told His Majesty as plainly as I could that the wrongdoers will be brought to justice, and that the actions of those folks in Iraq do not represent the values of the United States of America. I told him I was sorry for the humiliation suffered by the Iraqi prisoners, and the humiliation suffered by their families. I told him I was equally sorry that people who have been seeing those pictures didn't understand the true nature and heart of America.""

Some people construed as an apology remarks Bush made in 2002 about American slavery at Goree Island, Senegal. But Bush did not explicitly apologize or express regret: ""My nation's journey toward justice has not been easy, and it is not over,"" he said. ""The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and justice for all.""

Back to Obama: PolitiFact isolated the passages Romney cited that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory. The passages are compiled in a separate document with links to the full remarks, but we’ll give brief recaps here.
       
At a town hall meeting in France, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and said the United States ""has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive."" But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a ""casual"" and ""insidious"" anti-Americanism.

In a major address to the United Nations, Obama said: ""I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.""
   
In England, a reporter said that during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said the power and authority of the United States had diminished in recent years. Obama turned the question toward Bush. ""Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable,"" Obama said. ""I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.... I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world.""
   
At a speech in Cairo on relations between the United States and the Islamic world, Obama said, ""In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.""
   
Also, Romney’s book cites four instances of Obama discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Typically, Obama would say that the U.S. must stay true to its ideals, and that's why he ""unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year."" (Obama has not been successful with his order of closing Guantanamo; consider it a Promise Broken.)
   
At the National Archives, in a major speech on fighting terrorism, Obama said that after 9/11, ""our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions.""

So, did Obama apologize?
       
In 2010, PolitiFact ran the excerpts past experts with different points of view.
  
Our ruling
   
Obama made no secret during the campaign that he intended to set a different course on foreign policy than Bush -- a committed unilateralist -- had pursued.
   
Yet it’s incorrect to portray these early speeches as part of a global apology tour. Using this standard, you could argue that any change in foreign policy that’s undertaken after a presidential transition and announced to the world would constitute an ""apology"" for the previous policy.
   
Obama's speeches contained criticisms of past U.S. actions, but not one full-throated apology. Cruz’s debate claim is so far off the mark, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/jan/20/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-obama-made-worldwide-apology-tour/

Jim Florio says fish from New Jersey waters labeled unsafe to eat
","
There’s plenty of fish in the waters of New Jersey, along with lots of other things: mercury, polychlorobiphenyls and dioxin, among them.

And according to a former governor, there could be some danger in eating fish from Garden State waters.

""Many types of fish and shellfish from waters across the state are labeled unsafe to eat,"" Jim Florio wrote in a Dec. 14 guest column in The Star-Ledger about how new reductions in mercury pollution will protect New Jerseyans from contaminated seafood.

It turns out Florio wasn’t exactly telling a fish tale, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

""I think that’s a fair and accurate statement actually,"" said Kerry Pflugh, manager of Constituent Services for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. ""But that doesn’t mean that everything we catch is unsafe to eat. … Advisories are not based on water quality, it’s based on what’s in the fish itself. Fish advisories are set by tissue analysis, not water quality.""

Jonathan Scott, communications director for Clean Water Action in Washington, DC said, ""We would agree with his assessment.""

Florio could not be reached for comment.

How are fish consumption advisories formulated?

Fish collected from New Jersey waterways are sent to The Academy of Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia. Tissue samples are taken to test for contaminants – mostly mercury, PCBs, DDT and other pesticides, said Richard Horwitz, senior biologist at the academy.

A committee decides an acceptable risk for eating a particular fish based on potential health issues for people considered ""high risk"": children, pregnant women and women of child-bearing age, Horwitz said. They are advised to eat smaller portions of fish and less often.

The 2010 Fish Consumption Advisories for all New Jersey waterways is available at the DEP’s Office Of Science website. The 30-page document explains what parts of fish are safe to eat; proper preparation; consumption frequency; and more.

""Fish is a very healthy source of protein, vitamins and minerals,"" said Dr. Gary Buchanan, manager for the DEP’s Office of Science. ""Just be careful about the fish you eat when catching them in local waters.""

The state also considers federal recommendations made by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

""The EPA provides guidance to assist states, Indian tribes and local governments in developing methods of monitoring, gathering and assessing information about their fish populations,"" EPA press officer John Martin said in an email. ""Since this information is only guidance, use by states is not mandatory. The States have primary responsibility for monitoring, assessing and making advisory decisions. Thus the basis for each State fish advisory varies.""

While a variety of contaminants are found in fish, mercury is the most prevalent, experts told us.

The mercury found in New Jersey waters comes from air pollution emitted from power plants, coal plants and incinerators from Pennsylvania and the Midwest, according to Buchanan, Horwitz and Scott.

""If those sources from out of state are reduced, that will help speed up the reduction of mercury in our waters and our fish and help allow additional fish consumption,"" Buchanan said. ""It is a nationwide problem. It’s not just a New Jersey problem. Every state in the country has a fish advisory for some parameter and some species.""

Even with the chemicals found in fish, New Jerseyans shouldn’t fear eating fish caught from the state’s waters, said Tom Fote, legislative chairman for the Jersey Coast Anglers Association in Toms River, as long as fish consumption guidelines are followed.

""Seafood coming out of New Jersey waters is no different than the seafood coming from out of any other state,"" Fote said.

Our ruling

Florio said in a recent opinion column in The Star-Ledger that most fish from New Jersey waterways ""is labeled unsafe to eat."" Experts told PolitiFact New Jersey that they agree with the former governor’s assessment but also note that fish from New Jersey waters can be eaten safely by following consumption advisories. Also, fish bought in supermarkets or other stores in New Jersey are labeled, but recreationally caught fish are not. We rate Florio’s statement Mostly True.

McDonnell says plan to bolster teacher pensions puts no mandate on localities
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell is calling on local governments to kick in $1 billion towards public teachers’ retirement nest eggs over the next two years.

The initiative is part of the governor’s overall plan to inject a record $2.21 billion of state and local dollars into the ailing Virginia Retirement System’s pension plans for state employees and teachers.

During a December 19 speech to the General Assembly’s money committees, the governor said his proposal ""puts no mandate on local government, but just continues their fair share of retirement for their teachers.""

We were curious whether McDonnell’s plan, if approved by the General Assembly, would mandate a level of pension of contributions for local government. So we took a look.

Webster’s New World College Dictionary defines mandate as ""an authoritative order or command, (especially) a written one.""  

In political debate, mandate is a charged word connoting an strong central government sending down dictates that erode local sovereignty and personal rights. Many conservatives, including McDonnell, have railed against mandates. McDonnell, on Jan. 16, unveiled a legislative effort to eliminate 21 ""burdensome state mandates on localities"" this winter.

The governor did not list pension rates on his list of local mandates. So let’s look at how employer contributions for teacher pensions are set by the state.

Every two years, the Virginia Retirement System’s board of trustees recommends a level of employer contribution for teacher retirement plans. For the biennial budget cycle starting July 1, VRS called for a contribution equaling 16.77 percent of the total teacher payroll for local school systems participating in the state pension plan. The governor, in presenting a two-year state budget to the legislature last month, called for a smaller contribution of 11.66 percent.

The General Assembly, while considering the state budget, ultimately sets the pension amounts that localities pay for teacher retirement.   

With that background, we called the McDonnell’s office and asked this question: If the General Assembly -- which has final say on pension rates -- approves the governor’s plan, why would it not qualify as a mandate on localities? We were referred to Ric Brown, Virginia’s secretary of finance.

Brown's answer was that teachers are local employees. The state is not dumping a burden on localities, he said, because cities and counties already have a responsibility to pay most of the pension costs for their teachers.

Although the General Assembly can set a lower rate than McDonnell recommends, doing so won’t save localities long-term money, Brown said. That’s because the cities and counties ultimately have the liability to fund the pension and must pay now or pay later, he explained.

The VRS is an estimated $19.9 billion short of the assets needed to pay its projected pension liabilities over the next 85 years. One of the reasons is that legislators for decades have set pension contribution rates at lower levels than recommended by VRS.

McDonnell has said the proposal, if approved, would be ""the largest employer contribution to the Virginian Retirement System in history."" We checked out that statement earlier this month and rated it True.

The state does help localities with teacher retirement costs by paying its share of the Standard of Quality -- regulations that provide minimum education guidelines for Virginia public schools.
Under McDonnell’s plan, localities would pay $1 billion for teacher retirement costs over the next two budget years, and the state would contribute $600 million.

""The state determines what the localities pay. This is nothing new … This is not a new mandate,"" said Mary Jo Fields, the director of research at the Virginia Municipal League. ""The fact that we pay part of the retirement costs is not unreasonable, but the amount we pay is unreasonable. Our share it too large, but Governor McDonnell didn’t invent that.""

What would happen if a county or city refused to pay the pension rates set by the General Assembly?  Brown said the VRS could extract the payment by ""intercepting"" state aid intended for the locality.

Our ruling:  
McDonnell said his proposal to boost localities’ teacher pension contributions ""puts no mandate on local government.""

The governor and his finance secretary justify the statement by noting teachers are local employees and, as such, it is up to localities to pay for the bulk of their retirement costs.

But the simple fact is that the General Assembly sets the rates localities pay into the state pension for teachers. If lawmakers adopt McDonnell’s plan, cities and counties must make the record retirement contributions or risk losing state aid.

That sounds like a mandate to us, albeit one that started long before McDonnell became governor.

We rate McDonnell’s no-mandate claim False.",/factchecks/2012/jan/20/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-plan-bolster-teacher-pensions-puts-/

Arne Duncan says the U.S. has dropped from No. 1 to No. 16 in the world for college graduation
","
The cost of higher education keeps rising, but U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan says it has never been more important.

He and Vice President Joe Biden focused on the need to keep college affordable in a visit to Ohio this month.

Speaking near Columbus at a town hall-style meeting at Lincoln High School in Gahanna, Biden said, ""The one ticket today for the middle class is some kind of education beyond high school.""

Duncan said going to college must stay a part of the American Dream.

""One generation ago we led the world in college graduation,"" he said. ""We're 16th today. In one generation, we've flat lined. We've stagnated.""

Going from first to 16th in international standings sounds like falling off a cliff into shallow water.

Is it true? PolitiFact Ohio called the Department of Education.

Duncan's office said the secretary frequently cites that statistic, usually stunning his listeners, and that his source is the report on education that was issued last September by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD is a 50-year-old group of 34 developed countries that sets international standards on a wide range of topics.

Its report shows that the United States has fallen from 12th to 16th in the share of adults age 25 to 34 holding degrees -- trailing leaders South Korea, Canada and Japan, and ranking in the middle of the pack among developed countries.

That supports Duncan's statement about the current U.S. ranking. But was the U.S. ever first? We asked the OECD.

To compare the current ranking with a generation ago, press officer Spencer Wilson referred us to a chart ranking countries by the percentage of their 55- to 64-year-old post-secondary degree holders.

On that list, the United States ties with Canada for second at 41 percent. Israel is first, with 45 percent.

""But the OECD itself, when talking about the changing world of global education, uses the U.S. as the world leader 40 years ago because most of the world's graduates at that time were American,"" Wilson told us in an email.

In fact, among the G20 countries that comprise the world's largest economies, every fourth adult with a post-secondary degree is in the U.S., the OECD report said. (China and Japan come in second and third.) The United States still has one of most highly educated labor forces in the OECD.

""However,"" the report adds, ""because of the rapid expansion of tertiary [post-secondary] education both in the industrialized world and in emerging economies, the U.S. is fast losing its advantage.""

The United States, it notes, is the only country in which degree attainment levels among people just entering the labor market -- meaning 25- to 34-year-olds -- do not exceed those of people about to leave the labor market, 55- to 64-year-olds.

When President Obama announced in 2009 a goal of retaking the lead in young adults with degrees, the U.S. ranked 12th among developed nations, with 39 percent of young adults holding degrees, according to an OECD report based on 2006 data.

That percentage increased to 41 percent in the latest study, based on 2009 data. But the pace of increase was more rapid elsewhere. The rate reached 63 percent in South Korea, and 56 percent in Canada and Japan.

""The U.S. also faces significant challenges in the supply of future students,"" the OECD said. In 2009, it said, the reading level of 42 percent of 15-year-old students was below the level necessary for secondary-level studies, meaning ""it will become increasingly difficult to supply institutions of higher education with students who are able to follow and complete their studies.""

So where does that leave Duncan’s claim?

The OECD data shows that his assertion that the United States ranked 16th for college graduation gets high marks. As for a generation ago, the OECD considered the United States the world leader because most of the world’s college graduates were from the United States.

In terms of percentage of population, though, the U.S. numbers were slightly behind the much smaller nation of Israel. That’s a point of clarification.

"['Georgia', 'Jobs', 'Nathan Deal']","
Little research on Savannah port jobs impact
","
Boosters of the stalled plan to deepen Savannah’s port keep a laundry list of reasons why breaking ground is a good idea.  

You may have heard them before. The project, they say, will make the port more efficient, help the U.S. boost exports, and make Georgia more competitive in the global market.  

But few grabbed our attention like one by Gov. Nathan Deal about the port’s effect on jobs.

The claim appeared in an op-ed in Roll Call, a Washington, D.C., publication with a Capitol Hill readership. Deal’s essay argued that Congress should give the dredging project money, even while the country is counting its pennies.

""Updating vital infrastructure that supports jobs and increases U.S. competitiveness is not the place to find cost savings. In this new era of prioritization, this is exactly the type of export-boosting, jobs-creating project that should be at the top of our list,"" Deal wrote.

Politicians often lace their pitches for expensive infrastructure projects with jobs claims, especially now that Georgia’s unemployment is stuck near 10 percent. We wondered if Deal had proof.

A Deal spokeswoman suggested we call the Army Corps of Engineers for data and mentioned research by the University of Georgia on the economic impact of the state’s ports.

We also looked for jobs forecasts for the port deepening.

We found that there’s not much jobs data. Officials from the Army Corps of Engineers and the Georgia Ports Authority and experts we interviewed said they were not aware of any economic impact study that analyzes how a deeper port would impact area jobs once it’s up and running.

The Army Corps of Engineers did conduct an economic impact study, but it didn’t focus on jobs. It studied how the project would increase shipping efficiency across the nation, and the economic benefits this would create.

The study does mention that if the port were dredged to the depth of 46 feet, construction could create as many as 5,000 ""job-equivalents"" during 48 to 60 months of construction.

But take note. This number does not represent how many additional people would be hired to dredge the port.

It includes jobs that would be created to make materials needed to dredge the port, or those that come about when workers spend their salaries.

Furthermore, it’s not clear how many of these jobs would be new. The corps would contract with professional dredging companies that already maintain the harbor, said Billy Birdwell, a spokesman for the corps. It’s unclear how many additional people they would hire.

Further complicating the matter is that each of these 5,000 job-equivalents amount to one job lasting one year. By this measure, a single full-time job lasting all five years of the project could count as five job-equivalents.  

Though there are not many specifics on the deepening project’s potential to create jobs, it’s clear that the Savannah port has a profound impact on employment in Georgia. Jeffrey Humphreys, director of the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia, has conducted studies about the economic impact of the state’s port system.

In 2009, workers held 14,131 full- and part-time slots at the Savannah port’s publicly owned facilities, according to a Selig Center study.

If you add in the jobs to make the materials those workers used, as well as those to staff the places where those workers spent their pay, these jobs total 21,628, the study said.

Because of major changes in the shipping industry, Georgia risks losing jobs if the port isn’t deepened, Humphreys said.

An expansion project at the Panama Canal will allow a bigger class of megaships to sail into East Coast harbors. Businesses like using these ships because they can help reduce how much time and money they spend transporting goods.

These ships require deeper ports, so major harbors along the Atlantic coastline are racing to update their infrastructure to win their business.

If these ports are successful, the rewards could be big. A trade group representing businesses that move big cargo expects that shipments will jump dramatically along the East Coast once the Panama Canal expansion completes in 2014, according to an August 2010 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

If that happens, the Georgia Ports Authority expects to build cranes and rail yards to accommodate more containers, the Journal-Constitution reported in December 2010.  

Ports that don’t deepen may lose business, analysts told PolitiFact Georgia.

""It’s really a matter of making sure the economic impacts that are already existing don’t go away,"" Humphreys said.

How do we rule? Is the proposed Savannah port deepening a ""jobs-creating project,"" as Deal said?

The corps estimates that dredging the port will require additional workers, although it’s not clear how many.

Evidence and common sense suggest that if megaships flock to a newly deepened Savannah port, the project could keep jobs in Georgia. It may well create them. But existing research offers little clarity.

Since Deal’s claim leaves out the crucial fact that the jobs impacts are uncertain, we give him a Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/20/nathan-deal/savannah-port-jobs-impact-unclear/

Newt Gingrich ad says Mitt Romney enacted taxpayer-funded abortions
","
Did Mitt Romney make taxpayer-funded abortion the law of the land in Massachusetts?

That’s one claim in an attack ad put out by Newt Gingrich’s campaign, which says Romney called himself ""pro-life"" but ""governed pro-abortion.""

""Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer funded abortions,"" the ad says, as a downcast Romney appears onscreen, along with his signature.

This is a claim that’s sure to be repeated, so we decided to look into it.

What’s in the law?

First, what’s not in the law: the word ""abortion.""

The sweeping health care legislation Romney signed on April 12, 2006, aimed to extend health insurance coverage to nearly every Massachusetts resident. It included an individual mandate, requiring almost all Massachusetts residents to get insurance, leading to an insured rate of nearly 98 percent in the state.

It required people who don't have health insurance to buy it or lose their individual state tax exemptions. To cover low-income people, private insurance companies developed low-cost plans that residents could buy through a new state-run insurance exchange called the Health Connector.

But the law doesn’t address what is covered and what isn’t. Search the text of it, and ""abortion"" is nowhere to be found.

""It doesn’t say in the law what is covered or not. It talks about health care and funding health care,"" said Anne Fox, president of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, which opposes abortion.

Yes, abortion is covered

A 1981 Supreme Judicial Court ruling in Massachusetts said that the cost of abortions had to be included in publicly subsidized plans.

Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage, and the state-subsidized plans in Massachusetts do, too. So when the Health Connector began, abortion coverage was automatically included.

In some of the low-cost plans, abortions are covered with a $50 co-pay.

So Gingrich’s ad is right that some abortions in Massachusetts are ""taxpayer-funded."" But that requirement long predated the law Romney signed.

""That was already a given,"" Fox said. ""Anything that’s paid for with tax money, like Medicaid, covered abortions.""

Her group was part of an effort to overturn that requirement with a constitutional amendment, but it failed.

""The combination of the court order and state-controlled health care means Romney really wasn’t involved in funding these abortions. It was automatic, and there would be no way to stop it,"" Fox said. ""We tried. It would have to be a constitutional amendment. It would not be something somebody could just veto.""

Fox’s assessment lines up with that of an abortion-rights group we contacted:

""NARAL Pro-Choice America’s position is that the Massachusetts health care plan enacted during former Gov. Romney’s tenure expanded on a system that already covered abortion. Thus, Romney should not get credit for improving women's access to abortion in Massachusetts,"" spokesman Ted Miller said in an email.

Our ruling

Gingrich’s ad says ""Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions.""

What’s right about that? Romney did sign government-mandated health care, and Massachusetts does provide taxpayer-funded abortions. But the ad inaccurately links the two together. The law Romney signed did not mention abortion coverage. It was included by the state exchange, which created plans that mirror private insurance nationwide. And a court decision two decades earlier mandated that the cost of the abortions be included. You’d never know any of that based on the misleading wording in the ad. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jan/20/newt-gingrich/gingrich-ad-says-mitt-romney-enacted-taxpayer-fund/
"['National', 'Marriage', 'Poverty', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum says Obama prohibits encouraging young people to marry
","
Rick Santorum says the president has issued a gag order on talking to young people about marriage.

During a debate in South Carolina on Jan. 16, 2012, Santorum gave a winding answer to a moderator’s question about combating poverty. He mentioned a study that he said found that people who have a job, earn a high school diploma and get married before having children are far less likely to be poor.

""It's a huge, huge opportunity for us,"" he said. ""But what is the Obama administration doing?"" The White House, Santorum said, ""now has regulations that tell (people who work with at-risk youths) that they can no longer promote marriage to these young girls. They can no longer promote marriage as a way of avoiding poverty and bad choices that they make in their life.""

It was a vague claim but one that piqued our curiosity.

What’s behind this?

We reached out to Santorum’s campaign to ask for the basis of the claim but didn’t get a reply. In the debate, the former Pennsylvania senator said he learned about the no-marriage rule from Elayne Bennett, founder and president of the Best Friends Foundation. The organization provides character education for at-risk girls in Washington, D.C., schools. Its message to adolescents, according to Bennett: ""that the best decision is to reject the risk behaviors of sex, drugs and alcohol.""

Bennett is the wife of Bill Bennett, former education secretary under President Ronald Reagan and drug czar under President George H.W. Bush. Both Bennetts are well-known conservatives.

In an interview, Elayne Bennett told us Santorum’s statement was incorrect with regard to marriage.

Here’s some background: Best Friends Foundation was awarded a five-year, $2.5 million grant by the Department of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush. The Healthy Marriage Grant, which included a component for counseling inner-city teenagers on the benefits of marriage, addressed issues such as abuse prevention and life skills.

But Bennett said that about two years ago, after Obama was elected, one aspect of the grant’s terms changed.

""We were not to discuss abstinence or sex as a risk behavior,"" Bennett said. ""It was a verbal instruction that we had to remove that word -- abstinence -- from our curriculum materials, which we did because we wanted to adhere to the new policy.""

Bennett says she rejects the label ""abstinence-only"" for what she teaches but said, ""we do recommend that the best choice for young people is to say no to risk behaviors.""

Formerly that meant encouraging girls to wait to have sex -- until the grant terms changed.

But she said the change never applied to discussing the benefits of marriage, and she thought Santorum’s statement in the debate left that impression. She said she spoke to him the next day, and he acknowledged it was ""lost in the translation.""

In the debate, Santorum added that the White House had restricted federal grantees from talking about abstinence and described why he thinks that’s harmful.

""They (the grantees) have to be neutral with respect to how people behave,"" Santorum said. ""The problem is neutrality ends in poverty, neutrality ends in choices that hurt people's lives. This administration is deliberately telling organizations that are there to help young girls make good choices, not to tell them what the good choice is. That is absolutely unconscionable.""

Bennett, who also issued a statement clarifying Santorum’s error, said she still agrees with his broader point about the benefits of discussing abstinence.

Source of the confusion

The Department of Health and Human Services told us that its position (in the prior administration and in this administration) stems from a 2006 law signed by President George W. Bush. Called the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, it identifies eight activities on which healthy marriage funds can be used.

Here, word for word, are the eight activities listed in the statute:

• Public advertising campaigns on the value of marriage and the skills needed to increase marital stability and health.

• Education in high schools on the value of marriage, relationship skills and budgeting.

• Marriage education, marriage skills, and relationship skills programs that may include parenting skills, financial management, conflict resolution and job and career advancement. 
•  Pre-marital education and marriage skills training for engaged couples and for couples or individuals interested in marriage.

• Marriage enhancement and marriage skills training programs for married couples. 
• Divorce reduction programs that teach relationship skills.

• Marriage mentoring programs which use married couples as role models and mentors in at-risk communities.

• Programs to reduce the disincentives to marriage in means-tested aid programs … .

Clearly, promoting marriage is an express purpose of this grant, not prohibiting promoting it.

A 2008 report by the Government Accountability Office review of the grant found that there was confusion among grant recipients and HHS staff about what was allowed to be taught about abstinence.

""HHS officials told us that abstinence education was not allowable under the Healthy Marriage program, but we observed during our site visits and review of grantee data several Healthy Marriage grantees operating programs that focused on abstinence education,"" the report states.

To clear up confusion, HHS said that in 2011 they made the existing policy more explicit but did not change the policy. The department also added that the topic of abstinence can be one component of some of these activities, but a stand-alone abstinence education program does not fit within the statutory uses of the funds.

Our ruling

Santorum said the Obama administration is not allowing people who work with at-risk adolescents to promote the benefits of marriage.

Santorum said he had heard this from Elayne Bennett of the Best Friends Foundation, but she told us he misspoke. The change under Obama, according to Bennett, was about what could be taught regarding abstinence -- not marriage. The Department of Health and Human Services said there was confusion in this area, so it clarified the policy, which does allow discussion of abstinence in other contexts but not as a stand-alone education program. Santorum simply got it wrong. His statement is False.",/factchecks/2012/jan/19/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-obama-prohibits-encouraging-you/

Barack Obama says he 'kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules'
","
In a 30-second ad released Jan. 18, 2012, President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign touts his record on several issues, including ethics.

""President Obama kept his promise to toughen ethics rules,"" a narrator says, as the following text is displayed on the screen: ""President Obama ‘kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules,’ PolitiFact 1/21/09.""

With our work cited in a campaign ad, we thought it would be worth checking whether it was cited accurately.

We found the article referenced in the ad -- a check in our Obameter that looked at whether the president kept his promise to ""issue an executive order banning registered lobbyists or lobbying firms from giving gifts in any amount or any form to executive branch employees.""

The ad is correct that we rated this a Promise Kept.

""In one of his first acts as president,"" we wrote at the time, ""Barack Obama kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules, signing an executive order on Jan. 21, 2009. ‘If you are a lobbyist entering my administration, you will not be able to work on matters you lobbied on, or in the agencies you lobbied during the previous two years,’ Obama said at the signing ceremony. ‘When you leave government, you will not be able to lobby my administration for as long as I am president. And there will be a ban on gifts by lobbyists to anyone serving in the administration as well.’""

We should note that we rated this a Promise Kept one day after Obama took office, based on his signing of the executive order. We have not checked subsequently to see if the executive order has been adhered to. However, since this is all we’ve published on that promise, we think it’s fair for the Obama campaign to have pointed to it.

But is this the whole story? Not necessarily.

We looked over our promises again and found at least 10 additional promise ratings relevant to the ad’s claim. And on these promises, Obama’s record has been decidedly more mixed. (We determined that five additional promises we had categorized under ""ethics"" weren’t relevant to the ad’s claim, so we’re excluding them from our calculation. But the ratings for those five are also all over the map, so it doesn’t change our conclusion.)

Here’s a rundown of the ethics promises we think are relevant:

• Centralize ethics and lobbying information for voters: Promise Broken

• Seek independent watchdog agency to investigate congressional ethics violations: Stalled

• Create a public ""Contracts and Influence"" database: Promise Broken

• Expose Special Interest Tax Breaks to Public Scrutiny: Stalled

• Require more disclosure and a waiting period for earmarks: Compromise

• Make White House communications public: Stalled

• Conduct regulatory agency business in public: In the Works

• Release presidential records: Promise Kept

• Tougher rules against revolving door for lobbyists and former officials: Promise Broken

• Require new hires to sign a form affirming their hiring was not due to political affiliation or contributions: Promise Kept

Counting the Promise Kept already cited in the ad, the final breakdown for these 11 promises is three rated Promise Kept, one Compromise, one In the Works, three rated Stalled and three rated Promise Broken. So, more than half of those promise are rated either Stalled or Promise Broken.

To be able to cite a Promise Kept on ethics, the ad makers cherry-picked just one of at least 11 relevant promise checks they could have chosen from.

Our ruling

The ad accurately quoted one of our promise checks in saying that Obama ""kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules."" However, it ignored at least 10 other ethics-related promise checks that showed a more mixed record, including three promises rated Stalled and three rated Broken. On balance, we rate the ad Half True. ",/factchecks/2012/jan/19/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-kept-campaign-promise-toughen-et/

Dennis Kucinich says combined top CEO pay topped $770M while average pay rose just 2%
","
Rep. Dennis Kucinich often decries the pay gap between America’s top earners and the growing poverty class.

He recently took to the stump after the U.S. Census Bureau released a new report on poverty, using it as a chance to promote safety net programs and his National Emergency Defense Act, which calls for investing in infrastructure and folding the Federal Reserve into the U.S. Treasury.

""The top 10 most well-paid CEOs in America received a combined $770 million in 2010, while the average American worker’s wage rose just 2 percent,"" he said in a news release.

PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued. To think, these 10 CEOs are so gifted that they command compensation  — in a single year — that is the rough equivalent of the gross domestic product of Grenada.

Put another way, if they pooled their annual pay for 2010 it would have exceeded:   
Heck, the CEOs’ collective booty totaled nearly one one-thousandth of the economic stimulus called for in President Obama’s $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out.

Kucinich based his claim about the 10 highest paid CEOs on a survey produced annually by a group called GMI, which tracks corporate governance. We looked at a summary of the report and found it to be on the level. The total for the combined compensation of the 10 highest paid CEOs on its list was $770,046,373.

Just to be clear, we note that the compensation these CEOs received was not all in the form of salary. Much of it came in the form of exercised stock options, deferred compensation and other benefits.

But to that, we say, so what? It is still compensation.

According to the survey, the highest paid CEO on the list is John Hammergren of health care giant McKesson Corp. of San Francisco. He exercised $112 million in stock options while getting a boost of $13.5 million in retirement benefits. His salary was but a measly $1.6 million.

And if he gets bounced from the company, he won’t be left wanting. If that were to happen, he stands to collect $469 million in severance pay.

The pay package didn’t sit well with GMI.

""Shareholders understand and expect that extraordinary compensation must be linked sufficiently to extraordinary performance,"" said GMI’s chief communications officer Paul Hodgson in a written statement. ""For that reason, they are increasingly frustrated about these clear failures of compensation governance.""

GMI also pointed out that in 2010, the total realized compensation for CEOs in the Standard & Poor’s 500 rose by a median of 36.5 percent.

""The 36.5 percent increase in realized compensation is particularly notable when it’s put in context of the modest growth of the economy in 2010 and general public company performance last year,"" Hodgson stated.

Kucinich’s staff provided a table from the Census Bureau to support the part of his claim about wage growth for average American workers.

It states that total compensation for civilian workers rose 2 percent in 2010. If just wages and salaries are included, the percentage drops to 1.6 percent.

So, on this point, Kucinich’s statement is pretty close. We note, though, that his statement used the word ""wage"" to describe the 2 percent increase. The 2 percent figure from the Census Bureau includes total compensation. But the real figure -- 1.6 percent -- would only strengthen his point.

Politifact Ohio is not trying to stoke the fire of class warfare by pointing out how much certain CEOs made in a year compared with the average worker. We’ll let Kucinich take the hit for that.

But as to his claim about the vast difference between the haves and the have-nots, he is pretty much on target.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kucinich’s claim True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/19/dennis-kucinich/dennis-kucinich-says-combined-top-ceo-pay-topped-7/

Rhode Island Democratic party says Republican Brendan Doherty flip-flopped on abortion in a little over a week
","
Opponents of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney have gained some traction by criticizing the former Massachusetts governor for flip-flopping on the abortion issue. So it shouldn't have been surprising that the Rhode Island Democratic Party would try to use the same tactic against Brendan Doherty, the Republican running for Congress in the 1st District against Democratic Rep. David Cicilline.

In a Jan. 11, 2012, news release about Doherty stumping for Romney in New Hampshire, the Democratic party's executive director, Stephanie DeSilva, contends, ""Romney and Doherty certainly have a lot in common, like flip-flopping on abortion -- in Doherty's case, in a little over a week.""

PolitiFact has already addressed the issue of whether Romney flip-flopped on abortion and found that it was True. For this item, we will look at Doherty's stance.

The news release from DeSilva doesn't say how Doherty's opinion has changed, only that it has.

So we e-mailed DeSilva. She responded that the information came from a June 1, 2011, web page on GoLocalProv.com headlined, ""Doherty Shifts Abortion Stance.""

""Just weeks after announcing his run for Congress, former State Police Supt. Brendan Doherty is already apparently changing his position on a key issue -- abortion,"" the story said.

GoLocalProv found that a May 31 position statement on DohertyForCongress.com was different from what had appeared eight days earlier.

And what was the change?

GoLocalProv says that the website said on May 23: ""Abortion - As always, I support the decision of the United States Supreme Court who [sic] has determined that abortions are a legal right. I am, however, personally pro-life.""

On May 31, GoLocalProv said, the statement had been changed to: ""Abortion - I am pro-life."" That's also what we saw when we checked Doherty's site on Jan. 12, 2012.

How significant is the rewording?

We realize that the terms ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice"" mean different things to different people. Some who call themselves pro-life reluctantly support abortion in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the mother's life. Some who call themselves pro-choice would never choose to have an abortion themselves or are opposed to partial birth abortion.

But few people who are staunch opponents of abortion rights would express any degree of support for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that abortions are a legal right. To them, the original language on Doherty's website would sound like double-speak.

When we contacted the Doherty campaign to talk to the candidate about the nuances -- if any -- about his abortion stand, we were told he was not available.

""The original language was found to be confusing to some people and was adjusted to clarify Brendan's position,"" said his political director, Robert Coupe. ""The website has stated consistently and accurately Brendan's position that he is pro-life.""

So why did he express support for the Supreme Court's ruling legalizing abortion?

""The original statement expressed Brendan's intent to abide by Supreme Court decisions on the issue,"" Coupe said. ""Throughout his career in law enforcement, Brendan [a former head of the Rhode Island State Police] had pledged to uphold the Constitution, which meant abiding by various Supreme Court rulings and I believe that perspective accounts for the 'as always' introductory phrase.""

To get a better idea where Doherty stands, we e-mailed the campaign to ask, if elected to Congress, would Doherty work to have the Supreme Court overturn Roe vs. Wade. Coupe's response: ""Brendan will remain consistent in his pro-life position.""

So where Doherty falls on the abortion spectrum -- whether he supports filing attempted murder charges against women who seek an abortion, whether he would endorse abortion in some cases, or whether he thinks the question has been settled -- remains a mystery because his campaign won't discuss specifics.

Our ruling

Stephanie DeSilva, executive director of the Rhode Island Democratic Party, said Doherty changed his position on abortion in a little over a week.

It is true that a change was made to the phrasing on his website.

His campaign removed an ambiguous statement that could be read as supporting the Supreme Court’s decision legalizing abortion. His spokesman said that wasn’t the statement’s intent -- but then refused to answer whether Doherty would work to overturn Roe vs. Wade.

On the other hand, Doherty clearly said he was ""pro-life,"" in both versions,  even if the Supreme Court reference would make staunch abortion opponents wary.

Because her statement ""is partially accurate but leaves out important details,"" we rule it Half True.
