Did Obamacare premiums double in most states this year? No
","The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the House-passed Republican health care bill would leave 23 million more Americans without insurance by 2026. Republicans counter that the situation with the Affordable Care Act is dire. ""Obamacare is collapsing. We must do something,"" Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said in a Facebook post May 24. ""This year, a majority of states are seeing premiums and costs double, including states that expanded Medicaid. Three states – Alaska, Alabama, and our own Oklahoma – are seeing premiums triple."" A PolitiFact reader thought that sounded high, so they asked us to take a look. What we found is that Lankford inartfully described the results of a study, which by itself has significant limitations.  Lankford uses problematic wording when he says that ""this year, a majority of states are seeing premiums and costs double."" We suspect that a reasonable person would interpret those words to mean that premiums doubled from one year to the next -- an undeniably worrisome prospect, if true. But that’s not correct, according to a report released May 23 by the office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services. This report appears to be the one Lankford is referring to because with one crucial exception, the numbers in his post fit with those in the report. The Health and Human Services study did find that in 25 of the 39 states studied, rates doubled (or more) over the period analyzed. But the period analyzed wasn’t the past year. In reality, the report compares premiums in 2013 -- a year before the Affordable Care Act took full effect -- to premiums in 2017. That’s a span of four years. We should also note that the HHS comparison looked at individually purchased policies, not employer-sponsored plans. Lankford did not note that distinction. But there are bigger concerns than the time frame -- namely, that the 2013 figure and the 2017 figure aren’t an apples-to-apples comparison. And what’s different about the numbers tend to make the premium increases look larger, and the Affordable Care Act look worse. • The 2017 figure ignores all subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Comparing premium levels in 2013 and 2017 ignores that most policyholders in 2017 were able to obtain subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Factoring that into the HHS study would have dropped the out-of-pocket cost for 2017. The difference can be substantial. Cynthia Cox, associate director for health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation, pointed to federal data showing that in Oklahoma -- Lankford’s home state -- the average plan on the marketplace cost $620 before subsidies and $79 after subsidies. In any case, the after-subsidy figure is what really matters for the consumer, not the published rate they never have to pay. • The comparison doesn't take into account that, due to the Affordable Care Act, plans in 2017 covered more than plans in 2013 did. One explanation for why premiums rose between 2013 and 2017 is that the Affordable Care Act required all plans to cover certain basic services that were not mandatory previously. But comparing it the way the Health and Human Services study does doesn’t indicate that the purchaser was getting added benefits for their added outlays. For instance, ""prescription drugs were often excluded from nongroup coverage pre-2013, or offered in only a very limited way,"" said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. ""People wanting drug coverage were considered high risk. Since drugs are covered under (Affordable Care Act) plans, and since prescription drug costs are the fastest growing component of health costs in recent years, this difference in coverage makes the comparison increasingly inappropriate."" • The comparison ignores the impact of the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that insurers cover people with preexisting conditions. It’s easier to keep down premiums if insurers are allowed to exclude the most expensive potential patients, as was the case in 2013 but not 2017. ""Pre-(Affordable Care Act) premiums were low because people with pre-existing conditions were denied coverage or charged deterrent rates, and insurer rating practices also made it more difficult for sick people to renew and maintain their coverage,"" Cox said. And, we should add, the low premiums from 2013 wouldn’t have helped someone with pre-existing conditions at all. • The universe of plans studied changed between 2013 and 2017. To understand this particular difference, we should first explain that individual insurance is one of the major categories of insurance -- the one in which people buy policies on their own, as opposed to getting it provided through their job or from the government (as is the case with Medicaid or Medicare). Today, some people in the individual insurance market buy their insurance on the healthcare.gov marketplaces that were set up under the Affordable Care Act. Some, however, still buy their individual plans outside of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. It’s not a trivial percentage: One estimate published in the journal Health Affairs found that 40 percent of individual-market plans were sold off the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. These plans were not considered in the Health and Human Services study. In addition, the Health and Human Services study only looked at Affordable Care Act marketplaces run by the federal government, not those run by the states on their own. This matters, Cox said, because states that run their own exchanges have seen lower-than-average premium growth, in part because the customer base for their marketplaces have tended to be healthier. So, if the study had looked at state-run marketplaces, not just the federal marketplaces, the premium figure for 2017 might have been lower.  Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed with the critiques listed here and said that the Affordable Care Act is ""not in a death spiral or collapsing."" Still, she added that problems with the marketplaces should not be overlooked. ""The markets are clearly still in churn. Insurance companies are still exiting and substantial premium increases being reported,"" she said.  Lankford’s communications director, D.J. Jordan, told PolitiFact that while ""the understanding of the phrase ‘this year’ is a nuanced technicality, the general message of the senator's social media post is accurate."" He said the Health and Human Services study documents a significant rise in premiums. ""These increases are burdensome to thousands of Oklahomans who have contacted our office, and that shouldn't be downplayed. Also, just because subsidies are available to some Americans doesn't mean that premium increases aren't problematic for many families,"" Jordan said. Lankford said, ""This year, a majority of states are seeing premiums and costs double"" under Obamacare. A recent Health and Human Services study found that individual-market premiums in many states had doubled -- but over four years, not ""this year."" But the comparison itself is flawed. It doesn’t reflect several significant issues that would paint a different picture, including federal subsidies that lower the out-of-pocket cost, coverage requirements that provide better benefits for the insured, and the possibility that people with pre-existing conditions could buy a plan at all. We rate Lankford’s statement False.

Samantha Bee says buying weed, tampering with an odometer or a lobster trap are felonies
","Comedian Samantha Bee traveled to Florida, where she says ""retirees and democracy go to die,"" to shed light on how the state makes it difficult for felons to regain the right to vote. On her TBS show Full Frontal on May 10, Bee spotlighted efforts by advocates to collect about 700,000 signatures to place a question on the 2018 ballot. The amendment, which would have to pass by 60 percent to be enacted, calls for restoring voting rights for felons automatically for those who have fully completed their sentences including parole or probation. That would not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses who would still have to ask the Cabinet to restore their rights, a process which is currently slow and cumbersome. In Florida, about 1.7 million felons have lost their right to vote. Bee portrayed some of those felonies as not so serious. ""In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap,"" Bee said. ""So basically spring break."" Bee’s big point: Felons in Florida aren’t just axe murderers. We will fact-check if the crimes Bee cited are felonies. A spokesman for Bee declined to comment on the record. Under the Florida Constitution, a convicted felon cannot vote, serve on a jury, or hold public office until civil rights have been restored. The policy stems back to the Jim Crow era. And that doesn’t only apply to violent offenses, said Randall Berg of the Florida Justice Institute. ""Any felony conviction in Florida, no matter how small or seemingly trivial, results in the loss of your civil rights,"" Berg said. There have been efforts on and off since the 1970s to make the process easier. But in 2011, Gov. Rick Scott and the members of the Florida Cabinet decided to make the process more cumbersome and set a minimum five-year waiting period. Through April 1, 2017, about 2,600 felons have gotten their rights restored since 2011, while more than 10,000 cases are pending. Bee cited three statutes that are felonies in Florida:   • 893.13 (2) (a) 2: This statute bans buying or possession with intent to sell drugs, including marijuana which is a third-degree felony. Possession of a small amount of cannabis -- less than 20 grams -- is a misdemeanor. • 319.35 (1) (a) tampering with an odometer: ""It is unlawful for any person knowingly to tamper with, adjust, alter, set back, disconnect, or fail to connect an odometer of a motor vehicle, or to cause any of the foregoing to occur to an odometer of a motor vehicle, so as to reflect a lower mileage than the motor vehicle has actually been driven..."" This is a third-degree felony. • 379.367 (4) disturbing a lobster trap: ""It is unlawful for any person willfully to molest any spiny lobster traps, lines, or buoys belonging to another without permission of the license holder."" This is a third-degree felony. While we were unable to find any data on how many people had lost their rights based on particular statutes, we did obtain conviction data for the statutes Bee cited from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Here are the convictions for those offenses between 2012 and 2016, which make up a tiny slice of all felony convictions in that period: •  Buying or possessing marijuana: 398 felony convictions with specification of marijuana. •  Messing with an odometer: 1 felony conviction •  Disturbing a lobster trap: 4 felony convictions Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, pointed to national data for 2006 that showed about 18 percent of felony convictions in state courts were for violent offenses. The majority of convictions were drug and property offenses. ""We tend to think of felonies as being represented in the prison population, but that's a skewed view that doesn't incorporate the more numerous people who are sentenced to some type of probation or community service,"" Mauer said. Bee interviewed one person who opposes automatic restoration of rights for felons generally: Roger Clegg, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. He has called for states to address restoration on a case-by-case basis. Clegg said that of course some crimes appear less serious than others, but the ones Bee cited are serious for the victims. For example, if someone sells a car that has 200,000 miles on it but has tampered with the odometer to show only 20,000 miles, that is cheating the buyer out of thousands of dollars. ""You can ask someone who makes his or her living as a lobster fisherman if it’s a trivial matter if someone ‘molests’ (the statute’s word) his or her traps,"" he said. Bee said, ""In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap. So basically spring break."" Bee is correct that these crimes are felonies on the books in Florida. Only a handful of felony convictions for tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap in recent years. The drug statute she cited resulted in about 400 felony convictions related to marijuana. For small amounts of marijuana, the crime is a misdemeanor. With that clarifying note, we rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA23F00>],/factchecks/2017/may/25/samantha-bee/samantha-bee-says-buying-weed-tampering-odometer-o/
"['Elections', 'Crime', 'Florida', 'Desmond Meade']","
Driving with suspended license can lead to loss of voting rights for felon, advocate says
","Desmond Meade, a convicted drug offender who later turned his life around and graduated from law school, is leading the effort in Florida to automatically restore voting rights to many felons. Meade’s effort to put a question on the Florida ballot got a major plug from comedian Samantha Bee, who used her TBS show Full Frontal on May 10 to highlight the topic of how felons struggle to regain civil rights in Florida. ""Ever since losing the popular vote, President (Donald) Trump has had his Underoos in a wad about 3 million people who voted illegally,"" Bee said, setting up her interview with Meade. ""They don't exist. What does exist is 6 million people whose right to vote has been taken away. To learn about them, I went to Florida, where retirees and democracy go to die."" Meade, from Orlando, told Bee that in Florida, 1.68 million felons have lost the right to vote. And some of those felonies are less serious than others. ""It doesn’t matter if it's a first degree or third degree. You could lose your rights for life over something as simple as driving with a suspended license,"" he said. ""Come on Florida,"" Bee replied, ""do you really want to be the Florida of everything?"" Meade has a point that not all the felonies that cost a person their right to vote are as egregious as murder or sexual assault. For this fact-check, we wanted to know if driving with a suspended license could really cost a Floridian his or her civil rights, and how often it happens. Restoration of rights for felons is a hot topic in Florida, a swing state where any significant changes to the voting population can have a big impact. Research in a few states has shown that more felons after being released from prison register as Democrats than Republicans. In April, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously approved language for a proposed amendment to restore voting rights to felons after they complete their sentences. The next hurdle for advocates including Meade is to collect about 700,000 signatures to place a question on the ballot in 2018. (Meade, a recovered drug addict, is among felons who have lost their civil rights: He served about three years in prison after a conviction for a 2001 firearm possession charge.) The proposed amendment calls for restoring voting rights for felons automatically once they have completed their sentences including parole or probation. Automatic restoration would not apply to felons convicted of murder or sexual offenses, who would still have to ask the Florida Cabinet and Gov. Rick Scott to restore their rights in a slow and cumbersome process. While the policy extends back to the Jim Crow era and makes Florida an outlier nationally, there have been efforts to make the process easier. In 2007 under then-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, felons convicted of less serious offenses could regain their rights without a hearing after finishing their sentences. However, in 2011, the Republican Cabinet, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Gov. Rick Scott scrapped that process and set a minimum of a five-year waiting period. Since 2011 through April 1, 2017, about 2,600 felons have gotten their rights restored while more than 10,000 cases are pending. That means that felons don’t necessarily lose their rights for the rest of their life, but it’s a long and cumbersome process and ultimately the Cabinet can deny restoring someone’s rights. The Florida Constitution (section 4a) states: ""No person convicted of a felony, or adjudicated in this or any other state to be mentally incompetent, shall be qualified to vote or hold office until restoration of civil rights or removal of disability."" That broadly applies to all types of felonies, experts said. ""Any felony conviction in Florida, no matter how small or seemingly trivial, results in the loss of your civil rights,"" said Randall Berg of the Florida Justice Institute. Meade sent PolitiFact the statute about the penalties for driving with a suspended license in Florida. The law states that a first or second offense is a misdemeanor but a third or subsequent conviction is a third-degree felony. We were unable to find any data on how many people had lost their rights based on particular statutes.  That makes it difficult to quantify which statutes most commonly, or infrequently, result in loss of rights. We were able to get data on the number of felony convictions for driving with a suspended license. There were 6,759 felony convictions between 2012 and 2016, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Advocates in favor of restoring rights to felons pointed to some other felonies that don’t exactly conjure up the image of threatening lawbreakers. Bee’s show highlighted some of those statutes, such as tampering with a lobster trap or an odometer -- both felonies, although they rarely result in convictions. Take the case, for example, of the man a state trooper said violated a rarely-prosecuted felony pollution statute when Anthony Brasfield released a dozen heart-shaped balloons in Broward around Valentine’s Day in 2013. Broward prosecutors didn’t file a case based on that statute, in part because prosecutors thought the jury would likely see this as a romantic gesture rather than a criminal act. Brasfield ultimately pled guilty to a lesser offense: a misdemeanor for driving while his license was suspended. Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, pointed to a few additional felony statutes, including knowingly presenting a counterfeit or altered state lottery ticket or trespassing on posted commercial horticultural property  Meade said, ""It doesn’t matter if it's a first degree or third degree. You could lose your rights for life over something as simple as driving with a suspended license,"" he said. The Florida Constitution says people convicted of felonies cannot vote until their civil rights are restored, a process that takes years after felons complete their sentences and is ultimately up to the Florida Cabinet and governor. Meade omits an important caveat about the Florida statute specifically about driving with a suspended license: the first and second convictions are misdemeanors, so the crime only becomes a felony upon the third or subsequent conviction. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF0DB40>],/factchecks/2017/may/25/desmond-meade/driving-suspended-license-can-lead-loss-voting-rig/

Conservative group's ad misleads about pre-existing conditions in GOP health care bill
","A political group backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan has come to the aid of fellow Republicans who voted for their party’s Affordable Health Care Act. The American Action Network has launched two weeks of ads in 21 House districts that could face competitive races in 2018 because members voted for the bill May 4, including U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Miami and U.S. Rep. Brian Mast of the Treasure Coast. The politically conservative group has spent $5.6 million on TV, digital and radio advertising campaigns since the House passed the legislation. The ads, which will also run on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, are narrated by a mom who says her family lost their insurance and doctor because of the Affordable Care Act. ""But now, we have hope,"" she says. ""House Republicans are keeping their word and fixing our broken health care system: more competition and choices resulting in lower costs and better coverage. Families get tax credits to make insurance cheaper, and people with pre-existing conditions are protected. Thank Congressman Carlos Curbelo for fighting for the better health care we deserve."" While AHCA has some language that is intended to protect those with pre-existing conditions, health care experts have previously told us that the legislation would allow insurance companies to charge more for people with pre-existing conditions. We contacted the American Action Network’s spokeswoman but did not get a reply. The Affordable Care Act adopted in 2010 prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage — or charging higher premiums — because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. The American Health Care Act, as passed by the House, does not approach pre-existing conditions the same way. The literal language of an amendment appears to protect those with pre-existing conditions. It states that ""nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions."" Here’s the issue: That language says insurers have to provide access for those with pre-existing conditions. It says nothing about the costs for those patients. The legislation permits insurers to set premiums based on the ""health status"" of an individual by looking at their current and past health status and making a guess as to how they will use medical care in the future. That means the costs would rise for consumers who are sicker, said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University School of Law emeritus professor. ""Health status underwriting is literally charging a higher (possibly much, unaffordably, higher) premium to people with pre-existing conditions,"" Jost said. ""Under the MacArthur amendment, they could not be refused coverage, but insurers could impose high enough premiums that coverage would be unaffordable."" The exact amount might differ regionally, as some states might not allow the higher rates. The legislation would allow states to obtain waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including the ""essential health benefits."" The waiver would allow states to set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new federal invisible risk-sharing program to help states reimburse insurers for covering high-risk consumers.   Republicans argue that the high-risk pools will protect those consumers with pre-existing conditions.  (Curbelo’s spokeswoman sent us a copy of the Republican talking points that make that argument.) To sweeten the legislation for Republicans on the fence before the vote, the GOP added in more money for those risk pools. In states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status. However, many low-income people aren’t able to stay covered without breaks, and questions remain about the effectiveness of the high-risk pools. Many analysts believe the law would still leave those people more vulnerable to cost increases that could make their plans unaffordable. An ad by the American Action Network says that under the American Health Care Act ""people with pre-existing conditions are protected."" The only kernel of truth here is that the amendment has language that states insurers can’t limit access to coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. However, the ad omits that the House GOP health plan would weaken protections for these patients. The legislation would allow states to give insurers the power to charge people significantly more if they had a pre-existing condition. While Republicans point to the fact that those patients could get help through high-risk pools, experts question their effectiveness. Current law does not allow states to charge people with pre-existing conditions significantly more. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBF3500>],/factchecks/2017/may/24/american-action-network/conservative-groups-ad-misleads-about-pre-existing/

Trump goes a bit overboard with icebreaker claim
","President Donald Trump told new graduates of the Coast Guard Academy that his administration is working hard to make the military branch’s job easier. In his speech at the academy’s commencement on May 17, Trump said his administration will be investing in icebreakers in a way the country hasn’t done in a while. ""I’m proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years,"" Trump said. Trump’s statement suggested his administration was the driver behind this project. He’s right about the four-decade gap, but it takes a long time to build a big ship (it’s just one -- not plural as he said) and the plan for this ship has been underway for some time. An icebreaker can carve a path through thick sheets of ice in frozen regions of the world or to access research stations in the Arctic. The bigger the ship, the thicker the ice it can handle. The United States has just one active heavy polar icebreaker, the Polar Star, which entered service in 1976. At a speed of 3 knots it can break through ice as thick as 21 feet. A similar ship was mothballed after its engined died in 2010 In addition to the Polar Star, the country has medium icebreaker, Healy, and the National Science Foundation operates a small icebreaker named Palmer. The construction of a new, heavy icebreaker would indeed be the first for the United States in four decades, said Magnus Nordenman, director of the Transatlantic Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council’s Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security. Trump left out a key fact: The process of building a new heavy icebreaker for the Coast Guard began before he took office. The U.S. Coast Guard told us the work began in earnest during President Barack Obama’s second term. ""The time needed to build a new icebreaker can anywhere be between 5 to 10 years,"" said Sherri Goodman, a former defence official and senior fellow with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. The Coast Guard included it in its 2012-13 budget submission, according to the Congressional Research Service. The project received about $15.6 million through FY 2016. In FY 2017, Congress gave the Coast Guard $25 million to manage the project and $150 million went to the Navy to start the design and construction process. Right now, actual building is slated to start in 2020 and if all goes well, the ship will launch in 2023. Trump said, ""I’m proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years."" He has a point that the heavy icebreaker being built is the first  since the 1970s. If all goes according to schedule, construction will begin in 2020 with delivery in 2023. That puts the building phase within his first term, but as with any large project, the timeline can slip. Regardless, this has been an ongoing project that has been receiving funding from the government since 2013. Trump’s statement implied that the efforts to build the icebreaker came from his administration when in fact it was already in progress before he took office.

Persistent story about NASA paying people $18,000 to lie in bed and smoke ganja is fake
","An online story that claimed NASA pays people thousands to smoke marijuana in bed for months is actually a viral legend that has been in orbit for quite awhile now. ""NASA will pay you $18,000 to stay in bed and smoke weed for 70 straight days,"" read the headline on a Jan. 2, 2017, post on TheSolExchange.com, a blog that is largely concerned with the latest developments in athletic sneakers. Judging by the number of commenters asking to be signed up, there also is an audience for marijuana studies. Facebook users flagged this post as possibly being fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to fight fake news in users’ social media feeds. ""NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their ‘Rest Studies’ – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD,"" the post read. ""During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week."" There are more details on the post, but you get the gist. We found versions of the same story on several other blogs going back to at least March 2016, all claiming NASA is doling out the big bucks for people who want to lounge all day and spark up. Pretty good hustle, right? Except it’s not true. Well, it’s true that NASA does perform bed rest studies. The goal is to examine the potential effects of weightlessness on astronauts, and lying in bed with your head tilted down at a six-degree angle is apparently a fair substitute. The studies sound pretty much as described at TheSolExchange.com — except for the cannabis part. Several media outlets like the Houston Chronicle, Forbes, Vice and CBS News have written in the past about the studies, which involve people getting paid something on the order of $1,200 per week for 15 weeks (that’s $18,000) to hang out in bed. But it’s not all that great of a time, from the sound of it. Boredom is a constant problem, as every moment of a volunteer’s life is spent in bed for that time. Scientists continually poke and prod them, taking readings and measurements on everything from weight to bone density. Volunteers are told when and what to eat, and have to do everything in bed. That means eating, exercising, showering and even, yes, using the facilities while lying down. A NASA spokesman told us that there have not been any sleep studies that involved consuming cannabis. There also aren’t any more sleep studies currently planned, so it’s not like NASA is suddenly going to try it the next time. Blog posts that have been saying that NASA is paying subjects $18,000 to lie in bed and smoke marijuana for 70 days are pretty far out.

Did first-time use of photo ID cause 200,000 drop in Wisconsin voter turnout in presidential race?
","As they have for years, claims of voter suppression continue to be made by Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. When President Donald Trump signed an order to create a commission to study voter fraud, Moore attacked its vice chairman as having ""led numerous voter suppression initiatives against minorities."" Five days later, on May 17, 2017, Baldwin made this declaration on Twitter: Voter turnout in 2016 was reduced by approx. 200,000 votes because of WI’s photo ID laws. We’ve rated Mostly True a claim by TV show host John Oliver that in Sauk City, Wis., the office that provides identification for voting was open only four days in 2016. But on a claim closer to Baldwin’s, we rated False tweets that said ""300,000 voters were turned away"" by Wisconsin’s voter ID law in the 2016 presidential election. A federal judge had determined that some 300,000 registered voters lacked the necessary ID to vote, but there was no evidence that anywhere near that number of people were turned away from the polls. What about Baldwin’s claim? What voter ID is about Thirty-four states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, according to the nonprofit National Conference of State Legislatures. Wisconsin is among seven states that have a strict requirement -- voters without acceptable identification must vote on a provisional ballot and also take additional steps after election day for their vote to be counted. As the group puts it: Proponents see increasing requirements for identification as a way to prevent in-person voter impersonation and increase public confidence in the election process. Opponents say there is little fraud of this kind, and the burden on voters unduly restricts the right to vote and imposes unnecessary costs and administrative burdens on elections administrators. A few days before Baldwin made her statement, the Associated Press reported on examples of Wisconsin residents who said they couldn’t get the ID they needed to vote in the 2016 presidential election -- the first presidential contest in which the state’s ID law was in place. But the story said it is unknown how many people did not vote because they didn’t have proper identification. Baldwin’s evidence To back Baldwin’s claim, her campaign cited a report issued two weeks earlier. It’s worth noting who was behind it. The report was commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and describes itself as a ""voter-centric progressive advocacy organization"" that is ""committed to standing up to the Trump administration and its allies."" The group says its ""voter suppression analysis"" is part of an effort to ""glean lessons that can be applied to strengthen Democrats in elections in 2018, 2020 and beyond."" The report was conducted by CIVIS USA, a Chicago firm founded by the chief analytics officer of the 2012 Obama campaign team. The report compares the 2012 and 2016 elections. It says that on average, turnout increased 1.3 percent in states in which there was no change to voter ID laws, but decreased 3.3 percent in Wisconsin. The report concludes that had there been no voter ID in Wisconsin, turnout would have risen by 1.3 percent -- or 200,000 voters -- over the 2012 total. (Although it doesn’t affect the rating of Baldwin’s claim, the report also argues, based on other data, that the 200,000 people it refers to ""would have been more Democratic,"" and notes that Clinton lost to Trump in Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes.) Ignoring other factors Roughly 3 million votes were cast in each of the last three presidential elections in Wisconsin. As we’ve noted, the 2016 turnout was lower than 2012, when Obama won reelection and there was no voter ID requirement. On the other hand, the 2016 turnout was higher than when Obama was first elected in 2008 and, again, there was no voter ID law. More importantly, according to experts, the methodology of the report Baldwin cites is lacking. Put simply: The voter ID requirement undoubtedly prevented or discouraged some people from voting. But the report attributes all of the decrease in turnout to the ID law, when there are many other reasons that could also explain it, including a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton or Trump, or perhaps a belief that Trump couldn’t win Wisconsin. ""The story is getting picked up by Democrats and left-leaning smart people across social media because it confirms what they already think,"" University of California, Irvine law and political science professor Rick Hasen wrote on his election law blog. ""But there is reason for considerable caution about this study, which is at odds with what other studies of the effect of Wisconsin’s voter ID has found. There are questions about the study’s methodology being raised by people who know their stuff."" Yale University political science professor Eitan Hersh tweeted: ""No offense, but this is something that is going to be shared hundreds of times and does not meet acceptable evidence standards."" Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us there’s simply no way to put a number on how many people didn’t vote because of the voter ID law. Bucknell University political science professor Lindsay Nielson has done research finding that voter ID laws lower minority turnout and benefit the Republican Party. But as for the voter turnout decline in Wisconsin, ""there could be a multitude of other reasons"" why voters stayed home, she told us. ""Voter ID laws could very well have been suppressing voter turnout in Wisconsin,"" but ""we just can’t say it’s 200,000 people. We need a lot more research before we can draw that conclusion."" Baldwin campaign spokesman Scott Spector responded by saying ""there is no reason to question the (CIVIS) study or believe other factors were involved,"" because of one of the findings in a September 2014 by the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office. But that finding didn't look at the 2016 election and involved two different states. The GAO found turnout between the 2008 and 2012 elections declined more in Kansas and Tennessee than in states that did not change voter ID requirements -- by an estimated 1.9 to 2.2 percentage points more in Kansas and 2.2 to 3.2 percentage points more in Tennessee — and the results ""were attributable to changes in those two states’ voter ID requirements."" Our rating Baldwin says: ""Voter turnout in 2016 was reduced by approx. 200,000 votes because of WI’s photo ID laws."" A report she cites from a Democratic candidate-supporting group says a decline in voter turnout between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections in Wisconsin was entirely due to the state’s new photo identification requirement for voting. But experts say that while photo ID requirements reduces turnout to some extent, they question the methodology of the report and say there is no way to put a number on how many people in Wisconsin didn’t vote because of the ID requirement.  We rate Baldwin’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E8A3D940>],/factchecks/2017/may/24/tammy-baldwin/photo-id-law-caused-200000-drop-wisconsin-voter-tu/

Was 2016 'one of the deadliest years ever' for police officers in the US?
","Announcing his support for a national pro-police bill, North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis cited an eye-catching statistic. Only a few years in U.S. history, he said, were more deadly for police than 2016. ""Last year was one of the deadliest years ever for law enforcement officers, a stark reminder that these men and women go to work every day not knowing whether they’ll return home safely to their families,"" Tillis said Friday, when he co-sponsored the bill. ""Our law enforcement officers risk their lives to protect ours, and the Back the Blue Act will enact new laws that offer them much-needed support and will make criminals think twice before targeting them,"" he continued, in an official press release. The Back The Blue Act proposes several notable changes. It would create stricter penalties for people who assault police officers, making it a federal crime subject to mandatory minimum sentences and, in some cases, the death penalty – which would fulfill a campaign promise President Donald made about cop-killers. It would also limit people’s ability to sue police officers for abuse. And for those who could still sue, the bill cuts down on how much money they could receive if the police are found guilty. However, the crux of the claim Tillis made to support the bill – that ""last year was one of the deadliest years ever for law enforcement officers"" – is not accurate. Whether you look at total deaths, or violent deaths only, or the percentage of officers killed, the numbers show 2016 was actually one of the least deadly years in modern history. ""It's still more dangerous to be a cop than it is not to be a cop,"" said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who now researches anti-police violence and teaches at the University of South Carolina’s law school. ""But … to say that this is the most dangerous time for officers is just woefully uninformed."" After we asked what numbers Tillis was citing, his office didn't defend the claim but did question why we would fact-check him. ""Losing one police officer is one too many,"" Tillis spokesman Daniel Keylin said. ""... Senator Tillis will continue to do everything in his power to support North Carolina’s law enforcement community and recognize the daily sacrifices they make."" In the past, Tillis has advocated for criminal justice reforms like less harsh sentencing laws – in North Carolina and nationwide. Total deaths One way to measure how deadly a year has been for police is to look at the total number of deaths. Another is felonious killings, which is the term for the killing of a police officer by a criminal while in the line of duty. Felonious killings are what people tend to think of when they hear about a deadly time for law enforcement. They make the national news – ambushes, traffic stops gone bad, a suspect getting the upper hand in a fight. Those are included in the number of total deaths, which also includes on-duty accidental deaths like car crashes, heart attacks or falls, and off-duty deaths from causes like illness or suicide. In a previous fact-check, we looked into a comparison of Prohibition and the War on Drugs, which claimed they’ve been equally deadly for police. We ruled that Mostly False. Here’s an graph, from that previous fact-check, of total annual police deaths from 1900 to now: It shows that fewer officers died in 2016 than most other years in the 20th and 21st centuries. More police officers died in 1916 (164) than in 2016 (143). So by that metric, Tillis is way off. But what about violent deaths? Felonious killings Data specifying the number of police officers killed by criminals started in the 1970s, which is also when the War on Drugs began. And again, Tillis is wrong. 2016 saw 66 officers shot, stabbed or otherwise killed by a criminal – which is less than half the number of killings in several other years. ""Senator Tillis is way off,"" Stoughton said. ""It is an unmitigated tragedy that 66 officers were feloniously killed in 2016, but that number is nowhere near the historic high."" In fact – and this is good news for current officers – 2016’s violent death toll was about 10 deaths below the average for the last half-century. Even though more police were killed in 2016 than in much of the 2000s, there were fewer officers killed last year than in nearly every year in the 1970s, ‘80s and ‘90s. Rate of killings When we consider the percentage of officers killed, the decline in anti-police violence is even more striking – from more than 30 deaths per 100,000 officers in the late 1970s, to around 17 in the 1980s, to about 6 or 7 now. ""We have close to twice as many officers and half as many deaths,"" Stoughton said. There’s no authoritative count yet on the number of police officers in the United States in 2016, so it’s impossible to calculate an exact rate. But it’s safe to say Tillis is almost certainly wrong by this measure, too. We know 66 officers were killed in 2016, and we know there were at least 635,000 officers in the U.S. in 2015. So unless half of the nation’s cops (or more) were laid off last year, there’s no way the rate of officers killed in 2016 would even be at the low end of the violence in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Instead, if the number of police officers rose by a few thousand in 2016, as happened in the few years prior, the rate for 2016 would be about 10 officer deaths per 100,000. If that happens, then 2016 will have been more deadly for police than other recent years, yet still safer than any year between 1975 and 1995. Our ruling Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said a new pro-police law is needed because 2016 ""was one of the deadliest years ever for law enforcement officers."" That’s wrong. In fact, 2016 saw a below-average number and rate of officer deaths compared to the last half-century. The 66 officers killed in 2016 pales in comparison to the 1970s and 1980s, and wasn’t much different from the typical year in the 1990s, either.

Trump calling KFC’s Col. Sanders a Civil War hero was a parody site’s story
","A story that said President Donald Trump praised Kentucky Fried Chicken’s founder for saving Civil War troops from starvation at Valley Forge flunks the truth test. Let’s do our own history lesson here: A May 2, 2017, post at TheRedShtick.com carried the headline, ""Donald Trump praises Colonel Sanders for his service in the Civil War."" The story was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The story played off a controversial comment Trump made on May 1 about former President Andrew Jackson, whom Trump readily admires.   During an interview on Sirius XM’s P.O.T.U.S. channel, Trump told the Washington Examiner's Salena Zito, ""I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, 'There's no reason for this.' "" Trump drew criticism for the incident because his words neglect the fact that Jackson was a slave owner. TheRedShtick.com used an excerpt from a May 1 New York Times story about the flap, then went off on its own invented tangent. The post said Trump told their intern, Dave Robicheaux, that Col. Harland Sanders, the founder of the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant chain, was a ""tremendous Civil War hero.""   ""Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter,"" the post read. ""Robicheaux attempted to explain to Trump that Col. Sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that The Donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a Biblical story about Jesus feeding the multitudes, and that Valley Forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the Civil War."" It should be pretty obvious that this story is more than a bit contrived, starting with the name of the post’s author, Manny Schewitz. (For the record, Trump does like the occasional KFC bucket.) People coming to the story would certainly realize the post is fake if they visited the web pages’ About Us section. It says TheRedShtick.com is ""a bold and engaging source of satire and irreverent humor."" It said the site is a digital descendant of the defunct Red Shtick Magazine, formerly ""the only print satirical publication in Louisiana’s capital city"" of Baton Rouge (French for Red Stick). The print magazine ended in 2012, the site said. There is a RedShtickMagazine.com, that carries similar graphics to TheRedShtick.com, but the two sites post different content. The magazine site appears to carry unrelated, intermittent blog posts about Thailand-centric issues and events, as far as we can tell. Neither site makes its registration information public, but TheRedShtick.com publisher Jeremy White told us the publication once used the magazine’s domain name, but gave it up after going digital. As for the Sanders story, White said that it should be obvious that it’s fabricated, but these days satire can be difficult to distinguish from reality. ""We earnestly endeavor to distinguish ourselves from peddlers of fake news — devoid of any real humor or any attempt to speak truth to power — who publish their fiction under the guise of satire,"" White said. ""They only muddy our national discourse in the pursuit of easy clicks."" Either way, Facebook readers should flag TheRedShtick.com as a satirical website and avoid it as a news source.

Trump's commission vice chair Kris Kobach says immigration data not bounced against voter rolls
","Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who will help lead President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission, says the federal government has data on millions of legal noncitizens ineligible to vote, but it has never compared its rosters to state voter rolls. Kobach told Fox News he wants to change that as part of his role as vice chair of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, headed by Vice President Mike Pence. ""The Department of Homeland Security knows of the millions of aliens who are in the United States legally and that’s data that's never been bounced against the state's voter rolls to see whether these people are registered,"" Kobach, a Republican, told Fox News May 14. Kobach later continued. ""So, one thing that's never been done before, that I alluded to earlier, is the Department of Homeland Security has a database of all known aliens, green card holders, temporary visas holders in the United States. And that has never been bounced against a state’s voter rolls to say well, hey, how many of these people, with this name, this date of birth, so you can get an exact match. How many of them are registered to vote in state A or state B?"" Kobach’s comments struck us as misleading, because of the widespread publicity about the problems Florida faced when attempting to use federal data to search for noncitizen voters. The only DHS data we know of that includes these legal immigrants is Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE. SAVE has been used in a handful for states precisely for the purpose of weeding out ineligible voters. But when it was tried in Florida under Republican Gov. Rick Scott, it created so many problems that it was scrapped in 2012. Kobach didn’t refer to SAVE by name on Fox News, and his spokeswoman didn’t directly answer our question as to whether that was the data he was meant. But there’s no other database of legal immigrants that we know of that could be compared to voter rolls.   Implemented in 1987, SAVE provides government officials access to various databases, usually so various agencies can verify the citizenship status of an individual to determine eligibility for benefits such as Medicaid or Social Security. (This is not a database of illegal immigrants, such a full list doesn’t exist.) SAVE has access to records on noncitizens who have been processed by federal agencies. For that reason, SAVE later became used by a few states for voter registration purposes. Which places use SAVE? Election officials in Florida, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia and several Arizona counties have reached agreements with DHS to use SAVE, but they aren’t necessarily active users. In fiscal year 2016, less than 1 percent of 20 million SAVE queries were for voter registration (or about 920). Florida’s 2012 attempt shows why a state might decide to change course. Florida election officials briefly used SAVE as part of a voter-purge effort. But doing so led to many errors, including wrongly identifying some citizens as noncitizens including four Polk County residents born in Puerto Rico, which automatically qualifies them for U.S. citizenship.  Yeral Arroliga, an immigrant from Nicaragua, was flagged as a noncitizen despite telling the Miami Herald he provided proof of citizenship. State election officials ultimately scrapped using SAVE. State election officials in Georgia and Virginia also told PolitiFact that they no longer use the system. Colorado and North Carolina, however, still do. Federal warnings said SAVE isn’t foolproof The Homeland Security Department under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama has cautioned states about relying too much on the system for voter registration purposes. Some state election officials including Kobach’s spokeswoman, Samantha Poetter, has said SAVE isn’t useful for voter registration purposes because the federal government puts too many restrictions on its use. For state election officials to use SAVE, they need a person’s alien registration number or a naturalization certificate or certificate of citizenship -- information that election officials don’t typically have. ""SAVE access has not been granted in a meaningful way to any state,"" Kobach’s spokeswoman Samantha Poetter said. ""The state must already possess an alien number assigned by the federal government."" While some states have said SAVE isn’t useful to them, others have found workarounds. Colorado and North Carolina election officials told PolitiFact that they obtain information from drivers license records. A driver’s license shows that applicants are not citizens and then check to see if they registered to vote. If they obtain a match, then they run the person through SAVE. A match isn’t definitive -- because the information may be out of date. That’s why even a match in SAVE requires additional steps to determine if someone is not a citizen and therefore ineligible to vote. North Carolina’s post-2016 election audit showed that 41 noncitizens with legal status, such as a green card, cast ballots. The audit identified an additional 34 voters who provided documents showing they are U.S. citizens, and investigators continue to review 61 additional records. That’s out of a total of nearly 4.8 million voters who participated in the November election. Virginia election officials found SAVE wasn’t useful because the state doesn’t have the alien numbers. However, Virginia uses another method: the names of those who check a box on a driver’s license form indicating they are not citizens is run against the voter registration list.  If that produces a match, it is forwarded to a local registrar who sends letters to the voters. The current system works, Virginia's top elections official Edgardo Cortés said. ""Overall the processes states have in place -- the checks we have in the system with all the data sharing going on  -- we are able to identify folks who at some point are not supposed to be on the list and get them off,""  Cortés said. Our ruling Kobach says the Department of Homeland Security’s database of legal immigrants has ""never"" been ""bounced against a state’s voter rolls."" There is a kernel of truth here, in that there has not been a widespread comparison of federal government data on immigrants and voter rolls in all the states to search for noncitizen voters. However, Kobach misleads when he said that it has never been tried. A handful of states have used federal information about immigrants in SAVE to check voter eligibility. Some of them encountered issues with the system and have chosen not to keep using it. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB89F380>],/factchecks/2017/may/23/kris-kobach/trumps-election-commission-chair-kris-kobach-says-/

False: McCaskill says 1 Mar-a-Lago trip could fund Missouri meals on wheels for 2 years
","Democrats are criticizing President Donald Trump for proposed budget cuts to social programs. They also aren’t happy how Trump often spends his weekends away from the White House visiting one of his properties. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., put the two criticisms together recently. ""The thing that I'm most disappointed about so far, and this is a little thing, but Trump's budget cut the meals on wheels program. Completely, gone,"" McCaskill said at an April 14, 2017, town hall.  ""If we are not doing meals on wheels, it is cutting off our nose to spite our face, because the people who can't get nutrition at home and don’t stay well end up in a nursing home, and you end up paying the bill, so meals and wheels is a small investment,"" McCaskill said. ""If Donald Trump would stay home from Mar-a-Lago one weekend, if he would stay home from Mar-a-Lago for one weekend, it would pay the entire meals and wheels budget for the state of Missouri for almost two years. One weekend.""  McCaskill continued. ""So, if he -- he has not called me ever -- and there hasn't been a particular reach out to me ... but if he did, I would say you know what I would do if I were you, it'd be a really smart idea. I would announce on a Friday I'm not going to Mar-a-Lago, and this week I’m going to make sure that the money that we would've spent, the $3 million that we would've spent goes to the meals on wheels program in Tennessee or in Kansas, or in how about Missouri."" Trump's budget proposal would cut $192 billion from federal nutritional assistance programs, the New York Times has reported. The question of this fact-check is: Would one fewer trip to Mar-a-Lago save Missouri's meals on wheels programs for two years? Pinning down the cost of a trip to Mar-a-Lago is difficult. As PolitiFact has previously reported, the closest thing we have is a 2016 Government Accountability Office report detailing the costs of a 2013 trip taken by President Barack Obama. The trip was four days from Chicago to Palm Beach, Fla., and cost $3.6 million. But the author of that report has said it should not be used to estimate the cost of Trump’s travel to Florida. ""We wouldn’t recommend substituting the numbers from President Obama’s trip to any other trip,"" Brian Lepore, director of defense capabilities and management at GAO, told PolitiFact in April. (We rated a fact-check saying Trump's trips cost $3.6 million Half True.) When the president travels, generally several military aircraft are involved. These include Air Force One, carrying the president, his entourage and guests, cargo planes packing motorcade limousines and other equipment, and aircraft to transport personnel who conduct security sweeps before the president arrives. This is the main driver of presidential travel costs. Air Force One alone costs nearly $180,000 per hour of flight as of 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service. The GAO report found that total air and boat support accounted for more than 85 percent of the $3.6 million spent on Obama’s 2013 trip. But these costs change significantly from trip to trip, so it’s hard to nail down the average cost. For example, a president could take two identical weekend trips to Palm Beach, both trips requiring a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. But one trip could cost a good deal more than the other depending on where the C-130 has to fly in from. Military logistics could mean that one week it comes from Delaware, the next from Texas. Or, if the president’s event schedule for one of the Palm Beach weekends requires a helicopter, an additional or bigger plane might be necessary to transport the helicopter. Another group has estimated Trump's trips to Florida have cost much less. Judicial Watch, a conservative group, said public records show that two Trump weekend Mar-a-Lago trips cost $1.28 million. The authority on the matter, the GAO, has accepted a request to examine the costs of Trump’s Mar-A-Lago trips. Unfortunately that report isn’t available yet. While there are difficulties estimating the cost of a trip to Mar-A-Lago, McCaskill’s bigger issue is with how she discussed Missouri's meals on wheels budget. Meals on wheels is a catch-all term for companies or organizations that provide nutrion assistance to low-income people, primarily seniors. Meals on Wheels is one specific organization that provides delivered meals, but it's only one. McCaskill spokeswoman Sarah Feldman said McCaskill was speaking specifically about one federal funding source, Community Development Block Grants. The block grants help fund nutrition assistance programs in five Missouri cities: St. Louis, St. Charles, St. Peters, St. Joseph and Independence. In fiscal year 2016, grants for home-delivered meals totaled $356,900. Spread over two years, that's a total of $713,800. What's not clear from McCaskill's comments, however, is that meals on wheels programs in Missouri include much larger funding streams. Jenny Bertolette, spokeswoman for Meals on Wheels America, said the main source of funding for meals on wheels is the Older Americans Act. That program provided about $10.5 million in federal funding for meal assistance in Missouri, according to a 2017 fact sheet (the figures are from 2014).  That's way more -- in one year -- than any estimate for a Mar-a-Lago trip. And the Older Americans Act isn't the only source of funding.  For instance, Meals on Wheels of Greater St. Louis, says it does not receive any government funding. Yet it spent nearly $340,000 in 2013 on program expenses, according to required government filings. McCaskill said that if Trump stayed home from Mar-a-Lago for one weekend, then it would pay for the cost of meals on wheels in Missouri for two years. We don't know how much it costs for Trump to visit Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. A GAO report said it cost $3.6 million for Obama to take a four-day, two-city trip in 2013, but the author of that report said that figure should not be used to make other estimates. Another group pegged the cost much lower. More problematic, McCaskill only looked at Community Development Block Grants when considering the cost of home-delivered meal programs in Missouri. The comparison falls apart entirely when you look at a fuller set of funding streams. We rate this claim False. Update (5 p.m. May 23): This post was updated to include additional comments from McCaskill. The rating remains unchanged.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD96140>],/factchecks/2017/may/23/claire-mccaskill/false-mccaskill-says-1-mar-lago-trip-could-fund-mi/

The baseless claim that slain DNC staffer Seth Rich gave emails to WikiLeaks
","It’s been several months since the intelligence community concluded Russia tampered in the election, including stealing Democratic Party emails and giving them to WikiLeaks. Yet an unfounded conspiracy theory persists: that WikiLeaks actually got the emails from a Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot and killed in July 2016. Seth Rich, who worked on voter access projects for the DNC, was 27 when he was killed early in the morning near his Washington home. Ten months later, the case remains unsolved, though Washington police have said they believe it was likely a botched robbery. WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of internal DNC emails several days after Rich died, leading conspiracy theorists to speculate that the two events were related. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich’s murder. The story is back in the news because on May 15, a private investigator looking into Rich’s case said he had evidence to prove the theorists right. But the investigator, a man named Rod Wheeler, backtracked on his claims the next day, and the Rich family has sent him a cease-and-desist letter, saying their son was not WikiLeaks’ source. Even so, some right-wing pundits continue to peddle this conspiracy, most prominently on Fox News. Among them are host Sean Hannity and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. ""We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments,"" Gingrich said on Fox May 21. ""Nobody’s investigating that, and what does that tell you about what was going on? Because it turns out, it wasn’t the Russians."" Contrary to Gingrich’s statement, the thin case that Rich was the DNC leaker is in no way substantial enough to outweigh ample evidence that Russia was the culprit. Two days after Gingrich made this claim, Fox News retracted its report promoting this conspiracy theory. The latest iteration of this story started when Wheeler spoke to a reporter with Washington local news station WWTG-TV on May 15. Wheeler worked for the Washington police in the 1990s and is an occasional Fox News contributor. Texas businessman Ed Butowsky, another Fox News contributor, is financing Wheeler’s investigation. Wheeler told WWTG-TV he believes the local police and the FBI are engaged in a cover-up because of information found on Rich’s laptop and the relationship between the Washington mayor’s office and the DNC. ""But you have sources at the FBI saying there is information that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?"" asked the WTTG-TV reporter. ""Absolutely,"" Wheeler replied. ""Yeah, and that’s confirmed."" The next day, a national Fox News report said an unnamed federal investigator corroborated Wheeler’s findings. And according to the federal investigator, an FBI analysis of Rich’s laptop found that Rich made contact with a WikiLeaks director and sent him 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments from DNC leaders. Here’s the problem: Hours after Fox published its report, Wheeler recanted. He told CNN that he hadn’t seen the evidence himself, and his knowledge of Rich’s alleged email contact with WikiLeaks came from the national Fox News reporter, not his own investigative work. ""Let me just really quickly say this,"" Wheeler said on Hannity’s show May 16. ""I don't know for sure, I don't know as a matter of fact if the emails went out to the WikiLeaks or anybody else, but it sure appears that way."" Fox retracted its own May 16 article, saying ""the article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting."" So this allegation that Rich was the real DNC leaker — and related insinuation that Rich was murdered because of it — rests nearly entirely on claims from a single unnamed federal investigator with unspecified connections to the case. The theory also doesn’t make much logical sense. No evidence has emerged that shows Rich was so disgruntled with the DNC that he felt the need to expose its leaders to WikiLeaks. Further, the leaked emails were overall rather mild. They were embarrassing and prompted Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida to step down from her role as DNC chair, but they didn’t expose any conspiracies or illegal activity. All of this together makes for a pretty flimsy case, especially when compared to the broad consensus that Russian actors were the true culprit. The intelligence community and private cybersecurity professionals have widely concluded that the DNC hack and WikiLeaks dump are covered in Russian fingerprints. The technical methods behind the hack were similar to those used by two Russian intelligence groups, dubbed APT28 and APT29, also known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear. And experts have said that dumping large quantities of stolen political information is a signature move of Russian influence operations. There’s also the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the Russian government have a well-documented relationship. Assange has hosted a television show on RT, a state-owned network, for example. Various intelligence agencies reiterated Russia’s culpability in official reports in October, December and January. And intelligence community leaders and experts in Russia and cybersecurity have said they agreed with this conclusion in testimony before Congress in the months since. ""The final piece of Russia's modern Active Measures surfaced in the summer of 2016 as hacked materials were strategically leaked,"" said Clint Watts, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and former FBI special agent, in a March 30 Senate hearing. ""The disclosures of WikiLeaks, Guccifer 2.0 and DC Leaks demonstrated how hacks would power the influence system Russia had built so successfully in the previous two years."" There’s evidence that Russia engaged in cyber operations against Republicans, too, though it wasn’t as robust as the DNC hack. ""The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets,"" said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in a May hearing. ""Russia also collected on certain Republican Party-affiliated targets, but did not release any Republican-related data."" Gingrich said DNC staffer Seth Rich ""apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments. ... It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians."" There is no trustworthy evidence supporting the theory that Rich was WikiLeaks’ source for thousands of DNC emails. The police believe his death was the result of a botched robbery, not a political assassination. The intelligence community and cybersecurity experts have reached a broad conclusion that all the available evidence points to Russia as the actual perpetrators — based on technical indicators and an understanding of how Russian influence operations work. Gingrich and others are talking about an unfounded conspiracy theory as if it's a matter of fact. It is far from it.

Dan Patrick's $20,000 tax savings claim proves incorrect, ridiculous
","Texas Lt. Gov . Dan Patrick made such a dramatic claim about ""must-pass"" tax-rate legislation--$20,000 in savings for the average homeowner every year!--we launched a fact check. Patrick, during 17 minutes of remarks to Capitol reporters May 17, 2017, named Senate Bill 2, authored by Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, as one of two measures--along with the Senate-backed proposal barring local governments and school districts from letting transgender residents use bathrooms of choice--that must pass, in Patrick’s view, for lawmakers to avoid one or more special sessions possibly called by Gov. Greg Abbott after the regular session that must end by midnight Memorial Day. Patrick, mindful the House then had yet to vote on SB 2, said the Senate-approved version of the measure ""would bring about the largest property tax reform in Texas history. It would bring local government spending under control, give the voters an automatic election on government spending, of anything over 5 percent, and,"" Patrick said, ""save the average homeowner in Texas $20,000 a year over the next 20 years or so."" Patrick aide: He meant $20,000 cumulatively Is that correct? To our inquiry, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said by email that Patrick had intended to tout savings adding up to $20,000 over 20 years. He pointed out a Texas Tribune news story posted two days after Patrick spoke quoting an unnamed Patrick staffer saying the same. The Tribune story said Patrick provided its reporter with a sheet of figures suggesting $20,856 in cumulative savings to the average homeowner, a conclusion predicated on local tax-rate hikes running higher than usual. The story quoted Dick Lavine, a tax analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities, which opposes SB 2, saying: ""This calculation certainly does not portray what an ‘average’ homeowner could expect in any given year, to say nothing of experiencing these ‘savings’ every year for the next 20 years."" Bettencourt offers backup We didn’t draw any backup from Patrick. But Bettencourt replied to our inquiry by offering a chart suggesting escalating savings for what he described as the owner of the median-valued Texas home based, he said, on research by the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, which drew on data on home sales culled monthly by the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University:                    SOURCE: Chart projecting homeowner savings from Senate-approved version of Senate Bill 2 (received by email from Lauri Saathoff, director of communications, state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, May 17, 2017) In phone messages, Bettencourt noted that the association’s analysis suggests that over five recent years, through 2015, the owner of a median-valued home saw a nearly 34 percent escalation in property taxes paid to the local government entities targeted by SB 2, which averages out to increases of more than 6 percent a year. Those entities are cities, counties and special districts though not school districts. How the chart gets to a $22,761 cumulative savings in year 20 figure: It shows first-year savings under SB 2 for the median-value homeowner of $46, second-year property tax savings of $99 with annual savings exceeding $1,100 starting in year 12--and topping $2,100 a year starting in year 17. Each year’s savings, the chart shows, reflects the difference between what the homeowner would face in local property taxes if all government units raised taxes 8 percent minus what the homeowner would face if the local government entities all raised taxes 5 percent. Under existing law, local governments may raise effective tax rates up to 8 percent without residents being able to petition for a rollback election. The ""effective rate"" refers to the rate needed for the governing unit to raise the same total amount of taxes from the same local properties as the unit garnered the year before. Under the Senate’s version of SB 2, any of the affected entities could raise such taxes up to 5 percent with any additional bump automatically touching off a rollback election. Realistic tax-rate assumptions? We asked Bettencourt about the basis of the chart’s assumption that local governments will every year across-the-board raise effective tax rates 5 percent and if it’s realistic to compare that to an assumption that such governments would otherwise uniformly be driving up rates 8 percent every year. In phone messages, Bettencourt stressed the TTARA chart showing the recent average 6-percent-plus increases in property taxes charged the owner of a median-valued home. Separately, Dale Craymer of TTARA declined to comment. Bettencourt also gave  us an alternate savings projection premised on all government entities affected by SB 2 annually raising effective rates 6 percent (rather than 3 percent) without a change in law. Upshot: Cumulative ""savings"" to the median-value homeowner would exceed $17,000 in year 20, the second chart suggests. We asked Bettencourt about available data showing local governments had widely maximized tax rates every year of late. In writing, he replied that he’d heard testimony along those lines from an Arlington and a Dallas official during pre-session hearings of the Bettencourt-chaired Texas Senate Select Committee on Property Tax Reform and Relief. Actual county, city tax rate changes Advocates for cities and counties say the senator’s assumption--that local governments will always uniformly raise effective tax rates to the maximum level allowable without risking a rollback vote at the polls--doesn’t reflect what Texas governments have been doing. By phone, Don Lee of the Texas Conference of Urban Counties, representing 38 member-counties home to most of the state’s residents, said that from 2014 through 2016, the counties averaged 2.2 percent effective tax rate increases, falling far short of the 8 percent rate that would open the way to a rollback vote. Lee emailed us a spreadsheet indicating the member counties averaged effective tax rate increases of 3.1 percent in 2014; 3.2 percent in 2015; and 0.7 percent in 2016. We also queried the Texas Municipal League, which says it represents most of the state’s cities, and whose legislative counsel, Bill Longley, emailed spreadsheets he described as based on effective city tax rates posted by the Texas state comptroller’s office for a couple of recent years. The sheets show, Longley noted, that the ""vast majority of cities haven’t been increasing their tax rates above the current 8 percent rollback rate."" According to the sheets, in 2014 and 2015, respectively, about 21 percent of the state’s cities adopted effective rates equal to or exceeding 8 percent. And, in keeping with SB 2’s proposed 5 percent rollback rate, how many cities lately have escalated rates that much or more? According to the sheets, 38 percent (382 of 1,002 cities) in 2014 and 39 percent (376 of 963 cities) in 2015. ""In both cases,"" Longley wrote, ""more than 60 percent of cities were under a 5 percent rollback rate, if it had been in place."" Texas A&M expert For an outside perspective, we asked Jim Gaines, chief economist of the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University, to appraise Bettencourt’s analysis and chart. By phone, Gaines said TTARA presented an accurate figure on its spreadsheet for a median-valued Texas home. But Gaines called ""highly questionable"" the assumptions behind the dollar figures in Bettencourt’s chart--both of local governments uniformly and annually driving up effective tax rates 8 percent without a change in law and of such governments under SB 2 all increasing rates 5 percent year after year. Counties, for instance, don’t act identically, Gaines said. ""Each county is going to be unique,"" he said. Comptroller makes no homeowner savings estimate Next, we checked the fiscal note on the Senate-approved version of SB 2 that was public by the time Patrick spoke (a more recent version appeared May 19, 2017). The March 16, 2017, note, prepared by the advisory Legislative Budget Board staff, states up front that the financial effects of reducing the rollback rate can’t be estimated. However, it also says, ""the table below is a hypothetical example of potential costs of the bill to counties, cities, and special districts"" based in part on assuming that no voters approve rates exceeding the 5 percent rollback rate and that future ""rate-setting practices would be similar to the rate-setting practices demonstrated in the available historical tax rate data."" And in fiscal 2019, the first year of tax effects, cities, counties and special districts would lose nearly $199 million in revenue, the comptroller’s office estimated, an indication of some taxpayer savings, it seemed to us. The  hypothetical shows additional costs to affected government entities in subsequent years. Does the hypothetical lost revenue, we wondered, mean the comptroller got a fix on how much homeowners and other property taxpayers might save? By phone, a spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office, Lauren Willis, said the agency has not estimated particular savings for homeowners. Tim Wooten, a comptroller consultant who worked on the table, told us by phone that’s because ""we can’t predict what local taxing entities will do"" in setting rates or if voters indeed will reject all increases at the polls. We asked Wooten to unpack how he reached the hypothesized revenue losses. Wooten said he applied the SB 2 limits to 2015 tax rates set by the targeted entities, finding that in that year, 60 percent of cities and special districts and 70 percent of counties did not set rates high enough to touch off the rollback elections envisioned in SB 2. Wooten said too that a lot of the remaining government entities would have sustained small 2015 losses in revenue if SB 2 had been law then. Bettencourt stands by $20,000-plus figure Following up, we asked Bettencourt if most local entities covered by SB 2 don’t reach existing or proposed rollback tax rates, aren’t homeowner savings impossible to precisely forecast? ""Of course,"" Bettencourt said in writing, ""because we are dealing with future projections to a 20-year degree. However, downward pressure on property tax rates means tax rate reductions across the board in probability."" When we said it looked to us like his projected homeowner savings were based on unrealistic assumptions about all the affected government entities maximizing tax rates every year, Bettencourt replied: ""Disagree strongly,"" urging us to revisit the spreadsheet he attributed to TTARA. Our ruling Patrick said legislation targeting local tax rate growth will result in the average Texas homeowner saving $20,000 a year over 20 years. That’s an absurd amount. Even if we look at what Patrick purportedly meant to say — $20,000 over 20 years — we find major flaws in the assumptions underlying that calculation. To reach that amount, one must assume that every city, county and special taxing district will raise tax rates by 8 percent every year without this legislation in place and by 5 percent a year with it. Neither assumption is in line with recent history, making the total savings figure highly suspect, at best a wild guess. Pants on Fire!

Milwaukee County executive candidate Jim Sullivan says police have to wait for hours with mental health patients
","
During a two-month period in 2004, more than 60 people with mental health emergencies waited for up to 60 hours to get treatment at the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex. Some had to be kept under police guard until they could receive care.

In early 2008, police agencies continued to rack up thousands of dollars in overtime as officers waited in their squad cars or in hospital emergency rooms with patients who needed psychiatric crisis services.

According to Jim Sullivan, one of the five candidates running in the Feb. 15, 2011, primary election for Milwaukee County executive, the problem persists.

In a Jan. 31, 2011 meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, Sullivan responded to a question about the Mental Health Complex by saying:

""When they’re full up over there, our local police officers -- if you’ve got somebody who needs to be over at mental health because they’re mentally ill, they may pose a danger to themselves, any of these different things -- if it’s full, cops sit out there in their squad cars with a mentally ill patient in the back and they have to wait to unload and people will, in some cases, spend an entire shift out there doing that.""

If Sullivan is right, police officers are regularly experiencing hours-long delays at the Mental Health Complex when transporting someone who needs crisis services.

Is he right?

We asked Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator from Wauwatosa, the basis for his statement. He did not have any direct evidence, but said he heard the Wauwatosa and West Allis police departments experienced such waits.

Thousands of people each year receive crisis care at the complex, 9455 W. Watertown Plank Road. Some are admitted to the 96-bed facility but most are treated and released.

As Sullivan indicated, crisis patients are brought to the facility, often by police, because they are deemed a danger to themselves or others.

The Journal Sentinel’s Patients in Peril investigation has uncovered numerous problems at the complex, from bungled care of patients and staff members falsifying documents to skyrocketing overtime costs.

But delays faced by police officers transporting crisis patients have not been in the news recently.

What’s more, Sullivan’s claim about delays is contradicted by an October 2010 study by a national consulting firm, which found that changes made by the county ""have been very effective in reducing backups.""

The finding was reiterated by the Milwaukee-based Public Policy Forum research organization in a January 2011 report, which summarized issues for candidates in the county executive race.

That report relied, in part, on a November 2010 county memo that showed a dramatic reduction in police waits beginning in 2008.

To further check Sullivan’s statement, we contacted the two police departments he cited as well as the Milwaukee Police Department and the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office.

Here is what they told us:

Wauwatosa police: Long delays ended five or more years ago and current wait times are usually less than 30 minutes, said Capt. Jeff Sutter. ""It would be extremely unusual for us to have what I consider a long wait,"" he said.

West Allis police: Long waits ended three years ago, according to Chief Mike Jungbluth, who said his officers transport patients to the Mental Health Complex ""every day.""

Milwaukee police: ""We aren’t experiencing the issue anymore,"" said spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz.

Milwaukee County sheriff:  Deputies usually wait about 20 minutes, said Capt. Darlene Jonas. If several officers are trying to get patients treated, the wait time could be one to two hours, she said.

So what’s the bottom line?

Sullivan said delays in admitting people to the Mental Health Complex for crisis care can be so long that police officers spend up to an entire shift with patients waiting for them to receive treatment. Hours-long delays were a problem some years ago. But the four largest police agencies in the county now say waits are short.   

Perhaps there are isolated cases today in which officers waits for hours, but at minimum Sullivan’s claim is clearly dated.

Metro Atlanta groundhog boasts more accuracy than Punxsutawney Phil
","
Politics, step aside. The Truth-O-Meter must address a matter of Southern pride.

The honor and reputation of our local groundhog General Beauregard Lee.

For three decades, the South’s most esteemed weather prognosticator has lived in the stout and lumpy shadow of Punxsutawney Phil.  

Phil makes the rounds yearly on the morning talk shows. He’s made appearances with Oprah Winfrey and President Ronald Reagan. His agent even scored him a gig with Bill Murray in the 1993 movie ""Groundhog Day.""

On Wednesday, PolitiFact Georgia scribes rolled our eyes as the public fawned over Phil once again during Wednesday’s annual Groundhog Day celebration. Phil never saw his shadow, news accounts said. Spring will come early.

But should you really trust Phil? Beau’s website says our metro Atlanta celebrity is accurate 94 percent of the time. Phil’s record is a measly 85 percent, it said. That stat has been picked up by various news outlets.  

Does Beau really deserve second place to that Yankee glory hog?

PolitiFact Georgia decided to settle this matter once and for all.

For the scoop on Beau’s record, we talked to Art Rilling, CEO and founder of Lilburn’s Yellow River Game Ranch, an attraction featuring people-friendly wildlife northeast of Atlanta. Beau lives there in a plantation-style manse named ""Weathering Heights."" For the past 10 years, his staff has calculated the General’s accuracy by noting the number of days local temperatures hit the freezing mark during the six weeks after Feb. 2.

Beau, like Phil, predicted an early spring for 2011.

Sadly, Phil’s staff has not tracked their groundhog’s predictions so diligently. Their official stance is that their marmot is ""incapable of error, so his accuracy rate is 100 percent,"" said Mike Johnston, vice president of the Inner Circle of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club.  

Wednesday was Punxsutawney’s 125th groundhog celebration. German settlers brought the tradition, which is based on ancient myths that say hedgehogs, which resemble groundhogs, have the power to predict the weather.

Phil’s predictions are not site-specific. If he says that spring will come early, it will, Johnston said. Somewhere.

When Phil’s really wrong, Johnston added, it’s the fault of poor Groundhogeese-to-English translation.

""People complain and tell us we’re just making it up as we go along,"" Johnston said, ""but after 125 years of doing it, we don’t need to.""

Before we go further, the staff of PolitiFact Georgia feels obliged to mention that meteorologists have officially determined that groundhogs cannot predict the weather.

Really. A tongue-in-cheek analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Climatic Data Center concluded groundhogs show ""no predictive skill."" (Why do this? To help get kids interested in the science of weather.)

Or, more bluntly, ""you can’t take any stock in a groundhog predicting the weather,"" said Tom Ross, a meteorologist who helped put together the NCDC’s report.  It showed that between 1988 and 2010, Phil gave accurate national weather predictions 10 times out of 23 for a rate of 43 percent.

True, but that won’t stop us. Our groundhog’s honor is at stake.

Since the keepers of Beau and Phil do not keep comparable statistics, we performed an independent analysis using the NCDC study and National Weather Service data for 2001 through 2010.

We defined ""early spring"" as a February with above-average temperatures. We then compared each groundhog’s prediction with temperatures nationally and in his respective hometown.

The NWS does not keep average February temperatures for the hamlet of Punxsutawney, Pa., so a kindly meteorologist gave us figures for Putneyville, Pa., a town at a similar elevation about 15 miles away.

We found that the General predicted whether spring will start early nationally with 60 percent accuracy. Phil’s rate was 30 percent.

Beau predicted Atlanta weather with 50 percent accuracy. Phil got Punxsutawney’s right 40 percent of the time.

By our analysis, Beau’s staff overestimated his success, but he’s still 10 to 30 percentage points ahead of Phil. Georgia’s underhog is the champion, paws down.  

General, emerge from the shadows. Stand tall on your stubby legs.

"['Abortion', 'Ohio', 'Lorraine Fende']","
Rep. Lorraine Fende on point that abortion at 8 1/2 months is legal
","
A new bill to ban late-term abortions is gaining traction in the Ohio House of Representatives, reinvigorating debate over the state’s abortion laws.

If passed, the bill would ban abortions when a woman is at least 20 weeks pregnant and tests show the fetus can live outside the womb – a condition known as being viable. The proposed ban contains exceptions for certain medical situations, a legal requirement for late-term abortion bans at the state level.

The proposed ban is one of three bills related to abortion the Republican majority in the House introduced this week. The set of abortion bills comes on the heels of similar legislation Democratic Rep. Lorraine Fende of Willowick introduced earlier this year. Fende’s bill aimed to ban abortions when a woman is at least 22 weeks pregnant with a viable fetus.

Fende’s bill is likely going nowhere now that Republicans have trumped her proposal with one of their own. But a case she made for her bill – involving the availability of late-term abortions in Ohio – also is central to Republicans’ plan to ban late-term abortions.

""I had a conversation with someone quite some time ago that right now, you could be 8½ months’ pregnant and have an abortion for no reason,"" Fende told The Columbus Dispatch for a story published Jan. 17.

Similarly, proponents of Republicans’ plan to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy decried the occurrence of abortions in Ohio up to the ninth month of pregnancy.

While advocates and opponents of the proposed ban on late-term abortions prepare to debate this sensitive issue as it moves through the legislature, it is important to keep the facts straight. So we decided to check out Fende’s claim.

Fende said she relied on statistics from the Ohio Department of Health. Doctors who perform an abortion in Ohio must submit to the department a Confidential Abortion Report, which does not include the woman’s name or other identifying information.

According to the Ohio Department of Health, four abortions were performed in Ohio after 32 weeks (or eight months) of pregnancy in 2009, the most recent year in which statistics are available. Two abortions were performed when the mother was 32 weeks along; one abortion took place at 33 weeks; and one occurred at 35 weeks.

Overall, 28,721 abortions were reported in Ohio in 2009. Of those, 613 involved pregnancies at least 20 weeks along and 116 of them were for women at least 24 weeks pregnant. The length of the pregnancy was unknown in 276 cases.

The numbers confirm that at least one abortion occurred in Ohio when a mother was at least 8½ months’ pregnant. Fende said she was aware of this one abortion when she made her claim, and she said she did not know the reason behind it.

Ohio law does not include an absolute ban on abortions when a woman is 8½, 8¾ or even 9 months’ pregnant.

State lawmakers tried to pass a late-term abortion ban in 1995, but the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the ban was unconstitutional because medical exceptions to the ban were not sufficiently specific.

Courts, however, have upheld Ohio’s a ban on partial-birth abortions, which are performed after part of the fetus has been removed from the mother’s body. Partial-birth abortion is associated with late-term pregnancy but the two are not mutually exclusive. There are other abortion procedures, permitted under Ohio law, that can terminate a late-term pregnancy.

Although certain late-term abortions are legal, pro-choice advocates say they are only done for medical reasons – not for ""no reason,"" as Fende suggested.

Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, said abortion clinics in the state will not perform an abortion if the woman has been pregnant for at least 24 weeks. She said any abortion performed afterward would take place in a hospital for medical reasons.

Jessie Hill, a professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said abortions when a woman is 8½ months pregnant don’t happen in Ohio for no reason. ""It’s just one of those things that’s unheard of,"" said Hill, who has researched reproductive rights. Hill said she is pro-choice.

Michael Gonidakis, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, said that most abortion clinics advertise for abortions at 24 weeks or earlier. But, Gonidakis pointed out, statistics from the Ohio Department of Health show abortions are happening beyond 24 weeks. The statistics do not show whether the abortions are taking place in a hospital or an abortion clinic.

But, upon request from the Democrats for Life of Ohio, the Department of Health provided data on the medical condition of women receiving an abortion after they had been pregnant for at least 23 weeks. The data was taken from the abortion reports doctors submitted to the department. The report includes a question about the patient’s medical condition, whether it was ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""other.""

Of the 116 abortions in 2009 performed when the woman was reported to be 24 weeks pregnant or more, all of them were listed in good medical condition, according to the Department of Health.

So where does this leave us?

The law does not explicitly outlaw such an abortion, but state health records show there was just one such case in 2009, and Fende said she did not have the background of that case. And a law professor who is an expert in reproductive rights told us that abortions at 8½ months aren't done for just ""no reason.""

Fende’s claim was legally sound. But by itself it does not reflect what the state Department of Health is documenting. That there was just one case out of more than 28,700 abortions in 2009 that fits her statement is an additional piece of information needed to fully understand the claim.

"['Environment', 'National', 'Energy', 'Harry Reid']","
Nevada will be ""energy independent within the immediate future""
","
In a recent TV interview, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid made a striking claim about his home state. Reid said Nevada will be ""energy independent within the immediate future.""

During the Jan. 18, 2011, interview, Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston asked Reid how soon Nevada can start exporting its energy to other states.

""It’s going to take a while, but some of that is happening right now,"" Reid said, citing a power line between northern and southern Nevada that’s in the works.

""California has a rule that one-third of all their electricity by the year 2020 must come from renewable sources,"" Reid said. ""They simply can’t do it. So we will be the chief state that they will import their energy from.""

Ralston prodded, ""How long is it going to take to get that to happen?""

""I would say within the next three or four years,"" Reid responded.

""That fast?"" Ralston asked.

""Oh yeah, we are going to be able to be energy independent within the immediate future,"" Reid said.

We decided to see if the senator was correct.

We began by contacting the Nevada State Office of Energy, which keep statistics on the state's energy sources, but Spokesman Sean Sever said his agency ""doesn't have anything to prove or disprove this statement.""

So we turned to Scot Rutledge, the executive director of the Nevada Conservation League and Education Fund, a leading environmental group in the state. Rutledge was skeptical.

He said that Nevada could stop importing coal by shutting down a few plants in northern Nevada, and the state does have enough geothermal resources to theoretically replace fossil-fuel powered plants, particularly natural gas. ""But that would take longer than three to four years,"" he said.

In the meantime, Nevada does have impressive solar resources, and if the state developed sufficient storage capacity, that might be enough to provide 24-hour electricity for homes and businesses.

But being a net exporter of energy does not necessarily mean being ""energy independent."" That’s because cars, trucks and airplanes have to run on fuel, too -- and the state does not have enough oil for that.

""We would need to convert every vehicle on the road to electric,"" Rutledge said, and then provide fuel obtained in-state for airplanes.

All told, Rutledge said, it’s conceivable that Nevada might be able to export more energy than it imports ""over the next seven to 10 years, but I don't think that is a true definition of energy independence.""

Rutledge speculated that Reid may simply have been overzealous in echoing comments from 2008 by former President Bill Clinton. Clinton told a national clean-energy summit-- held in Nevada and co-sponsored by Reid -- that the state could one day become energy independent, as could such countries as Liberia, Rwanda, East Timor and Papua New Guinea.

At the same summit, Reid said in a speech that ""the sun shines here all the time. The wind blows much of the time, and we're one of the few states that has massive amounts of geothermal energy. That's why I refer to Nevada as the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy. Tax incentives and upgraded transmission capacity could make the goals set forth for Nevada a reality.""

Indeed, when we contacted Reid’s office, spokesman Jon Summers repeated the theme of Nevada as a huge repository of untapped energy.

Reid ""has a vision of Nevada leading the nation in clean energy production,"" Summers said. ""He’s been responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in investment in the state’s clean energy industry. Nevada’s north-to-south transmission line, which is expected to be completed in less than three years, will allow the state’s population centers to secure clean energy from rural areas and even export it outside the state. In his interview, Sen. Reid said he thinks that energy independence is going to take a while but some of it is already happening.""

We’ll grant that in the interview, the discussion began with the question of how fast Nevada can begin exporting energy out of the state. But Reid went on to say the state would be ""energy independent within the immediate future,"" which means all of the state’s energy would be produced within its own boundaries. Even if Nevada successfully taps into its solar and other energy resources, it is many years away from changing all of its cars, trucks and planes from fossil fuels to fuels that can be produced within the state. So we rate Reid’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB89F740>],/factchecks/2011/feb/03/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-nevada-will-be-energy-independent-/

Maddow began to cite a statistic about the median wage from 1980 to 1990 when Moore interrupted.

""The facts are the facts, Rachel. The lowest income people had the biggest gains,"" Moore said.

In a separate item, we're checking Maddow's claim that ""From 1980 to 1990, the top 1 percent saw their income go up by roughly 80 percent"" while ""the median wage in the country over (the same) 10 years went up 3 percent.""

Here, we're checking Moore's claim that during the 1980s, ""The lowest income people had the biggest gains.""

There are lots of ways to slice income statistics, but neither Maddow nor Moore responded to our e-mails seeking clarification and backup material.

So we turned to the U.S. Census and a few economists for input.

Gary Burtless, an economist at the centrist to liberal Brookings Institution, said U.S. Census data doesn't back Moore up.

According to Census data, when presented in equivalent 2009 dollars, the income among the lowest fifth of the population increased about 6.3 percent (from $10,682 to $11,400). That's the lowest gain compared to other quintiles: 7.9 percent for the second lowest fifth; 8 percent for the middle fifth; 10.5 percent for the fourth fifth, and 20.3 percent in the highest fifth. Incomes rose 28.2 percent among the top 5 percent.

""Incomes rose in the bottom, middle, and top portions of the income distribution as Mr. Moore stated, although the income gains were certainly bigger at the top compared with the bottom,"" Burtless said. ""These results clearly show that low-income Americans did not obtain the biggest income gains between 1980 and 1990.""

According to the U.S. Census, the share of the aggregate income received by families decreased in every quintile except the top quintile (where it increased from 41.1 to 44.3 percent). In other words, the richest Americans held a larger share of all income in 1990 than in 1980.

Those are the census figures. Economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez also analyzed income via tax data. According to their study, average inflation-adjusted income (pre-tax) per family in the top 1 percent increased from $427,000 in 1980 to $661,000 in 1990. That's a 55 percent increase. Meanwhile, the average income (pre-tax) per family in the bottom 90 percent fell slightly from $30,900 in 1980 to $30,800 in 1990. You can see all of the results in Table A6 of their report.

""All economists agree that the 1980s saw a huge increase in inequality,"" said Saez, an economics professor at the University of California Berkeley. There was ""increased concentration at the top and big losses at the bottom (especially during the early 1980s recession).""

So Moore can make a credible argument -- based on Census data -- that all incomes rose during the 1980s, but the data does not support his claim that the lowest income people had the biggest gains. To the contrary, the lowest income people had the smallest gains. We rule Moore's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6CD580>],/factchecks/2011/feb/03/steve-moore/wall-street-journals-steve-moore-claims-low-income/
"['National', 'Economy', 'History', 'Income', 'Pundits', 'Taxes', 'Rachel Maddow']","
Rachel Maddow tangles with 'Wall Street Journal's' Steve Moore over Reagan tax cuts and income inequality
","
Rachel Maddow got into a spirited back-and-forth with Stephen Moore of the Wall Street Journal on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher show Jan. 21, 2011, over the effect of the Reagan tax cuts and income inequality.

Moore got the ball rolling with his comment, ""I say the Reagan tax cuts were the greatest economic policy of the last 50 years.""

Maddow disagreed. As the two exchanged arguments, Maddow tried to get out a statistic about growing income disparity during the 1980s, but she was repeatedly interrupted.

Frustrated, Maddow raised her hand and finally stood up to belt out her point.

""From 1980 to 1990, the top 1 percent saw their income go up by roughly 80 percent,"" Maddow said. ""The median wage in the country over 10 years went up 3 percent. That means for the best people, the people that were best off in the country, it was the Matterhorn, and for everybody else in the country, it was like this (she drew a flat line with her finger). So, if you were rich, Reagan was awesome, and if you were anybody else, it sucked.""

""You've got to get the statistics right,"" Moore said. ""That's not true.""

In fact, Moore said, ""everyone's income went up...The lowest income people had the biggest gains.""

Economists disagree over the effect of tax cuts, and we're certainly not going to try to settle that here, but we can check the underlying statistics behind Maddow's point.

The problem is that there are lots of ways to slice income statistics (do you include investment income such as capital gains? pre- or post-tax income?), and neither Maddow nor Moore responded to our e-mails seeking clarification and backup material.

In a Jan. 22, 2011, article on the conservative NewsBusters website, reporter Noel Sheppard wrote that, ""Not surprisingly, Maddow was 100 percent wrong.""

Sheppard attacked Maddow's claim about the median wage in the country going up just 3 percent between 1980 and 1990. NewsBusters cited a Census Bureau table which shows that median income for men in 1980 was $12,530 per year; and grew to $20,293 in 1990 -- a 62 percent increase. For women, this figure went from $4,920 in 1980 to $10,070 in 1990 -- a 105 percent jump.

""This means that the median income for the entire population in that decade rose at roughly the same rate as Maddow claimed the income for the top 1 percent did,"" Sheppard wrote.

Those figures are correct for the actual income figures at the time. But they aren't adjusted for inflation.

When the 1980 and 1990 figures are adjusted for inflation, the increase for men gets awfully close to Maddow's figure -- going from $31,054 in 1980 to $32,284 in 1990, a 4 percent increase (the median income jump was 31 percent for women).

Further complicating things, however, is that Maddow toggled between two different statistics, first citing income statistics for the top 1 percent; then citing overall median wage figures. Income and wage are two different things. Income can include a lot of things other than just wages, such as investment income or capital gains.

To get more precisely at what Maddow cited, Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution pointed us to Census Bureau figures for the median annual wage of ""workers who are on full-time schedules."" These statistics show that the inflation-adjusted median earnings of full-time male workers fell 4.5 percent between 1980 and 1990 (declining from $46,127 to $44,033 ) while the real median earnings of full-time female workers increased 13.6 percent (climbing from $27,750 to $31,535).

You would think the Census would provide combined figures in this category for for men and women, but it doesn't. As a result, Burtless said, ""it’s hard for me to guess whether the real median wage for both men and women increased exactly 3 percent during the decade. However, the estimate does not look unreasonable in view of the relative number of male and female full-time workers in the labor force.""

As for Maddow's claim that from 1980 to 1990, the top 1 percent saw their income go up by roughly 80 percent, the Census Bureau again leaves us wanting.

The Census Bureau tracks income by quintiles, but not the top 1 percent.

It's unclear where Maddow got her statistic, but several economists suggested it must have been from the analyses of tax data performed by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez.

So we contacted Saez, an economics professor at the University of California Berkeley, who said tax data he compiled with Piketty show that average inflation-adjusted income (pre-tax) per family in the top 1 percent increased from $427,000 in 1980 to $661,000 in 1990. That's a 55 percent increase. Meanwhile, the average income (pre-tax) per family in the bottom 90 percent fell slightly from $30,900 in 1980 to $30,800 in 1990, he said. You can see all of the results in Table A6 of their report.

So how did Maddow get to 80 percent?

Saez believes Maddow must have used statistics in the report that did not include capital gains (Table A4), which show the same stagnation in the bottom 90 percent but a bigger, 74 percent increase at the top 1 percent.

""All economists agree that the 1980s saw a huge increase in inequality,"" Saez said. There was ""increased concentration at the top and big losses at the bottom (especially during the early 1980s recession).""

Added Burtless: ""Ms. Maddow seems to be completely correct that incomes at the very top increased many times faster than the real median wage.""

As for Moore's claim that ""everyone's income went up...The lowest income people had the biggest gains,"" he's only half right. It's true that everyone's income went up. But adjusted for inflation, the lowest income people saw the smallest percentage of gain.

Said Burtless: ""Incomes rose in the bottom, middle, and top portions of the income distribution as Mr. Moore stated, although the income gains were certainly bigger at the top compared with the bottom. These results clearly show that low-income Americans did not obtain the biggest income gains between 1980 and 1990.""

According to Census data, when presented in equivalent 2009 dollars, the income among the lowest fifth increased about 6.3 percent (from $10,682 to $11,400). That's the lowest gain compared to other quintiles: 7.9 percent for the second lowest fifth; 8 percent for the middle fifth; 10.5 percent for the fourth fifth, and 20.3 percent in the highest fifth. Incomes rose 28.2 percent among the top 5 percent.

Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute summed up the Maddow-Moore exchange this way: ""She's right, he's wrong. He might have been thinking about the '90s, when everyone’s income did indeed go up, even at the bottom, (but even in the nineties the people at the top made the biggest gains). You have to go back to the '50s and '60s to find business cycles where growth was faster at the bottom.""

Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Princeton and author of ""Unequal Democracy,"" believes the best indicator of the real income change of the top 1 percent between 1980 and 1990 is the Piketty/Saez figure of 55 percent.

""I’d say Maddow exaggerated a bit but got the general story right, whereas Moore was not within shouting distance of anything true,"" Bartels said. ""Of course, how much of this can be attributed to the Reagan tax cuts is a separate question, and worth debating in its own right.""

Again, we're not wading into the debate about whether Reagan tax cuts had anything to do with the growing gap in income inequality. To see some of the varying viewpoints among economists on that issue, check out an article by Slate's Timothy Noah on Sept. 9, 2010, which ran under the headline, ""The United States of Inequality: Can We Blame Income Inequality on Republicans?""

At issue are the statistics Maddow and Moore used to underpin their arguments. In this case, Maddow said that ""from 1980 to 1990, the top 1 percent saw their income go up by roughly 80 percent"" and that at the same time ""the median wage in the country over 10 years went up 3 percent."" The median wage in the country, expressed in constant 2009 dollars, does appear to be in the range Maddow cited (though with statistics broken out separately for men and women, we can't be precise). As for Maddow's claim that the top 1 percent saw their income go up that decade by roughly 80 percent, that's close but only if you cite numbers that do not include capital gains. It's not unreasonable to cite those numbers, but the economists we spoke to preferred to use figures that included capital gains, which show the top 1 percent saw an increase of 55 percent. Either way, Maddow's point that the 1980s were much more of a boon for the very rich than everyone else is valid. And so we rate Maddow's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFC3E00>],/factchecks/2011/feb/03/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-tanglles-wall-street-journals-steve-/
"['Health Care', 'Crime', 'Florida', 'Ron Saunders']","
Ron Saunders says Miami-Dade, Broward rule the country in Medicaid fraud
","
South Florida has a reputation as a place ripe for fraud and crime -- including bilking the government.

State Rep. Ron Saunders, the Democratic minority leader from Key West, has slapped a more specific label on a costly problem in South Florida: Medicaid fraud.

""The two worst counties for fraud in the country -- not state -- are Dade and Broward county,"" he told a roomful of reporters on Jan. 19, 2011, during an Associated Press preview of Florida's upcoming legislative session.

It's easy to find news articles describing South Florida as a mecca for such fraud -- with labels such as ""ground zero"" or mind-boggling tales of abuse. But the word ""worst"" caught our eye -- are the South Florida counties of Miami-Dade and Broward truly the ""worst"" in the country for Medicaid fraud?

Medicaid, a health care program for low-income individuals, is administered by the states and receives some federal funding. The Truth-O-Meter has weighed in multiple times on fact-checks related to the high cost and growth of Medicaid, including a claim by Pam Bondi, now Florida's attorney general, and Bill McCollum, Florida's previous attorney general. For more background, check out this website of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

We spoke to Saunders directly on Jan. 20, who told us that his statement was in response to a question about how to resolve the state's budget crisis. Saunders said it's a ""no-brainer"" to cut back on fraud such as in Medicare and Medicaid rather than make more cuts in areas such as education.

But after a lot of calls and research, we can say one thing for certain: Nobody tracks county-by-county Medicaid fraud nationally. Even within Florida, a county breakdown is not available. So we're going to rely on expert opinions and documented trends in this ruling. 
Mark Hollis, spokesperson for the House Democratic caucus, sent us links to newspaper articles and government reports about Medicaid fraud in South Florida.

Among the sources Hollis cited was a March 2009 article in Health News Florida, quoting state Sen. Don Gaetz saying: ""Since we have the worst problem in the nation, we need the most effective solution."" Hollis also sent us a December 2005 article in HomeCare, an industry publication, quoting FBI agent Michael Clemens, who was in charge of the Miami field office at the time, saying: ""South Florida is ground zero for health care fraud.""

But neither article provides any documentation to support that ""worst"" label.

Hollis also sent us links to a House bill and recent government reports about Medicaid fraud.

House Bill 1487 in 2009, which labeled Miami-Dade an area of ""special concern,"" was intended to rein in Medicaid fraud. The Senate version, Senate Bill 2658, was signed into law in June 2009. The staff analysis outlined the rampant growth in home health care agencies in Florida: Of the 431 licensure applications in 2007, 58.5 percent were in Miami-Dade. In that county, the number of licensed agencies grew 414 percent between August 1999 and March 6, 2009.

The analysis also stated that ""While Miami-Dade has about 20 percent of Florida’s Medicaid population and about 33 percent of Florida’s residents over the age of 60, 91 percent of the state reimbursement for certain home health services were going to Miami-Dade.""

While the bill analysis doesn't provide data ranking all of Florida's counties, it certainly suggests that Miami-Dade has an overwhelmingly disproportionate share of Medicaid dollars -- and fraud.

Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, which administers the Medicaid program, has a report from 2009-10 that also provides some insight. Although the 94-page report does not describe Broward and Miami-Dade as the worst in the nation, it noted:

• ""Home health agencies have been an acknowledged area of health care fraud in recent years. For the four fiscal years ending June 30, 2009, approximately 90 percent of Medicaid expenditures for home health aide visits were made to providers in Miami‐Dade County, while only about 20 percent of Medicaid recipients reside in that area. At the end of the fiscal year, there were 339 home health agencies in Miami‐Dade County actively enrolled in the Medicaid program and only 293 in the other 66 counties combined."" (Page 53)

• Statutes were changed in 2008 and 2009 to address home-health fraud. Forty-seven licensure denials for home health agencies were upheld in FY 2009-10 for fraud-related reasons. Thirty-one of the denials (66 percent) were in Miami-Dade County. (Page 65)

We reached out to several agencies that have a role in Medicaid.

Both the Florida Attorney General, which has a Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, and AHCA said they had no nationwide county-by-county information to support or refute Saunders' claim.

Don White, spokesman for the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also told us that the federal government has ""no statistics on Medicaid fraud.""

As for Saunders' claim that Dade and Broward are the ""worst"" in the country, White said: ""Do we have the numbers? No. Is he probably correct? Yes.""

We ran Saunders' claim by Alan Levine, a former secretary at AHCA under Gov. Jeb Bush and an expert on Medicaid.

""I have absolutely no doubt South Florida is among the highest,"" Levine wrote in an e-mail. ""Others that likely run in the same circle are New York and New Jersey. But South Florida, from all the experience I have, clearly leads the way.""

Levine sent us a 2009 report, ""Stop Paying the Crooks,"" by the Center for Health Transformation, an organization founded by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. It stated that the U.S. Department of Justice labeled ""South Florida -- and more specifically, Miami-Dade County --Ground Zero for health care fraud in America."" But no numbers ranking counties nationwide.

We sent Saunders' claim to Craig Smith, the attorney who wrote the South Florida chapter, who works at Hogan Lovells law firm in Miami.

""Whatever the exact figure is, there can be no question that the bulk of the fraud, waste and abuse is occurring in Miami-Dade and Broward counties,"" Smith wrote to us in an e-mail Feb. 1. ""Based on the size of Florida's Medicaid program, you can fairly eliminate about 45 states from the comparative discussion.""

So let's review: Saunders said that ""The two worst counties for (Medicaid) fraud in the country -- not state -- are Dade and Broward county."" We could not find any government office that could point to numbers ranking counties across the nation in terms of Medicaid fraud. But we found four experts -- one from the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, one a former secretary of the state's AHCA, a spokesperson from a national organization that provides information on health care fraud and an attorney who specializes in health care law -- who all agree that Saunders is likely right.

At PolitiFact Florida, we dig for data to support claims by politicians -- and Saunders and our experts haven't provided hard numbers to prove him right. But the fact that four experts -- including one appointed by a Republican governor -- generally back up the Democratic minority leader or say that the two counties are at least among the worst in the nation carries weight with us. We rate Saunders’ claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB4FF00>],/factchecks/2011/feb/03/ron-saunders/saunders-says-dade-broward-rule-country-medicaid-f/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Workers', 'Blake Farenthold']","
Rep. Blake Farenthold says health care law will force 70 percent of workers to lose their current plan
","
On Jan. 23, 2011, Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas -- a freshman lawmaker who ousted a Democratic incumbent in 2010 -- wrote an op-ed in the Corpus Christi Caller-Times explaining his decision to vote to repeal the Democratic-backed health care law.

One of the reasons he cited was this:

""Despite claims that you can 'keep the health care plan you like,' the Obama administration has predicted that as many as 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan,"" Farenthold wrote.

Farenthold was referring to President Barack Obama’s frequent claim that under the proposed law, ""if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan."" We fact-checked that claim in 2009 -- before the final version of the bill was passed -- and ruled it Half True. Later that year, Obama began using a less sweeping version of the claim -- that if you ""already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have."" We rated that statement True.

When we saw Farenthold’s statement, we wondered whether the Obama administration really acknowledged that ""as many as 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan.""

We tried contacting Farenthold’s office, but his staff did not respond to our inquiries. However, Michael Tanner -- a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, which has been critical of the health care bill -- suggested that Farenthold may have been referring to a fact sheet the administration assembled and posted at the informational website HealthCare.gov.

This fact sheet explained how health plans can be ""grandfathered"" under the law, which was passed in early 2010 and which becomes fully operational in 2014.

The law allows plans that existed on March 23, 2010, to be ""grandfathered,"" which means that they do not have to comply with new provisions that took effect last fall, such as requirements to provide preventive services without cost-sharing and direct access to ob-gyn care without a referral. To keep their grandfathered status, these plans must not significantly cut benefits or increase out-of-pocket spending for consumers. (Minor policy changes and increases to keep pace with medical inflation do not threaten a plan’s grandfather status.)

While acknowledging significant uncertainty about how employers will react to their options, the fact sheet offers estimates of how many plans the administration expects to opt for grandfathered status, both for the 133 million Americans whose plans are provided by large employers and the 43 million with plans provided by small employers (fewer than 100 employees). We aren’t looking at the nation’s 17 million individually purchased policies, because Farenthold’s claim specifically referenced employer-provided health care.

According to administration projections, between 71 and 87 percent of large-employer plans will be grandfathered in 2011, and between 36 and 66 percent will remain grandfathered by 2013. For small plans, the administration expects between 58 and 80 percent to be grandfathered in 2011 and between 20 and 51 percent to be grandfathered in 2013.

So, in his op-ed, Farenthold used the highest estimate for the percentage of plans that will have lost their grandfather status by 2013 and therefore changed to comply with the health care law, though he does hedge somewhat by saying ""as many as.""

Still, we don’t think these numbers fully support Farenthold’s claim.

For one thing, if your plan loses its grandfather status, it won’t necessarily mean that you’ll ""lose (your) current health plan,"" as Farenthold writes.

Health care specialists said they expect that in many cases an employer (or the insurance carrier the employer uses) will change the plan in ways that are significant enough to end grandfather status but which will not terminate the plan or result in a radical change in its coverage. While some employers may decide to end health care coverage entirely (and thus pay a penalty under the bill), many will continue to offer a similar plan but perhaps with more extensive requirements mandated under the law, possibly along with higher premiums.

Indeed, one way that your employer’s plan could lose its grandfather status would be if the employer decides to make it more generous to patients. In this case, ""losing"" the plan would be a net gain for the patient, not a net loss. This is certainly how supporters view the law -- they see the shift from a grandfathered plan to one with new patient benefits and protections as a good thing, not a bad thing. Opponents counter that un-grandfathered plans will force patients to pay more even if they don’t want the new benefits.

There’s also a broader issue. Saying that the law could force 70 percent of Americans to lose their current health plans ignores that many people lose their current health coverage every year for reasons having nothing to do with the new law. Both Obama and Farenthold failed to acknowledge this point, but more on that in a moment.

Answering the question of how many Americans ""lose their current health plan"" for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law is surprisingly tricky. Health care experts we contacted said they’d never seen a comprehensive statistical look at that question, so we pieced it together as best we could.

We found one study by the U.S. Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation, which looked at a statistically representative sample of Americans over a period of 48 months. Unfortunately, the data is old -- it’s from the mid-to-late 1990s -- but one finding was that 26.3 percent of fully employed Americans lacked health coverage for at least one month in the 48-month period studied.

That statistic only addresses people who lost coverage entirely, at least temporarily. It doesn’t include people who switched jobs (and thus health plans) without losing coverage. That’s common in an economy as dynamic as the United States’. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that, on average, slightly more than 3 percent of employees leave their jobs in any given month.

The Census Bureau study also didn’t count those who stayed in the same job but whose company changed insurance carriers, or whose insurance carriers changed the terms of a client company’s plan. Data on this phenomenon is scarce.

We found some data in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population ""switched"" health insurance coverage. However, this probably underestimates the rate of switching for the people Farenthold was referring to -- those who have employer-based coverage. The HHS study included people of all ages, including those covered by Medicare, who rarely switch. In addition, the study would capture a switch between, say, an Aetna plan and a United Health Care plan but would not necessarily catch a shift between one type of Aetna plan and another type of Aetna plan.

We found another relevant study by Mercer, a private consulting firm. Mercer's National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans, an annual study of nearly 3,000 employers released every November, includes a question on whether employers will ask employees to pay a greater share of health care costs in the upcoming plan year -- for instance, by changing from an HMO to a PPO or by raising deductibles and other forms of cost-sharing.

Beth Umland, the head of research for Mercer's health & benefits consulting practice, said that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly 25 percent of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, she said, that percentage rose to one-third of companies each year.

So if you add up the workers who lose coverage entirely, who change jobs, who work for companies that change insurance carriers or plan terms significantly, or whose employer’s insurance carrier is merged or bought out, a significant number of Americans were already losing ""their current health plan"" before the new law was passed. The data is too scattershot to know how large or small the percentage is, but it seems reasonable to assume that the number is not trivial. In fact, the percentage could well be higher than the administration's lower- to mid-level projections for de-grandfathering.

Why does this matter? Because knowing that many workers every year are already required to change plans -- even if they like them -- would provide a different impression of the statistics Farenthold cites.

And this confusion owes a lot to Obama’s original promise.

When Obama said, ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,"" he never acknowledged that many working Americans were already unable to keep the same coverage every year. That set up an unrealistic perception of what the health care bill would do -- and it gave his opponents a perfect opportunity to make the bill’s impact seem problematic. 
Later he modified the claim to say that if you ""already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor that you have."" But by the time Obama changed how he made this point, it was already too late -- his opponents had seized on the initial comment and cited it repeatedly.

That said, this item is about Farenthold’s claim, not Obama’s, and we find problems with it. If Farenthold is using the administration’s estimates for lost grandfather status, he’s taken the most extreme point on a wide range of possible outcomes. More important, it’s not clear that an employee whose plan loses grandfather status would be losing his current health plan in anything more than a technical sense; many workers could actually end up with a more generous plan. Finally, Farenthold ignores that many employees lose their current health plans for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with the health care law. To suggest that the law is the reason for 70 percent of employees being forced off their plans, as Farenthold does, ignores all other reasons for such changes. And he is incorrect when he says the Obama administration predicted that. We rate the statement False. 
UPDATE: Shortly after our story was published, Farenthold’s office replied to our inquiry. They confirmed that the Congressman was referring to the administration’s projected rates of grandfathering, specifically citing Table 3 in the official regulation. We stand by our ruling.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8D8300>],/factchecks/2011/feb/02/blake-farenthold/rep-blake-farenthold-says-health-care-law-will-for/

David Rivera says Obama ignored the Cuban exile community
","
U.S. Rep. David Rivera, who has criticized President Barack Obama's loosening of restrictions in policy toward Cuba, blasted the president following a White House reception for new members of Congress in January.

Rivera's guest at the reception, former political prisoner Cary Roque, delivered a letter to Obama dated Aug. 25, 2010, that was signed by 26 Cuban exile organizations. The letter asked for a meeting with the president or a member of his administration.

The next day, the Miami Republican accused Obama of not doing enough to accommodate Cuban exiles.

""In the past,"" Rivera said in a statement on Jan. 25, 2011, ""President Obama has refused to meet with representatives from Cuban exile organizations, so I was proud to take Cary Roque as my guest to the White House last night to help the president put a real human face to the issue of Cuba. I thought it was important to introduce him to someone who knows first-hand what it’s like to be imprisoned and abused by the Castro dictatorship.""

Before he was elected in November 2008, Obama stressed the need for a new policy approach to Cuba. He also called for the lifting of limits on Cuban Americans who want to visit Cuba or send money to relatives on the island.

But had he ""refused"" to meet with reps from Cuban exile groups, as Rivera alleged?

Rivera defined ""exile organizations"" as the ones that signed Roque's letter, according to his spokeswoman Leslie Veiga. These groups include Consejo por la Libertad de Cuba, Frente Nacional Presidio Politico, Presidio Politico Historico y Casa del Preso and Junta Militar de Veteranos Cubanos.

But others interpret ""exile organizations"" more broadly to include other groups and individuals, too.

""I laughed when I read the quote,"" said Jeff Garcia, a partner at Balsera Communications, a Miami firm that boasts it delivered much of the Hispanic vote to secure an Obama victory. ""What David was saying (was that Obama) refuses to meet with his people.""

We found that Obama has met with various Cuban exile leaders, including Carlos Rodriguez, co-chair of the Cuba Study Group, before he took office January 2009. But maybe Rivera meant meetings with representatives -- or leaders -- from the Cuban exile groups after his January 2009 inauguration.

We found one meeting Obama had, on April 15, 2010, with a pair of prominent exiles: Gloria and Emilio Estefan. He met with the celebrity couple at their home on exclusive Star Island as part of a fundraiser for the Democratic Party that raised $2.5 million.

Even though the Estefans aren't Democrats, they say they wanted to get the president's ear on Cuba’s human rights record. Gloria Estefan gave Obama letters from dissidents, according to the Miami Herald. (Some Cuban-American exiles assailed the fundraising event because they believe Obama is not tough enough on Cuba.)

The couple has a long history in defense of human rights. In October, the Cuban Liberty Council honored the Estefans as ""Heroes of Liberty"" in downtown Miami. A month before, the couple led a march of tens of thousands in Little Havana for Cuba's Las Damas de Blanco, or Ladies in White.

Separately, Obama met in October 2010 with Joe Garcia, the former head of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party, who helped the administration formulate its travel policy. Garcia, who lost to Rivera in the recent congressional race, and Obama had their heart-to-heart at El Mago De Las Fritas on Calle Ocho.

""We talked about Cuba, how to facilitate civil society, how to adjust travel,"" Garcia said.

Garcia and others say Obama has also met with Francisco ""Pepe"" Hernandez, president of the Cuban America National Foundation. (Obama spoke to an audience of nearly 900 people about the need for a new Cuba policy at a CANF luncheon in 2008.) The leading exile group once opposed travel to Cuba but now supports it.

Our efforts to confirm that Hernandez met with Obama were unsuccessful. Three days of calls to CANF weren't returned.

A spokeswoman for the White House declined to release details on any other meetings between Obama and Cuban exile leaders. She referred PolitiFact Florida to an online database that lists White House guests.

Among the White House guests: Mauricio Claver-Carone, a lawyer who's against increased travel to Cuba and represents Cuba Democracy Public Advocacy. He visited 1600 Pennsylvania on Nov. 12, 2009, according to the database.

""It was not to advocate for or against anything,"" Claver-Carone said.

Claver-Carone said he met with a presidential foreign policy adviser, not the president, but couldn't remember his name. 
Separately, Obama has contacted island dissidents. In November 2009 he personally responded to an e-mail message from Generación Y blogger Yoani Sánchez, telling her that her blog ""provides the world a unique window into the realities of daily life in Cuba.""

Rivera's claim is that ""In the past, President Obama has refused to meet with representatives from Cuban exile organizations."" Certainly, he has not met with all the many exile groups -- but he clearly has met with some representatives. We think Rivera overstated in claiming no meetings at all, so we rate his claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC745F80>],/factchecks/2011/feb/02/david-rivera/david-rivera-says-obama-ignored-cuban-exile-commun/
"['Military', 'Nuclear', 'Virginia', 'Bill  Janis']","
Bill Janis says the New START treaty was passed despite significant concerns among U.S. diplomats and military leaders
","
Del. Bill Janis, a Republican from Henrico, recently criticized the U.S. Senate’s ratification of the New START nuclear arms treaty with Russia.

According to a Senate roll call, the vote in favor of ratification was 71-26, with three senators not voting.

Janis, in a Jan. 25 speech on the floor of the House of Delegates, argued the bill was rushed through the ""lame duck"" session of Congress despite ""significant concerns among some people in the State and Defense Departments.""

His comments came when he was speaking in support of a proposed U.S. constitutional amendment that would give states the collective right to repeal any law or regulation passed by Congress.

We wondered about those ""significant concerns"" Janis cited and looked to see if there was indeed major opposition to the treaty among former diplomats and generals.

First, a word about the pact. New START replaces the 1991 START agreement between the United States and Soviet Union. START stands for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The latest agreement was signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dimitry Medvedev.

The treaty limits each nation to 1,550 nuclear warheads, 74 percent lower than the 1991 treaty’s limits. It also contains agreements for each nation to inspect the other’s weapons facilities and exchange missile telemetry. The treaty is set to run for 10 years, with the possibility of being extended for another five years.

When we called Janis, he said his comment was based on news reports saying senators and some former members of the diplomatic corps had concerns about the treaty.

""I saw media reporting where former secretaries of state had concerns,"" he told us.

There are nine living people who have served as Secretary of State: Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, Warren Christopher, Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton.

Clinton, the current secretary of state, has backed the treaty in repeated public statements and praised its eventual ratification.

Kissinger, Shultz, Baker, Eagleburger and Powell, all of whom served Republican presidents, endorsed the treaty in a Dec. 2, 2010 editorial in The Washington Post.

Condoleezza Rice, who served under Republican George W. Bush, backed the treaty in a Dec. 7, 2010 editorial in The Wall Street Journal, though she noted her endorsement carried caveats. She said approval should be accompanied by spending to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal and that the treaty should not establish a link between offensive weapons and missile defense systems.

Madeleine Albright backed the treaty in a separate editorial in The Washington Post. And Warren Christopher’s support was noted in a November statement released by the office of Vice President Joe Biden.

That means every living secretary of state endorsed the treaty. What about at the Defense Department?

When the agreement was announced in March 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said the treaty would ""strengthen nuclear stability"" and that he would work with Congress to ensure ratification.  

Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Join Chiefs of Staff, said ""I, the Vice Chairman, and the Joint Chiefs, as well as our combatant commanders around the world, stand solidly behind this new treaty, having had the opportunity to provide our counsel, to make our recommendations, and to help shape the final agreements.""

But what about opposition from former members of the military or diplomatic corps? After some searching we found that John Bolton, who served as Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations, argued against ratifying the treaty. Bolton, writing with former Bush Justice Department official John Yoo, argued ""New Start’s faults are legion. The low limits it would place on nuclear warheads ignore the enormous disparities between American and Russian global responsibilities and the importance of America’s 'nuclear umbrella' in maintaining international security.""

The men also argued that the treaty would also hinder efforts by the United States to use conventional warheads in future conflicts.

We also found a joint letter opposing the treaty that included the signatures of Bolton; retired Admiral James Lyons, Jr.; retired Major Gen. Paul Vallely; retired Brig Gen. Jimmy Cash; Paula DeSutter, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Verification, Compliance, and Implementation; Fred Iklé, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and Bruce Gelb, the former ambassador to Belgium.  

Let’s review the evidence. In our follow-up interview, Janis said he made his comments to show that the treaty ""was not without controversy."" He also says he thinks the treaty was ""rushed through the ‘lame duck’ Congress.""

Janis has a point about the controversy; the New START treaty had more opposition in the Senate than its two predecessors. The Senate approved the New START treaty on a 71-26 vote. Only four senators opposed START II in 1996, and just six were against the original START treaty in 1992.

But he got it wrong when he said there was opposition from former secretaries of state or top brass in the United States military. And the only truly notable former diplomat we found who opposed the treaty was John Bolton. Other opponents of the treaty existed, but their combined stature is a far cry from the roster of every living secretary of state.

While trying to make a point about the sometimes-contentious treaty debate, Janis exceeded the facts. The treaty was backed by virtually every top official, past and present, at both the State Department and Defense Department. Therefore we find his statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC747580>],/factchecks/2011/feb/02/bill-janis/bill-janis-says-new-start-treaty-was-passed-despit/
"['Jobs', 'Legal Issues', 'Small Business', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says surveys repeatedly showed businesses considered tort reform as a top priority
","
Gov. Scott Walker sounded a bit defensive when signing a lawsuit-reform bill he called for during the Republican-controlled Legislature’s special January session.

Walker told reporters he wanted the bill passed quickly to ease the threat of frivolous litigation, because Wisconsin has ""out of control"" lawsuit abuse -- and employers have made it a top complaint.

We have already tackled the first part of that explanation.

We gave a False ruling to a small business group’s claim that Wisconsin has one of the most anti-business injury-lawsuit systems in the country. (Wisconsin stands out on a few high-profile issues, but is generally rated middle of the pack or even better in legal-climate surveys).

Addressing reporters at a Jan. 27, 2011, bill-signing ceremony, Walker elaborated on the second part of his rationale.

""Time and time again on survey after survey,"" he said, ""employers tell us that one of the most important elements when they are considering expanding and investing in the state, is what the litigation climate is.""

Is lawsuit reform really one of the top priorities for employers seeking a friendlier business climate?

The legislative debate is over. But we thought it was worth a look back as the changes -- which critics say will harm consumer protection in injury cases -- go into effect.

Walker, through spokesman Cullen Werwie, pointed us to four national surveys.

One was a 2010 national poll for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an advocate of easing lawsuits on business. In it, 67% of lawyers for major corporations said  the litigation environment is likely to affect business decisions such as where to do business.

A second --  a 2007 national survey for the chamber -- found half of businesses were concerned about getting unfairly sued. In that group, 11% blamed lawsuit-related business decisions for laying off workers.

The other two surveys, by private groups surveying the public and doctors, showed strong support for tort reform as part of federal health care legislation.

The national surveys don’t break out any state-specific results or rank concerns about the litigation climate against the many other factors that play a role in relocation or expansion decisions.

And Walker did not cite any information specifically about Wisconsin.

So, we went looking for some Wisconsin data -- and what we found did not break in Walker’s favor.

The most on-point data comes from the annual surveys by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, a trade group that represents 3,500 Wisconsin employers.

In June 2010, 263 CEOs responded to the organization’s survey that asked executives to pick ""one thing state government could do to improve Wisconsin’s business climate.""

The result: 1 percent named lawsuit reform.

The group also did a narrower 2010 survey, of the group’s board of directors. None named it, and over the last five years just 3 percent to 6.4 percent of board members mentioned it.

In a prior survey of its full membership, in 2001, the WMC did not even put tort reform on the list of possible answers to that question.

In 2010, lawsuit reform tied for lowest among 10 concerns in the membership survey. Topping the wish list: reduced taxes, less regulation and cuts in government spending.

The song was the same when the membership was asked to name ""one thing state government could do to help your business."" Lawsuit reform was a non-issue (0 percent) in most years, with a spike to 10 percent in 2004.

WMC is most often associated with big business, but has a mix of members. What about small business?

We checked with the state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business. The chapter made the claim that we rated False about Wisconsin having one of the most unfriendly legal climates for business in the United States.

The group’s state director, Bill Smith, said lawsuit reform is always among the five or six concerns of small businesses, but it’s hard to rank the issues. The group hasn’t polled its members specifically on it.

Meanwhile, when the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce surveys its members, it  lumps lawsuit reform in with regulation, so it’s impossible to say how big an issue it is.

The lessons from these surveys: Lawsuit reform is a minor concern, or at least doesn’t stand out from the pack when businesses spell out what they want from government. But worries about lawsuits and their effect on business decisions are pretty widespread.

Nevertheless, the business community has made a high-profile push in recent years to get changes in the legal climate. Various business and industry organizations even formed a coalition to lobby on the issue. Business concerns grew after Wisconsin Supreme Court rulings and legislative tussles broke out with Democrats over damages and liability in negligence cases.

""Once businesses get sued, they get more concerned,"" said Jim Pugh of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce.

He argues that legal reform is widely desired by business, but overshadowed by taxation and spending concerns: ""You have to look beyond surveys.""

So where does this leave us?

In trying to tie the lawsuit reforms to job creation, Walker asserted the issue is ""one of the most important factors"" when businesses are deciding to expand or invest in Wisconsin. That’s a major overreach. He cited a series of national surveys, which show it’s a concern but lack Wisconsin data and don’t weigh how the concern stacks up against other issues. In the surveys of state businesses we found, lawsuit reform is on the radar screen -- but a blip behind taxes, regulation and other issues.

We rate Walker’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD76C00>],/factchecks/2011/feb/02/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-surveys-repeatedly-showed-bu/
"['Oregon', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'John  Kitzhaber']","
John Kitzhaber says proposed budget represents increase in state funding for schools
","
Before Gov. John Kitzhaber released his budget proposal for the next two-year cycle, he gave a few hints at how he’d budget some of the biggest pieces of state government. In an e-mail sent out before the Feb. 1, 2011, budget announcement, he says he’ll allocate some $5.56 billion for the state’s K-12 public school system.

But that’s not all. He gets even more specific. Kitzhaber plans to make 52 percent of the total (about $2.89 billion) available in the first year of the cycle.

This, he says, is the ""equivalent to a $5.78 billion budget for school funding. The effect is to provide an increase in state funding for the 2011-12 school year.""

That, naturally, piqued our curiosity given that most of what you hear down in Salem is worrying comments about how education will have to take a cut going forward. And yet, here’s Kitzhaber talking about increased spending.

Could he really be offering the schools more money next year? We decided to find out.

To start off, it’s helpful to have a clear understanding of where funding is currently. The thing is, the budget for public education has fluctuated several times over the past couple of years. The state revenue forecast is consistently down, which has led to reductions in the budget. Meanwhile, there’s been movement on the federal level to kick funds to states, which have helped balance, in part, some of those earlier cuts. But not all of them.

To get the most recent number, we called Oregon's Legislative Fiscal Office. According to the office’s most recent calculations, K-12 education is operating on a budget of $5.756 billion. Thatincludes the promise of $35.5 million from a state education stability fund, which may or may not come through. But, for the purpose of this article, we’ll keep it in the total.

Of that $5.75 billion, $342 million has come from the federal government in various forms and $5.41 billion has come from the state. To parse it even more (who doesn’t love lots of numbers?), $2.94 billion went to schools during the 2009-10 school year, while the remaining $2.82 billion went to schools for the current year.

So, let’s compare these numbers to what Kitzhaber is proposing.  According to the e-mail statement, Kitzhaber is suggesting a K-12 budget of $5.56 billion for the next two-year period. But for next year in particular, he is suggesting $2.89 billion go to schools. That’s a clear increase in funding (not just state funding, but overall funding) this year over next, by about $70 million.

Still, it’s important to note here, that funding, overall, will take a hit. Sure, the state is throwing in more cash for the upcoming biennium than it did the current -- about an extra $150 million. And yes, the school system will have more cash to work with next year than it did this year. But overall the biennium’s budget is down, $5.756 billion to $5.56 billion. That’s because the state’s increase in funding still doesn't offset lost federal dollars.

What’s more, under Kitzhaber’s proposal, that reduction will be felt strongest come the 2012-13 school year. Whereas there will be a $70 million more to work with next year, as compared to the current school year, there will be a $150 million decrease the following year, if you use the current year as the baseline.

By front-loading 2012, you necessarily leave 2013 with a smaller slice of the funds.

Kitzhaber explains his logic in the e-mail: ""Front-loading the funding also provides a year to find cost savings through consolidation and other efficiencies to maintain this level of classroom support during the 2012-13 school year.""

Whether those cost savings will be realized, nobody can say, so we’ll stick the initial statement, which is that this proposed budget represents an increase in state funding for the upcoming 2011-12 school year. Kitzhaber is right, it does. That said, it’s important to recognize that even with the increase in state funds, the school system will have to make do with less sooner or later. Kitzhaber seems to have chosen later.

Since we think that bit of context is important, we rate this claim Mostly True.

Rep. Jim Renacci characterizes Medicare savings in health reform law as cuts
","
Less than a week after taking office as a member of Congress, GOP Rep. Jim Renacci held his first town hall meeting at Walsh University in North Canton. Local news reports indicated about 225 people attended, some of whom grilled Renacci about his campaign pledge to overturn the health care reform bill that Congress adopted last year.

In an exchange between Renacci and a senior citizen identified as Dan Fonte, Fonte cites facets of the the health care bill that he approves of, and asks Renacci why Republicans don’t present a replacement plan for people to examine before the repeal vote. Renacci replies that he and more than 80 other freshmen Republicans were elected to Congress with pledges to repeal the new law.

""I agree with you, there are some good things, but there are also a half a trillion dollars in cuts to Medicare that are going to go in place,"" Renacci told Fonte.

That statement had a familiar ring to it. We decided it was one worth another look.

Renacci’s exchange with his constituent hit on the same themes as the health care debate in 2010. And more than once during the election season we looked at the claims from Republicans and groups that opposed the reforms that the health care package would cut $500 billion from Medicare.

But it’s important to note that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, as Renacci and the bill’s foes make it sound. Rather, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act slows the program’s projected growth in Medicare spending by about $500 billion over 10 years.

That’s a big difference.

Medicare spending will still increase. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated it will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.

About $136 billion in savings is projected to come from Medicare Advantage, an optional program where the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare recipients. About a quarter of Medicare recipients were enrolled in the Medicare Advantage plans in 2010, which often offer benefits like dental and vision coverage that aren’t available to traditional Medicare beneficiaries.

It was hoped that competition between private insurers for Medicare Advantage programs would drive down costs and make the system more efficient, ultimately saving the federal government money. But it has not worked out that way. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said the Advantage programs cost taxpayers an average of 14 percent more than traditional Medicare.

The health care law that President Barack Obama signed in March will phase out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare.

The law aims to save the Medicare program another $220 billion by reducing annual payment increases health care providers would otherwise get. More savings would come from requiring seniors with yearly incomes over $85,000, or $170,000 for couples, to pay higher Medicare premiums.

PolitiFact examined repeated claims by politicians and interest groups in 2010 that the health care reform bill would cut Medicare by $500 billion, including one by the 60 Plus Association in an attack ad against Renacci’s election opponent, Democrat John Boccieri. Each time the claim was found to be Barely True, no matter who or where it was uttered.

Neither a new year, nor the GOP takeover of the House of Representatives makes it any more accurate.

We still rate the claim as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECADE400>],/factchecks/2011/feb/02/jim-renacci/rep-jim-renacci-characterizes-medicare-savings-hea/

Georgia is second fastest-growing state for tourism, official says
","
Who needs the Statue of Liberty to draw tourists when you have the Big Chicken?

Georgia’s new economic development commissioner, Chris Cummiskey, surprised us when he made this claim during a recent state budget hearing:

""We are the second-fastest-growing state for international tourists.""

Virginia, the commissioner said, is first.

So Georgia had a greater increase in international tourists than New York, home to Broadway, Lady Liberty and the amazing Manhattan skyline? The Peach State’s tourism market is growing faster than the market in California, the land of Hollywood and Disneyland? Georgia is ahead of Florida, where you can sunbathe in February on South Beach?

Really?

AJC PolitiFact Georgia went searching for answers.

Georgia Economic Development Department spokeswoman Alison Tyrer directed us to a 2009 study by the federal government about international tourism broken down by each state. In 2008, an estimated 634,000 international tourists came to Georgia, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration. About 689,000 international tourists visited the Peach State the following year, the federal agency reported. That’s nearly a 9 percent increase. A survey examining international tourism in 2010 has not been done yet, the ITA said.

The top markets for international tourists who visited Georgia were the United Kingdom, Germany, the Caribbean, the Netherlands, France and Brazil, according to an ITA spokeswoman. In Atlanta, the tourists like to go to attractions such as the Georgia Aquarium. They also enjoy the Georgia coastline and are curious about the state’s antebellum architecture.

Virginia had a 16 percent increase, according to the study. New York, Florida, California, Nevada and Hawaii ranked first through fifth in the number of international tourists, but only two of those five states (Florida and Hawaii) actually had more international tourists in 2009 than 2008, the ITA found. Hawaii had a 2 percent increase, while the number of international tourists who visited Florida increased by 1 percent.

The ITA report found Atlanta had the greatest percentage increase of international tourists of the nation’s top 20 markets.

Georgia is well-known as a state that hosts many conventions. But we also know Georgia has Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the world’s busiest airport. So we wondered, perhaps, if these tourists were visiting the area overnight and whether the ITA’s numbers were deceptive. An ITA spokeswoman said the agency did not have specific data for how long people stayed in Georgia. An Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau spokeswoman said the average tourist stays in Atlanta about two or three days.

So what’s bringing these international tourists to Georgia? Cory Churches, the ITA spokeswoman, believes part of the explanation may be the merger of Delta Air Lines with Northwest Airlines in 2008.

""Delta Air Lines has been enhancing its ATL [Atlanta] hub presence, including international routes, since the merger with Northwest,"" Churches said.

Delta has been eager to have more international flights, said Lauren Jarrell, the communications director for the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported Delta’s desire to have 50 percent of its business be the more lucrative international flights. Jarrell said more conventioneers are coming from outside the country. For example, Jarrell said 56 percent of the attendees to one convention were international.

Tyrer, the state economic development spokeswoman, said Delta’s push for more international flights has helped. She also said the department has been more aggressive in marketing Georgia in other countries, particularly China and Germany, as a tourist destination. Georgia has had a tourism representative in the U.K. for about 10 years, Tyrer said.

The numbers in the federal report accurately reflect what the commissioner told state lawmakers in the budget hearing. We rate Cummiskey’s statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB846580>],/factchecks/2011/feb/02/chris-cummiskey/georgia-second-fastest-growing-state-tourism-offic/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Mike Villarreal']","
Mike Villarreal says Texas population grew three times faster than state tax system in last decade
","
State Rep. Mike Villarreal maintains the state tax system, untended by ruling Republicans, needs a full review. In a Jan. 7 op-ed column in the San Antonio Express-News, the San Antonio Democrat wrote that ""Republicans have ignored the fact that over the last decade our population has been growing three times faster than our state tax system.""

We’re not gauging what Republicans notice, but wondered if Villarreal correctly compared population growth and state taxes.

In an interview, Villarreal told us he drew his population counts from the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, and fiscal information from annual cash reports by the state comptroller’s office, adjusting figures for inflation to reflect 2009 dollars. Villarreal said he considered all state taxes including sales and franchise taxes and taxes on motor fuels, vehicle sales, tobacco and alcohol products, insurance and oil and natural gas production.
 
He said he prepared a spreadsheet in consultation with experts including Dale Craymer, president of the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, and Eva De Luna Castro, senior budget analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities, which has made a case for Texas to create a state personal income tax.

According to Villarreal, the state’s population increased 19 percent from 1999 to 2009, from 20.9 million to 24.8 million. In 2000, according to Villarreal, inflation-adjusted state taxes generated $35.8 billion. In 2009, the comparable total was $37.8 billion, up 6 percent.

So, Villarreal said, population increased three times faster than annual state tax revenue.

What we noticed: Villarreal’s spreadsheet also showed that money from non-tax revenue such as state fees went up 13 percent, trailing population growth, while federal aid surged 47 percent, more than double the rate of population growth. State income from all sources, including federal aid, increased 26 percent.

Next, Villarreal shared a revised spreadsheet indicating that revenue from all sources increased 19 percent--not 26 percent. In an e-mail, Villarreal said he fixed an error ""that had me over-counting non-tax revenue and as a result over-counting"" total revenue from all sources. He said he’d inadvertently double-counted the federal aid, but stressed the error did not bear on his comparison of state taxes to population growth.

Even in the revised version, we noted, all revenue to state government increased at about the same pace as population growth. Villarreal agreed, but said that the bulk of money from all sources--which broke down in 2009 to 45 percent from state taxes, 18.5 percent from state non-tax revenue and 37 percent from federal funds--consists of dollars dedicated to specific purposes. His point: Lawmakers can’t easily tap such sources, which include public college tuition, to support general needs such as public education and health care.

We sought outside perspective.

Craymer of TTARA, which represents businesses and trade associations, said Villarreal’s work leads to a flawed conclusion--that the state’s main revenue source, the sales tax, is undependable.

""If there is a systemic problem with the tax system,"" Craymer said, ""it’s probably that it reflects the economy,"" which was rocked by two recessions in the decade. ""So it’s not surprising to me that sales taxes would not have kept pace with population.""

Craymer said too that any analysis varies due to the time period it covers. For instance, he said, sales tax revenues steadily rose from 2005 through 2007.

Lobbyist James LeBas, formerly the state’s chief revenue estimator, offered a per-person breakdown of Texas taxes over the decade, adjusted for inflation, which also took into account property taxes levied by local governmental units. LeBas, who said his figures came from the comptroller’s office, said in an e-mail that from 2000 to 2010, taxes per person grew slightly faster than inflation--by 37 percent compared to the 27 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index. In 2000, he said, Texas taxes per person, adjusted for inflation, amounted to $2,180; the 2010 figure was $2,195.

LeBas, summing up, said the tax system ""has produced a stable, if unremarkable, amount of revenue per capita, even adjusted for inflation.""

We asked De Luna of the CPPP for her perspective on per-capita state plus local taxes. She suggested that combining state taxes and locally levied property taxes obscures the fact state taxes have dropped. Drawing on figures published by the comptroller in January 2011, she said 3.6 percent of personal income in Texas went to state taxes in 2010--down from the 4.4-percent level of 2001.

Next, we asked LeBas to focus on state taxes alone. He reported that inflation-adjusted per-capita state taxes were $1,210 in 2000 but $1,145 in 2009. The 5-percent decrease reflected slower growth in state taxes than population.

DeLuna floated another way to pit changes in taxes and population. She said average annual rates of change can be more  meaningful than comparing a recent year to an earlier year. The year-by-year average ""helps put numbers in a better context for the average person,"" she said. From 1999 to 2009, she said, the state’s average annual population growth, 2 percent, compared to inflation-adjusted growth in state revenue of .8 percent and inflation-adjusted growth in all funds of 1.7 percent.

Finally, we asked DeLuna the question we’d asked Villarreal: If revenue to the state from all sources pretty much kept pace with population growth, should there be a beef? DeLuna replied that revenue from all sources soared mainly because of federal aid, which the comptroller expects to drop in 2012-13. Also, she said, lawmakers perpetually added to the state’s funding burdens in 2006 by cutting local school property tax rates and committing the state to cover the difference going forward.

Phew. What a seminar.

Our take: Villarreal’s analysis disregards that state revenue from all sources, in part due to increased federal aid, about matched population growth from 2000 through 2009. He also disregards property taxes, which are affected by legislative decisions.

That said, his statement accurately compares population to state taxes, which are, as he said, the taxes lawmakers directly set.

","
A freshman Florida lawmaker is grabbing national headlines for sponsoring a bill that would make it a felony for doctors to ask their patients if they own guns.

State Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, has filed HB 155, the Privacy of Firearms Owners Act, which seeks to punish doctors with fines up to a $5 million for asking a patient or a patient's family about gun ownership and gun habits. The proposal is a reaction to American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, which encourage physicians to counsel parents on creating a safe home environment and offering advice to avoid preventable accidents. The long list of recommendations includes mainly innocuous tips like ""Keep plastic bags and balloons away from your children,"" and ""NEVER place an infant in front of an air bag.""

Physicians also are encouraged to tell parents to remove guns from places where children live and play.

""More than 5,000 children and adolescents are killed by gunfire each year -- injuries almost always inflicted by themselves, a sibling or a friend,"" the doctor's group says as part of suggested counseling for parents. ""Handguns are especially dangerous. If you choose to keep a gun at home, store it unloaded in a locked place. Lock and store the ammunition in a separate place.""

Brodeur says the advice is out of bounds and that it infringes on people's privacy protections. The controversial measure has proven fodder for CNN's Anderson Cooper.

But what has so far been left out of the debate is Brodeur's suggestion that his bill could have even more privacy implications because of the passage of the federal health care overhaul in 2010. The law is now facing an aggressive court challenge.

Speaking to the Fort Myers News-Press, Brodeur said he's concerned about doctors asking patients about guns in the home and then allowing that information to get into the hands of the government or insurance companies.

""What we don't want to do is have law-abiding firearm owners worried that the information is going to be recorded and then sent to their insurance company,"" Brodeur said. ""If the overreaching federal government actually takes over health care, they're worried that Washington, D.C., is going to know whether or not they own a gun and so this is really just a privacy protection.""

The federal health care law is 974 pages long -- long enough for important details to get sometimes overlooked (we like this one) and long enough for outrageous claims (like here, and here, and our favorite, here.)

We wondered where Brodeur's claim fit in.

The health care law and guns

So much can be revealed by simply reading the health care law, formally called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Or if that's too much -- just try searching for keywords. We accessed the final version of the law through the White House's web site.

Then we searched for the word ""gun.""

Here's what we found: ""(c) PROTECTION OF SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS."" So we read on.

The gun provision of the law has two main thrusts -- that no one in the government can use the health care law to collect gun information and that insurance companies cannot adjust their rates because someone owns a gun.

""A premium rate may not be increased, health insurance coverage may not be denied, and a discount, rebate, or reward offered for participation in a wellness program may not be reduced or withheld under any health benefit plan issued pursuant to or in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or an amendment made by that Act on the basis of, or on reliance upon -- (A) the lawful ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition; or (B) the lawful use or storage of a firearm or ammunition,"" the law reads in part.

That gun language was added by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid specifically to placate gun owners, who argued that the health care law could be used as a way for the federal government to create a national gun registry or charge gun owners more for insurance. So to avoid any (more) backlash about the law, Reid included a provision to further protect gun owners from either seeing their insurance rates increase, or from having their names collected and entered into some federal gun owner database.

""In the face of all this abuse, Senator Reid was pressured by Gun Owners of America and his constituents into making a face-saving move,"" the lobbying group Gun Owners of America wrote on its blog. ""He wanted to silence the pro-gun community’s objections, so he took steps to strip the bill of any gun rights concerns.""

More on a gun registry

The health care law cannot be used to collect gun data, and it cannot be used to raise the insurance premiums of gun owners. But we wanted to step back and ask an even more basic question. Does the federal government keep a database of gun owners as Brodeur is asserting?

""There is no national firearms registry,"" said Jim Wright, a gun policy expert who teaches at the University of Central Florida.

William J. Vizzard, a criminal justice professor at California State University Sacramento who spent 27 years working for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, agreed. The government does track some high-powered weapons like machine guns, grenades and short-barreled shotguns but not common firearms like handguns and rifles. There is no searchable database, and records are kept with gun dealers, Vizzard said.

Some states do register firearms, said Daniel Vice, a senior attorney at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. But not Florida.

""To say this is a response to Obamacare would be less accurate than to say this is in response to a more general problem going on long before Obamacare,"" added David Kopel, research director of the conservative-leaning Independence Institute and an adjunct professor of law at the University of Denver.

Kopel said he believes the real issue is with the proliferation of electronic medical records, which means that if a doctor asks a patient about guns, a permanent electronic record will be created and maintained. And though that record cannot be expressly used by insurance companies or the government, the record exists.

His point might be worth discussing. But in this case, it's not what we're checking.

Our ruling

We left a message with Brodeur's legislative office, but did not hear back.

Brodeur told the News-Press that his bill -- which would prevent doctors from asking patients if they own a gun -- was crafted to combat privacy concerns resulting from the passage of the federal health care law.

It turns out Brodeur's trying to right a ""wrong"" that isn't wrong.

The health care law included specific protections for gun owners -- so they wouldn't see insurance premium increases and their information wouldn't be included in a gun owner database or registry. We find this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6E5840>],/factchecks/2011/feb/01/jason-brodeur/florida-lawmaker-suggests-doctors-can-use-gun-info/

Mark Warner says U.S. tax breaks outweigh income tax receipts
","
U.S. Sen. Mark Warner says it’s time for Congress ""to put up or shut up"" in addressing the national debt.

The Virginia Democrat, with Sen.Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga. is preparing a bill that would pare  debt through a regimen of spending cuts and tax reforms certain to leave everyone in pain. Among the most controversial aspects will be proposals to change deduction guidelines for home mortgage interest and to phase in personal income taxes on health care benefits provided by employers.

The bill will revive a comprehensive series of budget overhauls urged last fall by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, a panel of fiscal experts appointed by the White House and Congress. The recommendations were set back last fall when they failed to receive a super majority of votes needed on the bipartisan commission to advance them to Congress.

Warner, in a Jan. 25 interview on Fox News, said ending popular tax breaks must be must be part of any formula to significantly reduce debt.

""I don’t think that most Americans realize that we actually spend more on tax expenditures, or tax breaks, than we collect in personal income taxes each year,"" he said. ""So that has to be on the table, also.""

Personal incomes taxes are the federal government’s largest revenue source, providing 45 percent of its tax receipts. Is Uncle Sam exempting more than he’s taking in? We checked.

Warner’s office sent us data from the Office of Management and Budget that show the senator is correct.

The spread sheets show during the last two fiscal years combined, the U.S. collected $1.85 trillion in personal income taxes and allowed $2.17 trillion in income tax breaks to individuals and corporations.

During the current fiscal year, the U.S. is projected to take in $1.12 trillion in personal income taxes while allowing individuals and corporations $1.66 trillion in breaks.

We wondered if Warner was stacking the deck by sending us spread sheets that compared the revenues from personal income tax payments to the money Washington forsakes in tax breaks to individuals as well as corporations.

So we untangled the numbers. Computing data in a Dec. 21 report by the Joint Committee on Taxation, we found that individuals receive about 91 percent of the value of income tax breaks, with corporations getting the rest.

That means during the last two fiscal years, individuals received a total of about $1.98 trillion in breaks for the $1.85 trillion in income tax they paid. Warner’s claim, in other words, holds true when compare you the income tax paid by individuals to the tax breaks they receive.

The largest break to individuals is not having to pay income taxes on their employers’ contributions to their personal health care and health insurance premiums. That’s worth about $132 billion a year in taxes. The commission, whose work Warner wants to revive in his bill, recommended phasing out the break by 2038.

Second biggest break is the net exclusion of pension contributions and earnings, worth about $119 billion a year.in annual taxes. The commission said the break should be examined and perhaps capped.

The popular mortgage-interest deduction is worth $97 billion a year. The commission proposed that the deduction be limited to principle residences only and that eligible mortgages be capped at $500,000 instead of the current $1 million limit. The group also proposed a 12 percent nonrefundable mortgage-interest tax credit for all filers who own homes.

Under the commission’s proposal, individuals would be compensated for some of the loss in tax breaks by lowering the rates charged in all income tax brackets.

The commission recommended a long series of tax reforms, spending cuts and pro-growth policies that it said would reduce debt by $3.9 trillion by the end of the decade. The tax changes would lead lead to $785 billion in debt reduction.

Let’s review.

Warner says the U.S. gives up more in income tax breaks than it receives in income tax revenues. Anyway you dice the figures, he’s right. We rate his statement: True.
