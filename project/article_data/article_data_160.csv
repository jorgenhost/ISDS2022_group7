Did Scott Brown flip-flop on supporting Paul Ryan's budget plan?
","
The budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- which would make deep spending cuts, hold the line on taxes and significantly change Medicare for those younger than 55 -- has become a key battleground between the two parties.

The plan won passage in the House, with almost all Republicans and no Democrats voting for it. But Democrats have made the dangers of Ryan’s proposed changes to Medicare a major talking point, seeking to pin Republicans down on whether they support Ryan’s vision.

First, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich prompted a media firestorm for seeming to change his position on the Ryan plan. We rated Gingrich’s position a Full Flop.

Now, Sen. Scott Brown -- the Republican who won a special election in 2010 to fill the Massachusetts seat long held by the late Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy -- is attracting attention for his own possible flip-flop.

According to the Newburyport Daily News -- a newspaper in northeastern Massachusetts -- Brown made reference to the Ryan plan during an annual luncheon of the Greater Newburyport Chamber of Commerce & Industry on May 13, 2011.

""The leaders will bring forward (Ryan's) budget, and I will vote for it, and it will fail,"" Brown said. ""Then the president will bring forward his budget, and it will fail. It will be great fodder for the commercials.""

Ten days later, Brown authored an op-ed in the political newspaper POLITICO that was headlined, ""Why I don't back Paul Ryan's Medicare plan.""

""While I applaud Ryan for getting the conversation started, I cannot support his specific plan — and therefore will vote ‘no’ on his budget,"" Brown wrote.

A ""no"" vote on the Ryan plan is considered safer for Brown. Massachusetts voters historically lean Democratic, and Republicans who win election are usually moderate.

So in his Newburyport speech, Brown said he’d vote for the Ryan plan, while in his op-ed 10 days later, he said he’d vote against it.

When we took these two comments to Brown’s press staff, spokesman Colin Reed said, ""He was making the point in Newburyport that political games are being played in Washington, but was not commenting on the merits of the bill.""

We agree that in his Newburyport comment, Brown focuses on the gamesmanship of budget-writing in Washington rather than on the nitty-gritty of its policy details. Meanwhile, in the POLITICO column, Brown was careful to praise Ryan’s role in starting the ""conversation"" even as he declared opposition to his plan. These suggest a somewhat nuanced position.

Still, Brown did indicate pretty clearly in Newburyport that he would cast a loyal GOP vote for the plan, even if he expected that the vote would ultimately prove fruitless. Then 10 days later, in the POLITICO op-ed, he made clear that he wasn’t just disappointed by the Ryan plan but would definitely vote ""no.""

Anyone reading his comments in the Newburyport Daily News would be under the impression Brown was voting for the Ryan budget, but he's not. So we give Brown a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C40CE80>],/factchecks/2011/may/23/scott-brown/did-scott-brown-flip-flop-supporting-paul-ryans-bu/

Conservative PAC claims new government regulations will force consumers to buy light bulbs that cost six times more
","
Is the government going to force you to buy light bulbs that cost $50?

That's just one claim from opponents of new light bulb efficiency standards. We are fact-checking several claims from the fundraising letter circulated by AmeriPAC, a conservative political action committee, and the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise (CDFE) Action Fund, which seeks contributions and support for a bill to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.

In this item, we will address the groups' claim that the law will force consumers to buy light bulbs that are significantly more expensive than conventional light bulbs sold today.

The groups contend that the law -- which is being rolled out in phases -- will ""outlaw"" incandescent light bulbs in favor of compact fluorescent bulbs. It's a claim we rated Pants on Fire, for reasons that have an impact on this claim as well. But we'll get to that in a bit.

First, here's the wording of the claim in a letter from CDFE:

""Democrats in Congress passed legislation that raises the cost of a single light bulb to $50!""

Ron Arnold of CDFE backed up this claim with a link to a May 16, 2011, AP story about two leading light bulb makers showcasing LED bulbs that are bright enough to replace the 100 watt light bulbs that will be phased out in January -- and which were projected to cost about $50 each.

Later in its letter, the CDFE claims that ""the new light bulbs will cost roughly six times the cost of the light bulbs we now use.""

The letter quotes a Dec. 19, 2007, study from US News and World Report which states, ""Each cone-shaped spiral CFL [compact fluorescent light] costs about $3, compared with 50 cents for a standard bulb.""

There are, however, two major problems with the claims in the letter. The first, said Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, is that there are two costs to a light bulb: the front-end cost of a light bulb at the store and the cost of electricity to operate it.

The CDFE letter only considers one side of the equation -- the up-front cost.

The curly-shaped compact fluorescent light bulbs use about 75 percent less electricity than comparable incandescent bulbs and last about 10 times longer, according to an analysis by the Department of Energy. As a result, the DOE concluded, ""typical CFLs can pay for themselves in less than nine months and then start saving you money each month.""

That point would have been clear had the CDFE letter contained the full context of the study from US News and World Report, instead of just cherry-picking one sentence.

Here's how the fuller Q & A reads:

How do I save money, when a CFL costs six times as much as an old-fashioned bulb?

Each cone-shaped spiral CFL costs about $3, compared with 50 cents for a standard bulb. But a CFL uses about 75 percent less energy and lasts five years instead of a few months. A household that invested $90 in changing 30 fixtures to CFLs would save $440 to $1,500 over the five-year life of the bulbs, depending on your cost of electricity. Look at your utility bill and imagine a 12 percent discount to estimate the savings.

As for LED light bulbs, it's true that some were put on the market with a $50 price tag, but the Department of Energy and most industry experts expect that price to come down dramatically as more products enter the market. Also not mentioned is that LED lights use about 20 to 25 percent of the energy of a traditional incandescent equivalent, and the LED light can last up to 25 times longer.

The other problem with the claim in the CDFE letter is that it assumes the law will limit light bulb options to either fluorescent or LED bulbs.

In fact, however, all of the major light bulb manufacturers have developed new halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the law's new efficiency standards.

We spoke to Randy Moorhead, vice president of government affairs at Philips, which began selling its latest halogen incandescent bulbs at Home Depot in April.  Moorhead said the EcoVantage light bulb -- which puts off as much light as a traditional 100 watt bulb -- comes with a suggested retail price of $1.49. That's roughly triple the cost of the existing 100 watt bulbs. However, it saves about $3.36 is reduced energy costs to the customer over the 1,000-hour life of the bulb, he said. In other words, the bulb may cost $1 more up front, but saves $3.36 in energy costs -- for a net savings of $2.35. Philips also offers a premium bulb that costs even more up-front but saves more over the life of the bulb.

The Department of Energy put out a fact-sheet detailing the up-front costs and longer-term energy costs of all the light bulb options.

The data is clear, said, Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, while light bulbs that meet the new efficiency standard cost more than the traditional incandescent light bulbs, ""the energy savings more than pays off the extra cost.""

We asked Arnold, who penned the CDFE letter, about the potential long-term cost-savings of the more energy efficient bulbs.

""We're not obligated to tell the other guy's side of the story,"" Arnold said.

Perhaps not, but we think it's awfully misleading to warn about up-front cost without also mentioning the longer-term savings. The claims in the CDFE letter also assume that consumers will have no options come January when the new efficiency standards kick in. Even if you consider only the up-front cost of light bulbs, consumers would not be obligated to buy LED bulbs that cost as much as $50 apiece; nor would they be forced to purchase fluorescent alternatives that go for $3 apiece. There also are halogen incandescent bulbs for $1.49. It's true that all of these options will cost more at the store than traditional incandescent bulbs cost today. But when you factor in the cost of electricity needed to power the light bulb, they will end up costing significantly less. We rate the claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967AC280>],/factchecks/2011/may/23/ameripac/conservative-pac-claims-new-government-regulations/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Rich Zipperer']","
State Sen. Rich Zipperer says deregulation of the telecommunications industry will create 50,000 jobs in Wisconsin
","
Wisconsin law governing telecommunications hasn’t been changed since the days of beepers and fax machines. As one industry executive put it, the industry is regulated by rotary-phone laws in a smart-phone era.

That’s why a telecom deregulation bill sped through both houses of the Legislature with relatively little opposition. The measure is the first major revision of the state telecommunications law since 1994, and would, among other things, remove regulations that force phone companies to invest in old-fashioned land lines.

One premise of the bill -- approved by wide bipartisan margins in the Senate and Assembly on May 11, 2011 -- is that if telephone companies are no longer forced to spend money on old technology, they’ll instead pour resources into broadband for high speed Internet service.

And that will lead to economic growth.

How much growth?

The new law could create 50,000 jobs, according to a study cited by state Sen. Rich Zipperer, R-Pewaukee, one of the measure’s main sponsors. He made the claim in interviews with the Journal Sentinel April 26 and May 4 and in testimony about the bill.

Others, including top telecom executives, used the figure at public hearings, with one saying it could mean $2.6 billion in new investment in the state.

And the jobs figure showed up in a report by the Discovery Institute, commissioned by Wired Wisconsin, a group pushing for broadband expansion, and the Wisconsin Technology Council, a nonprofit and nonpartisan group that advises the governor and Legislature and encourages networking and economic development. The Discovery Institute is a conservative Seattle-based think tank best known for advocating ""intelligent design"" creationism.

Fifty thousand jobs? Sounds like a no-brainer. And a big down payment on Gov. Scott Walker’s goal of creating 250,000 jobs in the next four years.

But what’s the basis for the numbers?

When we dug into the data (and news release) trail, what we found resembled an old-fashioned game of telephone, where something is repeated again and again and then changed in small ways to suit political arguments.

First, let’s be clear: The jobs claim doesn’t relate directly to telephone service or the people who work for the phone company. One expert, Barry Orton, a University of Wisconsin-Madison telecommunications professor, believes deregulation could result in job cuts because the phone companies would need fewer workers to handle landlines.

Rather, the advertised jobs and economic boom would come from more people using high speed Internet, which would presumably improve efficiency among other things.

The 50,000 number stems from a broadband expansion project called ConnectKentucky staged in that state between 2005 and 2007.  

The project included increased publicity about broadband, and, in some cases, gave people free computers.  A key result  was that 7 percent more people signed up for broadband service. The survey estimated consumer savings in time, miles driven and health care and calculated the impact on job creation and retention thanks to broadband.

ConnectKentucky was transformed into a national project called Connected Nation. That group took the Kentucky results -- the 7 percent increase -- and extrapolated the economic impact of broadband adoption for each state and the country as a whole.

For Wisconsin, Connected Nation says the increased use in broadband would lead to an ""direct annual income growth of $1.8 billion,"" and 50,748 jobs created or saved, with a total economic impact of $2.6 billion.

These numbers assume that broadband service is as widely available and attracts subscribers in the same way it was in Kentucky five to seven years ago.

The Kentucky and national ""Connect"" groups have drawn criticism for their ties to the telecommunications industry.

""ConnectKentucky is nothing more than a sales force and front group for AT&T paid for by the telecommunications industry and by state and federal governments that has achieved far more in publicity than it has in actual accomplishment,"" telecom expert Art Brodsky wrote  Jan. 9, 2008 in a blog on the Public Knowledge site.

Brian Mefford, Connected Nation’s CEO, issued a rebuttal that said the blog was inaccurate, and that Bellsouth/AT&T’s contributions accounted for a fraction of ConnectKentucky’s revenue.

In any case, the study did not look specifically at the situation in Wisconsin, including the current economic climate, and was done by a group that has ties to the industry, which is seeking deregulation.

So, its conclusions are on shaky ground from the start.

There have been other efforts to estimate how an expansion of broadband service will lead to economic growth.

The Connect group and others rely upon a 2007 study by the Brookings Institution, a moderate to liberal-leaning think tank, that created a formula to gauge the economic impact of broadband expansion.

""A one percentage point increase — equal to roughly 3 million lines — is associated with nearly 300,000 more jobs, assuming that the economy is not already at full employment (or the lowest rate of unemployment that can be achieved with a low, stable rate of inflation). Obviously, such a projection is subject to estimation error and depends on the existence of some slack in the labor market.""

But those projections were from 2007 -- before the worst recession in more than 70 years kicked in.

Yet another jobs yardstick is found in a 2010 study by the Communication Workers of America, which provides no attribution for its figures, but seems to rely in part on the Brookings report.

The CWA study says: ""Studies show that each additional $5 billion investment  in broadband creates 250,000 jobs – 100,000 direct and indirect jobs from telecom and IT equipment spending plus another 150,000 in ‘network effects’ spurring new online applications and services. With every percentage point increase in broadband penetration, employment expands by nearly 300,000 jobs.""

That report did not provide a Wisconsin-specific number.

Asked about the estimate he has cited, Zipperer said it’s impossible to predict how many jobs will stem from deregulating landline telephone service.

""I don’t know exactly how many jobs it’s going to create,"" he said in an interview.

Asked why he cites the 50,000 figure, he responded: ""because it’s the only number that’s been out there. That’s the number that’s out there from one organization.""

Wired Wisconsin executive director Thad Nation said telecom companies have made ""no direct promises"" about how much they will expand broadband service. He said the 50,000 jobs figure is ""speculation.""

The group notes that Ohio and Illinois deregulated their phone companies and have seen a growth in investment from companies thanks to expanded broadband service.

Look at one report from an Ohio tech group.

The largest recent item in the report tied to job creation was from October: $57,400,000 from First Energy Service Co. in Akron to update the smart grid. 2,870 potential jobs created.*

The asterisk leads to the CWA formula -- in other words, it’s an estimate that leads back, again, to the Brookings formula.

Clearly high speed Internet service helps people and businesses work more efficiently.

Indeed, TDS Telecommunications Corp., a phone company that is shifting its emphasis to broadband, TDS has invested $100 million in Wisconsin in the past three years, and is advertising 60 job openings based on future growth.

But the question at hand is the use of the oft-cited 50,000 number.

In arguing for deregulation, Zipperer -- and others -- cited that number. It was generated based on the experience in another state more than five years ago. The methodology there has been recycled in a series of different reports, papers and press releases seeking to build urgency over telecom deregulation. What’s more, the study that’s been tied to the telecom industry, which is seeking the deregulation.

Even Zipperer and other backers admit they do not know how many jobs the new law will create, or how much money will actually be invested by telecom companies.

We rate the statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C499640>],/factchecks/2011/may/23/rich-zipperer/state-sen-rich-zipperer-says-deregulation-telecomm/

Rep. Frank Wolf says U.S. has over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities
","
Weeks ago, when credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded its outlook for U.S. debt from ""stable"" to ""negative,"" Rep. Frank R. Wolf, R-10th, was not surprised.

""The warning flags are flying as we move closer and closer to the edge of the financial cliff,"" Wolf said in a statement on his website, pointing to his own previous alerts that the the nation’s mighty Triple-A credit rating was in jeopardy.

Wolf called the downgrade a ""predictable warning,"" adding: ""I've been sounding a similar one for almost five years as I've tried to get the attention of Congress and the past and present administrations that America cannot continue on its current debt and deficit track, with over $14 trillion of debt, over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and over one trillion dollar deficits projected for years to come,"" Wolf added.

There’s one number in there that failed to ring a bell.

We know the national debt is more than $14 trillion; in fact, we recently reached the debt limit of $14.3 trillion. It’s also true that future deficit projections -- under the current budget plan -- exceed $1 trillion annually. But is it true that the U.S. has more than $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities?

We thought it was worth a look.

For a source, Wolf’s office pointed to a 2010 report from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an organization devoted to public awareness of fiscal issues. The study contains a table entitled ""Major Fiscal Exposure."" A sum of $61.9 trillion is calculated for 2009, adding ""explicit liabilities"" (public debt, pensions, etc.)  ""commitments and contingencies"" and ""social insurance promises"" (future social security benefits and future Medicare benefits).

Predictably, the biggest driver of the staggering total is social insurance promises, which accounts for $45.8 trillion -- $38.2 trillion of which is future Medicare benefits. Social Security benefits account for the rest.  

As noted in fine print, the projections come from the Social Security and Medicare Trustees reports dated Jan. 1, 2009, and estimate benefits over the next 75 years. The rest of the data comes from the U.S. Treasury’s 2009 report.

First, there’s an issue of terminology.

""Technically, Mr. Wolf is in error because he calls the shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare ‘unfunded liabilities’"" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. ""Legally, they are not liabilities. They can be referred to accurately as promises or obligations.""

Foster said the benefits do not qualify as liabilities because ""Congress can at any time reduce or alter them. In contrast, state pension plans are contractual labor arrangements that are liabilities because they are legally enforceable.""

Gary Burtless, an economist with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, agreed, calling the idea that the government ""owes"" trillions of dollars to future citizens from a variety of programs under rules that are currently in effect ""ridiculous.""

""The Supreme Court has ruled that the U.S.A. does not have a contractual obligation to pay Social Security and Medicare under rules that Congress has no power to change,"" Burtless said in an email. ""No citizen can expect to win a lawsuit that demands that benefits be paid that are as generous as the benefits that were ‘promised’ under some old, presumably more generous set of rules.""

Nevertheless, we’ll limit the Truth-O-Meter point reductions on this point because the Peterson Foundation report and media reports we found refer to the future Social Security and Medicare benefits as ""liabilities"" rather than ""obligations.""   

The next problem is less debatable: the information is outdated.

According to the latest Medicare and Social Security trustees reports, the numbers have changed significantly since 2009. Promised Medicare benefits for the next 75 years now total $24.6 trillion, according to 2011 numbers, and Social Security benefits have increased to $9.2 trillion.

So Medicare obligations are now $13.6 trillion less than the data upon which Wolf based his claim , largely due to the health care reform act passed last year. Social Security obligations are $1.5 trillion trillion more. The net effect of those changes is that projections for future obligations are $12 trillion less than the 2009 data Wolf uses.

But the trustees reports for this year hadn’t been released when Wolf made his claim, so we must look at the 2010 reports.

Last year’s projections showed Medicare obligations to be $22.78 trillion over the 75 years and Social Security at $7.95 trillion for a total of $30.73 trillion. Using that comparison, Wolf’s off by even more, $15 trillion.

And of course the debt has also changed. In the report Wolf cites, the publicly-held debt -- U.S. bonds held by individuals, institutions and foreign nations -- is listed as $7.6 trillion. On the day he issued his statement, it was $9.7 trillion. So add $2.1 trillion back and he’s off by almost $13 trillion.

Other numbers have changed, too, but you get the point: The 2009 estimate was not a safe number in April 2011.  

Others argue that estimating unfunded obligations 75 years into the future is never safe.  

""One can certainly come up with all kinds of scary – but essentially meaningless – estimates of the ‘unfunded liability’ of the federal government’s programs,"" Burtless, the Brookings economist, said. ""As a general rule of thumb, the bigger the estimate, the more meaningless it is.""

Burtless noted that the numbers change wildly based on annual policy decisions and a 75-year measure was is arbitrary because obligation don’t end then.

""It is impossible to predict 25 years into the future with much accuracy, let alone 75 years or all of eternity,"" he said.

So let’s review.

Wolf claims that the U.S. faces ""over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities.""

First, he and many others misuse the term ""unfunded liabilities"" to describe the future costs of government promises. Unlike a home mortgage, the U.S. is not locked into paying a certain amount based on existing terms. In fact, Congress changes the terms all the time.   

Secondly, the numbers Wolf based his claim on are badly outdated. In fact, using the 75-year estimates he cites, the figure would be significantly lower than $62 trillion based on 2011 figures.

So, while Wolf’s claim is based on an actual figure, it’s an old one that was shaky to begin with given the distant projection and likelihood of change. We rate his claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097725D00>],/factchecks/2011/may/23/frank-wolf/rep-frank-wolf-says-us-has-over-62-trillion-unfund/

Rep. Marcy Kaptur says gasoline for troops in Afghanistan costs $400 a gallon
","
When President Obama announced that Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta would replace Robert Gates as Defense secretary, Rep. Marcy Kaptur took the the pages of ""Politico"" to offer him advice.

In suggesting that the Defense Department needs to cut back on its use of petroleum products, the Toledo Democrat said:

""Even before the oil companies and Wall Street speculators drove up the price of gasoline close to $4 a gallon, the landed cost of a gallon delivered to the front lines for our troops in Afghanistan cost more than $400.""

PolitiFact Ohio already thought gas prices in Ohio were outrageous, but the idea of spending $400 per gallon boggles the mind. So we decided to look into the claim by Kaptur, a member of the House Appropriations subcommittee that funds the Pentagon.

We started with Kaptur’s office. Her staff said she gleaned her information from testimony delivered to her subcommittee.

A 2009 report in The Hill, a Washington publication, recounted some of that testimony. The Pentagon comptroller’s office gave appropriators that statistic to explain the high cost of keeping troops in Afghanistan. It factors in the transportation and security costs of transporting the fuel into areas with a lack of infrastructure, challenging geography and increased roadside bomb attacks.

""It turns out that when you factor in the cost of transportation to a coastal facility in Pakistan, or airlifting it to Kandahar - and then you add the cost of putting it in a truck, guarding it, delivering it to the battlefield, and then transferring that one gallon into a piece of equipment that needs it - in extreme cases that gallon of gasoline could cost up to $400,"" Navy Secretary Ray Mabus told a 2009 Naval Energy Forumin Virginia.

One U.S. Army official has said the ""fully burdened"" cost of transporting fuel into remote areas can be as high as $1,000 per gallon.

""In some places you have to fly it in by plane or by helicopter and drop off bladders of fuel,"" Kevin T. Geiss, program director for energy and partnerships in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Environment told Army News Service. ""Those costs can be an additional $20, $40 or even $200 a gallon.""

High fuel costs in military battlegrounds predate U.S. military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. A May 2001 Defense Science Board report cites the true cost of military fuel at ""$17.50 per gallon for USAF worldwide tanker-delivered fuel, and hundreds of dollars per gallon for Army forces deep into the battlespace.""

Retired Army Brigadier General Steven M. Anderson, who handled military logistics operations for Gen. David Petraeus in Iraq during 2006 and 2007, offers a slightly different picture -- that the cost of bringing gasoline to troops in Afghanistan actually works out to be at least $30 per gallon, and is possibly as high in the mid-40s.

He told a Capitol Hill Briefing on fuel convoys in Afghanistan and Iraq that it cost about $13.88 per gallon to transport a gallon of gas to troops in Iraq when he worked there in 2007, and the amount has risen since then to $17.44 cents per gallon. He explained that it’s more expensive to bring gas to Afghanistan because ""Iraq is a land of six lane highways from one end to the other"" while ""Afghanistan is perhaps the most isolated country in the entire world.""

He said the $400 per gallon figure for gas that others have cited for Afghanistan applies only when fuel must be brought by aircraft to the most remote areas.

""If we’re flying water up there, it’s $400 per gallon, or toothpaste or whatever,"" Anderson said. ""Anything that flies is expensive.""

Retired Air Force Lt. General Norman R. Seip, who spoke at the same event, described the $400 per gallon cost as a ""worst case scenario,"" that accounts for a tanker providing airborne refueling to a cargo plane. He said the lower figures are more reasonable.

So where does that leave Kaptur’s statement?

Numerous sources have said it can cost as much as $400 per gallon to provide gas for troops in Afghanistan. That the statistic seems to be a high end number is a piece of information that provides clarification.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate her statement Mostly True.

Randi Shade says 7 percent turnout in City Council elections was lowest in decades
","
Austin City Council Member Randi Shade discounted her second-place finish in the May 14 election, saying in a statement that she can compete with challenger Kathie Tovo, who drew 46 percent in the election.

Tovo ran a few percentage points shy of outright claiming the Place 3 seat over Shade, who garnered nearly 33 percent in the four-way race.

Shade’s May 17 statement continued: ""The turnout on May 14 was just 7 percent -- the lowest turnout in decades.""

Precisely, the turnout was 7.4 percent of registered Austin voters. Nothing to brag on, but was that the lowest in decades?

We checked the city’s year-by-year election summaries covering the elections since 1965. By the percentage of registered voters casting ballots--a widely accepted way to gauge participation--turnout is listed as 7 percent in May 2000 when voters acted in races for mayor and some council seats. A closer look shows 38,166 of 513,072 registered voters participated, making the actual May 2000 turnout 7.4 percent--same as this May’s turnout. We suspect the web post--7 percent--reflects a rounding down of the actual turnout percentage, which appears the case for about 20 of the election result summaries we reviewed.

Shade consultant Lynda Rife said by email that the number of voters (32,869) this May was less than the number of voters in any general election since April 1965, when 21,605 voters participated, according to the campaign's figures.

Fewer voters (22,094) participated in March 1975 balloting for two council seats, according to the results posted by the city. However, Austin political consultant Mark Littlefield, a Shade supporter who culled the figures relied on by Shade, told us that was a special election, which he suggested shouldn’t be compared to general elections.

Rife said another gauge is comparing the number of voters to the city’s population. Some 4 percent of the population voted this time, she said, less than any other city election the campaign could find. ""This number,"" Rife said, ""seems to provide the most insight into this election."" Unsaid: The general population includes many non-voters including minors and non-citizens, arguably making this metric less meaningful.

So, voter turnout May 14 was about the same as in the Austin municipal general election 11 years ago. Then again, fewer voters participated in the election than in any general council election in decades. Shade’s statement rates Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1F4100>],/factchecks/2011/may/23/randi-shade/randi-shade-says-7-percent-turnout-city-council-el/

Huffington Post reporter says possible GOP Senate candidate Tommy Thompson wanted to implant data chips in people
","
Over the past few years, Wisconsin Republican Tommy Thompson has toyed with making another run for public office about as often as Brett Favre pondered retiring and un-retiring from professional football.

Thompson, the former Wisconsin governor and U.S. health and human services secretary, said in 2009 that he might run again for the Wisconsin governor’s seat the following year, but he didn’t. In 2010, he was said to be weighing a challenge to then-U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., but he never jumped in.

Nevertheless, considerable buzz followed a Politico.com report on May 17, 2011, that Thompson had told he friends he plans to run in 2012 for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated after 24 years by Democrat Herb Kohl.

Later that day, this headline appeared on the liberal and widely read HuffingtonPost.com:

""Tommy Thompson wanted to implant data chips in humans.""

The headline stopped us because it read like it might have come from the Onion satirical newspaper. So we decided to do some peeling to see if the claim was accurate.

Was Thompson an advocate of chip implantation? Was it to be voluntary or something more forceful, as the headline seemed to suggest?

The headline topped an article by Michael McAuliff, senior congressional correspondent for Huffington Post and a former Washington reporter and editor for the New York Daily News. McAuliff is the ""king of headlines,"" according to a fan of his on Twitter who re-tweeted the article about Thompson.

The article recalled that in 2005, Thompson joined the board of VeriChip Corp., a Florida company that implants digital chips in people. He joined the board a few months after resigning from the health and human services post he held under then President George W. Bush.

VeriChip, McAluliff wrote, ""makes something called radio frequency identification chips that are implanted in an arm, and can help doctors track a person's medical history, or can be used in high-tech security systems.""

The article linked to two sources that contained statements Thompson made in July 2005 about the chip: 
Spychips.com, which says the chips ""pose serious risks to consumers,"" posted two video clips from an interview Thompson gave to the former CBS Marketwatch, a financial news operation that was a partner of CBS News. Saying human implantation was ""completely voluntary,"" Thompson called the chips a ""giant step forward to getting to what we call an electronic medical record for all Americans."" 
In a TV interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" business program, Thompson said he would get such a chip implanted in his arm. ""I certainly would and I think it's the coming thing,"" he said. ""And the problems is, is that medical technology is so far behind that (the chips) are going to really be the impetus in order for us to get new technology in the medical field that's going to help people improve their quality of care, and that's what it's all about."" 
So, the two Thompson statements show he was enthusiastic about the chips, although he wasn’t advocating they be implanted in people involuntarily.

We asked McAuliff if he had other evidence to back the headline. He said the two videotaped Thompson statements meant ""case closed"" -- in other words, it was clear, he said, that Thompson wanted to implant data chips in humans. McAuliff also said he didn’t think the headline suggested that Thompson wanted people to be implanted involuntarily.

We sought comment from Thompson, but one of his advisers, Madison lobbyist Bill McCoshen, didn’t respond.

We found other accounts of Thompson’s support of the VeriChip chip for humans, including two more statements from July 2005. 
When Thompson joined VeriChip's board, the company issued a statement quoting Thompson as saying: ""We are all well aware of the need to enhance information technology in health care. It is my belief that VeriChip is an important and secure means of accessing medical records and other information. I look forward to working with the company as it continues its growth."" 
U.S. News & World Report quoted Thompson as saying he planned to have the chip implanted. ""People are dying all the time because they can't access their medical information overseas,"" he said. 
It’s unclear whether Thompson ever did get the chip implanted, as later reports quoted him as saying he was waiting for more hospitals to be able to read the chips. When Thompson resigned from the VeriChip board in 2007, he held options for 55,556 shares of VeriChip stock and, in 2006, had been paid $40,000 by the company, according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article.

By 2010, the majority owner of VeriChip, which had become known as PositiveID Corp., said the company had stopped marketing the chip that Thompson had touted as an electronic medical record and instead would use the technology for medical diagnostic purposes.

We’ve peeled enough of this onion. What’s left?

The headline of an article by HuffingtonPost.com reporter Michael McAuliff said Tommy Thompson ""wanted to implant data chips in humans."" Thompson certainly was a major cheerleader for the product, although he made it clear he was only advocating that people choose to be chipped voluntarily.

The headline was accurate, but needed clarification.

"['Energy', 'Gas Prices', 'Texas', 'Michael Williams']","
Michael Williams says gas prices are up $2 since Obama became president
","
On Twitter, GOP U.S. Senate hopeful Michael Wiiliams of Texas urged online pals to join him in seeking a national policy encouraging all forms of energy production, writing: ""Gas prices have gone up $2 since Obama took office. We need More American Energy.""

Williams adds on his campaign website: ""If I didn’t know better, I’d think President Obama is actually trying to see what $5 gasoline looks like.""

Energy policy aside, did Williams accurately peg the price of gas on Obama’s watch?

After leaving Williams a message, we drilled for price changes since Obama took office in 2009 and during previous presidencies.

First, a little perspective: Presidents can’t do anything to lower gas prices in the short term, an energy policy expert at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota recently told WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. In an April 27 post, the station quotes associate professor Elizabeth Wilson saying that the United States doesn’t have a lot of control over prices because ""oil is an international commodity, fungible commodity, traded on international markets.""

Presidents can tap the nation’s strategic oil reserves, which President George W. Bush did in 2005, causing oil prices to drop 10 percent. But, Wilson said, ""you could argue that the high prices, while painful, are not potentially strategic reasons to drain the reserves.""

Or, she said, the president could go after speculators who some blame for driving up the price of oil. Speculative energy contracts have increased 35 percent since the unrest in Egypt began in January; the government could limit the number of contracts big players could purchase, though Wilson said that’s unlikely to have an immediate impact on prices at the pump.

Gas prices have caught Obama’s attention. On May 14, he said in his weekly radio address: ""Without a doubt, one of the biggest burdens over the last few months has been the price of gasoline."" He said he was ordering various governmental moves, including annual lease sales in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve to speed the evaluation of oil and gas resources in the mid and south Atlantic.

How much have gas prices gone up since Obama was inaugurated Jan. 20, 2009?

That week, the average per-gallon price of unleaded gas in Texas was $1.72, according to the AAA, which tracks prices at the pump by daily surveying more than 100,000 self-service gas stations. It was $3.77 the week of Williams’ tweet--up $2.05.

That price was still shy of the July 2008 average of $3.97, the highest average Texas price during predecessor George W. Bush’s presidency, a $2.55 increase from the week Bush began his first term in 2001. In his first two-plus years--the period comparable to where Obama is today-- the average per-gallon Texas price of unleaded gas scarcely shifted, going from $1.42 to $1.47, according to AAA.

Next, we looked at national retail prices for all formulations of gas posted online by the EIA. That information, starting from mid-August 1990, suggests that such prices bumped up less than a dime in the comparable part of Bill Clinton’s presidency and about 10 cents in the matching portion of George W. Bush’s first term—compared to about $2.10 for Obama.

Another EIA chart shows annual prices for unleaded gas over the five presidencies preceding Obama. Adjusted for 2005-value dollars, the national price went up from $1.74 to $2.06 in the first three years of Jimmy Carter’s presidency; from $2.64 down to $2.15 in that part of Ronald Reagan’s tenure; up from $1.47 to $1.53 for George H.W. Bush; from $1.42 down to $1.41 for Clinton; and up from $1.61 to $1.69 for the second Bush president.

Next, we wondered about  the cause/effect relationship implied by Williams’ statement. That is, Is it fair to saddle any president with responsibility for the price of gas at the pump?

The U.S. Energy Information Administration calls the price of crude oil the ""main contributor to the general increase in retail gasoline prices since the start of 2009."" Its March 22 post lists several factors affecting the price of crude oil  including political events in the Middle East and North Africa, shifts in inventory levels, gradual improvements in the economies of the world and bumps in profits taken by gasoline refiners.

Regardless, presidents historically get blamed when the price of gas increases and they aren’t necessarily rewarded when it falls, according to a May 2006 Bloomberg Business Week story. It states that the price-at-the-pump problem has ""bedeviled presidents at least since 1973, when the Arab oil embargo created gas lines, a price spiral toward 55 cents per gallon, and an additional headache for President Richard Nixon. Of course, price spikes aren't the sole cause of falling presidential popularity. The relationship is a correlation, and other factors contribute to public perceptions of a president.""

Our take? Gas costs $2 more per gallon than it did when Obama took office; in the past 35 years, no other president saw such a price surge by this point of his presidency. However, Williams errs by implying the president is at fault; key factors driving gas prices are beyond a president’s control.

We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097209600>],/factchecks/2011/may/22/michael-williams/michael-williams-says-gas-prices-are-2-obama-becam/
"['Rhode Island', 'Elections', 'Rhode Island ACLU']","
ACLU says RI would be lone Northeastern state to adopt voter photo ID requirement
","
Got ID?

A bill before the General Assembly would require all voters in Rhode Island to show photo identification before casting a ballot.

Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, and Secretary of State Ralph Mollis, who worked together to introduce the bill, say it would help prevent fraud and ensure the integrity of elections. Critics argue that fraud is rare and that obtaining a valid ID is an obstacle to voting for the poor, the elderly, people with disabilities and racial minorities.

In opposing the bill, the Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union stated in a news release, ""No other Northeastern state has passed a photo ID law.""

Is Rhode Island truly alone among other states in the region? We elected to find out.

Both the ACLU and the secretary of state’s office, who are on opposite sides of the issue, directed us to the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.

The first thing we learned is that nearly half of the states -- including Rhode Island -- only require voters to provide a signature at the polls.

But that’s been changing rapidly.

In 2000, just 15 states asked for ID, such as a birth certificate, Social Security card, photo ID or voter registration card. But today, the number has grown to 28.

Another 13 state legislatures have taken up voter ID legislation this year, including 8 that are considering expanding their ID requirements to include photo identification.

The laws ""are becoming more prevalent and stricter,"" said Jennie Bowser, senior fellow at the National Conference of State Legislatures.  ""It has been slowly growing over the last decade. And there has been a big pickup in activity this year.""

Photo ID laws differ on what’s considered an acceptable form of ID and who is exempted from showing one. (Kansas, for example, exempts those whose religious belief prohibit photo identification.)

Another variable is what happens when someone arrives at a poll without a photo ID.

Florida’s canvassing board reviews whether the vote may be tallied. Hawaii asks voters without a photo ID to recite their address and date of birth. Several states accept a provisional ballot, but only count it when certain requirements are met. Georgia, for example, gives voters two days to present a valid ID. Idaho and Louisiana offer the option of submitting an affidavit, which if filled out falsely can result in criminal charges.

Rhode Island’s proposed law (passed by the Senate, but held for more study in the House) would go into effect in stages. Beginning in 2012, voters would have to show a college ID, driver’s license, passport or other government issued card. IDs without a photo, such as a Social Security or Medicare card, would be accepted, but only until  2014.

At that time, voters without a photo ID would have two choices. First, they would have to obtain, at no charge, a voter identification card from the state prior to going to a polling place. Second, they would have to go to their polling place and cast a provisional ballot that would have to be inspected by a review board before being counted.

Now, returning to the ACLU’s claim, are there any states with photo ID laws in the Northeast? Since the ACLU didn’t say what it means by Northeast, we’ll use the U.S. Census Bureau definition: the six New England states plus New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that none of these states requires, or even requests, a photo ID. (In fact, only one Northeast state -- Connecticut -- requires any ID at all.)

""As far as I know there is no Northeastern state that has photo ID as a requirement,"" agreed Sean Greene, manager of research for the Pew Center on the States, which tracks voter ID legislation.

There are certainly states close to the Northeast with stricter rules. Delaware, Virginia and Ohio all require identification. Michigan and Indiana are among nine states nationwide that request or require photo IDs.

""The majority of bills pending this year are photo [mandates],"" said Bowser, of the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Among them are two New England states, Maine and New Hampshire. Connecticut, too, has in the past considered photo identification, but has so far rejected the idea.

In its attempt to portray Rhode Island as remarkably isolated on the issue, the ACLU has omitted some relevant facts: other states in the country are increasingly turning to photo ID laws; the majority of new bills under consideration across the country would require photo IDs; and two of Rhode Island’s neighbors in New England are considering such mandates.

But the ACLU is factually correct when it states that no other state in the Northeast requires photo ID.

That’s why our judges (whose IDs, incidentally, we did not request) voted to rate the ACLU claim True.

"['Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
McAuliffe says McDonnell job-creation effort hasn't kept pace with population growth
","
Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe was not kind to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s jobs record in a recent speech.

McAuliffe, who ran unsuccessfully in the 2009 Democratic gubernatorial primary, said the state’s employment situation has regressed since McDonnell, a Republican, became governor in January 2010.

""We have not gone forward. We have gone backwards,"" McAuliffe, who is considering another run for governor in 2013, said in a May 7 speech at a Democratic rally. ""I know Bob is for jobs, talks about these great press releases. But if you take the population growth here in Virginia, we are net zero on job creation since he became governor.""

Has Virginia’s population growth outpaced its job growth since McDonnell became governor? We decided to check.

Levar Stoney, McAuliffe’s spokesman, told us the information came from a January 2011 report by The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a think tank that focuses on economic issues facing low and moderate-income residents.

The study said if the pace of Virginia’s job growth between February through December of 2010 continues, it would take until 2022 to return the state to its pre-recession employment levels.

That report, however, does not include the specific statement McAuliffe made about the state’s job growth trailing its population increase under McDonnell.

So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics figures to see if McAuliffe was right.

The BLS compiles monthly figures from a survey of households showing how the size of each state’s working-age population compares to its number of residents who are employed. Working-age population is defined as the number of people 16 or older who are not in the military, incarcerated or in mental institutions.

We’ll start with February 2010, McDonnell’s first full month in office. Virginia’s working-age population was 6,049,306 that month. The number of employed residents was 3,891,279. That means 64.3 percent of the state’s working-age population had jobs.

In March, 2011 -- the latest BLS figures -- Virginia’s working-age population was 6,125,642. There were 3,931,679 employed Virginians -- 64.2 percent of the working-age population.

So in March 2011, the percentage of the state’s working-age population with jobs was one-tenth of 1 percent lower than in February 2010. The working-age population had risen 76,336 over the span, while  the number of employed residents went up by 40,400.

McAuliffe is right that the state’s population increase has outpaced the rise in number of jobs.
But that trend is not is not unique to Virginia.

Between February 2010 and March 2011, only a dozen states saw their number of employed residents rise faster than the increase in their working age populations, according to the BLS.

Nationwide, the percentage of working-age people with jobs was at 58.5 in February 2010 and in March 2011. Virginia has easily outperformed the national average every month during that span since McDonnell became governor.

We don’t point this out to take McDonnell’s side. We merely note there is a universe of employment statistics that politicians sift to paint favorable pictures of their own performance creating jobs and disparage the work of opponents.

McAuliffe did not address the record of his fellow Democrat Tim Kaine, who preceded McDonnell as governor. But Kaine, who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, is open to the same criticism McAuliffe aimed at McDonnell.

In February 2006, Kaine’s first full month in office, 66.5 percent of the state’s working age population had a job. By December 2009, Kaine’s last full month, it dropped to 64.2 percent. Virginia’s working-age population rose 275,496 during Kaine’s term while the number of employed people only increased by 48,249.

To sum up:

McAuliffe said that since McDonnell became governor in January 2010, the state’s population growth has outpaced its job growth.

McDonnell is a Republican. McAuliffe does not note that the same trend existed when his fellow Democrat Tim Kaine was governor from from 2006 to 2010. Economists say governors have little control over economic conditions. Virginia has consistently had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation this century.

Those points aside, McDonnell bills himself as a job-creating governor. McAuliffe accurately summarized one set of statistics about employment in Virginia during McDonnell’s term. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971651C0>],/factchecks/2011/may/21/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-mcdonnell-job-creation-effort-hasnt/
"['Israel', 'Foreign Policy', 'Texas', 'Ron Paul']","
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul says ""the Arab and the Muslim nations"" get twice as much foreign aid as Israel
","
Asked during the first debate of the 2012 presidential campaign about his concern that Israel will start a war with Iran, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas shifted the focus to his position that the United States should stop sending money to other countries. 
""I don't want any of this foreign aid — Pakistan or anybody else — because the principle is wrong and because it doesn't achieve anything,"" the Lake Jackson Republican said during the May 5 debate. ""If we stopped all the foreign aid, you say, ‘Oh, you're going to hurt Israel.’ But, you know, the Arab and the Muslim nations get twice as much money."" 
We looked into Paul’s foreign aid comparison. 
Paul didn’t respond to our request for evidence, but he’s spoken frequently about his opposition to all foreign aid. 
Some background: A 2004 Congressional Research Service report lists several objectives of foreign aid, including economic development, poverty reduction and democracy promotion. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the United States has also established aid programs across the Middle East in an effort to deter radicalism. 
For our fact-check of Paul’s debate comment, we turned to a database of U.S. foreign assistance, including loans and grants, kept by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The database includes information on assistance that flows from the military, USAID, the State Department and the Agriculture Department. 
According to the latest year of available data, the United States distributed about $45 billion to more than 180 countries in fiscal 2009, which ran from October 2008 through September 2009. Israel received $2.4 billion, ranking second to Afghanistan, where the United States has ongoing military and reconstruction operations. 
Not knowing the countries Paul means by ""the Arab and the Muslim nations,"" we zeroed in on those that could be identified as either Arab or Muslim based on entries in the CIA’s World Factbook, which presents information on countries throughout the world. 
Result: Seven of the top 11 recipients of foreign aid in 2009 can be described as Arab, Muslim or both: Afghanistan ($8.8 billion in aid), Iraq ($2.3 billion), Egypt ($1.8 billion), Pakistan ($1.8 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), the Palestinian territories ($1 billion), and Jordan ($816 million). Together, those entities received $17.7 billion. 
In addition, at least 30 other countries that can be considered Arab or Muslim received U.S. aid, including Somalia ($281 million), Morocco ($244 million) and Indonesia ($226 million). 
Collectively then, the 2009 aid to these nations was more than seven times the aid to Israel — not much of a surprise considering Paul’s comparison was between 40-plus countries and just one other, though that nation also has long been the prime U.S. beneficiary. 
From its founding in 1948 through 2004, Israel was the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign aid, according to a September 2010 CRS analysis. It also was the largest annual recipient from 1976 until it was surpassed in 2005 by Iraq, which the U.S. invaded in 2003. Nearly all of Israel’s current U.S. aid is military assistance. According to a February CRS report, the close U.S.-Israel relationship has been ""based on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests."" 
Meanwhile, U.S. aid policy toward the Middle East has changed. A June 2010 CRS report says it ""has gradually evolved from a focus on preventing Soviet influence from gaining a foothold in the region and from maintaining a neutral stance in the Arab-Israeli conflict, to strengthening Israel’s military and economy and using foreign aid as an incentive to foster peace agreements between countries in the region."" 
Two top Arab recipients have signed peace agreements with Israel: Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. 
Let’s take a closer look at the numbers from the USAID database, calculated in inflation-adjusted 2009 dollars: From 2000 through 2009, Israel received $32.3 billion in U.S. assistance — 82 percent of which was military assistance. 
We compared that figure with the 10-year aid total for the seven major Arab or Muslim recipients. Their take during those years: $136.4 billion, more than four times Israel’s. Their military component: 42 percent. 
And before 2000? The relative shares of aid look different. From 1990 through 1999, Israel’s U.S. aid totaled $44.2 billion, while the seven Arab or Muslim nations got $35.2 billion. But other Muslim and Arab nations also received U.S. assistance during that decade, including Turkey ($6.1 billion) and Bangladesh ($1.8 billion). All together, the nations’ cumulative total was more than Israel’s but nowhere near twice as much. 
So where does that leave us? 
On the face of it, stacking one nation’s foreign aid dollars against 40 others may not be a meaningful comparison. Regardless, based on the most recent decade of U.S. foreign aid data, Paul’s statement is correct: Collectively, the 40-plus Arab and Muslim countries drew far more than double what Israel got. 
We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809771FB40>],/factchecks/2011/may/21/ron-paul/us-rep-ron-paul-says-arab-and-muslim-nations-get-t/
"['National', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Medicare', 'Social Security', 'Taxes', 'Amy Kremer']","
Tea Party Express' Amy Kremer says current tax revenues could cover interest, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security
","
During a May 17, 2011, interview on Comedy Central’s The Colbert Report, Tea Party Express chair Amy Kremer offered host Stephen Colbert this statistic about the federal budget: ""We bring in enough tax revenue,"" she said, ""to service our debt, pay for Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security and then still have about $300 (billion) or $400 billion left over.""

A reader asked us if we could fact-check this claim, so we did.

We turned to President Barack Obama’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal, which includes a statistical table called ""Proposed Budget by Category."" While this table primarily lists Obama’s proposed budget over the next 10 years, it also includes the past two fiscal years -- 2010 and 2011 -- with dollar figures broken down in each of the categories we need to analyze Kremer’s statement.

Here’s what we found:

Fiscal year 2010

Interest on the debt: $196 billion
Medicare: $446 billion
Medicaid: $273 billion
Social Security: $701 billion

Subtotal: $1.616 trillion

Tax receipts: $2.041 trillion

Receipts minus expenses above: $425 billion


Fiscal year 2011

Interest on the debt: $207 billion
Medicare: $488 billion
Medicaid: $276 billion
Social Security: $742 billion

Subtotal: $1.713 trillion

Tax receipts: $2.047 trillion

Receipts minus expenses above: $334 billion

So using either year’s figures, Kremer is very close to correct.

But does her claim say anything meaningful about the federal budget? That’s less clear.

Left unspoken by Kremer are several other important components of the federal budget. The remaining $334 billion for fiscal year 2011 would have to cover such expenses as these:

Other mandatory programs: $716 billion
Non-security discretionary spending: $507 billion
Security discretionary spending (primarily defense and homeland security: $908 billion

Total: $2.131 trillion.

Now, it’s certainly possible to shrink these categories -- but getting down to $300 billion or $400 billion is not easy.

""Other mandatory programs"" include those that are not funded annually by Congress but instead receive funds according to a pre-set formula. These include federal civilian and military retirement benefits, food stamps, unemployment compensation and veterans benefits. It’s possible to rewrite formulas for these programs in a way that drastically shrinks or even eliminates them, but it would pose a major challenge, both legislatively and politically.

The second category -- non-security discretionary spending -- is easier to cut in a practical sense, but even within this category are lots of expenditures that, while discretionary, aren’t easy to let go of, from food and drug safety to air traffic control.

Finally, Kremer’s comparison devotes not a dime to either the military or homeland security. Even cutting the current amount in half -- a course that’s almost entirely impractical in the short term -- would exceed Kremer’s excess amount for 2011 by more than one-third.

""Long before the country had Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security, it had an Army and Navy,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. ""I think the omission of ‘national defense’ from Ms. Kremer’s list of essentials is a pretty important clarification.""

Rating Kremer’s statement is challenging, because what she said is undeniably true, but narrowly so, with missing factors that undercut her statement’s relevance. When we asked an ideologically diverse group of economists how useful they thought Kremer’s formulation was, their answers ranged widely.

For instance, J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, noted that some of the excess costs that Kremer left out of the equation could be picked up by reining in factors she did include. ""If we're going to play ‘what if,’ then you have to allow that she may have wanted to cut some of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to make room for other spending that was off the list,"" he said.

Kremer deserves credit for doing the math correctly. However, her decision to ignore defense and homeland security spending -- to say nothing of mandatory programs like veterans benefits and safety-related discretionary spending -- makes the comparison of questionable value to a discussion of the nation’s budget problems. We rate her statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C213F80>],/factchecks/2011/may/20/amy-kremer/tea-party-express-amy-kremer-says-current-tax-reve/
"['Federal Budget', 'Florida', 'Adam Hasner']","
Adam Hasner claims debt increases by $75 million an hour
","
Adam Hasner, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate and former Florida House Majority leader, is a big fan of Twitter. He uses his account (@adamhasner) as a campaign tool to chat with supporters and flaunt his conservative credentials. 
It's not unexpected that he used the venue to sound off on a popular GOP target: the country's ever-increasing national debt. 
The debt exceeds $14 trillion. 
Hasner tweeted at least three statements on the topic from May 10 to May 12, 2011.

• ""Scary"" fact about our national debt. In 1791 it was $75 million. Today, it rises by that amount in about an hour www.attackthedebt.com

• ""Scary"" fact #2 Post WW2 national debt was 122% of GDP, by 1970 it was down to 38%, now it's 95% of GDP www.attackthedebt.com

• Debt more than doubled since '00, increased 41% in just 3 years under Pres Obama. Both parties to blame. www.attackthedebt.com 
""Scary"" facts, huh? Labels such as that practically beg for closer scrutiny. 
We decided to investigate the first claim, which required a little arithmetic. Does the debt really grow at $75 million an hour today? 
We also took a quick look at claims No. 2 and 3, just to be thorough. They were easy to verify through federal websites. For ""Scary Fact #2,"" we looked at the Office of Management and Budget tables showing the debt as a percent of GDP. In 1946, the total federal debt was 121.7 percent of GDP. In 1970, it was 37.6 percent, and now (for 2010), it's 93.2 percent. Those are close enough to Hasner's numbers. 
For his third claim, we checked the same link. From the end of fiscal year 2000 (Sept. 30, 2000) through fiscal year 2010 (Sept. 30, 2010), the total debt rose 140 percent, more than doubled, so Hasner's right on that part. We switched to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's website to check the change since Barack Obama became president because that site lists a daily amount for the debt. From inauguration day on Jan. 20, 2009, when the debt was $10.627 trillion, to May 12, when it was $14.308 trillion, the increase is about 35 percent. Not quite the 41 percent Hasner cites, but also close. 
So let's go back to our fact-check on his first tweet. 
Debt history 
The first part of this tweet is easy to check out. The Treasury Department website goes back to Jan. 1, 1791 -- the earliest date available -- when the historical debt outstanding was $75,463,476.52. 
So, Hasner was right about that too. 
But how did he determine the rate at which the debt increases today? We asked Rick Wilson, his Republican campaign consultant, to explain the math. 
It turns out Hasner, um, borrowed all three claims from CBS MoneyWatch.com story posted in November 2010, called ""18 Scary US Debt Facts."" 
The claim we're checking from Hasner is the first to appear in Jill Schlesinger's story. She provides a link to the website of Ed Hall, who runs an online Debt Clock and appears to be the original source of this factoid (his debt clock was not working as of May 19, 2011, and the FAQ link was also inaccessible at times). 
Hall, a software engineer from California, said he started the website in 1995 as a lesson in Web programming. He couches his statement a little bit more than either the MoneyWatch story or Hasner by adding ""or so"" at the end. 
In an e-mail, Hall wrote: ""That number is out of date (it was correct at the time I wrote it) but now the National Debt rises by about $165 million per hour. I get this by dividing the average daily debt increase over the past few years ($4.02 billion) by 24."" 
Our math 
Hasner tweeted his claim on May 10, 2011. That's important because he says the debt rises by $75 million in about an hour ""today."" 
We looked at the rate at which the debt increased from April 10 to May 10, 2011. 
To do that, we used very precise numbers provided by the Treasury's ""Debt to the Penny and Who Holds it"" feature, which allows you to look up the daily total U.S. public debt for any date since March 31, 2005. We'll provide the long numbers so you can follow along. 
For April 10, 2011, that number was $14,265,383,134,019.53 
For May 10, 2011, it was $14,331,522,797,881.61 
The difference between those figures, which tells us how much the debt grew over 30 days, is $66,139,663,862.08. 
Divide that by 30 and you learn the debt increased by $2,204,655,462 a day. That sum divided by 24 is $91,860,644.25, which exceeds Hasner's figure of about $75 million an hour. 
For more context, we applied the same method to Oct. 18, 2010, and Nov. 18, 2010 (the day the CBS MoneyWatch story was published). 
Oct. 18: $13,668,894,473,093.42 
Nov. 18: $13,788,455,142,118.05 
Using the same method, but dividing by 31 days instead of 30, we found the hourly debt increase to be $160,669,824. That's closer to the amount gleaned with Hall's method. 
As you see, the rate the debt grows can vary month to month and year to year. It depends on how big the budget deficit is at any point in time. (The debt, as explained here, is the sum of all past deficits.) 
Our ruling 
Hasner relied on a months-old news story, without attributing it, for his string of ""scary"" debt tweets. That posed a problem for part of his first claim, that the hourly increase of the debt is $75 million. His message -- that the debt is huge and growing rapidly -- is accurate, but he would have achieved a more up-to-date total had he done his own math. He is off by millions of dollars. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E29480>],/factchecks/2011/may/20/adam-hasner/us-senate-candidate-says-debt-increases-75-million/
"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Message Machine 2014', 'Poverty', 'Public Health', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Despite Gov. Scott Walker's opposition to Obamacare, do more in Wisconsin have access to health care?
","On the day he officially launched his re-election campaign, Gov. Scott Walker unveiled a folksy sort of TV ad contending that many things in Wisconsin have improved since he took office. One claim about health care caused a number of readers to contact us. The ad, released April 15, 2014, begins with the narrator saying: ""It had gotten pretty bad four years ago. Over 130,000 jobs lost. A deficit over 3 billion. And taxes going up. Wisconsin's future looked dark."" Then come the claims. ""But it's different now. Wisconsin has turned around. The deficit is gone. Taxes are lower. And more people have gone back to work. ""Kids are going to college. Families are planning vacations and more are going to sleep knowing they have access to health care."" Walker has famously opposed Obamacare. On the other hand, he expanded Medicaid eligibility in Wisconsin. So, just how much credit does he deserve for more Wisconsinites having access to health care? The lay of the land  We’ll start by acknowledging there isn’t a universally accepted definition of ""access to health care,"" although the phrase carries a presumption that the care is affordable -- another vague term. To take it to an extreme, people could technically have access to health care even if all they could afford is private insurance with premiums that ate up half of their paychecks. But that would be nothing to brag about. At the same time, there is little debate that access has increased since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, some 10 months before Walker took office. Among other things, under Obamacare: No one can be turned down for health insurance coverage because of a medical condition; children can be covered under a parent’s policy until age 26; subsidies are available for low- and middle-income people who don’t get insurance from an employer; lifetime caps on health insurance benefits are eliminated; and, quite simply, the law carries a mandate that nearly all Americans carry at least a basic level of coverage. In Wisconsin, according to an actuarial firm that did a report in 2011 for the state, the Obamacare premium subsidies and mandate are expected to increase the number of residents with health insurance by 340,000 by 2016. So, where does that leave Walker? The Republican governor fought Obamacare in court. And he refused what was termed a full expansion of Medicaid under the law that would have been paid for 100 percent initially, eventually declining to 90 percent, by the federal government. Walker's evidence To back Walker’s claim, his campaign cited a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected national authority on health care, and an October 2013 news release from the state Department of Health Services about the report. The news release said that -- even though Wisconsin would not expand Medicaid eligibility as provided under Obamacare -- all Wisconsin residents nevertheless ""will have access to affordable health care"" as a result of the way Walker ""reformed"" Medicaid. So, what was the reform? Walker expanded Medicaid (known as BadgerCare Plus in Wisconsin) to cover adults who previously were not eligible for the program – basically those below the poverty threshold and without dependent children. (The federal government will pay about 60 percent of the cost, just as it does for other adults covered by the state’s Medicaid programs.) But adults with incomes above the poverty threshold previously covered by BadgerCare Plus are now required to buy subsidized private insurance on the marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act. Even after the federal subsidies, they will have higher premiums and cost-sharing – arguably, less access to health care – than they had with BadgerCare Plus. In other words, Walker is financing his Medicaid expansion with the money the state will save by moving the less-poor adults from Medicaid to the subsidized private plans sold in the Obamacare marketplace. The catch is, Wisconsin could have opted to expand the Medicaid program through the Affordable Care Act at a lower cost to the state – roughly $100 million lower in the  first two years – and a lower cost to many of the people who are losing their coverage under BadgerCare Plus. The upshot of Walker’s move? We don’t know yet. But an estimated 83,000 more people became eligible for Medicaid, while 77,000 were removed from Medicaid -- a net gain, of sorts, of 6,000 people, according to the liberal Citizen Action of Wisconsin, a group that is a frequent Walker critic and which advocated for the full Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. Our rating Walker said that under his leadership as governor, more people in Wisconsin ""have access to health care."" He can take some of the credit, given that everyone living under the federal poverty line is now eligible for Medicaid. But far more people are getting access to health care, whether from the government or private carriers, as a result of Obamacare.

"['Ethics', 'PunditFact', 'Wayne Rogers']","
Former 'M*A*S*H' star: Obama lied over 200 times
","Wayne Rogers of M*A*S*H fame -- he played ""Trapper John"" -- now investor and Fox News pundit, took a shot recently at President Barack Obama’s character. ""He's not just willing to lie. He does it deliberately,"" Rogers said May 3, 2014, on the Fox News business program Cashin’ In. ""There are over 200 documented cases where he has lied, you know, you can keep your plan if you like it. You can keep your doctor if you like it. Those are the obvious lies."" That’s a lot of lying, and we wanted to learn more. We asked Rogers for his sources and did not hear from him. So we don’t know where he got the number but it seems likely he has read this: ""252 Documented Examples of Barack Obama’s Lying, Lawbreaking, Corruption, Cronyism, etc."", a list on a website called Infowars.com. The title alone suggests Rogers may have gone overboard. At face value, the list gets to 252 by lumping ""lies"" in with a variety of other things (alleged lawbreaking, corruption, cronyism and the catch-all etc.). In fact, we looked at each item and about 225 came down to a difference of opinion over policy. Some examples on the policy front: Sent U.S. troops to Africa; made recess appointments when Congress was not in recess; had Freedom of Information Act record worse than Bush’s. The list includes 13 instances of what the author considered actual lying. PolitiFact declared the claim ""If you like your plan, you can keep it,"" as the 2013 Lie of the Year (So we’ll give Rogers credit for that one.) For the rest, we take no position on whether the president verifiably misled the public but here are some items in that group (followed by our work): Lied about the cost of Obamacare; Falsely said that ""we got back every dime"" from the bailout; (PolitiFact New Hampshire rated Obama saying ""We got back every dime used to rescue the banks"" as Mostly True) Falsely said that Fast and Furious was started when George W. Bush was president. (PolitiFact rated Obama saying that Fast and Furious started when Bush was president as False) There are an additional 13 items on the list that seem more like broken promises than anything else. That portion of the list includes things like broke his promise to close Guantanamo Bay (PolitiFact has rated that promise Stalled), claimed he would wait five days before signing bills (PolitiFact has rated that Promise Broken), and broke his promise to pass immigration bill, and then lied about why he broke it (PolitiFact has rated several promises related to immigration). Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College and co-author of All the President’s Spin, does not put lying and broken promises in the same basket. ""People may not be able to fulfill promises for reasons beyond their control and in any case it’s less ethically troubling to change your mind later than to say something that is misleading at the time that you say it,"" Nyhan said. ""I’m opposed to the term ‘lie’ and have avoided using it in my work. It implies intention to mislead, which we can never know definitively."" This Infowars.com article was expansive in its index of Obama’s transgressions and many items went beyond traditional policy disputes. In this category we found claims such as: had armed SWAT agents raid a law-abiding guitar factory because it was owned by a Republican; shut down an Amish farm; falsely claimed to know more about Judaism than any other president; and lied about being his ‘brother’s keeper.’ Trangessions? Maybe. Provable, documented lies? No. PolitiFact, by the way, has fact-checked Obama more than 500 times and found 77 of his claims to be rated either False or Pants on Fire. Neither rating indicates Obama lied, but you can see the rulings for yourself here. PolitiFact also is tracking more than 500 of Obama's campaign promises, 115 of which have been rated Promise Broken. A Promise Broken rating doesn't mean Obama lied, but you can review the promises for yourself here.   Our ruling Rogers said ""there are over 200 documented cases where (Obama) has lied."" Rogers did not provide any proof, but it appears he got his information from an online list of 252 perceived transgressions by Obama that includes accusations of lying, broken promises, ethical lapses and objectionable policies. By our count, the article offered 13 instances of what the author saw and another 13 instancs of Obama breaking promises. In this fact-check, we're not verifying whether those 25-or-so cases constitute lies. But we can say with certainty that the ""documented"" total does not reach ""over 200."" Rogers' claim is ridiculously false. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0F3580>],/factchecks/2014/may/06/wayne-rogers/former-mash-star-obama-lied-200-times/

Tom Coburn: Death penalty deters violent criminals
","Last week reporters, attorneys and state officials watched Oklahoma death row inmate Clayton Lockett writhe on the gurney as he was executed. It took nearly 45 minutes, and he eventually died of a heart attack after officials stopped the execution. He’s not alone. Seven percent of all executions by lethal injection are ""botched,"" or not done in line with protocol, according to an Amherst law professor. Each time, the death penalty debate reignites among legislators and the public about executions. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., went on MSNBC’s Morning Joe May 1 to emphasize his support for the death penalty, despite the complication with Lockett’s execution. ""I think it is a deterrent that does affect and impact people,"" he said. ""I’ve given a lot of thought. I don’t like it. I wish we put everybody that had such a history as this gentleman behind bars and working and doing things that would help them, but I haven’t changed my position."" We decided to check the research to see if Coburn was right that the death penalty is a deterrent. Does the death penalty discourage crime? We found there’s no conclusive evidence to support any viewpoint, including Coburn's. We can’t definitively say that the death penalty deters homicides, increases homicides or has no effect, so Coburn can't back up his point with widelyaccepted scientific evidence. Daniel Nagin, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, chaired the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Deterrence and the Death Penalty. He and his team were tasked with addressing whether or not available studies can prove that the death penalty serves as a deterrent for violent crime. In 2012, he and his team published ""Deterrence and the death penalty,"" a report that sums up more than three decades worth of research: ""The committee concludes that the research to date on the effect of capital punishment on homicide is not informative about whether capital punishment decreases, increases, or has no effect on homicide rates. Therefore, the committee recommends that these studies not be used to inform deliberations requiring judgments about the effect of the death penalty on homicide. Consequently, claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate should not influence policy decisions about capital punishment."" Nagin found a few common problems with the existing research: No comparison to deterrent effects of life imprisonment: Study authors often can’t access the data they need from the government. An ideal deterrence study would examine whether people are more deterred by the death penalty than by other serious punishments. No information on would-be murderers’ perceptions: ""Deterrence is about how people are responding to their perceptions,"" Nagin said. Are potential criminals considering their chances of ending up on death row before they commit violent crimes? We don’t know. Statistical flaws: Nagin’s committee determined that the research was so flawed, it couldn’t be informative. However, Nagin said research does show that punishment for crime, in general, is a deterrent. ""It’s the certainty of apprehension, not the severity of the ensuing consequences, that is the more effective deterrent,"" he said. The Death Penalty Information Center, The Sentencing Project and other death penalty experts we contacted pointed to Nagin’s report as the most authoritative literature on death penalty deterrence, but there are a significant number of people in the field who side with the studies Nagin and others have criticized. Coburn’s office pointed us toward a 2007 Fox News column by John Lott, founder of the Crime Prevention Research Center. Lott defended a group of studies that found that every execution saves 15 to 18 potential murder victims. They’ve been widely criticized for the way they count homicides, mistakes in methodology and making conclusions based on the very small pool of U.S. executions. It could be quite some time before studies produce a widely respected answer to the deterrence question. ""The road forward is not easy,"" Nagin said. Our ruling Coburn said, ""I think (the death penalty) is a deterrent that does affect and impact people."" Overall, many experts say the existing research has limitations and doesn’t clearly show support for or against the death penalty as a deterrent. So Coburn can't prove his viewpoint is correct. However, executions, along with prison sentences and other punishments for crime, do generally deter criminals. We rate Coburn’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0F3140>],/factchecks/2014/may/06/tom-coburn/tom-coburn-death-penalty-deters-violent-criminals/

Charlie Crist says Florida is No. 2 in long-term unemployment under Rick Scott
","In an April TV ad by Gov. Rick Scott’s political committee Let’s Get to Work, the narrator states: ""Florida’s unemployment tripled. 800,000 jobs gone...."" and reels off other bad news economic statistics. ""Which governor took Florida to the bottom? Charlie Crist."" Crist counter-attacked on his campaign website and argued that the unemployment picture isn’t as rosy as painted by his Republican opponent. ""Floridians understand that Scott’s numbers never tell the whole truth. But, since he insists on talking about numbers, here are some of his own..."" Crist then cites a series of unflattering economic numbers including this one: ""Florida is ranked 2nd in the nation in long-term unemployment."" We looked at the state’s ranking on long-term unemployment and found that there was some truth to Crist’s claim but that the data comes with some caveats -- particularly about Crist’s implication that Scott owns that ranking. Long-term unemployment Crist’s claim about the long-term unemployed linked to a February article in the Orlando Sentinel that cited analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. EPI calculated that 46.2 percent of laid-off Floridians were out of work for at least six months in 2013. Only New Jersey and Washington, D.C., were higher, at 46.6 percent. We interviewed David Cooper, the economic analyst at EPI, who wrote the post in January that included a state-by-state map showing long-term unemployment. Cooper said that he used the monthly data released by the U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics to calculate the share of those unemployed 27 weeks or longer by state. The Current Population Survey, on which the BLS bases its data, is a sample representative for the nation. But when the data is used to drill down to the state level, the margin of error goes up significantly, Cooper said. And drill down even further to those who are long-term unemployed, and ""again the margins of error go up even more."" So while Cooper found Florida was in second or third (since New Jersey and D.C. were tied), the margin of error is large enough it could fall anywhere from the second to seventh place range, he said. ""Florida is clearly near the top, (but) where it sits in order is kind of ambiguous,"" he said. We sent the EPI report to a few Florida economists. While they didn’t dispute EPI’s numbers, economists noted that there are other ways to measure long-term unemployment. ""The figures provided by EPI are the percent of the unemployed that are long-term unemployed, not the percent of the labor force that are long-term unemployed,"" said Rollins College economist Bill Seyfried. So that will lead to different rankings, because one starts with the pool of unemployed, while the other looks at the entire labor force. Seyfried looked at long-term unemployed divided by size of labor force and determined that Florida came in 11th place in 2013. Florida’s unemployment rate declined considerably in 2013, which resulted in a relative improvement in the percent of the labor force that are long-term unemployed, Seyfried said. University of Florida economist David Denslow added some caveats to EPI’s data: Unemployment data is difficult to measure because people may not accurately report whether they are actively seeking work and how long they have been unemployed. Also, he said the sample size is small. ""We don't know just where Florida ranks in those data, since the margins of error are too large,"" Denslow said. ""But it is highly likely that Florida is one of the top 10.""   Blame on Scott? Crist’s statement could be interpreted as blaming Scott for the long-term unemployment figures. Economists we interviewed said that governors can take steps to influence employment, but there are other national economic trends at play that can’t be blamed (or credited) to any one particular politician. Just as Crist can’t be blamed for the nationwide economic crash as the housing bubble burst, Scott can’t be blamed for the state’s long-term unemployment figures as Florida recovers. Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness, said, ""It is a tough sell to push the blame for long term unemployment onto Gov. Scott, particularly since the problem clearly has its roots in the recession that occurred during Gov. Crist's term. Florida shed over 800,000 jobs during Gov. Crist's term and that amount of jobs cannot be recovered overnight. The long-term unemployment problem is more a function of the severity and nature of the recession experienced in Florida rather than any particular policy."" Our ruling Crist said in a blog attacking Scott, ""Florida is ranked 2nd in the nation in long-term unemployment."" An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute ranked Florida second, with New Jersey and the District of Columbia ahead. But there is a significant margin of error to these numbers, and it’s difficult to pinpoint each state’s ranking. Other economists used other measures to come up with a different ranking for Florida. Also, while governors can play a role in developing jobs, the pace of Florida’s recovery can’t be pinned on Scott. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BF8F40>],/factchecks/2014/may/06/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-florida-no-2-long-term-unemploy/

Social media meme says lawmakers will get $2,800 raise in January 2015
","There are few things that inspire as much popular outrage as examples of politicians behaving hypocritically. That’s why a recent Facebook post packed such a punch. ""Every single one of the 41 Republican senators who just blocked a raise in the minimum wage will receive a $2,800 cost-of-living adjustment on January 1, 2015,"" said the meme, which was posted by the creators of the ""Raise the Minimum Wage"" Facebook page. That page has attracted almost 132,000 supporters, and the meme, when it was posted on May 1, 2014, drew 1,984 likes. But is the meme’s claim accurate? Not exactly. Since passage of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, congressional pay raises are calculated by a formula that involves changes in private-sector wages and salaries, according to the Congressional Research Service. The annual pay hike automatically goes into effect unless Congress either votes to reject the adjustment or votes to change the amount. However, lawmakers have often been loath to raise their own pay. Even though the 1989 law makes it easier for politicians to get a raise without having to affirmatively vote for one, it hasn’t led to raises year after year. In fact, almost half the time, lawmakers have gone out of their way to reject the automatic pay raise. According to CRS, lawmakers let their pay be raised 13 times (those scheduled for January 1991, 1992, 1993, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009) and denied raises 11 times (those scheduled for January 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014). That means the last time lawmakers let an impending raise stand was for the one scheduled for January 2009. That was when George W. Bush was president and the Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress. At that time, the basic congressional salary went from $169,300 to $174,000, its current level. Since then, for five years running, Congress has passed language forgoing a pay raise. The CRS report confirms the numbers cited in the meme -- the maximum potential January 2015 pay adjustment would be 1.6 percent, or $2,800, an amount established by calculations made in January 2014. But the recent history of pay-raise rejections provides a crucial asterisk to the meme’s claim. If Congress refuses to act, lawmakers will get the raise specified in the meme -- but for the past five years, Congress has acted to reject the increase, and this year, there are solid reasons why lawmakers would want to avoid a raise again. ""The economy, while showing signs of recovery, is still shaky, especially when it comes to steady private-sector job creation,"" said Pete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, which has long tracked congressional pay and benefits. ""Furthermore, it would be politically suicidal for Congress to debate, much less affirm, the raise before the November election."" Sepp added, though, that it’s possible that lawmakers could go into a lame-duck session after the election. Then, he said, ""the political pressure is off to act like they feel their constituents' pain, and who knows what could happen? Opponents of allowing the raise to take effect might introduce a provision blocking the pay increase, only to be outmaneuvered in the rush to approve final business for the year."" In other words, a hike by january 2015 is far from the slam dunk the meme suggests. Our ruling The pro-minimum-wage group said in a Facebook meme that ""every single one of the 41 Republican senators who just blocked a raise in the minimum wage will receive a $2,800 cost-of-living adjustment on January 1, 2015."" That is what would happen if Congress fails to affirmatively reject a raise. But there is hardly a guarantee that lawmakers would simply go along with this pay hike. Accepting a pay raise is so politically unpopular that Congress has rejected such an increase for five years running. The difference between ""will receive"" a raise and ""could receive"" a raise is significant enough for us to rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FAD980>],/factchecks/2014/may/06/facebook-posts/social-media-meme-says-lawmakers-will-get-2800-rai/
"['Georgia', 'Guns', 'Nathan Deal']","
Deal on target with gun permit estimate
","Gov. Nathan Deal recently signed legislation that has been applauded by Second Amendment purists and blasted by gun control advocates for expanding where Georgians with permits may legally carry firearms to include churches, schools and bars. ""This legislation will protect the constitutional rights of Georgians who have gone through a background check to legally obtain a Georgia weapons carry license. Roughly 500,000 Georgia citizens have a permit of this kind, which is approximately 5 percent of our population,"" Deal told reporters and bill supporters at a signing ceremony for House Bill 60. We wondered where the governor got his estimate and whether it’s correct. We decided to dig deeper. We first reached out to Brian Robinson, the governor’s spokesman, who pointed to lawmakers as the source of the information. ""It’s a rough estimate, which is how we couched it,"" Robinson said. ""The numbers are constantly in flux."" We then contacted state Rep. Rick Jasperse, R-Jasper, the bill’s major legislative champion, who broadened our understanding of the complexities of this fact check. ""We figure the number of licenses is about 750,000,"" Jasperse said in an email. The 500,000 figure is what is reported by Georgia’s 159 probate judges to the state Administrative Office of the Courts, Jasperse told us. But, he pointed out, that information has its shortcomings. Some probate judges fail to report the number of applicants consistently. Others don’t report them at all, he said. Georgians aren’t required to have a license, or permit, to keep a gun in their car, on their property or at their place of business with the business owner’s permission. With a permit, a person can carry a gun openly or concealed, except in restricted locations, such as a nuclear power plant or within 150 feet of a polling place. We found two counties that were identified as not reporting for 2012. We also confirmed that there is a state law on the books (O.C.G.A. § 15-5-24(3)) that requires each county’s probate court to report how many gun license applications it receives. We scratched our heads and asked: Has any probate court ever been punished for not complying with the law? Or is that even possible? ""No on both accounts"" was the response. Cobb County Probate Judge Kelli Wolk told us the judges only know how many people have applied for licenses, not how many have obtained them. ""It is a small distinction. But some folks are denied as ineligible. Some -- very few -- don’t get fingerprinted after applying. Some are revoked after issued. Some folks move to Cobb with licenses from other counties, etc.,""  Wolk said in an email. She provided us data that show gun applications in Cobb have risen from 3,426 in 2006 to 11,462 in 2013. From Jan. 1 to April 15 of this year, 3,690 applications were made in the county. (Permits are good for five years, unless revoked, Wolk said. The $79.25 fee that is charged is divided four ways between the Georgia Crime Information Center and Sheriff’s Office for the background check, the statewide vendor and the local probate court, she said.) We found that the 500,000-plus number that’s bandied about was derived by adding up five years worth of applications filed statewide with the probate courts. (Actual number of applications was 535,826 for 2008 through 2012, according to our calculations). This clearly has some shortcomings. But the rationale, we were told, was that figure could at least be in the park since gun permits are good for five years. In 2012, the federal Government Accounting Office found the number of states allowing concealed carry permits was increasing, and the eligibility requirements and reciprocity agreements differed broadly, depending on the state. Seven states and the District of Columbia, as of June 2002, prohibited the concealed carry of handguns. By March 2012, individuals could carry concealed handguns everywhere but Illinois and the District of Columbia, the agency found. According to state reporting to the GAO, there were at least 8 million active permits to carry concealed handguns in the U.S. as of Dec. 31, 2011. This included about 600,000 in Georgia, which, at the time, had an estimated 6.9 million people 20 years or older. ""That number (the 600,000 reported by the GAO) is pretty close to my ‘adjusted’ number, corrected for the missing probate court numbers,"" Jasperse said. Jerry Henry with the gun rights group GeorgiaCarry.org said he estimates about 750,000 Georgians are licensed gun carriers. But the reality is we couldn’t find anyone who has an actual permit count. And the new law, which takes effect July 1, prohibits anyone from keeping a database of permit holders. Dubbed by opponents as the ""guns everywhere bill,"" the law allows firearms in churches, bars and government buildings under certain circumstances. It prohibits law enforcement officials from asking someone with a gun whether he or she has a license. It gives school systems the ability to decide whether teachers or other staff should be armed. The new law also repeals state law requiring firearms dealers to obtain state licenses and maintain records of firearm sales and purchases, and it revokes the governor's authority to suspend or limit the carrying or sale of guns in case of emergencies. Since its signing, some religious leaders -- including Catholic Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Atlanta -- have declared that guns won’t be permitted in their churches. Summary: There’s no firm data on how many gun permits are out there. Deal made clear that the number he quoted was a rough estimate of gun permits in Georgia. It falls in line with the lowest of the estimates out there. Deal’s statement is accurate but needs a bit of additional context to be fully understood. We rate the governor’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097299280>],/factchecks/2014/may/06/nathan-deal/deal-target-gun-permit-estimate/

Rand Paul says 40 times more Kentuckians have gotten health-insurance cancellation notices than signed up for Obamacare
","Now that more than 8 million Americans have signed up for coverage under Obamacare, the White House has all but declared victory after the law’s initially troubled rollout. But many of the law’s critics continue to see the law as a disaster. A reader sent us a newsletter to constituents released by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a critic of the law and a potential presidential candidate in 2016. Here’s an excerpt from the newsletter, which was dated May 2, 2014: ""Since the implementation of Obamacare, hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians have received cancellation notices from their current health care providers. For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage. Obamacare has been presented to the American people through twisted rhetoric, smoke and mirrors. Obamacare is not good for America and it certainly (is) not good for Kentucky. I would like (to) hear how Obamacare affected you, your family or your small business. Share your story by visiting my website."" The claim that leapt out at us was, ""For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage."" Could that really be true? We took a look at the data. How many Kentuckians have received cancellation notices? Tracking cancellations isn’t so easy, because cancellations are issued by private health insurance companies, and regulations differ in each state. The Associated Press assembled a comprehensive, 50-state look at Obamacare-related cancellations and concluded that, in Kentucky, 130,000 people received cancellation notices. Meanwhile, the Kentucky Department of Insurance has put the number at 168,000. So a reasonable number for cancellations in Kentucky is probably between 130,000 and 168,000. How many Kentuckians have signed up for Obamacare? The answer depends on your definition of ""Obamacare."" The broader measure includes both signups for private insurance at the state-run Kynect insurance marketplace, as well as signups for Medicaid, the longstanding government-run health insurance program for the poor that Kentucky chose to expand under Obamacare. In late April 2014, the state announced that 82,795 Kentuckians had purchased private plans on Kynect and 330,615 others had qualified for Medicaid coverage, for a total of 413,410. Data from the federal Department of Health and Human Services that counts a few more weeks of signups had slightly higher numbers. Comparing the two numbers Using just these numbers, Paul is either wrong or very wrong. The smaller number -- private-insurance number of signups (82,795) -- is exceeded by the number of cancellations (up to 168,000), but at most, the discrepancy is only twice as big, not 40 times as big. But it’s not clear that this is the right number to use. Paul’s newsletter didn’t only refer to private plans, and the Medicaid expansion was just as much a part of Obamacare as the marketplaces for private health insurance plans. So if you include both types of signups (413,410), then the combined Medicaid and private-insurance signups in Kentucky actually exceeded the number of cancellations by more than double. So Paul’s claim is not just off-base, it’s actually going in the opposite direction. In fact, the 40-times-higher claim is ridiculously off-base. If you take the smallest possible number of signups (82,795, counting just the new private plans) and multiply it by 40, you’d need more than 3.3 million cancellations to make the math work. Yet as of 2011-12, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there were only about 2.2 million Kentuckians who had insurance that could even theoretically be canceled -- either insurance purchased individually or provided by employer. The remainder either had government-provided insurance such as Medicare or Medicaid or were uninsured. Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that the number of employers who drop coverage in the future ""could be a real issue,"" but for the 2014 statistics, she said, Paul’s calculation seemed ""wildly off base."" Our inquiries to Paul’s office were not returned. Our ruling Paul said that ""for every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage."" That’s not mathematically possible. If you take the narrowest definition of ""sign-ups,"" there would have to be 3.3 million cancellations in the state for Paul’s statement to be accurate -- and there aren’t even that many Kentuckians with private insurance plans that could theoretically be canceled. In fact, it’s reasonable to argue that more people in Kentucky have coverage through Obamacare than have been canceled. Paul’s statement is so wildly off that we rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE, May 6, 2014: After we published this item, Paul’s office contacted us to explain how they calculated the 40-to-1 ratio of cancellations to signups. The office said that ""the numbers he used were accurate as of November of last year"" but that staffers failed ""to update the numbers for the newsletter."" Specifically, Paul’s office said that a Nov. 8, 2013, news release from the Kentucky governor’s office reported that 7,011 Kentuckians had enrolled in a private health plan through Nov. 8, compared to the 280,000 Kentuckians who the state believed at the time might be subject to cancellation notices. However, in the six months since, the number of private-plan signups has soared by a factor of 10, while the state released a smaller estimate of cancellation notices (168,000). Even in November, Paul’s estimate was cherry-picked; it excluded the 33,561 Kentuckians who enrolled in Medicaid, a program that saw its eligibility expanded under Obamacare. Even though the new numbers were available to Paul’s staff at the time the newsletter was put together, Paul’s office counted only the first two months of signups and ignored the final six months, a period when enrollment rose steadily. Our ruling stands: Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F0980>],/factchecks/2014/may/05/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-40-times-more-kentuckians-have-gott/

Laura Ingraham: U.S. ambassador 'was dragged through the street' in Benghazi
","Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham restated a debunked talking point Sunday, claiming that the body of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens was ""dragged through the street"" following the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi.  ""We have to not forget, we have four dead Americans,"" Ingraham said during a roundtable discussion about the Benghazi attack on ABC's This Week. ""The ambassador's body was dragged through the street. Okay? It was beyond heartbreaking and beyond infuriating.""  Stevens' body was not dragged through the street, at least not in the way Ingraham suggests, multiple accounts and three official reviews make clear.  PolitiFact examined a similar claim in September 2013 and the facts remain the same.  The bottom line: Good Samaritans took Stevens to a hospital where he could receive medical treatment.  The most recent summary of the events came from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in January 2014. In an appendix, the report provides a timeline. It has this entry for 1 a.m. Sept. 12, 2012:  ""Local Libyans found the Ambassador at the Mission Facility and brought him to a local hospital. Despite attempts to revive him, Ambassador Stevens had no heartbeat and had perished from smoke inhalation.""  Two other government bodies said much the same thing. An Accountability Review Board, headed by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering, declared that Stevens was brought to the hospital by six civilians. ""To the best knowledge of the Board these were ‘good Samaritans’ among the hordes of looters and bystanders,"" the review concluded.  The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee -- controlled by Republicans -- reported that ""local Libyans found the remains of Ambassador Stevens in the main diplomatic building at the Benghazi Mission and transported him to the hospital. The Libyans apparently did not realize who the Ambassador was, but they alerted the State Department of his location by using the cell phone that was in the Ambassador’s pocket. Libyan doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate Ambassador Stevens upon his arrival at the hospital.""  The Associated Press interviewed the Libyan doctor who treated Stevens. CNN spoke to Libyans who said they had found Stevens. The CNN report includes amateur video that shows rescuers pulling Stevens through a window.  It seems established fact that Libyans brought Stevens directly to the hospital and there were no signs that anything else took place.  Our ruling  Ingraham said that the body of Ambassador Stevens was dragged through the street. We reached out to Ingraham but did not hear back. After reading three government reports and independent press accounts, we find that Stevens, overcome by smoke from the fire, was brought to a Libyan hospital where efforts to revive him failed. To be dragged through the streets implies disrespect. There are no reports of public abuse of his body.  This claim was debunked long ago and the truth has been widely available. We rate Ingraham's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C3AB00>],/factchecks/2014/may/05/laura-ingraham/ingraham-recycles-incorrect-benghazi-claim/

Virginia Democrats says state is giving up $5 million a day by not expanding Medicaid
","Virginia is turning down a fortune in federal aid every day the Republican-led House of Delegates refuses to expand Medicaid, according to the state Democratic Party. ""Today alone, @VAHouseGOP wasted $5 mil of our tax $ by refusing to #ClosetheGap,"" the Democratic Party tweeted on April 15. We decided to take a look at the $5 million-a-day figure, which has been uttered by a wide circle of politicians seeking to broaden Medicaid eligibility in Virginia, including Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, and Republican Sen. John Watkins of Powhatan. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, gives states the option of expanding Medicaid eligibility to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, about $16,104 in a one-person household and $21,707  in a two-person household. Uncle Sam will pick up the entire tab for new enrollees during the next three years and pay 90 percent of the cost down the road. The House has twice refused to broaden the program, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. A stalemate between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate is delaying passage of a two-year state budget. Ashley Bauman, a spokeswoman for the state Democratic Party, said the $5 million-a- day figure originates from The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a think tank that analyzes state policies with a focus on their effects on low- and moderate-income people. In February 2013, it released a one-page paper saying if Virginia expanded Medicaid eligibility by the start of 2014, ""the state would be able to draw down about $5 million per day in federal funds."" Michael Cassidy, president of the institute, told us it used 2012 estimates by the state’s Medicaid agency of the amount of federal money that would flow into Virginia if the Old Dominion began expansion on Jan. 1, 2014 -- the earliest date permissible. Such action would bring $2.99 billion of federal money into the state between the start of 2014 through June 30, 2015, the agency projected. The Commonwealth Institute then divided the $3 billion by the number of days in the span, 546. The daily cost to the federal government would be $5,494,505. But Virginia’s Medicaid agency has since lowered its estimate of expansion costs. Its actuary, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, found that the cost per new enrollee has been lower than expected in states that have expanded their programs. That’s because the new Medicaid recipients are less likely to be disabled or require long-term care than those who already had been receiving benefits. The new estimates were released in January 2014. Assuming that expansion in Virginia would begin this July 1, the state’s Medicaid agency estimated it would receive $1,264,366,699 in new federal payments through June 30, 2015. That breaks down to $3,464,018 a day. The total federal dollars will increase over the decade as more people enroll in expanded Medicaid. The agency projects it would receive an extra $1,655,080,206 from Washington  during the state budget year that begins July 1, 2015. That breaks down to $4,522,077 a day. Our ruling The state Democratic Party says Virginia is losing out on $5 million a day in federal funding by not expanding its Medicaid program. It throws that figure at the feet of the Republican-led House of Delegates, which twice has rejected expansion. No doubt, there’s a tremendous amount of federal money at stake. As many as 400,000 Virginians could become eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare, and the U.S. would pay their entire health care costs through 2016.   But the $5 million-a-day figure comes from an old state estimate. The most recent estimate of expansion costs, released in January, breaks down to about $3.5 million a day for the budget year that starts this July 1. The federal contribution would be about $4.5 million a day during the following budget year, starting in mid-2015. That’s lots of money, but not as much as the Democrats say the House is now bypassing.

NBA legend Abdul-Jabbar: 'More whites believe in ghosts than believe in racism'
","The May 4 Sunday news shows sought outside-the-Beltway perspective for talking about American race relations, booking stars from the basketball and music industries to analyze racist comments made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Guests included Black Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am and former basketball stars Kevin Johnson (now the mayor of Sacramento, Calif.) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Abdul-Jabbar, who worked under Sterling for three months as a Los Angeles Clippers coach in 2000, offered his thoughts on the controversy last week in a Time op-ed, saying Sterling’s racially disparaging remarks revealed in a leaked voicemail were not a surprise given other discrimination over recent years. On the set of ABC’s This Week with host George Stephanopoulos, the retired six-time NBA champ said racism remains part of American culture. ""This is a problem. I did a little bit of research. More whites believe in ghosts than believe in racism,"" he said. ""That’s why we have shows like Ghostbusters and don’t have shows like ‘Racistbusters.’ "" We set out to find whether his catchy comment comparing white attitudes on ghosts and racism is accurate. We tried to contact Abdul-Jabbar through Twitter and ABC’s media team but could not reach him by our deadline. Polls on white Americans and ghosts A number of polls over the years have examined Americans’ belief in the supernatural, including ghosts. The problem is the surveys are often not broken down by race and the questions are not universally framed. People are generally more likely to say they believe in ghosts than that they have interacted with one. Non-white Americans are more likely than whites to say they believe in ghosts, and women are more likely to believe in paranormal activity than men, said Carson Mencken, a Baylor University sociology professor and director of the Baylor Religion Survey, a national random sample of U.S. households completed every three years with Gallup. According to the most recent survey results, in 2010, about 56 percent of whites say ghosts either absolutely or probably exist, which is ""pretty consistent over time,"" said Mencken, who co-wrote Paranormal America: Ghost encounters, UFO sightings, Bigfoot hunts and other Curiosities in Religion and Culture. (Within that rate, 22 percent said they absolutely exist, he said.) That’s a bit higher than other surveys we found, but Baylor professors said results can skew widely depending on the way a question is framed. A Harris Poll of 2,250 people surveyed online in November 2013 found that 42 percent of all Americans, and 42 percent of whites, said they believe in ghosts. The overall average was down from 51 percent of all adults who said they believed in ghosts in a 2003 Harris Poll.  That 11-year-old survey, which included response rates by race, showed 51 percent of whites as saying they believe in ghosts, compared with 43 percent of blacks and 59 percent of Hispanics. Another poll, by the Huffington Post and YouGov.com, found 45 percent of Americans say they ""believe in ghosts, or that the spirits of dead people can come back in certain places."" We were unable to find a breakdown of the December 2012 survey by race. Another September 2013 poll of 1,000 Americans by the Huffington Post and YouGov.com asked if they agreed with the statement ""I believe some people have experienced ghosts."" Sixty percent of whites agreed, compared with 62 percent of both black and Hispanic respondents. Showing just how much the way a question is worded can affect answers, a 2011 poll by The Economist/YouGov found 36 percent of white Americans say they generally believe in ghosts.  The takeaway: The number of white Americans who say they believe in ghosts ranges from 36 percent to 62 percent depending on the year, survey and question. Polls on white Americans and racism We were unable to find a poll that asked Americans if they ""believe"" racism exists. Nor do pollsters ask, ""Are you racist?"" ""People are obviously unlikely to tell pollsters they are racists,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""So I don't know how to interpret what he said."" Still, we found many polls examining white Americans’ attitudes on race relations, with a lot of recent polling conducted amid the summer 2013 Trayvon Martin trial. Gallup has done a lot of work on this subject. Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport produced a July 2013 video analyzing highlights in polling research on U.S. race relations. These questions peel away American attitudes on race and show clear disconnects. When asked if new civil rights laws are needed to reduce discrimination against blacks, 53 percent of blacks said yes compared with 17 percent of whites. When asked if the justice system is biased or not, 68 percent of blacks and 25 percent of whites said yes, ""a huge racial gulf there,"" Newport says. In yet another interesting Gallup question, 15 percent of whites said the fact that blacks have on average worse jobs, income and housing than whites was mostly due to discrimination, with 83 percent saying the cause was something else. One Gallup question that got at the issue a little more directly (but several years ago in 2009): ""Do you think racism against blacks is or isn’t widespread in the U.S.?"" Forty-nine percent of whites said it is widespread, while 48 percent said it was not widespread. We looked at other surveys, too, recognizing there are probably so many that we could not have reviewed them all by our deadline. A May 2013 poll for the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found 57 percent of whites said there was some or a lot of discrimination against blacks (88 percent of blacks said they saw a lot of or some discrimination against blacks). A 2006 CNN survey found 66 percent of whites say racism is a ""very serious"" or ""somewhat serious"" problem. Finally, a 2011 study by the Harvard Business School and Tufts University found white Americans feel they are more discriminated against than blacks. The ""reverse racism"" sentiment is notable, researchers said, ""because by nearly any metric—from employment to police treatment, loan rates to education—statistics continue to indicate drastically poorer outcomes for black than white Americans."" The takeaway: The results, again, vary depending on the question — but none of them truly measure whether white Americans believe racism exists.  In general, polls seem to suggest blacks are more likely to see racism as a problem than whites, but a plurality of whites acknowledge discrimination exists in some form in at least two polls we saw. But even these comparisons to Abdul-Jabbar’s claim are not perfect, as those polls measured whether discrimination was widespread or asked respondents to measure the amount of discrimination against blacks, not just acknowledge whether it was present. ""The problem with the comparison is how do we measure racism? Racism takes a lot of forms. It’s much, much harder to say, ‘Do you believe in racism?’ than ‘Do you believe in ghosts?’ "" said Kevin Dougherty, a Baylor University associate sociology professor. ""As a rhetorical flourish, I think it’s an effective one,"" Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, said of Abdul-Jabbar’s statement. But a serious look at empirical data shows it is ""far too complex to just be captured in one kind of rhetorical comparison."" Our ruling Abdul-Jabbar said, ""More whites believe in ghosts than believe in racism."" While we don’t know what research he was citing to support his point, Abdul-Jabbar’s claim is a stretch based on the polls we found and the pollsters we consulted. Depending on the question, you could argue that as many as about 6 in 10 white Americans believe in ghosts, though other polls present a smaller ratio. Abdul-Jabbar, meanwhile, seems to have  interpreted polling about white Americans’ views of discrimination as their belief in racism. We'll be happy to revisit this fact-check if someone points out a poll we missed. Polling we found supports the theory that white Americans are less likely than black Americans to think that blacks are being discriminated against. But those polls don’t measure whether white Americans think racism exists in this country. Experts told us that defining racism is difficult in terms of a poll and that a comparison with believing in ghosts is problematic. Abdul-Jabbar fails to acknowledge the wide disparity on polls dealing with ghosts, inaccurately describes the polling on racism and makes a shaky comparison between the two. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F15A00>],/factchecks/2014/may/04/kareem-abdul-jabbar/nba-legend-abdul-jabbar-more-whites-believe-ghosts/

Cokie Roberts: Susan Rice didn't put the whole Benghazi attack 'on the video'
","Following the release of a new White House email, discussion on the Sunday morning shows turned back to the Sept. 11, 2012, deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. President Barack Obama and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice both came under scrutiny for downplaying a potential terrorist attack in the days following. Though government officials eventually said the attack was an act of terrorism with ties to al-Qaida, White House officials initially said the violence was the result of a mob protesting an anti-Muslim film that had been posted on YouTube. On Fox News Sunday, Chris Wallace criticized Rice. ""Under court order, the administration had to release an email from a presidential adviser that indicates the White House helped shape Susan Rice’s talking points when she appeared here and on other Sunday talk shows five days after the attack,"" he said. ""In those interviews Rice blamed reaction to a video and ruled out a pre-planned act of terror."" Others defended Rice and the White House. On ABC’s This Week, political strategist David Plouffe said the president referred to Benghazi as a terrorist attack in his Rose Garden address Sept. 12. We’ve noted before, though, that the White House wasn’t consistent in describing the event as a terrorist attack until two weeks later. Similarly, ABC political commentator Cokie Roberts argued that Rice mentioned the prospect of terrorism in comments on the Sept. 16 Sunday shows. ""When you read the transcript of those Sunday shows, actually Ms. Rice did say a ‘terrorist attack,’ "" Roberts said. ""It’s not that she put the whole thing on the video."" PolitiFact has broken down Rice’s on-air comments before, but PunditFact wanted to revisit the issue since it’s still a point of contention among pundits a year and a half after the attack. PunditFact found that Roberts misrepresented Rice’s talking points during that first round of Sunday show appearances after the attack. ABC did not return our request for comment. We excerpted each interview at the bottom of our report. Here are the main points: Rice referred to the video as the source of the conflict in all five interviews. On Fox and ABC, she said the attacks were not pre-planned but rather were related to the video protest. She mentioned ""extremists"" on CBS, CNN, NBC and ABC, but again connected them to the protest of the video and implied the uprisings were not planned as an act of terrorism. On CNN, for example, she described the attack as a ""horrific incident where some mob was hijacked ultimately by a handful of extremists."" She mentioned al-Qaida only on CBS and cautioned that she wasn’t sure they were involved. In no interview did she use the word ""terror"" or any variation. Technically, Rice did mention extremism in most of her appearances, but she certainly wasn’t saying that the Benghazi attack was a pre-planned act of terror. In fact, she repeatedly emphasized that it wasn’t. Rice’s appearances on Sunday Sept. 16 were consistent in that she repeatedly said that the federal government was investigating what happened and that ""we'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms."" But when asked to offer her assessment of what happened, Rice stressed protests related to the anti-Muslim video and downplayed connections to terrorism. Our ruling Roberts said that when talking about Benghazi on the Sept. 16, 2012, Sunday shows, Rice said, ""terrorist attack"" and didn’t put the entire blame on protests related to an anti-Islam YouTube video. Our review of the transcripts from Rice’s appearances showed the opposite. She consistently emphasized the importance of the video, and the only times she brought up the possibility of a terrorist connection was to downplay it. We rate Roberts’ claim Mostly False. •  •  •  CBS’ Face the Nation Rice: ""Based on the best information we have to date, what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy sparked by this hateful video. But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution. And that it spun from there into something much, much more violent."" Host Bob Schieffer: ""But you do not agree with (Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.) that this was something that had been plotted out several months ago?"" Rice: ""We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned."" Schieffer: ""Do you agree or disagree with him that al-Qaida had some part in this?"" Rice: ""Well, we'll have to find out that out. I mean I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence. Whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine."" •  •  •  CNN’s State of the Union Rice: ""Let’s recall what has happened in the last several days. There was a hateful video that was disseminated on the Internet. It had nothing to do with the United States government and it's one that we find disgusting and reprehensible. It's been offensive to many, many people around the world. ""That sparked violence in various parts of the world, including violence directed against western facilities including our embassies and consulates. That violence is absolutely unacceptable, it's not a response that one can ever condone when it comes to such a video. And we have been working very closely and, indeed, effectively with the governments in the region and around the world to secure our personnel, secure our embassy, condemn the violent response to this video. ""And, frankly, we've seen these sorts of incidents in the past. We've seen violent responses to (Salman Rushdie’s novel, The) Satanic Verses. We've seen violent responses to the cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in an evil way. So this is something we've seen in the past, and we expect that it's possible that these kinds of things could percolate into the future. What we're focused on is securing our personnel, securing our facilities. ... ""(It was a) horrific incident where some mob was hijacked ultimately by a handful of extremists."" •  •  •  NBC’s Meet The Press Rice: ""We can't predict with any certainty, but let's remember what has transpired over the last several days. This is a response to a hateful and offensive video that was widely disseminated throughout the Arab and Muslim world. ... ""Let me tell you the best information we have at present. First of all, there is an FBI investigation, which is ongoing, and we look to that investigation to give us the definitive word as to what transpired. But putting together the best information that we have available to us today -- our current assessment is that what happened in Benghazi was, in fact, initially a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo -- almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video. ""What we think then transpired in Benghazi is that opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as this was unfolding. They came with heavy weapons, which, unfortunately, are readily available in post-revolutionary Libya, and that escalated into a much more violent episode. Obviously, that's our best judgment now. We'll await the results of the investigation."" •  •  •  Fox News Sunday Host Chris Wallace: ""The top Libyan official says that the attack on Tuesday was, quote, his words ‘preplanned.’ Al-Qaida says the operation was revenge for our killing a top al-Qaida leader. What do we know?"" Rice: ""Well, first of all, Chris, we are obviously investigating this very closely. The FBI has a lead in this investigation. The information, the best information and the best assessment we have today is that in fact this was not a pre-planned, premeditated attack. That what happened initially was that it was a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired in Cairo as a consequence of the video. People gathered outside the embassy and then it grew very violent and those with extremist ties joined the fray and came with heavy weapons, which unfortunately are quite common in post-revolutionary Libya and that then spun out of control. ""But we don't see at this point signs this was a coordinated plan, premeditated attack. Obviously, we will wait for the results of the investigation and we don't want to jump to conclusions before then. But I do think it's important for the American people to know our best current assessment."" •  •  •  ABC’s This Week Rice: ""First of all, it's important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired. But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what this began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated. ""We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate, rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons, weapons that as you know in the wake of the revolution in Libya are quite common and accessible. And it then evolved from there.

Jim Sensenbrenner says under proposed Obama budget, Army would be smaller than before Pearl Harbor
","Near the end of an April 15, 2014 town hall meeting in his district, Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner listened to a constituent cite something on the Internet about the resignation of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ""There’s no truth meter on the Internet,"" remarked Sensenbrenner, a Republican elected to Congress in southeastern Wisconsin since 1978. Respectfully, we beg to differ on that. A remark earlier in the town-hall session by Sensenbrenner about Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s plans to downsize the Army’s troop strength caught our attention. ""With respect to the president’s budget proposal, there the recommendation was that we have an Army of fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor,"" Sensenbrenner said when asked about survivor’s benefits. ""That’s ridiculous and outrageous."" Let’s put that one on our Truth-O-Meter. When we asked Sensenbrenner spokesman Ben Miller for backup on the historical comparison, he referred us to the U.S. Department of Defense’s budget request for fiscal year 2015. It quoted the Quadrennial Defense Review 2014. That five-year plan says the active Army will reduce its ""end strength"" to between 440,000 and 450,000 personnel. The current active-duty figure is about 520,000, Army spokesman Troy Rolan told us. Miller also pointed to stories in the New York Times, and a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that included Associated Press reporting on Hagel’s budget. The Times piece said that ""cuts proposed by the Obama administration would result in the smallest Army since just before the World War II buildup."" The AP report said the active-duty Army would shrink to the ""smallest number since 1940, when the nation was gearing up to enter World War II."" But Sensenbrenner didn’t say Hagel’s plan would result in the smallest Army since before the war buildup. He said it would be smaller than the pre-war troop complement. Before the U.S. buildup got cranked up, the Army had 188,000 troops in mid-1939 and 264,000 in mid-1940, official Army figures show. So Hagel’s plan for 440,000 active troops would still be larger than that, contrary to what Sensenbrenner said. Sensenbrenner’s phrasing looks better if you limit the comparison just to the 1941 period right before Pearl Harbor. But the troop numbers from 1941 include the U.S. buildup that began in 1940 in the wake of Germany’s 1939 invasion of Poland. By late August 1941, active-duty Army personnel totalled about 1.6 million. If Sensenbrenner was using 1.6 million as his comparison point, he couldn’t confine his outrage to the Obama/Hagel Army of 450,000, because every Army since 1952 has been smaller than 1.6 million. Troop levels ebb and flow, as you might expect, around major wars. After the World War II peak of 8.3 million, the Army’s numbers fell dramatically, then blipped up to 1.6 million during the Korean War. After another drop, the number ramped up to 1.475 million during the Vietnam War before levelling off at about 775,000 from the mid-1970s through the 1980s. The Army’s size fell significantly throughout the 1990s to 479,000 before slowly ticking up to 571,000 after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As America has drawn down troops in those nations, the Army’s strength has dropped to the current 520,000. So, with the proposed reduction, the Army would be just below where it was before the Sept. 11 attacks. Strained comparison There’s another angle to consider here: the difficulty in comparing a 1940 Army to today’s model. We asked military historian Lance Janda of Cameron University in Oklahoma to assess Sensenbrenner’s comments. Janda called the comments ""terribly misleading, implying as they do a sort of similarity between the technology, force structure, threat environment, and federal budget reality in 2014 and the one in 1940 that simply does not exist."" In terms of weapons systems, communications capabilities, speed of deployment, radius of action, and overall destructive potential, Janda said, the U.S. is light years beyond where it was prior to World War II. ""In 1940 our Army and army Air Corps were relatively small and our Navy was one among several powerful navies around the world,"" Janda said. ""Today, the United States Navy and Air Force have no peers."" Travis Sharp, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a nonprofit think tank, wrote that size of the force often does matter, but ""since the 2014 Army is not going to fight in the 1940 strategic environment, comparing them does not help us decide what to do today."" ""While interesting,"" Sharp wrote, ""the comparison to 1940 is not particularly useful."" ""Today's Army is vastly more capable, even at a fraction of the headcount,"" John Pike, director of Globalsecurity.org, told us. Hagel, in announcing the budget reductions in February 2014, called them difficult and not without added risk. Hagel said the cuts assume the United States no longer becomes involved in large, prolonged stability operations overseas on the scale of Iraq and Afghanistan, the Defense Department reported. But he said the smaller force still would be capable of decisively defeating aggression in one major war ""while also defending the homeland and supporting air and naval forces engaged in another theater against an adversary."" Still, some analysts, including Sharp, have expressed concerns about repercussions on the battlefield and beyond if the active-duty complement falls to 440,000 without appropriate contingency planning. ""Prioritizing technology over size has a strategic logic and conforms with historical practice,"" wrote Sharp. ""Despite this logic, focusing on high-tech modernization without simultaneously implementing policies to regenerate ground forces quickly should a crisis erupt constitutes strategic negligence of the highest order."" PolitiFact National checked a statement similar to Sensenbrenner’s in January 2012. The speaker was Mitt Romney. The Republican presidential candidate said that the U.S. military is at risk of losing its ""military superiority"" because ""our Navy is smaller than it’s been since 1917. Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947."" The claim earned a Pants on Fire rating. The numbers were close to accurate, but experts said it was wrong to assume a decline in the number of ships or aircraft automatically means a weaker military. And the comparison of today’s military to its predecessors in 1917 or 1947 was deemed ridiculous. Our rating Sensenbrenner said that President Obama’s budget proposed ""an Army of fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor."" The congressman doesn’t read as much into the numbers as did Romney. But he flubbed the historical comparison pointed out by others, and experts say it’s a limited and potentially misleading comparison in any event. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966ED400>],/factchecks/2014/may/04/jim-sensenbrenner/jim-sensenbrenner-says-army-smaller-pearl-harbor/
"['Rhode Island', 'City Budget', 'Negative Campaigning', 'Taxes', 'Gina Raimondo']","
Gina Raimondo says Providence taxes rose nearly 27 percent under Mayor Angel Taveras
","Read our lips: If you want to win an election, accuse your opponent of raising taxes. So it wasn't surprising when Gina Raimondo, Rhode Island's general treasurer and candidate for governor, accused one of her Democratic primary opponents, Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, of overseeing a hefty tax increase. On April 28, 2014, the Raimondo campaign issued a news release headlined, ""Just the Facts: As Providence families pay their property taxes, residential property taxes are up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras."" ""Under Mayor Taveras,"" it said, ""residential property taxes were raised two separate times: by 5 percent in FY 2012 and by 20.7 percent in FY 2014. In total, residential property taxes, which hit working families hard, are up 26.7 percent since 2011."" The news release even included footnotes that cite the pages in the city's budgets that supported the argument. The Taveras campaign quickly fired back that the allegation was wrong and the average increase for 2014 was about 6 percent, not 20.7 percent. We donned our referee jersey and decided to use the Truth-O-Meter to see who was correct. The references in the news release sent us to two Providence budgets. Raimondo spokesman Eric Hyers said we should be looking at the tax rates. In the 2012 budget, on page 137, the tax rate for homeowners goes from $15.19 to $15.94, a 4.9 percent increase. The following year, the tax rate remained the same. But in the 2014 budget, on page 161, the rate jumps to $19.25, for an increase of 26.7 percent over three years. ""We said tax rates are up 26 percent, which is totally, totally accurate,"" said Hyers. But on the same page of the 2014 budget, it notes that the new budget is based on an updated estimate of property values in the city, and residential property values decreased by an average of 13.2 percent. Readers who don't immediately understand why this throws a ridiculously-large monkey wrench into Raimondo's claim need to realize how property tax rates are calculated. The amount you pay depends on how many thousands of dollars your property is worth. If your house and land are worth $100,000 and the tax rate is set at $22 per thousand, your bill will be $2,200, or $100 times $22. In Rhode Island, every community is required to reassess the value of all of its properties every three years. When that revaluation occurs, the tax rate will usually go up or down depending on whether property values fall or rise, even if government spending -- and the average tax bill -- doesn't change from year to year. Comparing tax rates in isolation before and after a revaluation ignores half the equation. When residential property values decline by 13.2 percent, you have to increase your tax rate by a hefty amount if you want to raise the same amount of revenue that you did the previous year. In that case, the average tax bill remains the same. (On a case-by-case basis, the people in areas of the city where their property values rose will see an increase and homeowners living where property values fell will see their tax bill drop. That's what happened in Providence, although the average homeowner increase on individual tax bills was 4.8 percent.) In short: a tax rate -- by itself -- becomes a meaningless number when a municipality has readjusted the value of its tax base. When you take Providence’s revaluation into consideration, a homeowner whose property value went from $150,000 to $130,200 after revaluation saw a tax increase of 10 percent over the three-year period Raimondo is talking about, not 26 or 27 percent, according to our calculation based on city data. We asked Hyers if the Raimondo campaign had realized there had been a revaluation. He said the campaign knew, but it wasn't relevant to the news release. ""We're talking about rates,"" he said. ""The math is very simple.  We are not trying to claim, and you will never hear me try to claim, that tax bills are up 27 percent. We've never said that the bills went up 27 percent. All we're saying is that the rates have gone up 27 percent."" But contrary to Hyers’ assertion, the Raimondo news release never uses the word ""rate."" And it does say the tax bills went up 27 percent. It even quotes Hyers as saying, ""Providence property taxes are skyrocketing."" Our ruling In a news release, State Treasurer Gina Raimondo said, ""Residential property taxes [in Providence] are up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras."" If Raimondo had consistently said that the tax rate had increased nearly 27 percent, PolitiFact Rhode Island would have viewed this claim differently. But the Raimondo ""Just the Facts"" news release misstates the facts, claiming taxes increased by nearly 27 percent. That's a ridiculous assertion, especially coming from the campaign of the current general treasurer, who is also a finance expert and presumably understands municipal finance. We rate it Pants on Fire!

"['Immigration', 'Education', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott opposed in-state tuition for DREAMers before he embraced it
","After more than a decade of failed attempts, the Florida Legislature approved in-state tuition for DREAMers -- college students who were brought to the United States illegally as children. The legislation passed through both chambers by wide margins in the final week of the legislative session, during an election year when Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic rival Charlie Crist are battling for the Hispanic vote, which represents about 14 percent of the state’s electorate. Both candidates and their political parties have accused their opponent of not siding with Hispanics in the past and pandering now that they want votes. Scott campaigned in 2010 in favor of an Arizona-style immigration law and in 2013 vetoed a bill to give DREAMers driver’s licenses. (The term ""DREAMers"" comes from the DREAM Act, federal legislation that would give such young people legal status.) But this year he appointed Carlos Lopez-Cantera, a former Miami-Dade legislator of Cuban descent, as his running mate and is courting Hispanics. As the Republican-led Legislature appeared poised to pass the bill in April, the Republican Party of Florida attacked Crist for opposing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in 2006. As a Republican candidate for governor at the time, Crist did oppose the tuition break, though he supports it now. We rated the party’s claim True. But Crist isn’t the only candidate in the governor’s race to change his mind about DREAMers tuition. On the morning of the final day of the legislative session, the Florida Democratic Party accused Scott of flip-flopping on DREAMers tuition. Their weapon: an interview Scott gave in 2011 to a conservative news program. We decided to put the topic of in-state tuition for DREAMers on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter. The Flip-O-Meter doesn’t pass judgment on whether a politician flipped; we simply measure whether he did flip and to what extent. Scott on tuition before 2014 While Scott has said a lot about in-state tuition in recent weeks, we found he said very little about it before 2014. In September 2011, Scott was asked about the topic during a friendly interview on Newsmax, a conservative website. At the time, Scott was in Orlando for the Presidency V conference the Florida GOP was hosting. The main topics of the interview were the importance of Florida in the presidential election, Scott’s opposition to Obamacare and his effort to grow jobs and improve the economy. The reporter briefly touched on immigration: ""Two huge issues. Let’s talk about immigration and Rick Perry’s giving in-state tuition to illegal alien children. Where do you stand on that?"" Scott replied: ""Well, my position on immigration has been clear for a long time. I believe the federal government ought to do their job. You know, secure our borders. Come up with an immigration policy that Americans understand and people who want to come to this country understand. But with regard to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants I completely oppose it."" Then the interview turned to repealing Obamacare. In an April 2013 interview with the Sun-Sentinel, Scott showed support for allowing citizen children born here to parents who came here illegally -- which is different than the current bill which pertains to children who came here illegally. From the Sentinel: Question: ""Do you support a bill allowing children born here of illegal immigrants to qualify for college tuition as residents?"" Scott: ""Absolutely, yes. If you were born in this state or in this country, and you are resident of this state, you ought to get in-state tuition. ... "" Question: ""What about noncitizens brought to this country at a very young age by their parents?"" Scott: ""The issue you're dealing with there is that we're taxing our own citizens to pay for an education system. So what's fair? Right now our universities are always asking for more money as it is. So, I think the right thing is if you were born in this country and you have the residency requirements of this state, you get in-state tuition."" The bill in 2014 The bill approved by the Legislature this year offers in-state tuition rates to undocumented students who attended a Florida high school for at least three years. That reduced rate is about three to four times less than what out-of-state students currently pay. A Senate analysis estimates about 1,300 students would qualify each year. The Legislature has failed to pass similar bills since 2003, but this year it succeeded largely because of the support of House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel. The House swiftly passed it  81-33 in March. After some snags, the Senate approved it 26-13 on May 1. The Senate tweaked the House version so it returned to the House again and passed 84-32 May 2. What Scott said about the bill in 2014 This year, Scott was initially hard to pin down on DREAMers tuition. In early February in a meeting with the Legislature’s Hispanic caucus, he was cautious: ""I’ll certainly consider it,"" Scott said. ""I want all tuition to stop growing."" When asked about the House bill April 1, Scott reaffirmed his support for the Senate version, which included getting rid of the tuition differential that raises the cost for all students. ""I'm going to work with the Senate and the House to make sure we have a bill that lowers tuition for all Floridians,"" he said. But as the bill stood on shaky ground in the Senate in mid April, Scott made his support clear. In a joint statement with former Republican Govs. Jeb Bush and Bob Martinez, Scott said: ""Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition rate at universities their peers and classmates do. We want our students to stay here in Florida when they go to college and when they choose a career, and that means we must make college more affordable for all those students who call Florida home. The Florida Senate should take immediate action to move SB 1400 forward."" During a press gaggle in Fort Lauderdale a few days before the end of the session, Scott said he ""absolutely"" supported the bill. A reporter asked Scott: ""When did that change? When did you have that change of mind as far as supporting in-state tuition?"" Scott: ""I haven’t changed my mind at all. I want lower tuition for all Floridians. These are the things that the bill does. For individuals that grew up in our state, they deserve the same tuition as ... everybody else and all their peers. And this is something that Charlie Crist opposed. He opposed in-state tuition for children of immigrants. But on top of that it reduces the 15 percent differential and the inflationary change in tuition every year. ... They have caused tuition to be too expensive so lower-income, middle-income families can’t afford their tuition, and Charlie Crist is the one who signed those bills."" In follow-up questions, Scott focused on his overall goal of reducing college tuition in general: Question: ""You said you had always been in favor of in-state tuition for DREAMers. I did a quick search before I came here and I couldn’t find comments you made about that before this year. Can you be a little more specific about your support before this year?"" Scott: ""It’s the right thing to do. As you know I’ve always focused on lower tuition for all Floridians and whether it’s those that grew up here they’re not getting in-state tuition, those that are seeing this 15 percent plus inflationary increase we need to get tuition lower so all of our students -- low-income middle-income everybody -- can afford college and university."" Question: ""So you’ve always supported in-state tuition for DREAMers throughout your tenure as Governor?"" Scott: ""I have always supported lower tuition for all Floridians."" On May 1, after the Senate passed the bill, Scott said he looked forward to signing the bill. After the House took its final vote on the bill May 2, Scott said in a prepared statement: ""The Florida Legislature embraced fairness for all students today by taking action to lower the costs of higher education for every family in Florida. Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition. We are trying to right the wrongs of the previous administration that raised the price of a college education and opposed providing in-state tuition for children of immigrants. The Legislature did the right thing, and I look forward to signing this historic legislation."" Spokespersons for Scott referred us to Scott’s comments in a May 2 press gaggle when a reporter asked Scott about the video from 2011 which showed his opposition to in-state tuition for DREAMers. But Scott didn’t address his own flip-flop in his response. Our rating In September 2011, Scott said in a TV interview that he ""completely"" opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. But by April 2014, he supported it. For his complete change of stance, we give Scott a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C494C00>],/factchecks/2014/may/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-opposed-state-tuition-dreamers-he-embra/

Early in campaign, Wendy Davis has not raised more from three teacher groups than previous Democratic gubernatorial nominees combined
","Teacher groups often back Democrats for office; it shouldn’t be a surprise Wendy Davis has such support. Still, a reader asked us to check an April 11, 2014, tweet from @WendyDavisTruth, a Twitter account run by the Republican Party of Texas. The tweet said, ""Wendy Davis has already taken more $ from teacher unions than the past 3 Democrat gubernatorial candidates combined."" The tweet came with a bar chart comparing contributions by three teacher groups — the Texas State Teachers Association, Texas chapter of the American Federation of Teachers and the political arm of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association. The bar labeled ""2014 Wendy Davis"" far exceeded comparable bars for Tony Sanchez’s 2002 gubernatorial run, Chris Bell’s 2006 campaign and Bill White’s 2010 campaign. Here’s the chart:  By the group’s math, Davis has drawn $102,777 from the three teacher groups, while the previous three Democratic nominees for governor combined to attract $102,700. Republican Party of Texa administrator Beth Cubriel told us by email the figures were based on contribution and expenditure reports filed at the Texas Ethics Commission. She added that the figures reflect all contributions by the teacher groups to the candidates — not just contributions made while each one was running for governor. But labels on the chart — ""2006 Bell"" and ""2014 Wendy Davis,"" for example — left us with a different impression. One might not expect that previous campaigns for other offices would be included in those contribution totals. We looked next at how much each candidate drew from the singled-out groups while running for governor. By our calculations, Davis garnered about $67,000 of her contributions from the groups for her two tightly-contested Senate campaigns with about $36,000 coming in since she declared for governor Oct. 3, 2013. Likewise, Bell in 2006 drew no donations from the groups during his run for governor; his nearly $40,000 came during his 2008 campaign for a Texas Senate seat. By contrast, the teacher contributions to Sanchez in 2002 and White in 2010 were specifically for gubernatorial campaigns. By email, Cubriel said our breakdown succinctly covers ""what didn't fit into the four corners"" of the party's chart. The party ""never claimed the money was given to her gov(ernor) campaign directly,"" she said. ""The years on the chart are to serve as a reminder of when each candidate was the nominee."" We told Cubriel that our review of campaign-finance reports turned up a sizable contribution not included in the party’s critique--$125,000 gained by Davis’s gubernatorial kitty on Jan. 15, 2014, from the Washington, D.C.-based American Federation of Teachers Committee on Political Education. Cubriel said by phone that party researchers didn’t search records for that group. ""That makes the case against her even worse,"" she said. Our ruling The Texas party said Davis has already taken more money from ""teacher unions,"" meaning three teacher groups, than the previous three Democratic gubernatorial candidates combined and presented a chart purporting to show that. The tweet and chart turned out to mislead. Most of the cited teacher groups’ giving to Davis came during her campaigns for state Senate, not during her run for governor. Running for governor, Davis has attracted about $36,000 from two of the groups and nothing from the third. That total trails the $65,000 combined raised by two of the previous nominees in their respective gubernatorial bids. Regardless, the claim has an element of truth. With career fund-raising factored in, Davis has topped the three previous Democratic gubernatorial nominees in support from the groups. Moreover, the party didn't mention a 2014 donation of $125,000 to Davis's campaign from a major teacher group. We rate this claim as Mostly False.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett attacks Democratic rival Tom Wolf over taxes, job losses
","Pennsylvania’s Republican governor, Tom Corbett, is widely considered one of the most vulnerable governors seeking re-election in 2014. Recently, he’s begun targeting Tom Wolf, the Democrat who has become the frontrunner in a four-way Democratic primary. Since March, Wolf has led Corbett in general-election polls by between seven and 19 percentage points. In a radio ad released April 30, 2014, Corbett’s campaign took aim at Wolf’s record when he was serving as Pennsylvania’s revenue secretary, an appointed position that handles tax collection. Wolf was appointed to the position by then-Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, and confirmed by the state Senate, which was in Republican hands. He served as revenue secretary from April 2007 until November 2008. Here’s what Corbett’s ad said: Wolf ""conveniently left out of his ads that he was the state’s revenue secretary in Harrisburg. You know, the top tax collector. And Wolf was a job-killing bureaucrat. On Wolf’s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs, and our unemployment went up almost 50 percent. But the real insult? Wolf is a millionaire, but he fought to increase taxes on average Pennsylvanians, including higher taxes on home heating and the sales tax. Tom Wolf: high taxes, fewer jobs."" That’s a lot of claims for a brief ad, but for this fact-check we’re going to focus on the claim that ""on Wolf’s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs."" For claims like this one, we take into account two factors -- whether the statistics cited are accurate, and whether it’s reasonable to assign credit or blame to the target of the ad. So we’ll take this claim point by point. With this ad, the statistics quoted are reasonable, but the blame is off-base -- especially the cause of Pennsylvania's job loss. To the extent that taxes were high, was Wolf responsible? We won’t address whether taxes were too high in Pennsylvania, since that’s an opinion on which reasonable people can disagree. But we can judge whether Wolf bears responsibility for the state of Pennsylvania’s taxes while he was serving as revenue secretary. First, here’s Corbett’s argument. A Corbett spokesman, Billy Pitman, noted that the Tax Foundation found Pennsylvania to have the 10th highest tax burden among states in 2007 and 2008. (The Tax Foundation is a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning.) Pitman said the ad was referring to some specific taxes Wolf advocated for. ""In his position as the commonwealth’s top tax collector, Secretary Wolf lobbied the legislature on behalf of the Rendell administration he served,"" Pitman said. Among the proposals Pitman specifically cited were an increase to the sales tax, an oil-company tax and hikes to electricity and garbage-collection taxes. The Corbett campaign has a point that Wolf, as a member of Rendell’s cabinet, advocated for some tax hikes (though also for some reductions); we found news reports to back that up. However, the ad exaggerates Wolf’s influence on the shape of tax policy in the state. First, Pennsylvania’s tax landscape was set well before Wolf got on the job. In April 2007, corporate taxes accounted for about one-fifth of tax revenues, sales taxes accounted for about one-quarter, and personal income taxes accounted for about 55 percent. This means that adding a percentage point to the state sales tax, as Wolf advocated, would have represented a modest increase to a levy that represented just one-quarter of the state’s overall tax revenue. The other taxes he advocated for would have had an even more modest impact on the state’s overall tax architecture. Why does this matter? Because the ad said that ""on Wolf’s watch, taxes were high."" This suggests that Wolf is to blame for the state’s overall tax structure, rather than just for proposing marginal expansions. In reality, most of the state’s tax structure was already well-established before Wolf was even sworn in, so it’s a stretch to lay the blame for ""high taxes"" at his feet. Second, the ad overhypes how much impact Wolf had on tax policy as revenue secretary. While Wolf certainly engaged in at least some advocacy, as the newspaper articles noted, his job duties were exclusively administrative, not policy-setting. The secretary’s job, according to the department’s website, is to ""administer the tax laws of the commonwealth in a fair and equitable manner."" Raising taxes or creating new ones is up to the governor and the Legislature (which during his tenure had one chamber controlled by the Republicans). ""The revenue secretary collects the taxes and issues reports on the state's financial health, and the subjects and rates of taxation are set by state law,"" said Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. ""Policies dealing with economic and community development, jobs programs, taxes and other recession-fighting measures are handled by the governor and the Legislature."" Christopher Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., agreed that the ad assigned too much responsibility for setting tax policy to Wolf. ""The claims in this ad are really loose, and as is the case in almost all negative ads, very lacking in context,"" he said. Was Wolf culpable in killing 100,000 Pennsylvania jobs? We did find a basis for the ad’s claim that 100,000 Pennsylvania jobs were lost during Wolf’s tenure. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed Pennsylvanians rose by 150,000 between April 2007 and November 2008. However, the problem with this part of the claim is that it’s a stretch to blame taxes in general -- much less Wolf specifically -- for the loss of these jobs (especially their ""killing,"" in the ad’s overheated rhetoric). We asked Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, how much straight-line causation we can draw between tax policy and those job losses. ""Basically none,"" Sinclair said, saying the much bigger factor during that period was the national economic downturn, which officially became a recession almost halfway through Wolf’s tenure. While she acknowledged that tax policy can affect job growth, Sinclair added that ""economists disagree wildly on the ‘job-killing’ effects of taxes. So, confidently drawing any line of causation is impossible. And throw in that the entire country lost about 2.3 million jobs over that period. I don't think it was the high taxes of Pennsylvania that caused the job losses."" Our ruling Corbett’s ad claimed that ""on Wolf’s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs."" The ad has a point that Wolf, as a Rendell appointee, did at times give rhetorical support to some of the governor’s proposed tax hikes (as well as some proposed tax reductions). But the ad exaggerates the influence that Wolf, as the operational head of the state’s tax-collection department, had on crafting tax policy. Most of the state’s tax structure was set long before he took office, and most of his job was to carry out tax laws, not craft them. Meanwhile, the ad suggests that taxes are to blame for the job losses on his watch, when in fact Wolf’s time in office coincided with the start of the national economic downturn -- a much more plausible reason for rising unemployment. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809664EF40>],/factchecks/2014/may/02/tom-corbett/pa-gov-tom-corbett-attacks-democratic-rival-tom-wo/

NEARI Executive Director Robert A. Walsh Jr. says candidate Clay Pell hasn't spent anything on advertising in his run for governor
","During an April 20, 2014, interview on WPRI-TV's ""Newsmakers,"" Robert A. Walsh Jr., executive director of the National Education Association-Rhode Island, was asked about the likelihood that Clay Pell would win September's Democratic primary and, ultimately, the November election. Walsh downplayed the importance of the latest polls showing little support among Democrats for Pell, the gubernatorial candidate supported by the union. (Pell was favored by  9.4 percent in an April 11 Brown University poll and 15 percent in a February Providence Journal / WPRI survey.) ""Poll numbers in April for a relatively new candidate are meaningless,"" Walsh said. ""What is he? Mid-teens or something right now? But he hasn't spent a dime on advertising or done anything else. He's getting out there meeting people. When he meets people he converts them to his cause and his message."" Hasn't spent a dime on advertising? That didn't make cents to us. Immediately after Pell's announcement on Jan. 28, 2014, it was almost impossible to go online and not see ads for Pell popping up on nearly every website you’d visit -- even those featuring General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, one of Pell’s Democratic opponents. Those ads cost a lot of dimes, so we called Walsh to see if he could justify his claim. He responded by email: ""Of course the reference was to the traditional television buys that accompany campaigns (since I was on TV when I mentioned it),"" he wrote. That's not a distinction he made during the program. Exactly how much has Pell spent on advertising? On April 23 we began an effort to get that information -- even a rough estimate. Pell's campaign promised to get back to us, but despite repeated follow-up calls and emails, we couldn't get our questions answered. A week later, on April 30, the Pell campaign, as required by law, filed its quarterly finance report for the first three months of 2014. It showed that Pell, who began his campaign by loaning himself a million dollars, has now invested another million dollars of his own money in his campaign and spent $311,547 in January, February and March. It also showed that on Jan. 7, Pell spent $36,530 on advertising and media production through a media company in Washington, D.C. The firm got another $7,880 on March 10. (The other two items listed as advertising expenditures were $200 for an ad with the Rhode Island Black Heritage Society and $800 for a full-page ad in the program book of this year's Providence Newspaper Guild Follies, run by unionized workers at The Journal.) Our ruling NEARI executive director Robert Walsh said candidate Clay Pell ""hasn't spent a dime on advertising."" At the time, the Pell campaign had already spent 444,100 dimes, or $44,410, on advertising through a Washington media firm. We know the public has seen at least some of that money because we were inundated with online Pell ads soon after his announcement. To suggest that Pell hasn't spent a dime -- or a quarter, or a dollar -- on advertising is not only short-changing the truth, it's ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!
