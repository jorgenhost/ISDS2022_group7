No, a heat wave did not melt a turbine blade at a Texas wind farm
","A Facebook post showing a wind turbine with collapsed blades is falsely claiming that the damage is a result of excessive heat. ""Current wave of heat melts a wind turbine' [sic] in Texas,"" the caption on the photo reads. This is not true. The same photo, which was also posted to the Twitter page of the National Weather Service in Houston, was taken at a wind farm in Matagorda County, according to the agency. The wilted-looking blades are a result of storm winds that passed through the area on June 14, NWS Houston said in the tweet. The June 17 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post and others like it come on the heels of a recent heat wave that has gripped Texas and other states across the southwest and southeast over the past week which has sent demand for electricity skyrocketing as air conditioning units in homes and businesses are being run day and night.  What’s more, the company running the wind farm in the post — RWE Renewables — told Reuters in a statement that the damage was a result of storm damage and not excessive heat. ""The damage to the turbine was definitely NOT related to heat or high temperatures,"" RWE spokesman Matt Tulis said in the statement.

Bush lowballs border wall mileage
","Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush wants to continue a project left unfinished by former President Donald Trump.   As part of his recently-launched bid to unseat Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in the 2022 Republican primary, Bush has designs to join other state leaders in finishing the border wall using state resources.  In a June 9 interview on Fox Business, Bush took a moment to blast Vice President Kamala Harris and the Biden administration for its perceived inaction in response to the influx of migrants arriving at the southern U.S. border.   ""There’s absolutely no sense of urgency,"" Bush told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. ""We see an uncompleted wall that was duly appropriated dollars during the Trump days to build over 700 miles. Only 150 miles were constructed.""  Continuing construction on the border wall in Texas is emerging as a popular commitment among Texas Republican leaders and candidates as the Republican primary cycle begins. It is one of former Republican state Sen. Don Huffines’ central campaign pledges in his campaign for governor. And on Wednesday, Gov. Greg Abbott announced that his office would be pursuing construction of a state-owned border wall financed by $250 million from the state combined with private donations solicited online.  Trump indeed fell short of his original border wall goals. His 2016 campaign initially promised 1,000 miles of barriers along the 2,000 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, but by 2017 that goal shifted to ""anywhere from 700 to 900 miles."" In 2020 the goalposts moved again to ""about 537 miles altogether."" And before Trump left office, he claimed to have ""completed the wall"" with about 450 miles of barriers constructed. Is Bush lowballing Trump’s border wall achievements, or was Trump exaggerating the number of miles that were constructed during his term?  On Jan. 8, during the final weeks of Trump's tenure, U.S. Customs and Border Protection released a border wall status memo detailing additions made between 2017 and 2020.   According to the memo, about 738 miles of barriers were planned. Of those, about 453 miles were completed, and the remaining 285 miles were either under construction or in the pre-construction phase, which President Joe Biden ceased upon entering office. Only about 17 of these miles were constructed in Texas all within the Rio Grande Valley sector.   There are several ways to count border wall miles. U.S. Customs and Border Protection divides wall barriers into several different categories. There are walls constructed in locations where no barriers previously existed, and walls constructed in place of dilapidated or outdated designs. There are barriers built as ""primary walls,"" which people walking across the border would encounter first, and barriers built as ""secondary walls,"" which run behind the length of primary walls along some sections.  Of the 453 completed miles, about 47 miles of primary walls and 33 miles of secondary walls were constructed where no barriers previously existed. And 351 miles of primary walls and 22 miles of secondary walls were constructed to replace dilapidated or outdated designs.   It’s unclear what math Bush used to find that ""only 150 miles were constructed."" His office referred all questions to his campaign, and a spokesperson for his campaign never responded to questions asking for his calculus.   But by no permutation of these figures can you arrive at a total of 150 miles. If looking at primary walls alone, a total of about 400 miles were built. Fifty-five miles of secondary walls were constructed. If looking at walls only built where no barriers previously existed, 80 miles of walls were erected, while 373 miles were built in place of dilapidated or obsolete structures.   Furthermore, Bush makes a dubious claim that wall construction was funded by ""duly appropriated dollars during the Trump days.""  The Trump administration initially requested $13.3 billion through 2020 for wall construction, but Congress provided $4.47 billion through Department of Homeland Security appropriations, according to the Congressional Research Service. Of that total, about $1 billion was directed to barrier replacement projects, $1.4 billion was directed to planning and $2 billion was directed to construction needs in the Rio Grande Valley sector.  Funds appropriated by Congress for wall construction are legally obligated to be used consistent with their appropriated purpose, no matter the administration in office.  The only other money appropriated to border wall construction was part of a $1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by Congress in 2020. That bill included $900 billion for COVID-19 relief and nearly $1.4 billion for wall funding. Biden has since paused the flow of those funds to border wall construction projects.  However, the primary way the Trump administration funded the border wall project was by redirecting dollars originally appropriated by Congress to other government agencies for other purposes, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection memo. Between 2017 and 2019, about $15 billion was redirected from three agencies to Trump’s wall project through a series of executive actions.  ""Since January 2017, ~$15 billion has been identified to construct ~738 miles of new border wall system through a combination of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Defense (DoD) funding and the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF),"" the memo reads. ""Funding received supports planning, design, real estate, environmental, construction and oversight activities.""  On June 11, the Biden administration announced that it would use money appropriated by Congress for Trump’s border wall projects to ""remediate urgent life, safety, and environmental issues resulting from the previous administration’s border wall construction.""  Those remediation projects include closing breaches in the Rio Grande Valley levee system, remediating soil erosion in San Diego and cleaning up border wall construction sites.  It’s unclear how Bush concluded that ""only 150 miles were constructed"" of the border wall during the Trump administration. However, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that this is an undercount. About 453 miles of primary and secondary border walls were completed between 2017 and 2020.  Bush’s claim that Congress appropriated money to build over 700 miles of barriers also misses the mark. Although Congress appropriated some money — $5.9 billion — for the border wall project during Trump’s term, most of the construction was financed using $15 billion redirected from other purposes.  We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/jun/21/george-p-bush/bush-undercounts-border-wall-miles-completed-under/

But, leaving aside the ""atrocities"" rhetoric, and the fact that the public holiday isn’t only for Black people, their post ignores two points. The claim is that the Democrats ""finally"" created Juneteenth when the party only recently gained control of the presidency and Congress.  Before January 2021 — when Joe Biden was inaugurated as president and two special-election wins in Georgia gave Democrats effective control of the Senate — Democrats hadn’t had control of the House, Senate and White House for a decade.  In June 2020, with GOP President Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling the Senate 53-47, Democrats introduced the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act in the House and Senate. The measures didn’t get a vote in either chamber.  The Democratic-led legislation that created the holiday, introduced in February 2021, received overwhelmingly bipartisan support. On June 15, the Senate — now split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris able to break tie votes — unanimously approved June 19 as a new federal holiday.

DeSantis leaves out context in claim about meth and the southern border
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that Florida had a meth problem that is ""really, really ravaging communities,"" particularly in the northern part of the state. The problem, he said, is worsening due to President Joe Biden’s immigration policies. ""That meth, if you go back 10, 20 years ago, you’d find these places where they’d be cooking this stuff up locally. That’s not what’s happening now,"" DeSantis said at a June 16 news conference. ""It’s almost all coming across the southern border, and it’s been accelerating for the last six months, and it’s deepening the problems that we are having in terms of getting a handle on this in our own communities here in the state of Florida."" Part of DeSantis’ plan to address the problem is sending Florida law enforcement officers to states on the southwest border for about two weeks. At the news conference, with several sheriffs and state Attorney General Ashley Moody standing behind him, DeSantis did not clarify what exactly Florida officers would be doing in Texas and Arizona to assist with border enforcement — generally a federal matter. DeSantis is right about the southwest border now being the most common point of entry for methamphetamine in the United States. But it’s misleading to portray an increase in meth trafficking as a result of Biden’s immigration policies. Increased flows predate Biden’s presidency. DeSantis’ press office did not respond to our requests for more information. Most of the meth available in the United States is clandestinely produced in Mexico and smuggled across the southwest border, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Mexican criminal groups produce and supply meth that is low cost, highly pure and potent, a recent DEA report said. Traffickers transport and conceal meth using various techniques, including human couriers, parcel services, commercial and private vehicles. In cars, they commonly conceal it in fuel tanks and tires. Meth produced by criminal groups in Mexico has increasingly made its way into the U.S. ever since a 2006 U.S. law banned over-the-counter sales of cold medicines that had ingredients, such as pseudoephedrine, that were commonly used in the U.S. to make meth. That law, and a more potent and lower cost foreign meth, have contributed to decreased domestic production of meth. Increased flow of meth across the southern border is a problem ""of our own creation,"" said Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and director of its Drug Policy Project. There’s no precise number for the total amount of foreign meth that comes into the United States — it’s difficult for anyone to quantify how much of it goes undetected and evades seizure by border officials. So it’s hard to say whether that amount has increased over the last six months and at what pace. In the absence of comprehensive data, immigration officials, lawmakers, and analysts tend to rely on drug seizure data for a sense of how and where illicit drugs cross U.S. borders. Historically, officials seize more illicit drugs at ports of entry than between ports of entry. U.S. Customs and Border Protection publishes data on drug seizure by officers at ports of entry — such as land checkpoints — and by Border Patrol agents who work between ports of entry. The agency offers two sets of seizure data: events and pounds. So far, there’s only data for four full months of Biden’s time. It doesn’t clearly show an ""accelerating"" pace of meth seizure, and most of it has been seized at official checkpoints. In February, officers at ports of entry and Border Patrol agents recorded 342 meth seizure events. That number increased in March to 371, but declined in April and again in May. In weight, officials seized around 11,100 pounds of meth in February; that number increased in March, declined in April, and increased in May to nearly 19,800 pounds. But May’s figures are lower than the nearly 21,700 pounds seized in October, when Donald Trump was president.  The amount of meth seized by Border Patrol agents has increased annually since fiscal year 2013, said a 2020 Congressional Research Service report. Meth seizure at the southwest border is increasing, Tree said, but ""this is a very long-term trend."" DeSantis said meth is ""almost all coming across the southern border and it’s been accelerating for the last six months."" Most of the meth in the U.S. comes from the southwest border. But it’s unknown exactly how much meth comes through the southwest border undetected or at what pace. One metric, seizure data, does not show a steady uptick in the monthly number of pounds seized nor in the number of seizure events. Meth seizure at the southwest border has been increasing for years.

Yes, it’s been decades since the minimum wage kept up with inflation, and years since it increased
","Efforts to raise the minimum wage may have stalled at both the federal and state level, but the push for an increase has continued. President Joe Biden’s plan for a federal minimum wage hike passed the U.S. House earlier this year, but was squashed in the Senate. In Wisconsin, meanwhile, Republicans quickly stripped from the state budget Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ proposal to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $8.60 this year, then to $10.15 in 2024.  Detractors say increasing labor costs would cause companies to reduce their workforce or hire fewer people. Proponents of raising the minimum wage argue the move would lift millions of Americans out of poverty.  One such proponent is Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who recently responded on Twitter to comments from Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson’s about wages rising too much too quickly.  Barnes, who is considering a run against Johnson in 2022, said the senator was right about certain wages rising too quickly — those of the nation’s CEOs, which he said far outstripped wage increases of the average worker. (We rated that claim True.)  Barnes also pointed to the movement of the federal minimum wage over the years.  ""To anyone living in fear of the myth of wages growing too quickly, it’s been over 50 years since minimum (wage) and inflation parted ways, then over a decade since the federal minimum went up at all,"" Barnes tweeted May 23, 2021.  Is he right about that?  Let’s take a look.  We’ll get the simpler part of the claim out of the way first. When was the last time the federal minimum wage increased?  Chet Agni, communications director for the office of the lieutenant governor, cited the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which Congress passed that year to increase the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour over the course of two years.  The federal minimum wage is still $7.25 per hour, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, so Barnes is one the money for that portion of the claim.  Here, of course, he’s talking about raw dollars — or what is termed the nominal minimum wage. That’s a bit different than what Barnes is talking about when he asserts it’s been 50 years since the minimum wage and inflation parted ways. But what about that part of the claim?  Let’s start by clarifying what he meant by ""parted ways."" Agni said Barnes was referring to the point at which the minimum wage stopped increasing on par with inflation.  He cited a February 2021 Forbes piece title ""What you need to know about the minimum wage debate."" Throughout the 1940s to 1960s, minimum wage increases generally kept pace with inflation, according to the article, but wage growth started slowing after 1968 and fell behind the pace of inflation.  The article references a June 2019 economic snapshot from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, which says the federal minimum wage has lost 31% in purchasing power since 1968, when it reached its peak value.  In a 2016 report on indexation and the federal minimum wage from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, one can see the inflation and the minimum wage part ways visually. (Indexation adjusts the price or value of something for inflation.) In a graph using data from the U.S. Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics, two lines charting the nominal minimum wage, or the rate at which employees were compensated at the time, and the inflation-adjusted minimum wage initially rise together.  The nominal minimum wage was set at 25 cents per hour under the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act. Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator, it can be determined that it equaled $4.31 in 2016 dollars.  Up through 1968, the two lines rise together. As inflation gradually increases, the minimum wage increases too. However, after 1968, the inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage begins to decline, though the nominal minimum wage — the amount in raw dollars — is still rising.  The inflation-adjusted minimum wage took its sharpest plunge during the 1980s, according to the report, while the nominal minimum wage rose once in 1980 and again in 1981.  Barnes claimed that it’s been over 50 years since the federal minimum wage stopped increasing on par with inflation, and that it’s been over a decade since that minimum wage increased at all.  The inflation-adjusted and nominal minimum wage stopped rising together after 1968, which was 53 years ago. And the federal minimum wage was last raised in 2009.  We rate his claim True.

Grothman right on claim that 9.3 million jobs are open in U.S.
","Thanks to the crush of COVID, the U.S. last year went from low unemployment rates to record high numbers. But as more people have been vaccinated, and the economy continues to gain steam, things are shifting once again. Across the country, employers added 559,000 jobs in May alone, according to a June 4, 2021 report from USA Today. But many businesses can’t find enough workers to fill the positions. Many Republican lawmakers blame the additional $300 a week in federal unemployment benefits, saying it makes it lucrative for would-be workers to stay on the sidelines. Democrats argue the situation is more complex, involving child-care issues and other matters.   U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin, has called for an end to the additional benefits to help incentivize people to return to work. In a June 8, 2021 tweet, Grothman noted: ""We have a record 9.3 million job openings in the U.S.""  That is, well, a very big number. It’s more than the entire population of New Jersey. And of 39 other states, including Wisconsin. It’s more than 16 times the population of Wyoming, which at just about 579,000 residents is the nation’s smallest.  Is Grothman right? Does the country really have that many job openings waiting to be filled?  Grothman’s tweet was, in part, a retweet of one from Republican on the House Committee on Small Business. That tweet included a link to a June 8, 2021 CNBC report about the record number of open jobs, which mentioned that the number was pulled directly from a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics news release.  So, let’s go back to the source: According to the June 8, 2021 release, there were, indeed 9.3 million jobs open, as of the final week of April 2021. The Bureau calculates the number of job openings through random samples of more than  20,000 nonfarm businesses and government establishments across a database of more than 9 million businesses. The estimates are then adjusted for seasonal differences. Open jobs are considered positions with work available, a job that could start within 30 days or if the employer is actively recruiting workers, according to the bureau. There are plenty of reasons that number is so high, according to a June 8, 2021 CNN Business report. Some people still feel unsafe due to COVID. Many parents are juggling childcare and other at-home responsibilities that were exacerbated by the pandemic. Others are thinking about compensation levels and better-paying jobs or careers, while still others need training in order to be qualified for key positions. Even though U.S. employers hired more than 6 million people in April alone, millions of jobs were still unfilled. The CNN report noted that employers may have to get creative to fill open spots, maybe even by raising minimum salaries.  To be sure, the numbers are from April, and the picture may have changed somewhat in May and June. But Grothman is relying on the latest numbers, and can’t be faulted for using them. Grothman said in a tweet there were 9.3 million jobs open across the country.  As eye-popping as the number is, the most recent numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for April, show that is accurate.

Some police budgets are increasing, but evidence of national trend falls short
","Some cities are moving to restore or increase police spending after a year of budget cuts induced by the pandemic and public demands for ""defunding"" police departments in favor of social services.  But a viral claim shared on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook says, in apparent disappointment, that police departments never really cut their spending.  ""Police budgets are at their highest they've ever been, there hasn’t actually been any defunding the police,"" the tweet says, adding that recent crime spikes demonstrate that police spending is ineffective and could be invested into communities instead. A screenshot of the Twitter post garnered nearly 10,000 likes on Instagram. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) We looked into the claim that police budgets are at their highest point, but couldn’t find current national numbers to back it up. The more recent data, looking at the nation’s biggest cities, shows that their aggregate police spending did decline in the past year, and some cities did cut their police budgets substantially. But there was no overarching trend — fewer than half of the 50 largest cities cut their police budgets, and some that did are now planning to raise them again. The past year has been unusual for police budgets, which reflected the fiscal effects of the pandemic and recession, as well as the early response to summer protests against police violence and racial injustice. Federal relief funds have helped many states and municipalities supplement their budgets, allowing them to maintain public services while containing their own spending. The most comprehensive federal data available on police spending goes only up to 2017, prior to the ""defund the police""' movement that gained attention after George Floyd’s 2020 killing by a Minneapolis police officer. State and local governments spent $115 billion on police in 2017, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In inflation-adjusted dollars, that was higher than it had ever been, and up 26% from 2000. Police spending per capita rose 29% in that period, though the growth was concentrated between 2000 and 2009. However, it’s hard to analyze trends in police spending based on state and local budget numbers alone. Legal scholar Roger Michalski explained that policing is a decentralized public function, with budgets and responsibilities shared between different levels of government and overlapping jurisdictions. There’s also a range of federal programs that channel money to state and local governments. Recent reports on police spending have concentrated on major cities. Michalski says these analyses are not a representative sample of the nation as a whole, but they do provide a way to gauge trends.  According to research compiled by Bloomberg CityLab, the 50 largest U.S. cities reduced their 2021 police budgets by 5.2% in aggregate, while average law enforcement spending as a share of direct expenditures in those cities remained stable. Of the 50 cities, more than half increased or maintained their police budgets last year. The increases amounted to 8.6% in Tampa, 5.4% in San Diego, and 4.6% in Atlanta.  Some of the remaining cities made substantial cuts, more in line with the defunding movement that calls for shifting police spending toward social and community services. The Austin, Texas, City Council voted last summer to cut $21.5 million from the police budget and transfer another $128 million from the Police Department to other city departments. So contrary to the Twitter claim, there has been some defunding. Other cities scaled back planned cuts. While New York City officials said they agreed to cut $1 billion in police spending, Mayor de Blasio’s budget slashed less than half that. The Minneapolis City Council cut $7.8 million from the police department last year but later injected $6.4 million back into their budget to hire new officers.  Michalski said it’s still too early to detect trends in how police budgets are changing nationwide in the wake of last year’s protests.   ""Just because we see a one year dip in police budgets doesn’t mean there’s a radical transformation,"" he said.  ""Police departments may be holding on to bigger expenditures until the dust settles,"" he said, but eventually they will make those outlays.  There are already signs that the lower police budgets last year in some cities may have been temporary. Of the 12 big cities that have approved fiscal year 2022 budgets, nine are spending more for police.   In Louisville, Ky., where Breonna Taylor was killed, the mayor’s proposed budget for the fiscal year 2021-22 would increase the police budget by $8.5 million. In the previous year, funding was kept flat. In Phoenix, the approved budget for the fiscal year 2022 allocates an additional $3.7 million to the police department, largely to add civilian staff positions. The San Diego mayor’s budget proposal increases the police department budget to $592 million from $568 million. Houston approved a 2022 budget with an additional $30 million for police.  A viral tweet said, ""Police budgets are at their highest they've ever been, there hasn’t actually been any defunding the police."" There’s not enough current or comprehensive data to back the claim that police budgets are the highest ever. The latest nationwide figures supporting it go only up to 2017, and police budget responsibilities are shared among various jurisdictions and levels of government, making comparisons difficult.  The claim that ""there hasn’t actually been any defunding,"" is not supported. Some municipal governments did take money away from police department operating budgets in the past year, though it’s not yet clear how long those cuts will last, and some are reversing course.  The post contains an element of truth but lacks evidence to support its broadest claims. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/jun/18/tweets/some-police-budgets-are-increasing-evidence-nation/

The counting of mail ballots, and the way it eroded Trump’s early advantage, was the expected result of Pennsylvania’s election rules — not fraud. The counting process took longer than in other states because elections officials were prohibited from starting their work before Election Day. Most of the votes counted on Election Day were cast in person, and two-thirds of them were for Trump. Trump had spent months falsely attacking mail voting as susceptible to widespread fraud, which discouraged his supporters from using the method. Biden and Democrats encouraged their supporters to vote by mail, and in the end, Biden won more than three-quarters of Pennsylvania’s mail ballots. Trump’s lawyers asked a federal judge to invalidate Pennsylvania’s election results, vowing to present proof of widespread voter fraud — but they never did. And Trump’s challenge didn’t apply to enough votes to alter the result. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported June 4 that Republican leaders of the Pennsylvania General Assembly face growing pressure, including from Trump, to audit the election. But the GOP lawmaker who heads a committee that held 10 hearings on the state’s election system said the state House would not authorize such an audit.

State Rep. Born claim on unemployment claims since the pandemic is on the mark
","Fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic has touched just about every aspect of daily life, including education, travel and, of course, employment.  To deal with an unprecedented sudden loss of jobs, state and federal officials created a host of enhanced benefits for laid off workers. After a year of extensions of those benefits, many Republicans argue the extra money now is actually keeping unemployed people from working. In joining that debate, state Rep. Mark  Born, R-Beaver Dam, tweeted this on June 2, 2021 about how many in Wisconsin are getting unemployment benefits: ""Before the pandemic, just over 40,000 were on continuing UI claims. Now, there are well over 100,000 on state or federal UI benefits.""  The tweet came on the day Republicans who control the Legislature’s budget-writing Joint Finance Committee declined to put an additional $15 million toward running Wisconsin's unemployment benefits program, rejecting request from Gov. Tony Evers. ""There's a lot of federal money available for these types of (unemployment insurance) projects,"" Born told reporters. When it comes to how many people are claiming unemployment benefits, then and now, is Born right? Born’s tweet included a graphic pulled from figures from a state Department of Workforce Development document, ""Continuing Unemployment Claims by Program."" And that’s exactly where Born spokesman Tyler Clark pointed us when we asked for backup.  This is what the department’s ""Weekly Snapshot of UI Division Activity"" for the week of May 22, 2021, showed for the last full week before his claim was made: Regular Unemployment Insurance weekly claims: 70,112 Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation claims: 35,678 Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Weekly Claims: 21,537 Extended Benefits Weekly Claims: 418 Total: 127,745 So, his current numbers are on target. For pre-pandemic numbers, we looked back to March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus, a pandemic.  A DWD spreadsheet, ""Weekly Claims by County"" shows that in the week ending on March 7, 2020, there were 41,015 unemployment claims statewide.  ""The point of the tweet was to point out how many people are on state and federal UI benefits now as the economy is opening up and most government-mandated shutdowns and restrictions are being lifted, compared to before the pandemic,"" Clark said in an email. He said the figures are significant because ""it shows how many people are still on unemployment when we are in the middle of a workforce crisis,"" noting there were more than 100,000 jobs listed on the Job Center of Wisconsin website as of June 8, 2021.  On June 9, 2021, Republican lawmakers passed legislation that would eliminate the extra $300 per week unemployed people in Wisconsin have received under a federal program for those who lost work during the pandemic.  Proponents say the shift would encourage more people to go re-enter the workforce, but Evers said before the legislation passed that he was likely to veto it: ""I can’t imagine that I’ll be signing it.""  Born said """"Before the pandemic, just over 40,000 were on continuing UI claims. Now, there are well over 100,000 on state or federal UI benefits."" Those figures check out, and make clear things are far from back to normal, even if Democrats and Republicans disagree about why unemployment remains high and what to do about it.  We rate the claim True.  ",/factchecks/2021/jun/18/mark-born/state-rep-born-claim-unemployment-claims-pandemic-/

Liberal group says Rick Perry ended pre-K for 100,000 children
","
On a website devoted to criticizing Gov. Rick Perry, liberal advocacy group Progress Texas rotates about 50 Twitter-ready statements on Perry’s ""accomplishments"" during his nearly 30 years in state office. 
Among those drawing our attention: ""Rick Perry ended full-day Pre-K for 100,000 Texas children."" 
Really? 
To support its claim, Progress Texas pointed us to a May 28 report on the 2012-13 state budget bill, which the Republican-controlled Legislature wrote during this year's session and Perry later signed. The report was written by the Legislative Study Group, a caucus of the Texas House whose staff analyzes legislation for its one Republican and 48 Democratic members. 
The state's leaders, who began the 2011 session facing a projected state revenue shortfall of more than $20 billion, balanced the two-year budget without raising taxes and partly by cutting expenditures. The $172 billion budget spends 8 percent less in state and federal money than the current one. 
The legislative group's report notes in a section on the Texas Education Agency that the adopted budget lacks funding for the state’s Prekindergarten Early Start grant program, which began in 1999. In contrast, the current two-year budget included about $200 million for the grants, which school districts could use to improve their prekindergarten programs. 
Some background: The state provides funding through the Foundation School Program for districts to offer a half-day of prekindergarten for eligible children: those who do not speak English, are from low-income or military families, have ever been or are currently in foster care, or are homeless. (The 2012-13 budget maintains that aid.) 
In the past, if a district wanted to expand its half-day program to a full day, it could apply for an Early Start grant and use that money, among other funding sources, to do so. 
Gina Day, a TEA deputy associate commissioner, told us that most grant recipients used their awards to pay for the expansion to full-day prekindergarten. Last school year, 351 of the state’s more than 1,000 districts fielded the grants, which served 101,000 children, according to the TEA. 
We asked Day whether the elimination of the Early Start grants ""ended full-day pre-K for 100,000 Texas children,"" as Progress Texas says. Day said it would be more accurate to say the move ended state support for full-day pre-K. 
That’s because some districts, rather than scaling back prekindergarten offerings to a half day, decided to keep their full-day programs going. 
We touched base with the four districts that received the most Early Start grant money during the last school year. None plans to end full-day pre-K. 
In the Houston school district, which received $5 million in grant money in the 2010-11 school year, spokesman Jason Spencer told us that federal aid and cuts in other areas will help keep its full-day program going. Spencer said that the district had 16,847 students in its full-day pre-K program last year and that about 6,600 were served by the grant. 
In Dallas, Beth Steerman, director of early childhood education, told us that the district used its $5 million in Early Start money to provide full-day pre-K for about 3,100 children. Facing the loss of the grant funding, the district considered cutting its full-day classes back to a half day, Steerman said. However, its board decided to use local money not only to maintain the district’s full-day classes but also to expand all its half-day classes to full day. 
The Austin district received the second-highest amount of pre-K Early Start money last school year ($4.6 million). Jacquie Porter, director of early childhood education, told us that the grant funds paid for all of the district’s 5,200 pre-K students to have a full day of class. 
In the 2011-12 school year, she said, the district plans to use federal and local money to keep full-day classes. Also, the district for the first time will allow children who don’t qualify for free pre-K to pay tuition to attend, and that money will help finance full-day pre-K, Porter said. 
The Fort Worth district is financing its full-day program with a mix of local and federal funds, according to Patricia Rangel, director of early childhood education. Rangel said in 2010-11, the district’s $4.2 million in grant funds served about 4,400 pre-K students. 
On June 21, the Texas Tribune reported that the Pharr-San Juan-Alamo district in the Rio Grande Valley, which received about $3 million in grant money last school year, had decided to make cuts in other spending areas so it could continue to offer full-day prekindergarten. 
Superintendent Daniel King told us that the state grant money paid for about 1,000 of the district’s pre-K students to attend for the full day. 
The TEA's Day said the agency doesn't know how many school districts are planning to reduce their full-day pre-K programs to a half day as a result of the elimination of the state grant program. She said the agency doesn't collect that information. 
To get a snapshot sense of how districts are handling the end of the grants, we asked Kara Johnson, president of the Texas Early Childhood Education Coalition, whether she knew of districts cutting their programs from full- to half-day as a result. 
Of the 12 districts she sent in a list to us, we confirmed that six are scaling back at least in part because of the loss of grant funding. Four of the districts are in Central Texas — Temple, Smithville, Giddings and Del Valle. Two, Winona and Westwood, are in East Texas. 
Last school year, Temple had about 620 students in its full-day pre-K program while the other five had a total of about 450. 
We circled back to Progress Texas, explaining our findings. Its executive director, Matt Glazer, stressed that to craft the statements for the group’s anti-Perry site, complex ideas had to be boiled down into 140 characters or less so they could be sent out via Twitter. He said the pre-K statement was written to show that Perry’s decision to sign the budget legislation would have an effect on children who normally benefit from the state grant support and that budget cuts like the loss of the pre-K grants ""pass the buck"" to local districts. 
So, where does that leave us? 
All in all, we see flaws in Progress Texas' statement. 
First, the loss of Early Start funding doesn't mean districts that previously received grants are eliminating pre-K. The state is continuing its funding of half-day programs for eligible students. Second, the end of the grants — which helped about 100,000 kids attend a full day of pre-K last school year — doesn't mean all grant recipients are cutting back to half a day. Some are, and some are not. 
Finally, while Perry signed the legislation that ends the grant money, the budget was the handiwork of the Republican-led Legislature. He didn't stop the grants by himself.

Ex- APS Superintendent Hall says recent tests “given under the strictest security possible""
","
Even as her reputation crumbled, former Atlanta Public Schools Superintendent Beverly Hall’s PR machine continued to churn.

Hall’s smiling face appeared on the glossy cover of a promotional mailer commemorating her 12-year reign. The pages include detailed, year-by-year lists of her accomplishments and pictures of her smiling with students, teachers, and a giant check from district benefactor General Electric.

The PR bonanza outraged critics because it was so brazen. Hall left under accusations that the rising CRCT scores that helped make her an education superstar were the result of massive, systematic cheating on state tests. A state investigative report made public in July implicated 178 educators and 44 schools.

The pamphlet caught PolitiFact Georgia’s attention because Hall insisted that APS’ CRCT gains were real. If you compare results from 2000 through 2011, roughly the span of her term, they show significant increases, she wrote in a letter that accompanied the mailer.

And in 2011, the tests were ""given under the strictest security possible,"" Hall’s letter said.

Were they really that secure? we wondered.

We contacted Hall’s attorneys, who referred us to two APS documents describing changes the district made to security after test-tampering suspicions first arose.  

But before our analysis, here’s some background: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported more than two years ago that students statewide made statistically improbable gains on their CRCT exams. This prompted the Governor’s Office of Student Accountability to analyze answer sheets for erasures. They announced in February 2010 that they also found questionable gains.

APS changed its CRCT security procedures. They are stored in a ""vault,"" or a room inside a school. It’s accessible only by the principal and testing coordinator using a key card, said district spokesman Keith Bromery.

Teachers rotate within their schools so that they don’t administer the test to their own students. This makes them less likely to cheat because they don’t know which students need the help, Bromery said.

At the end of each testing day, answer sheets are reviewed by two employees for stray marks, sealed in a tamper-proof envelope, and stored in the vault. They remain there until the end of the testing period, which lasts seven school days.   

For its part, in 2010, the state posted at least one monitor at each school that met their definition of ""severe concern,"" said Kathleen Mathers, executive director of the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement. At schools of severe concern, 25 percent or more of a school’s classrooms showed highly unlikely percentages of wrong-to-right erasures, according to the state’s erasure analysis.

Schools of ""moderate concern,"" where 11 to 24 percent of classrooms were flagged, received random checks that year.

Monitors are state employees who are familiar with testing procedures. Since state officials found that test tampering and cheating risks are greatest before and after testing, monitors pay special attention to making sure the materials are properly stored. Afterward, they seal answer sheets in envelopes with tamper-proof security tape and return them to the vault.

State monitors do not administer the tests, and are not posted in each classroom, Mathers said.

In 2011, the state also posted monitors at schools of moderate concern.

We interviewed major testing companies and test security experts to assess the methods used in Atlanta Public Schools.  Our reporting found that APS does not use the following obvious or widely accepted measures to prevent tampering or cheating:

* Tests should be administered by people who are not employed by the school district and have no stake in the outcome, experts said.

* Teachers should be barred from entering the room where their own students are taking the CRCT. Educational Testing Service, makers of the SATs and AP exams, among others, will void the score of an AP English exam if students’ AP English teacher enters the testing room, said Ray Nicosia, director of ETS’ test security office. If a school has a testing coach, he or she is not allowed to administer the SATs.

* Ideally, tests should be administered by computer in a lab set up so students can’t see each other’s screens, said Richard Phelps, author of the ""Standardized Testing Primer"" and other books about testing. Computer testing has several advantages: It eliminates the problem of corrupt teachers gaining access to answer sheets and test booklets; they can track every move a student makes; and they can also order questions randomly, further reducing students’ ability to cheat by peeking at a neighbor’s screen, he said.

*Testing security is only as good as the people who enforce it, noted Walt Haney, a testing expert and Boston College professor. AJC reporting shows that many of the educators named in the investigative report released in July were still employed when the CRCT was administered in 2011.

In light of this information, how do we rule?

Certainly, the CRCT was not ""given under the strictest security possible"" in 2011, as Hall said. APS did tighten its procedures, but PolitiFact Georgia easily found additional ways to increase security.

Since APS did boost security starting in 2010, Hall’s statement is not outrageous. But it is incorrect. She therefore earns a False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/05/beverly-hall/ex-aps-superintendent-hall-says-recent-tests-given/

Ohio GOP chair says Democrat stronghold Cuyahoga County gave John McCain more votes than seven separate states
","The Ohio Republican Party hosted its annual state dinner and fund-raiser in Cleveland on July 22, 2011, that rallied its members around state and national issues and candidates.

The annual event, which is moved outside Columbus during off-year elections, featured Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel of Lyndhurst (near Cleveland), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, and Louisiana’s Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, a conservative who regularly speaks about GOP priorities.

The two politicians and others at the dinner easily revved up the crowd by blaming Democrats for the nation’s debt problems and by praising themselves for passing a collective bargaining law for public workers in Ohio that limits the power of unions.

Cuyahoga County Republicans deserved to have the event in their backyard because they provide the GOP a big chunk of votes in state elections, Ohio Republican Party chair Kevin DeWine said during the dinner.

To illustrate this point, he noted that in 2008 Republican Sen. John McCain garnered more votes for the presidency in the Democratic-dominated county than he did in seven states.

PolitiFact Ohio thought the statistic was worth examining given the GOP’s view  that Cuyahoga County, Ohio’s most populous, is a battleground within a battleground state that could have a big say in the fate of the new collective bargining law, which will be before voters in November.

""The Republican Party must compete aggressively in Cuyahoga County in order to carry the state,"" explains DeWine, who sees the recent public corruption scandal involving Democratic officials as helping the GOP cause.

So how many votes did McCain win in the county?

The last amended 2008 general election results on file with the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections shows that McCain received 199,880, or about 30 percent. Democrat Barack Obama received 458,422 votes.

Comparing this figure against the state vote totals, McCain indeed racked up more votes in Cuyahoga County than he did in seven states.

Obama carried these four states, shown here with McCain’s vote totals:

Candidate Fred Clark says State Sen. Luther Olsen supported sale of power plants to ""biggest donors"" with no oversight or bidding
","
Two Democrats working to knock off Wisconsin state senators in recall elections on Aug. 9, 2011, are reviving the short-lived controversy over Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to sell off state-owned power plants.

In a strongly worded TV ad, Nancy Nusbaum and Fred Clark pair up to accuse their respective opponents, GOP senators Robert Cowles and Luther Olsen, of an abuse of power -- or at least an attempted one.

""Power. We gave it to senators Robert Cowles and Luther Olsen, then they tried to sell it,"" intones a narrator in the ad. ""Supporting the sale of Wisconsin’s power plants, not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors. No bid contracts, no oversight, an invitation for corruption.""

Two contested races, a high-stakes election and a provocative claim -- in other words, right up our alley.

Because the case against each is slightly different, we are looking at them in separate items. You can find the Nusbaum vs. Cowles analysis here.

So, did Olsen support selling the plants to the biggest campaign donors with no oversight?

Walker’s budget-repair bill, proposed in February 2011, would have allowed a no-bid sale of up to 37 heating and cooling plants, primarily at University of Wisconsin campuses. Walker said the sale would avoid costly plant upgrades at taxpayer expense.

The clause immediately triggered accusations that Walker was setting up a deal to benefit Koch Industries, which the Journal Sentinel reported was the largest corporate contributor to Walker in the 2010 campaign. At the time, Koch Industries denied any interest in the plants.

The power-plant controversy all but died out amid the massive protests over Walker’s move to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees.

In fact, the power-plant sale provision was removed from the bill in the chaotic endgame that allowed Republican senators to approve the collective-bargaining changes without the Democrats who had fled to Illinois to block a quorum.

Let’s look at the three components of the claim:

 Supporting the no-bid sale approach.

The state Democratic Party, responding on behalf of the two Democrats, pointed us to a vote by Olsen.

As a member of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, Olsen voted to approve an amended version of Walker’s budget -- at a time when the bill still included the no-bid sale language.

Olsen told us the potential lack of transparency concerned him, but that the power plants were unique facilities.

In 2005, Republicans also pushed for sale of the plants, trying to insert it into the budget. When the matter came up at Joint Finance. Olsen opposed adding it into the budget. (It ultimately went in over his objections but was vetoed by then-Gov. Jim Doyle).

Supporting a sale of the plants to the ""biggest donors.""

This is an apparent reference to campaign donors.

It’s true that Koch or Wisconsin utilities who have given to Walker and Republicans could have emerged as buyers and purchased state plants. And they may have had an easier road without a formal bidding process.

But contrary to the dramatic accusation in the TV ad, the language in the bill didn’t select any winners, much less winners who are fat-cat campaign contributors. The bill would have authorized the no-bid sale, but who the ultimate bidders -- or buyers -- would be in that scenario can’t be known.

Supporting the sale without any oversight.

The original bill drew criticism in part because it went beyond the 2005 attempt by Republicans to sell the plants. That earlier effort would have required bids, and called for Public Service Commission review on whether the sale is in the public interest.

The 2011 plan submitted by Walker did not include those steps.

But amid the criticism, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee beefed up the oversight, requiring that any proposed sale forwarded by Walker’s administration first go through the committee.

Olsen voted for the additional oversight of the selection process.

Let’s review.

Democratic challenger Clark race accused Olsen of ""supporting the sale of Wisconsin’s power plants, not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors. No bid contracts, no oversight, an invitation for corruption.""

For Olsen, they cite only his committee vote.

Some viewers -- perhaps most -- may assume from the ad that Olsen actually voted to sell the plants to a big campaign donor. The ad is misleading on that score alone. It would have allowed a no-bid process for the sale, but did not designate any specific buyer.

The ad’s claim starts off OK by saying Olsen supported a no-bid approach. So there’s an element of truth in the claim.

But some critical facts are ignored and evidence missing on part of the claim. Olsen backed legislative oversight of any sale, and there is no evidence that his vote was ""supporting"" a sale to the flashiest campaign donor.

We rate Clark’s claim against Olsen as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/04/fred-clark/candidate-fred-clark-says-state-sen-luther-olsen-s/

Because the case against each is slightly different, we are looking at them in separate items. You can find the Clark vs. Olsen analysis here.

So, did Cowles support selling the plants to the biggest campaign donors with no oversight?

Walker’s budget-repair bill, proposed in February 2011, would have allowed a no-bid sale of up to 37 heating and cooling plants, primarily at University of Wisconsin campuses. Walker said the sale would avoid costly plant upgrades at taxpayer expense.

The clause immediately triggered accusations that Walker was setting up a deal to benefit Koch Industries, which the Journal Sentinel reported was the largest corporate contributor to Walker in the 2010 campaign. At the time, Koch Industries denied any interest in the plants.

The power-plant controversy all but died out amid the massive protests over Walker’s move to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees.

In fact, the power-plant sale provision was removed from the bill in the chaotic endgame that allowed Republican senators to approve the collective-bargaining changes without the Democrats who had fled to Illinois to block a quorum.

Let’s look at the three components of the claim:

Supporting the no-bid sale approach.

Cowles is not a member of the Joint Finance Committee and never had a chance to vote on the version of the repair bill that included the no-bid language. And records show that version never came to a vote in the full Senate in February because the Democrats were AWOL. The Assembly, which went first, passed the bill when it included the no-bid language.

Furthermore, in March, shortly after the Legislature passed the stripped-down repair bill lacking the power-plant action, Cowles took the lead in explaining he and other Republicans had asked that it be taken out.

In 2005, Republicans also pushed for sale of the plants, trying to insert it into the budget. When the matter came up at Joint Finance -- which at that time included Cowles -- he opposed adding it into the budget. (It ultimately went in over their objections but was vetoed by then-Gov. Jim Doyle).

It’s worth noting, however, that Cowles had the chance in February to amend Walker’s budget-repair bill -- or push for an alternative being shopped around by Sen. Dale Schultz, R-Richland Center.

Schultz was talking about requiring deeper concessions from public employees than Walker's budget-repair plan but preserving more of workers' collective bargaining rights. Schultz’s plans, however, could not have come to a vote unless the Senate Democrats returned.

Schultz told us the no-bid aspect of the power plant sale would have been removed in his alternative budget plan.

So where did Cowles come down on Schultz’s plan?

The state Democratic Party, responding on behalf of the two Democrats, pointed us to a Cowles comment about Schultz’s plan in a Feb. 26, 2011 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story.

""I'm prepared to vote for the bill as it is,"" said Cowles, referring to Walker’s bill -- which included the no-bid clause.

But the rest of the quote is: ""If something like this (plan by Schultz) happens, I could vote for this too because it gets you 80% to 90% of what you want.""

Supporting a sale of the plants to the ""biggest donors.""

This is an apparent reference to campaign donors.

It’s true that Koch or Wisconsin utilities who have given to Walker and Republicans could have emerged as buyers and purchased state plants. And they may have had an easier road without a formal bidding process.

But contrary to the dramatic accusation in the TV ad, the language in the bill didn’t select any winners, much less winners who are fat-cat campaign contributors. The bill would have authorized the no-bid sale, but who the ultimate bidders -- or buyers -- would be in that scenario can’t be known.

Supporting the sale without any oversight.

The original bill drew criticism in part because it went beyond the 2005 attempt by Republicans to sell the plants. That earlier effort would have required bids, and called for Public Service Commission review on whether the sale is in the public interest.

The 2011 plan submitted by Walker did not include those steps.

But amid the criticism, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee beefed up the oversight, requiring that any proposed sale forwarded by Walker’s administration first go through the committee. Cowles was not on the committee during the current term and, as we noted, did not have a chance to vote on the provision at all.

Let’s review.

Democratic challenger Nusbaum in the heat of a recall race accused Cowles of ""supporting the sale of Wisconsin’s power plants, not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors. No bid contracts, no oversight, an invitation for corruption.""

As evidence, they cite part of a quote by Cowles.

Some viewers -- perhaps most -- may assume from the ad that Cowles actually voted to sell the plants to a big campaign donor. The ad is misleading on that score alone. It would have allowed a no-bid process for the sale, but did not designate any specific buyer.

Beyond that, the ad has other problems.

Cowles never even had a chance to vote on the plan in 2011, apparently backed taking it out and has a history of opposition to slipping the plan into the budget. These are readily available facts on a very high-profile issue, making the ad’s claims -- and its implication of a scandal -- ridiculous.

Thus, we rate the claim from Nusbaum against Cowles as Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/aug/04/nancy-nusbaum/candidate-nancy-nusbaum-says-state-sen-robert-cowl/

Raul Labrador says tax hike led to spike in Michigan unemployment
","
During the July 31, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, faced off with former Michigan Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm over the causes of her state’s economic troubles.

We separately analyzed a comment by Granholm in which she took responsibility for cuts in state government and said that they had hurt Michigan’s economic growth. Labrador responded to Granholm’s comment by arguing that tax increases on her watch played a role in the state’s economic distress.

Addressing host David Gregory, Labrador -- a tea party-affiliated House freshman -- said, ""Let's talk about the truth about what happened in Michigan. Gov. Granholm actually supported the highest tax increases in the history of Michigan, and unemployment went from 6.8 percent to 15.3 percent."" After some stop-and-start verbal sparring with Granholm, Labrador proceeded to offer a contrast with Michigan, saying that Texas has thrived economically under a policy of tax decreases.

After talking to experts, we decided not to check Labrador’s specific claim that the tax increase under Granholm was the biggest in the state’s history. We made this decision for two reasons -- first, there are many conflicting ways to make such a comparison and second, the data to prove or disprove the claim is difficult to obtain.

Instead, we’ll look at two questions. Did the state’s unemployment rate go from 6.8 percent to 15.3 percent? And did the tax increases under Granholm -- whether or not they were historically large -- contribute to the increase in unemployment?

Did the state’s unemployment rate go from 6.8 percent to 15.3 percent?

This one turned out to be more complicated than we’d expected.

We first turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates both the national unemployment rate and the unemployment rate for each of the 50 states.

We found that the unemployment rate was indeed 6.8 percent around the time Granholm took office in February 2003. The rate stayed strikingly consistent during the next five years of Granholm’s tenure, staying within a narrow range between 6.7 percent and 7.4 percent through April 2008. Then it began to climb.

According to BLS, the unemployment rate peaked at 14.1 percent in August and September of 2009 before falling to 10.4 percent when Granholm left office in February 2011.

Though 14.1 percent is high, it’s not as high as the 15.3 percent Labrador said. But Labrador has good reason to think that the rate went that high.

In October 2009, the Michigan Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth issued a press release noting that the state’s unemployment rate had ticked upward to 15.3 percent in September.

So what happened? The rate was initially pegged at 15.3 percent, but as often happens, more complete data came to light and the number was revised. That’s how the rate was subsequently lowered to 14.1 percent.

So while Labrador overstated the peak unemployment rate under Granholm, we’ll give him some leeway because the higher number did receive media attention before the revision was made.

Did the tax increases under Granholm contribute to the increase in Michigan’s unemployment?

The short answer is that they probably did -- but they were hardly the driving force that Labrador implies.

He’s correct that Granholm enacted a tax increase package in 2007, as the state was facing a dire fiscal outlook. The package included a hike in the state income tax rate from 3.9 percent to 4.35 percent (although this was below the 4.4 percent rate it had been in 1999 under Republican Gov. John Engler). She also enacted a surcharge on the state’s business tax, which replaced an ill-fated, and quickly repealed, effort to expand the sales tax to a smorgasbord of services that had been included in the same bill as the income tax hike.

Experts we spoke to said that, on the margins, these taxes could have added to the state’s economic difficulties, possibly sending unemployment higher. However, their effect would have been small compared to the other economic factors in play at the time.

Michigan’s unemployment rate began climbing in April 2008, four months after the official start of the last recession, and it increased rapidly -- from 7.4 percent to 13.1 percent. That’s a 75 percent increase in the unemployment rate in the space of just one year.

""Was there anything else going on in the world other than the Michigan tax system that might have affected the employment picture?"" said Charles Ballard, an economist at Michigan State University and author of Michigan's Economic Future: A New Look. ""If Michigan’s tax system was the only thing that affected jobs, why was the rest of the country losing 7 million jobs at the same time? You can’t lay this at the feet of the Michigan tax system.""

Indeed, if you look at the trends in the unemployment rate for Michigan and for the nation as a whole, they follow a similar arc.

Craig Thiel, director of state affairs with the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan, acknowledged that it’s difficult to disentangle the various factors that pushed Michigan’s unemployment so high. Still, he said that ""the near-term impact that the recession had on Michigan employment certainly swamped any possible adverse economic effects resulting from the tax increases.""

It’s also worth noting that between April 2010 and April 2011 -- a period that covered most of Granholm’s final year in office -- the state’s unemployment rate fell by 2.9 percentage points, more or less in tune with national declines. Michigan’s decrease in unemployment was as rapid as any state in the nation, even though the previously adopted higher taxes were still in effect.

Gary Burtless, an economist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, added that even if Labrador were correct that tax policy hampered Michigan’s economic growth, it still wouldn’t necessarily provide any useful advice on the topic the Meet the Press panelists began with -- the federal fiscal picture.

""The lessons we can draw for federal policy based on the experience of states is questionable,"" Burtless said. ""In the long run, high state tax burdens may slow state growth rates, but that does not mean the result applies to the federal government. Middle- or high-income residents of high-tax jurisdictions may move to lower-tax jurisdictions to reduce their tax burdens -- Michiganders to Texas, New Yorkers to Georgia, Californians to Idaho. But there’s very little evidence for this effect in the country as a whole. How many Americans will move to Mexico or Canada to avoid higher federal taxes in the United States?""

Our ruling

Even though Labrador ignored the revised numbers, we consider his recap of the arc of Michigan unemployment to be fair. However, while higher taxes may have boosted unemployment on the margins, most of the available evidence suggests that Michigan’s rise in unemployment tracked the course of the national recession, simply to a greater degree, given the weakness of the state’s signature manufacturing sector. The experts we spoke to agreed that the impact of tax policy likely played a relatively minor role in the unemployment spike Labrador was referring to in 2008 and 2009. We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/04/raul-labrador/raul-labrador-says-tax-hike-led-spike-michigan-une/

Jennifer Granholm says massive government cuts in Michigan didn't spur growth
","
During the July 31, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Jennifer Granholm -- a Democrat who served as governor of Michigan from 2003 to 2011 -- was asked to bring her own experience to bear on the debate over the federal debt ceiling.

""Clearly the entitlement question has to be addressed,"" Granholm said, referring to the rising cost of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which is a major contributor to the growing federal debt.

However, Granholm told host David Gregory that she was skeptical about whether such cuts would be a boon for the economy at large.

""I can tell you, David, I cut more as a percentage out of government than any state in the country this past decade,"" Granholm said. ""And where is Michigan in terms of its economic growth? Cutting did not result in economic growth. What results in growth is making sure you've got a good business climate for businesses to grow and prosper. And so we've got to cut where we can in order to invest where we must in order to grow the economy. And it's that investment side that I worry that those who are affiliated with the tea party or who are on the far right don't realize that other countries are co-investing with businesses in order to create jobs in their countries.

""If we do nothing more than just cut,"" she continued, ""that will continue to accelerate the lack of growth in (gross domestic product). So we've got to realize that the strategy here must be very specific. Yes, you've got to reform entitlements, but you've got reform entitlements and invest in order to grow because the quickest way to take down your deficit is through growth.""

We wondered about three elements of Granholm’s comments: whether she ""cut more as a percentage out of government than any state in the country this past decade,"" how poor Michigan’s economic growth has been over the same period and whether spending cuts to state government hampered economic growth. (Separately, we’re looking at a comment from the same show by Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, in which he accused Granholm of supporting ""the highest tax increases in the history of Michigan,"" which helped push unemployment ""from 6.8 percent to 15.3 percent.)

We’ll take up the three claims in order.

Did Michigan cut more from its government than any state in the country?

To answer this question, we turned to The Fiscal Survey of States, a twice-annual publication of the National Association of State Budget Officers that offers fiscal data for the 50 states going back to 1979.

We determined that the most appropriate data to use were figures for annual expenditures from the 50 states’ general funds. We’ll acknowledge up front that this is not the only measure that could be used to compare how much state governments have been cut. In fact, Michigan’s state revenues flow into two accounts, the general fund and the school-aid fund, and the numbers we looked at only take into account the general fund. However, fiscal experts told us that the general fund offers a reasonable yardstick for state spending, and it also turned out to be the same measurement Granholm used, according to a spokeswoman. (Then there’s the eternal statistician’s lament: When comparing all 50 states across a period of nearly a decade, you take the statistics you can get.)

We calculated the change in general fund expenditures for all 50 states between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2010 -- the closest approximation we could get to the start and end dates of Granholm’s tenure.

And by this measure, Granholm is right. Every state but two saw their general-fund expenditures increase over that period (without taking inflation into account). The two that didn’t? Georgia, which saw its general fund expenditures fall by $54 million over that period, and Michigan, which saw its general fund expenditures fall by more than $1 billion. If they’d been adjusted for inflation, the decrease would be even more severe.

Using another measure, Carole Polan, a spokeswoman for Granholm, added that from 2000 to 2008, the number of state employees fell by about 11,000 -- a 17 percent decline. That was a more rapid decline than in private employment, which fell in the state by 12 percent over the same period, Polan said.

We’ll address the causes of these declines in a moment, but for now, we can say that by this measure, Granholm is right that spending on government declined faster in Michigan than in any other state between 2003 and 2010.

How poor was Michigan’s economic growth during Granholm’s tenure?

To answer this question, we looked at gross domestic product data for Michigan as published by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. (Just as the bureau calculates the national gross domestic product, it does the same for individual states.) Once again, we compared Michigan’s GDP for 2003 and 2010.

By this measure too, Michigan performed worst in the nation. Its gross domestic product rose by 6 percent over that period (again, not adjusted for inflation). That may sound okay, but it’s not. It’s only about one-third the rate of the next worst-performing state -- Ohio, at 17 percent growth. And it’s less than one-fifth of the increase of the nation as a whole, which was 31 percent.

So where economic growth is concerned, Granholm is right again: Michigan’s performance during her tenure was uniquely poor among the 50 states.

Did spending cuts to state government hamper Michigan’s economic growth?

The cuts to government almost certainly hampered Michigan’s economy. But experts say that they weren’t the primary cause of the state’s poor economic performance.

Long-term troubles in the automotive industry, the national recession and raising taxes on businesses and individuals ""were all partially to blame,"" said Patrick L. Anderson, an economic analyst in East Lansing, Mich., who wrote a report released by Granholm's successor elected in 2010, Republican Rick Snyder.

Charles Ballard, an economist at Michigan State University and author of Michigan's Economic Future: A New Look, added that even before the national economic crisis of 2008, ""the auto industry limped along for much of the decade, with General Motors, Ford and Chrysler losing market share steadily. In Michigan, we don’t have Honda plants -- we have GM, Ford and Chrysler plants. Two of those companies went into bankruptcy. For better or for worse, we are home to the portions of the industry that did the worst.""

Meanwhile, Ballard added that Michigan’s tax structure -- which doesn’t tax most services or Internet sales and mail-order -- exacerbated the fiscal impact of these economic problems.

If the sectors that aren’t taxed are growing faster than those that are, ""the sales tax applies to an ever-shrinking portion of the economy,"" Ballard said. ""So if you put the tax law on autopilot, the portion of your economy going to tax revenues shrinks every year.""

In fact, ""Michigan’s revenues peaked in 2000 and are not projected to return to peak until 2020,"" said Arturo Perez, a state budget analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""No other state has had a similar revenue situation.""

Given this backdrop, a more appropriate way of thinking about it is that a poor economy in Michigan caused a drop in state tax revenue, which in turn forced Granholm to cut government services -- not the other way around. Declining tax revenue is a much more urgent factor for state governments than for the federal government, since most states are constrained from using deficit spending. (Michigan is one, though ""unavoidable deficits"" may be resolved in the next fiscal year.) This means that tax revenues play a more direct role in determining spending levels than they do at the federal level.

""The plain fact is that state economic growth rates are in the short run linked to the demand for products that are produced in the state -- products like autos in Michigan, oil in Texas, sunny vacations in Florida and gambling holidays in Nevada,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. ""Demand for these products can have booms and busts that are completely unrelated to a state’s typical tax rate or spending level. In the short run, when demand for a state’s products plummets, its state tax revenues fall, forcing the state to trim state spending or increase state tax rates."" 
Our ruling 
There’s strong evidence supporting two of Granholm’s statistical claims -- that government spending has fallen faster in Michigan than in any other state, and that the state’s economic performance has been especially poor compared to other states.

However, in the Meet the Press interview, Granholm was trying to use her experience as a governor to make a larger point about how cutting government ""did not result in economic growth."" She's probably correct that government cuts hampered her state's recovery, at least in the short term, but Michigan’s experience over the last decade suggests that the reverse is an even bigger factor -- that is, poor economic growth hurts tax revenues and, in turn, forces government cuts. 
This doesn’t mean that Granholm’s point is inaccurate, but in trying to apply a state lesson to a federal problem, she’s ignored a key factor in how state fiscal policy works. On balance, we rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/04/jennifer-granholm/jennifer-granholm-says-massive-government-cuts-mic/

State Sen. Peggy Lehner, an abortion foe, says 600 a year occur after 20 weeks of pregnancy
","
Abortion rights have been among the top priorities so far this year for the GOP-controlled Ohio legislature -- the governor recently signed a late-term abortion ban and several other abortion-related bills are under consideration.

Republican lawmakers’ focus on the issue has drawn criticism from Democrats and others who say the bills do nothing to create jobs, the very platform Republicans across the state campaigned on last year.

A pair of Republican lawmakers appeared on a Cleveland radio program recently to discuss the abortion bills and why they are important.

Ohio Sen. Peggy Lehner, a Republican from the Dayton area, sponsored the late-term abortion ban requiring doctors to test whether a fetus can live outside the womb when a pregnancy is at least 20 weeks’ along. An abortion is prohibited if tests determine the fetus is viable.

""There’s actually 600 abortions done after the 20th week of pregnancy every year in Ohio,"" Lehner said July 18 on ""The Sound of Ideas,"" a program that airs on 90.3 WCPN.

With numerous abortion-related bills pending in the legislature, including the controversial ""heartbeat bill,"" which bans abortion as soon as six weeks into a pregnancy, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Lehner’s claim. When we contacted Lehner, she directed us to statistics from the Ohio Department of Health.

Lehner also pointed out that the late-term abortion ban, if it had been in effect in past years, would’ve prevented about 200 abortions – the number of abortions in Ohio when the woman was at least 23 weeks’ pregnant, the length of a pregnancy when viability typically sets in.

The Ohio Department of Health produces a report each year on abortions in Ohio. The report is based on forms doctors are required to file with the state when an abortion is performed. The forms are confidential; they contain no identifying information about the women who receive the abortions.

The report backs up Lehner’s claim. When a pregnancy was at least 20 weeks along, there were 613 abortions in Ohio in 2009, the most recent year data is available.

In 2008, there were 603 abortions; there were 690 in 2007, and 694 in 2006. From 1997 to 2005, the number was between 731 and 961.

We also checked Lehner’s follow-up point and it also was accurate. In 2009, there were 216 abortions when the pregnancy was at least 23 weeks along.

Lehner slightly understated the number of abortions that occurred in the timeframe she referenced during the radio program. Still, her understatement does not undercut the argument she is trying to make.

We rate the statement True.

Gov. Chris Christie claims Democrats cut $35 million from the state budget for Information Technology improvements
","
At a Monday news conference in Bergen County, Gov. Chris Christie criticized Democratic legislators for cutting $35 million from the state budget for Information Technology upgrades, and suggested they restore the funding.

""What would have been helpful is if they wouldn’t have taken the $35 million out of the budget that I submitted to improve our Information Technology and computer systems,"" Christie said in response to a question about Democrats’ plans to hold hearings on the recent computer problems at motor vehicle offices.

When a reporter told Christie that Democrats have claimed the amount was $5 million or $5.5 million, the governor responded: ""No. Thirty-five million that was put in to improve our infrastructure at all levels, not just MVC, but across the state. Which they took out. Now that things are going bad, they’re trying to change the numbers and change the story. The fact is, this is what happens when you rush and do a budget in the last week.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie was wrong about the budget cut -- nearly seven times wrong. Instead of $35 million, the Democratic-controlled Legislature cut $5.5 million for Information Technology upgrades from the budget for fiscal year 2012.

In fact, the governor’s office had listed those $5.5 million in budget reductions in a July 13 press release. That press release was distributed via an email from the governor’s office.

Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts on Tuesday acknowledged the governor’s mistake in an email:

""The Governor was speaking to the total amount appropriated for IT, while Democrats actually zeroed out $5.5 million in spending for IT improvements and modernization,"" Roberts wrote.

""The point remains the same - the Governor is calling on the Legislature to send him a supplemental to restore the funding they eliminated so that the Administration can make the investments and upgrades needed to keep the state’s computers up to par with the needs of New Jerseyans,"" Roberts said in the email.

The Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee is scheduled to discuss the recent computer failures at a meeting today in Lodi.

Now, let’s explain those funding cuts.

The state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services last month released a budget analysis showing the differences between Christie’s budget proposal, the budget approved by the Legislature and the final budget signed by Christie after making various line-item vetoes.

According to that analysis, the Legislature cut funding from Christie’s proposal for three IT projects in the Office of Information Technology, which handles IT systems throughout state government. Those cuts remained in the final budget signed by Christie.

Tom Hester Jr., spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, said the Assembly is willing to discuss restoring the IT funding. Derek Roseman, spokesman for the Senate Democrats, said any discussion on such a restoration must be part of broader negotiations to reverse cuts made by the governor.

But Roberts’ statement left us asking more questions.

Roberts said the $35 million was in reference to ""the total amount appropriated for IT."" But according to the fiscal 2012 budget, the total state appropriation for the Office of Information Technology is about $51.2 million.

Andrew Pratt, a spokesman for the state Department of the Treasury, clarified that the governor was referring to roughly $38 million of that money, which goes toward computer-related services. That funding is not broken up by state agency, Pratt said.

The real issue is the state needs to upgrade its computer systems, Pratt argued.

""We really have to do something here,"" Pratt said.

Let’s review:

In the wake of computer problems at Motor Vehicle Commission offices and other state agencies, Christie claimed the Democrats had cut $35 million for Information Technology improvements. But a Christie spokesman acknowledged the actual cut was $5.5 million.

We rate the statement False.

GOP Senate candidate Hinckley says there is no money in Social Security
","
How much money does the United States have on hand to pay for Social Security benefits?

That was one of the issues that Barry Hinckley, a Republican seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, touched upon during a Channel 6 interview that aired July 24.

Noting that people are living longer and there's concern about how the benefits will be financed down the road, host Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci, asked Hinckley what his solution would be. The candidate said he would raise the retirement age.

He also focused on separate statements by Whitehouse during the debate over the debt ceiling. He said that Whitehouse had reported that the crisis might prevent benefit checks from going out and that the Social Security trust fund has a multi-trillion dollar surplus.

""So if there's a surplus, why are checks going to stop going out? Well, actually, there isn't"" a surplus, said Hinckley. He asserted that the Johnson administration started spending Social Security money to pay for the Vietnam War and ""they never looked back. They kept spending that money so that, unfortunately, there's no money in Social Security.""

On his website, Hinckley doesn't say there's no money in Social Security. He's says there's no ""actual money … just IOU's from the general fund.""

PolitiFact has dealt with the no-money-in-Social-Security issue before. More than a year ago, Michele Bachmann, now a Republican candidate for president, was given a False on the Truth-O-Meter for insisting that ""Social Security, like I told you, is out of money.""

Why False?

In recent history, Social Security has been financed exclusively by payroll taxes. The amount raised in taxes was more than enough to cover the benefits it needed to pay out.

The excess went into a trust fund, which has now accumulated roughly $2.5 trillion.

Those who say the fund has no money, or that it has nothing more than a bunch of IOUs from the federal government, are referring to the fact that Social Security doesn't have $2.5 trillion in cash sitting in a vault somewhere. The federal government has loaned the money to itself, using the cash to pay for other expenses.

But these aren't IOUs, which generate no interest. The loan is in the form of special-issue Treasury bonds that earned $117.5 billion in interest in 2010, according to the latest trust fund report.

So saying that Social Security has no money is akin to saying that you're broke if you have $20 million in certificates of deposit but only 20 cents in cash.

But things are changing.

Thanks to the recession, Social Security paid out more in benefits in the last two years than it raised from the Social Security tax. That hasn't happened since 1983. Last year's shortfall was $49 billion; this year it's expected to be $46 billion.

To pay benefits last year and this year, Social Security is supplementing money from the payroll tax with interest from the bonds, according to Mark Hinkle, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration.

Unfortunately, with the U.S. population getting older, more people will be getting benefits, and fewer young people will be paying taxes to finance the program.

According to the 2011 Annual Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund Reports, interest from the treasury bonds -- combined with the ongoing revenue from the Social Security payroll tax -- will be insufficient to cover the cost of retiree checks in 2022.

Unless something is changed, the trust fund will be drained because it is under-funded.

Fourteen years later, in 2036, the trust fund itself will be depleted, according to the report. If nothing is done, the only money flowing into Social Security will be the amount raised year-to-year in taxes. That will only cover about 75 percent of what it should through 2085.

One issue driving the debate over Social Security is the realization that the federal government -- the folks promising to pay those Treasury bonds, with interest -- isn't exactly awash with cash, as the debate over the debt ceiling highlighted.

The national debt is approaching $15 trillion, a total that includes the $2.5 trillion owed to the Social Security trust fund.

So maybe a better analogy would be: Saying that Social Security has no money is akin to saying that you're broke if you have 20 cents in your pocket but $20 million in the stock of a heavily leveraged company.

You're far from broke. But you're probably lying awake at night wondering if you're ever going to see all $20 million of your investment.

When we asked Hinckley about his statement that ""Social Security has no money,"" he said he is correct because Social Security doesn't have cash on hand. The bonds it holds, he said, are assets.

""Social Security has assets. It doesn't have money,"" he said. ""Money is something you can immediately pay bills with. Assets are only redeemable if the government can borrow more money to pay them off. I've never said they don't have assets. The problem is, I question the integrity of the assets when you have to borrow money to redeem them.""

To summarize: Hinckley said, ""There's no money in Social Security.""

In fact, Social Security has a $2.5-trillion trust fund with more money coming in each year. The money is ""invested"" in a federal government that paid out $117.5 billion in interest in 2010 but shows a risky willingness to rack up debt, raising concerns that it may someday be unable to pay that money back, with interest.

But Hinckley, in his Channel 6 comments, said Social Security has no money now.

At the time he said it, the checks were still going out.

And they still are.

Harry Reid says 8 million jobs lost during George W. Bush's years in office
","
During a Senate floor speech on Aug. 2, 2011 -- shortly before a vote on the final debt-ceiling bill -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., compared the job-creation records of President Bill Clinton and President George W. Bush.

""My friend (Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.) talks about no new taxes,"" Reid said. ""Mr. President, if their theory was right, with these huge (tax cuts) that took place during the Bush eight years, the economy should be thriving. These tax cuts have not helped the economy. The loss of eight million jobs during the Bush eight years, two wars started, unfunded, all on borrowed money, these tax cuts all on borrowed money -- if the tax cuts were so good, the economy should be thriving. If we go back to the prior eight years during President Clinton’s administration, 23 million new jobs were created.""

A reader asked us whether Reid was correct that there was a ""loss of eight million jobs during the Bush eight years."" So we looked into it.

As always, we looked at jobs numbers compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment data.

During Bush’s eight years in office -- January 2001 to January 2009 -- the nation actually gained a net 1.09 million jobs. (Because there were gains in government jobs, the private sector actually lost 653,000 jobs during that period.)

This isn’t remotely close to what Reid claimed. Reid's office didn't respond to our request for information, but we think we know what he was referring to.

From the economy’s peak to its low point, the nation lost 8.75 million jobs. Here’s the problem: The peak for jobs came in January 2008, while the low point for jobs came in February 2010.
This means the starting point for Reid’s measure came seven years into Bush’s eight-year tenure, and the low point occurred about a year into Barack Obama’s tenure.

In other words, Reid had a point in saying that there was a ""loss of eight million jobs"" -- but it didn’t come ""during the Bush eight years."" The loss of eight million jobs occurred during a roughly two-year period shared more or less equally between Bush and Obama.

Reid may blame Bush’s policies for every single one of those jobs lost -- an opinion he’s entitled to, but one we are unable to fact-check. Still, his statement is incorrect as spoken.

Reid went on to say, ""If we go back to the prior eight years during President Clinton’s administration, 23 million new jobs were created."" We looked at the BLS numbers and found that Reid was basically correct in that claim. From January 1993 to January 2001, the nation gained 22.7 million total jobs.

This means that Reid specifically counted Clinton’s job-creation numbers from his inauguration day to the date he exited from office, but he did not do so for Bush, even though he used the Clinton figure as a direct comparison. It strikes us as a clear-cut case of cherry-picking.

So where does this leave us? Reid is correct that more than 8 million jobs were lost in the United States during the recent economic downturn, but he’s flat wrong to say that it happened ""during the Bush eight years."" Compounding the error, Reid makes a direct comparison between Bush and Clinton, yet he uses one method that makes Clinton’s number seem strong and Bush’s number seem weak. We rate Reid’s statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/aug/03/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-8-million-jobs-lost-during-george-/

Paul Krugman said the average Republican favors including taxes as part of overall debt deal
","As the debate over the nation's budget intensified over the weekend, liberal commentator Paul Krugman lamented that increases in tax revenue were being left out of the overall deal.

""On the politics of this, if you look at the polling, it turns out that the average Republican voter thinks there should be some revenue as part of this deal, right? So the president has agreed to -- not just to an agreement that's way to the right of the average American voter. It's actually to the right of what the average Republican voter wants.""

Krugman is saying that even Republican voters support some limited form of tax increases. We looked at a similar statement a few weeks ago from President Barack Obama. Obama said back on July 15, 2011, that ""the clear majority of Republican voters think that any deficit reduction package should have a balanced approach and should include some revenues."" We rated it Barely True (since re-named Mostly False). 

At the time Obama made his statement, we found one recent poll that supported his claim but two other polls that showed a much more evenly divided picture. We wondered if polling data showed growing support from Republicans for increasing tax revenues, in the form of tax increases or closing loopholes and removing exemptions. 

Interestingly, the polls we've looked at have shown markedly different results, sometimes showing Republican support for limited tax increases but sometimes showing opposition or an even divide. As pollsters have long noted, sometimes the way the question is phrased can affect the results.

We should note that we didn't consider polls that only asked people if they favored spending cuts or tax increases, since the relevant question is whether people support both spending cuts and tax increases.
Here are the three polls we looked at when we fact-checked the issue a few weeks ago. 

• A Gallup poll poll conducted July 7-10, 2011, asked: ""As you may know, Congress can reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting spending, raising taxes, or a combination of the two. Ideally, how would you prefer to see Congress attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit: only with spending cuts, mostly with spending cuts, equally with spending cuts and tax increases, mostly with tax increases, or only with tax increases?""  The answer ""only spending cuts"" got 26 percent from self-identified Republicans. The other answers from Republicans were ""mostly spending cuts,"" 41 percent; ""equal spending cuts and tax increases,"" 24 percent. Another 3 percent favored ""mostly"" or ""only"" tax increases. So about 68 percent of Republicans were open to some tax increases.

• A Quinnipiac University poll conducted July 5-11, 2011, asked, ""Do you think any agreement to raise the national debt ceiling should include only spending cuts, or should it also include an increase in taxes for the wealthy and corporations?""

In this case, 48 percent of Republicans favored spending cuts only, while 43 percent favored including tax increases. Another 9 percent were unsure.

• A Reuters/Ipsos poll from June asked, ""As you probably know, the US budget deficit is currently about $1.4 trillion. There are a number of different solutions being discussed for reducing this deficit. These are cutting existing programs, raising taxes, or some combination of the two. Which approach do you think is best?""

In that poll, 43 percent of Republicans said cut existing programs, while 44 percent favored including tax increases. That result was within the margin of error.

In addition to those three polls, we found three more recent polls. 

• A CNN/ORC poll conducted July 18 to 20 asked about the recent discussions on the debt ceiling. It asked, ""If you had to choose, would you rather see Congress and President Obama agree to a budget plan that only includes cuts in government spending, or a budget plan that includes a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on higher-income Americans and some businesses?""

That poll found that, among Republicans, 61 percent favored spending cuts only, while 37 percent said spending cuts and tax increases. So this would not support Krugman's statement.

• A Pew Research Poll conducted July 20 to 24 asked, ""In your view, what is the best way to reduce the federal budget deficit? Should we mostly focus on cutting major programs, increasing taxes, or should we do a combination of both?""

Among Republicans, 46 percent favored a combination of both, while 39 percent favored cutting programs.

These results would support Krugman's statement.

• Reuters/Ipsos polled again on the debt ceilling on July 25, 2011. It asked its same question from June, whether people favored cutting programs, raising taxes or some combination of the two.

This time, it found that 41 percent of Republicans favored only cutting programs, while 52 percent favored some form of tax increase. 

This too would support Krugman's statement.

To summarize these three newer polls, we still find mixed evidence. One poll showed Republicans favor spending cuts only; the other two showed Republicans favor including tax revenue increases. 

We e-mailed Krugman about our fact-check, and he referred us to an analysis from the New York Times blog Five Thirty Eight, which specializes in political statistical analysis. Five Thirty Eight analyzed the Gallup poll from early July in some depth, extrapolating what level of tax increases Republicans might support. But it didn't consider the other polls that we've described here. 

In conclusion, when we rated a similar statement from Obama a few weeks ago, the evidence seemed more mixed on whether Republicans favor some form of tax increases as part of a budget deal, the way that Democrats and independents do. Now, the polling seems to be moving a bit in Krugman's direction. Nevertheless, the polling results are still conflicted. While we can point to several polls that support Krugman's statement, we can also point to some that refute it. Of the six polls we looked at, three polls showed Republicans favored a package that included some tax revenues, two polls showed opposition, and one poll was a statistical tie. We're not convinced polls show that the average Republican favors some form of tax increases to reduce the deficit. Overall, we rate Krugman's statement Half True. ",/factchecks/2011/aug/03/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-said-average-republican-favors-includ/

Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner says the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District is one of the worst polluters in the country
","
As a handler of human waste -- which it periodically dumps into Lake Michigan untreated -- the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District is less popular among some people than mosquitoes.

But is the taxpayer-funded agency one of the nation’s largest polluters?

On July 24, 2011, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., held a town hall meeting in Whitefish Bay, a Milwaukee suburb. A woman told the 33-year congressman she was ""appalled at the continued gutting of good government regulation and awarding corporations who pollute and not holding them accountable,"" according to Patch.com, a website that covers community news.

Sensenbrenner said corporations are not the only ones to blame, adding:

""I get sick and tired of people saying that people are dumping sewage in our water when one of the biggest polluters in our country is the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District.""

Sensenbrenner later called MMSD a ""disgrace,"" prompting applause as well as objections from the audience, based on a video clip posted on YouTube.

But was the criticism on target?

We’ll first point out that the sewerage district doesn’t generate the pollution in question; its job is to treat it. But sometimes the district is treated like other polluters. Federal and state regulators have taken action against MMSD and other sewerage districts when they dump more untreated sewage and storm water than their government permits allow.   

With $3.5 billion in capital assets to treat sewage and help control flooding, MMSD serves 1.1 million customers in 28 communities in southeastern Wisconsin. In 2011, the agency has budgeted $242 million in property tax money for capital projects and $82 million in sewer service fees for operations.

Most people probably give the sewerage district little thought -- until heavy rainstorms bring news that MMSD has allowed millions of gallons of untreated sewage and storm water to flow into Lake Michigan and rivers.

Large rainfaills lead to the so-called combined overflows because the agency closes the gates to its $1.3 billion deep tunnel when the accumulated water nears the tunnel’s 521-million-gallon capacity. The most recent episode occurred over two days in June 2011, when the sewer district said an estimated 170.5 million gallons of untreated waste water overflowed following storms.

Overflows pose potential health risks. A 2010 study published by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Great Lakes WATER Institute and the Children’s Research Institute found an estimated 11 percent increase in the number of emergency room visits by children for acute gastrointestinal illness four days after rainfalls. That study cited untreated sewage releases as only one potential link to the illnesses. However, a 2007 Medical College of Wisconsin study concluded that such untreated waste water releases were ""potentially harmful"" because, in two of six releases examined, the number of children who went to emergency room for diarrhea ""increased significantly.""

Sensenbrenner has been critical of MMSD in the past.

In 2003, he lambasted the EPA for giving MMSD a ""clean water partner"" award not long after the sewerage district had been reprimanded for dumping. In 2005, when Sensenbrenner requested $68 million in federal flood control funds for MMSD, he emphasized that the agency had dumped ""billions of gallons of waste into Lake Michigan"" over the previous 10 years.

We asked Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman, Amanda Infield, for evidence to back her boss’ claim about MMSD as a polluter and she he made three points. We asked Bill Graffin, MMSD’s spokesman, to respond and did our own research.

MMSD’s dumping

Infield said that from 1994 through late July 2011, MMSD dumped 24.2 billion gallons of untreated sewage and storm water into Lake Michigan.

Graffin said that accurately quotes MMSD’s own statistics, which show that annual combined overflows have been as high as 4.38 billion gallons since 1994. That is down from overflows ranging from 7 billion to 9 billion gallons per year from 1990 through 1993.

Graffin said three other Midwestern cities, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Chicago, all have larger annual overflows than Milwaukee, such that they are being forced to make major treatment upgrades because of enforcement action by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Documents show that MMSD’s counterpart in Cleveland, which releases nearly 5 billion gallons of untreated sewage per year, agreed in December 2010 to spend $3 billion; and the City of Indianapolis agreed in 2006, when overflows were nearly 8 billion gallons per year, to spend $1.73 billion. That figure was reduced in December 2010 to save Indianapolis $444 million.

In Chicago, MMSD’s counterpart is under fire for its sewage dumping into the Chicago River. According to a New York Times article, in May 2011 the EPA ordered state regulators to impose stricter water quality standards on the river; environmental groups filed a lawsuit charging that Chicago’s waste water agency regularly violates the federal Clean Water Act; and an environmental group named the Chicago River one of the ""most endangered rivers"" in the country.

Conversely, MMSD was last part of a legal stipulation in 2001. The agency finished making upgrades to its facilities required under the stipulation in 2010, Graffin said.

Graffin also cited a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article on a 2006 study by the Sierra Legal Defense Fund, a Canadian conservation group. The article said Milwaukee was far from the worst polluter in the Great Lakes. The study gave Milwaukee a C-plus rating, ranking it in the top half of the 20 Great Lakes cities evaluated for sewage management. Milwaukee was at the top of all the large cities surveyed, according to the article.

So, while MMSD sometimes does dump untreated waste water into Lake Michigan, Sensenbrenner provided no evidence comparing MMSD to other polluters. It’s also clear that in the Great Lakes area alone, Milwaukee is far from being the worst polluter.

BP comparison

Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman said the amount of waste water MMSD dumped into Lake Michigan in one week was 10 times the amount of oil spilled by BP in the disastrous Gulf of Mexico spill in April 2009. She cited a news report from WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) in Milwaukee that said 2.1 billion gallons of untreated sewage and storm water were dumped into Lake Michigan following storms that caused flooding in July 2010. That amounted to about 75 percent of the overflows for the year.

The 2.1 billion gallons is more than 10 times the 170 million gallons of oil spilled by BP in the Gulf of Mexico. But measurements don’t tell the whole story. One important difference: What MMSD dumps includes contaminants, but it is mostly water; BP spilled oil.

A presidential commission that investigated the BP incident said in a January 2011 report that the spill was the largest accidental marine oil spill in U.S. history. The spill was so massive, the report says, that it will take decades just to assess the environmental damage, leaving aside the tens of billions of dollars in economic damage caused.

So, aside from noting the difference in volume, Sensenbrenner provided no evidence to establish that one MMSD overflow was somehow worse than what is regarded as one of the nation’s worst environmental accidents.

Spoiled beaches

Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman said southeastern Wisconsin has some of the most polluted beaches in the nation. She cited a 2011 report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental action group. The report labeled 13 beaches in seven states as ""repeat offenders"" for having high bacteria levels from 2006 through 2010. Two of the beaches were in southeastern Wisconsin, including one -- South Shore in Milwaukee -- that is in MMSD’s service area.

The report does not mention the sewerage district but seems to implicate the agency, saying ""chronically high bacteria counts indicate that the beach water is probably contaminated with human or animal waste.""

The Great Lakes WATER Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says, however, that sewage overflows are not the primary cause of beach advisories and closings.

The main causes at many Milwaukee-area beaches are waste from gulls and storm water runoff, according to the institute. In addition, the EPA said in a 2007 report to Congress that sewer overflows were the source of pollution in only 3 percent of the beach advisories and closings in Milwaukee County from 2000 to 2004.

So, like the other points, that one does not stand up to scrutiny.
 
We wondered whether there were rankings of the nation’s worst water polluters, but Josh Mogerman, spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he was not aware of any. We did find a June 2011 report about MMSD by the Public Policy Forum, a government watchdog and research organization in Milwaukee.

The report focused on the sewerage district’s financial condition. But it also found that, according to national data, MMSD’s ""sewage and treatment capacity offers greater protection from sewage overflows than most other districts.""

So where does all of this leave us?

Upset about how much untreated waste water goes into Lake Michigan, Sensenbrenner called the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District ""one of the biggest polluters in our country."" He cited the amount of dumping MMSD has done, but provided no evidence that it ranks among the nation’s top polluters.

To be sure, MMSD does dump untreated sewage -- along with collected rainwater -- in the lake when its system reaches capacity. But Sensenbrenner’s claim was one of magnitude, comparing the district to all other polluters nationwide. We found evidence indicating that MMSD is not even among the worst sewerage district polluters in the Great Lakes region.

We rate Sensenbrenner’s statement False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/03/jim-sensenbrenner/rep-jim-sensenbrenner-says-milwaukee-metropolitan-/

Are pit bulls more aggressive than other dogs?
","
DeKalb County commissioners are considering a reversal of an ordinance that has tongues wagging in Georgia’s third highest-populated county.

County leaders are thinking about removing pit bulls from its list of banned household pets.

Commissioner Elaine Boyer, whose district includes a politically conservative area in north DeKalb, raised some concerns about changing the ordinance.

""[T]his breed (of pit bulls) is most often associated with aggressive behavior,"" Boyer said in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution published July 20.

There is no date immediately scheduled to discuss the idea.

You don’t have to look far to find some tragic story of a child being horrifically mauled by a pit bull, which is known for its vise-like jaws. There are the frequent media accounts of pit bull dogfighting, which most famously involved former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, who pleaded guilty and served prison time for and his role in conspiring in a dogfighting ring.

But some counter that this breed of dog is not as vicious as its public portrayal. Many pit bull owners say the dogs are loving animals, which are sometimes trained by owners to be violent. Pit bulls are not the problem, they argue, people are.

We wanted to see if Boyer is right. The commissioner, who said she has no position on the proposed ordinance change, explained her initial comments to us via e-mail.

""I am an animal lover,"" she wrote. ""Our family owns small breed dogs, and we have personally never had an encounter with a pit bull. But friends and constituents have told me they have had bad experiences with pit bulls... I imagine even the sweetest puppy of any breed could snap at you if taunted or not trained properly.""

In 2008, a team of University of Pennsylvania researchers completed a study of aggressiveness of 30 breeds of dogs. The researchers collected about 15,000 questionnaires for the year-long study. The researchers asked owners a series of questions concerning how their dogs reacted in various situations to other canines and humans they know as well as strangers. The questions included how does the dog react when a stranger arrives.

The results found Chihuahuas and Dachshunds were the most aggressive toward both humans and other dogs. Those breeds, however, are smaller and usually inflict less-severe injuries. The findings were a mixed bag for Pit Bull Terriers. The dogs were among the most aggressive toward other dogs, particularly those they didn’t know. Pit bulls, the researchers found, were not significantly more aggressive than other breeds toward strangers and their owners.

""(Pit bulls) tended to be on the high side, but there were lots of breeds that were higher,"" said James Serpell, one of the researchers.

Serpell told us they felt confident with their findings. He acknowledged that some owners may have over reported or under reported how aggressive their dog acted in some scenarios. The results were widely reported by many newspapers.

One study of aggression done by a specialist in Australia found the pit bull terrier attacked humans at a higher level than any breed. German Shepherds and crosses were a close second.

For nearly 35 years, a Missouri-based group has conducted its own research on canine aggressiveness. The American Temperament Test Society conducts a 10-step exam and has checked out nearly 31,000 dogs, according to its website. The test includes seeing how the dog reacts to strangers,reacts to someone the animal doesn’t know but tries to pet it, how it reacts to loud noises and its response to a stranger who approaches in a menacing fashion.

The two types of pit bulls (the American Pit Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier) they’ve studied have aggression scores that are not as bad as boxers, bulldogs, collies, Great Danes, Greyhounds and Shetland sheepdogs. They are in the same range as the German Shepherd and golden retriever. Labrador retrievers scored better than pit bulls.

""On an even playing field, a pit bull is no more dangerous than a collie,"" said Salliann Comstock, the society’s chief tester and director of operations.

Comstock contends pit bulls are trained to be aggressive and argues many people, including some animal shelter workers, mistake other animals for pit bulls.

""A small boxer is called a pit bull,"" she said.

There is some skepticism about the society’s exam. One blogger said the test is geared toward bold dogs who are better equipped to face danger. Some discount dog aggressiveness studies altogether, saying the breeds are often misidentified even by owners.

The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control & Prevention once conducted a study of 20 years worth of fatal dog bite data. The study found 66 people died through bite-related incidents involving various types of pit bulls, which was more than any other type of dog. Rottweilers were a distant second, with 39. Rottweilers, though, were involved in 30 fatal dog bites for the last six years of the study while pit bulls were involved in 15 fatal dog bites. The study, however, was from 1979 through 1998. The CDC has not updated that study.

CDC spokeswoman Gail Hayes stressed via email that their study does not conclude which dogs are most likely to bite or kill. She also noted that the estimated 4.7 million Americans bitten by dog bites annually result in about 16 fatalities, a ratio of well less than 1 percent.

The past studies and research we’ve reviewed shows pit bulls are among the most aggressive dogs. Some breeds, however, have been shown to be more aggressive in each report.

However, the widely held perception is that they are dangerous, which was Boyer’s over-arching point. An Associated Press poll done in October found of the dog owners who would support breed bans, 85 percent would outlaw pit bulls.

Her statement has merit, but could have used additional context about the breed, which would have put it in a slightly different light.

We rate her claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/03/elaine-boyer/are-pit-bulls-more-aggressive-other-dogs/

Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted touts rise in new business filings
","
Ohio politicians have made job creation a top priority and talking point.

Gov. John Kasich, for instance, runs nearly every policy proposal through the jobs filter and frequently cites his belief that the state must be more business friendly to spur job growth.   

Even Secretary of State Jon Husted wants the public to know that he is keeping a close eye on jobs, an issue that he and fellow Republicans successfully harnessed during the 2010 election, when they knocked Democrats from office in part by blaming them for the state’s job woes.  

Though Husted’s most visible duty is overseeing elections, he is responsible for keeping track of the paperwork filed by individuals and companies – both non profit and for-profit corporations -- that want to do business in Ohio.

On July 18, 2011, a tweet by his office’s Twitter account, @OhioSOSHusted, noted that his office has processed more requests to set up companies through June of this year than the office processed during same period last year.  

""#Business formation is still on the rise in Ohio! So far in 2011 we’ve assisted w/ 44,443 new business filings.""  
The tweet also included a link to a news release his office posted to the Internet.  

PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued by the tweet and specifically whether the increase in business filings is an indicator of an upswing in business as the message -- and its exclamation point -- suggests.
 
The state handled 41,891 business filings through June 2010. That means the state processed 2,552 more business filings through the first six months of  this year – or about 6 percent -- compared to last year, according to Husted’s office.

""The number of new business selecting Ohio as a place to do business is heading in the right direction,"" Husted said in the news release.  

To get a better perspective on business filings, PolitiFact Ohio asked Matt McClellan from Husted’s office for the six-month and yearly totals of  business filings dating back to at January 2005, nearly three years before the recession officially began in December 2007.

McClellan offered these additional figures:   

Broadly speaking, these figures show the total number of filings has bobbed up and down and currently trending upward slightly.

Narrowing the focus, the January-through-June average total filings for the years leading up to the start of the recession is 41,994; the January-through-June average total filings during the recession is 40,909, or about a 2.5 percent fewer. So how does that compare to the 2011 January-through-June figure that inspired the tweet?

It is nearly even with the pre-recession yearly six-month average; and slighlty ahead of the recession average.

While the filings figures offer trend line, they tell us very little about the nature of the businesses, leaving to speculation whether they represent signs of real new businesses, future businesses, or just paperwork signaling legal and tax changes.

Also, it’s impossible to calculate the number of new businesses without knowing what is happening to existing businesses. If, for instance, new filings increased by 5,000 but 6,000 businesses failed, the uptick in filings, by itself, would create a misleading sign of growth.  

Husted seems to acknowledge that these numbers provide an incomplete view,  but he still sees these as a positive sign.

""While recognizing these number can’t provide a complete picture of Ohio’s job climate, they are an important indicator of economic activity that Secretary Husted hopes will add to the discussion of how to improve the state’s overall climate for business,"" Husted’s news release states.

It’s hard to ignore, however, a caveat at the bottom of Husted’s press release: ""Filing as a business in Ohio does not guarantee the company will begin operations, be profitable or create jobs.""  

So where does Husted’s tweet land on the Truth-0-Meter?

The figure in of itself is correct and points to a slight post-recession upward trend.  

But the context around the  tweet – the figure is worth boasting about because it’s a sign of economy recovery – seems overly optimistic, especially given the news release’s footnote that there’s no guarantee these filings mean more jobs will be created.

Husted’s claim is accurate, but leaves out details that provide clarification.

PolitiFact rates this claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2011/aug/03/jon-husted/ohio-secretary-state-jon-husted-touts-rise-new-bus/

Newark Mayor Cory Booker claims United States is trailing more than eight countries in the percentage of college graduates
","
Newark Mayor Cory Booker said he was disgusted and angry.

With federal officials mired in debate over raising the nation’s debt ceiling, Booker appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on July 24 to discuss political gridlock in the nation’s capital.

The generation of the Great Depression built the Hoover Dam and the Empire State Building at that time of crisis, but now ""Rome, our capital, is fiddling with itself while the nation is burning,"" Booker said.

Booker then pointed out how the United States has fallen behind other countries in the percentage of college graduates it produces.

""We are a nation that, in that generation said, you know, ‘We're going to go to the moon. And we're going to do math and science and make sure that our kids are prepared to go there.’ But right now what's happening?’"" Booker said. ""Nations are passing us in droves. Over eight different countries now have a higher proportion of people graduating from college than we do.""

PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Booker’s claim about the country’s college graduation rate was mostly right. In terms of young adults with the equivalent of an associate’s degree or higher, the United States is tied for ninth among the 36 countries analyzed by the Paris, France-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

First, let’s talk about how Booker received his numbers.

The mayor’s spokeswoman referred us to an Oct. 19, 2010 speech by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, in which he said: ""Today, in eight other nations, including South Korea, young adults are more likely to have college degrees than in the U.S.""

U.S. Department of Education spokeswoman Jane Glickman provided statistics from ""Education at a Glance 2010: OECD Indicators,"" which compares countries based on 2008 data. The OECD includes 34 member countries and works with other partner countries.

According to that 2010 report, the United States ranked ninth in the percentage of people between ages 25 and 34 to achieve an associate’s degree or higher. At 42 percent, the United States was tied with Israel, Belgium and Australia, according to the report.

The eight countries leading the United States in that age group were South Korea at 58 percent, followed by Canada, Russian Federation, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Ireland and Denmark, according to the report.

Older generations in the United States have fared better than in its OECD counterparts. The United States ranked higher in the percentage of adults between ages 35 and 64 who have college degrees, according to the report.

""Not too long ago we ranked at or near the top in the world, and while our rate has grown very slowly, other countries have experienced rapid increases and overtaken us,"" Glickman wrote in an email, adding ""we must sit up and take notice, especially since a degree is increasingly important for job opportunities in a changing economy.""

So Booker was right about young adults being more likely to have college degrees in eight other countries.

But Andreas Schleicher, head of the OECD's Indicators and Analysis Division in the Directorate for Education, said in an email that one should not put too much emphasis on small differences between countries, because of the varied educational systems.

Large proportions of young people in Germany and Austria enter apprenticeship arrangements, instead of higher education, Schleicher said. Russian Federation’s high graduation rate is related to short-term engineering studies that may not exist in other countries or only at the upper secondary level, which is comparable to high school in the United States, he said.

""A range of factors may affect the figures including the organization of the education and training system and government policies regarding education,"" Schleicher said in the email.

Alan Ruby, a senior fellow in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania, said four of those eight countries leading the United States don’t make for good comparisons because of their smaller sizes.

But why does the United States rank below some of the other countries?

Schleicher suggested the tuition fees in the United States -- the highest in the OECD -- affect participation rates. Ruby said some young people falsely believe there aren’t benefits to attending college.

Let’s review:

Booker said the United States trails ""over eight different countries"" in college graduates. The mayor shouldn’t have included the word ""over"" in his statement, but he’s on target when it comes to the younger generation of college graduates.

But since each country may have different educational policies affecting the overall rankings, we rate the statement Mostly True.

Barack Obama says debt ceiling deal lowers domestic spending to lowest level since Eisenhower
","
During his July 31, 2011, remarks announcing an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama offered a bit of historical context.

""The first part of this agreement will cut about $1 trillion in spending over the next 10 years -- cuts that both parties had agreed to early on in this process,"" Obama said. ""The result would be the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president -- but at a level that still allows us to make job-creating investments in things like education and research. We also made sure that these cuts wouldn’t happen so abruptly that they’d be a drag on a fragile economy.""

We received a number of requests to check Obama’s claim that the debt ceiling deal will result in ""the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president."" So we are checking it.

First, we’ll need to explain the term ""domestic spending,"" because in the past, Obama has used a slightly different term.

In February, we rated a similar comment by Obama. Back then, he said that under his own budget proposal -- which was not enacted -- ""domestic discretionary spending (would be at) its lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president.""

Domestic discretionary spending is generally defined as spending that (a) is not defense- or security-related, (b) is appropriated by Congress rather than being set by a formula (which is how funding for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security is determined) and (c) is not used to pay interest on the debt. Domestic discretionary spending includes a broad range of spending categories, from air traffic control to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

When we looked at Obama’s February comment, we found that according to White House budget projections, domestic discretionary spending under Obama’s proposal would indeed fall by 2015 to its lowest level since the early 1960s. That would come in the middle of Obama’s second term, if he wins one. We concluded that there was some merit to criticism that longer term ""projections"" about future reductions to discretionary spending were less meaningful than the ones proposed for the subsequent year. On that basis, and a few others, we rated Obama's claim Half True.

The phrasing in the more recent statement is different. On July 31, Obama referred to ""the lowest level of annual domestic spending."" Taking Obama literally, he would be referring not just to domestic discretionary spending, as before, but domestic mandatory spending as well, including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

We didn't think that’s what he meant to say -- and the White House confirmed that it was not -- but at PolitiFact, words matter, so we’ll calculate the numbers both ways to be sure.

Using the more traditional definition -- that is, non-defense discretionary spending, excluding  domestic mandatory spending -- Obama is on pretty solid ground.

The Office of Management and Budget has a historical table showing non-defense discretionary spending as a percentage of gross domestic product, going back to 1962. (Two brief and fairly minor caveats: 1961 was Eisenhower’s last budget, so the available data only goes back to the start of John F. Kennedy’s presidency, and a small portion of ""domestic"" discretionary spending is actually diplomatic in nature and thus international rather than domestic. But it’s a pretty small portion of the entire budget, so we’ll ignore it in our calculations.)

The OMB table shows that since 1962, non-defense discretionary spending has ranged from between about 3.2 percent of GDP and 5.2 percent of GDP. So the question is whether the debt ceiling deal just struck will lower domestic discretionary spending below 3.2 percent of GDP.

It does, according to calculations we made using Congressional Budget Office figures. To do this, we used three sets of statistics: the caps on discretionary spending set in the budget deal (table 1 here), the projected gross domestic product for each year from now until 2021 (table D-2 here) and the ratio between defense discretionary spending and non-defense discretionary spending (calculated from table 3-1 here).

Because CBO only provided figures for discretionary spending as a whole, we first determined that defense spending is expected to account for about 54 percent of all discretionary spending through 2021, and non-defense spending is expected to account for 46 percent. So we divided the capped amount of discretionary spending set in the debt deal by the projected GDP for the appropriate year, then multiplied the result by 46 percent to determine how much non-defense discretionary spending represented as a percentage of GDP.

We found that non-defense discretionary spending started as 3.6 percent of GDP in 2012, then would fall to 3.1 percent by 2014 and 2.5 percent by 2021. (This assumes GDP grows as projected, but these are the best numbers we have.)

So, starting in 2014, non-defense discretionary spending is poised to fall below the lowest level it reached between 1962 and the present, and that percentage continues to decline through 2021.

Using this measurement, then, Obama is correct.

However, it’s important to note a few caveats.

First, as we noted, Obama referred to ""the lowest level of annual domestic spending."" Using a strict definition of these words, the numbers would have to include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- and by this standard, Obama would be wrong.

Those programs currently account for roughly 13 percent to 14 percent of GDP -- several times the share allocated to non-defense discretionary spending. The combination of these two percentages will be bigger -- even under the deal -- than in many of the years since 1962.

Second, Obama implied that the debt deal deserves credit for achieving ""the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president."" In fact, the federal budget was already on a course to do this before the debt ceiling deal was struck.

Earlier this year, CBO published projections (table 3-1 here) showing that non-defense discretionary spending would fall to 3.2 percent by 2019 and 3.1 percent in 2020 and 2021.

The deal did have two important effects, however. It sped up the process -- setting a new post-1962 low by 2014 rather than by 2019 -- and it put the projections into law.

So where does this leave us?

Obama would have been right if he’d said the debt deal would reduce non-defense discretionary spending to its lowest level since 1962. If current projections of GDP are accurate, it would do so by 2014. And the deal deserves some credit for both accelerating the timetable for that achievement and enshrining it in law for the first time.

But that’s not what Obama said. He said that the deal would bring ""the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower."" By not specifying that he was referring to ""discretionary"" spending, Obama is wrong, since the expenses for mandatory domestic programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will remain high in the years ahead.

According to the White House, that's not what he meant, but he still said what he said. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/02/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-debt-ceiling-deal-lowers-domesti/
