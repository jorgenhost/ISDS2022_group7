No evidence Nevada Gaming Commission said Donald Trump wasn’t trustworthy enough for gaming license
","Ever wonder why Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas isn’t the ""Trump Hotel & Casino,"" asks a recent Facebook post?  ""The Nevada Gaming Commission did not find Trump ‘trustworthy’ enough for a gaming license,"" it says. ""Donald Trump — too shifty for Las Vegas."" The post, published on June 20, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reached out to the Nevada Gaming Commission for more information. Tony Alamo, the commission’s chairman, called the post’s claims ""a viral misconception on the internet."" ""President Trump has, in fact, been found suitable to be involved in gaming in Nevada,"" Alamo said.  In 2004, Trump filed an application and ""submitted to an investigation into his background in relation to his ownership interest in the Riviera Hotel & Casino,"" Alamo said. ""Both the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission voted unanimously to approve Trump’s application for suitability as a shareholder (individually and by and through his companies), with just over 10% ownership interest, in the Riviera Holdings Corporation.""  A 2004 Las Vegas Review-Journal article explains gaming regulators required Trump and his companies — Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc. and the THCR Holding Corp. — to secure a license after he purchased 358,000 shares of Riviera Holdings Corp., the parent company of what was then the Riviera Hotel and Casino. That purchase, the article says, put him over the threshold requiring an investigation and licensure by the state’s gaming regulators. (Alamo said Trump sold his interest in the Riviera later that year.)    Dennis Neilander, then the Gaming Control Board’s chairman, called the applications ""very clean"" and said he was impressed with the backgrounds of some of Trump’s personnel, according to the Review-Journal. In 2016, Harry Reid, the former Senate minority leader, told the Washington Post that Trump ""couldn’t get a license."" ""No question about it,"" the paper quotes Reid as saying. ""Not a chance. I may not be an expert on a lot of stuff but I’m an expert on gaming licenses. You can’t have filed 14 bankruptcies, cheat people out of stuff. In gaming circles, if somebody does something bad once, you can’t get a gaming license. He’s done something bad his whole life.""  But the Post reporter, Ben Terris, pushes back here.  ""Reid is not exactly correct here,"" Terris writes. ""Trump earned a license in 2004 but he hasn’t acted on it. Reid claimed that he has talked to the commissioner, and that if Trump were to try to build one now, he wouldn’t be able to.""  Terris links to this Snopes fact-check of the exact same image in the Facebook post. The hoax-debunking outlet then identified one possible source for the claim: a 1987 New York Times article about Trump’s effort to gain control of the Bally Manufacturing Corporation, a rival casino operator in Atlantic City. The story says:  ""Mr. Trump recently applied for a Nevada casino license, but Paul Bible, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission at the time, said that Nevada regulators would look askance at any ‘greenmailer’ who hurts casino companies in Nevada by acquiring large quantities of stock in order to sell the stake back to the company at a premium."" In court filings, Trump’s lawyers denied that he had invested in Bally to sell to the company at a premium, according to the Times. ""Mr. Trump has never been, and is not presently, a greenmailer or corporate raider,"" the filings said. In spite of such conflicts, though, we found no evidence that the Nevada Gaming Commission didn’t find Trump ""trustworthy"" enough for a gaming license, as the Facebook post claims. We searched Nexis news archives for evidence that the commission called Trump untrustworthy and came up empty. Plus, the commission’s chairman told PolitiFact that the allegation is a ""viral misconception,"" and that Trump has been deemed suitable to be involved in gaming in the state.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC92D00>],/factchecks/2019/jul/09/viral-image/no-evidence-nevada-gaming-commission-said-donald-t/

No, states haven't legislated marijuana users lose their guns
","People who support legalizing marijuana should proceed with caution, claims a recent Facebook post about communities that are decriminalizing the drug for medical and recreational use.  ""Nearly every state that has legalized it has also legislated that you lose your right to own a gun if you are prescribed it, or buy it recreationally,"" the May 14 post says. ""Pot legalization is turning out to be a back-door way for the government to get you to voluntarily give up your gun rights."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  A federal law that pre-dates legalization does prohibit users of controlled substances — including marijuana — from possessing firearms. But we found no evidence that states have legalized marijuana and then enacted their own laws to ban cannabis users from owning a gun. Dozens of states have legalized marijuana and we reached out to some of them to ask about the post. No one could corroborate the Facebook post’s claim.  Alex Traverso, a spokesman for the Bureau of Cannabis Control in California, told us he’s never even heard such a claim, nor seen anything about it in the state’s regulations.  Brian Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board, said there’s ""no link between purchasing recreational or medical marijuana and owning a gun.""  ""The product is not traced post-retail sale so there is no way of even linking the two,"" he said. Madeline Kane with the Oregon Liquor Control Commission said the agency doesn’t regulate firearms. But, she said, ""it is our understanding that what you have described may be related to federal policy."" Because marijuana is still illegal under federal law, said Tara Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, it’s still classified as a controlled substance. People who apply for a firearm must complete a federal form that asks in part about unlawful marijuana use.  ""Warning,"" the form says under a question about the unlawful use of marijuana or other substances. ""The use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or decriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside.""  That means that marijuana users may be rejected from purchasing a firearm, Dunn said.  Next, we turned to some marijuana experts to help us parse the federal and state laws. Matt Simon, the New England political director with Marijuana Policy Project, which advocates for marijuana policy reforms, including decriminalizing marijuana use, said the Facebook claim ""is absolutely false.""  ""I’m not aware of any state medical cannabis law or adult use legalization law that explicitly prohibits cannabis users from owning firearms,"" he said.  However, he said, under federal law it has long been considered illegal for a user of a controlled substance — including marijuana — to possess a firearm. Those are policies from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), though, not state law.  In some cases, Simon said, local law enforcement has enforced the federal prohibition. While the Department of Health and Human Services in New Hampshire is forbidden by state law from sharing information from its therapeutic cannabis patient registry with federal agencies, Hawaii lets local police access its medical cannabis registry and gun owner registry.  Simon pointed to a 2017 Miami Herald story that reported the Honolulu Police Department sent letters to all medical cannabis patients who were also registered gun owners and told them they had 30 days to surrender their firearms. After pushback, Simon said, the police department said it wouldn’t enforce the policy.   Some states have moved to protect the gun rights of medical marijuana users. In Oklahoma, for example, the governor signed a bill on April 15 that says state and local agencies can’t deny gun rights to people because they use medical marijuana. Earlier this year U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney, a Republican from West Virginia, filed a bill that would amend federal law so that medicinal marijuana users wouldn’t be disqualified from purchasing a gun. (No action has been taken since it was introduced in the House on April 3.) Our ruling The Facebook post says that nearly every state that has legalized marijuana has also legislated that people who use cannabis lose their right to own a gun.  We didn’t find evidence to support this claim.  While federal law prohibits marijuana users from owning a firearm, states are not legalizing cannabis and then passing legislation that requires marijuana users to forfeit their gun rights.  We rate this Facebook post as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB84FFC0>],/factchecks/2019/jul/09/viral-image/states-havent-legislated-marijuana-users-lose-guns/

Donald Trump exaggerates turnaround on US car plants, ignores closures
","On his trip to South Korea, President Donald Trump spent some time with business executives and highlighted signs of a robust American economy. ""We have companies moving in, car companies moving in,"" Trump said June 30. ""In particular, car companies. We hadn’t had a plant built in years — in decades, actually. And now we have many plants being built all throughout the United States."" We decided to look at what’s been going on with car plants, and if it’s been decades since a new one was started. The full story is that the turnaround is less clear cut than he said, especially when plant closures are folded in. The White House press office pointed to a list of recent automaker investments. The list included a totally new Toyota-Mazda assembly plant in Huntsville, Ala., (due to open in 2021) as well as expansions at existing facilities, such as General Motors retooling a Michigan plant to make electric vehicles, and Hyundai adding space at its Alabama facility to streamline engine production. The Trump campaign had a similar list. Between the two of them, we counted eight expansion/retooling projects and two new assembly plants since 2017. Trump’s statement could have referred to new plants that make cars, or expansions to existing plants, some of which make cars and others that make engines and other major components that go into cars. The distinction matters, because the patterns over the past 10 years are different.  Investments in existing plants have been fairly steady since the 2009 recession. In 2010, General Motors announced $145 million to re-open a Detroit-area plant. In 2014, Ford put $500 million into an Ohio engine facility. In 2016, General Motors unveiled nearly $790 million for its Spring Hill, Tenn., engine plant. Investments in new assembly plants sets a higher bar. We found two lists of car assembly plant activity — one from researcher James Rubenstein at Miami University in Ohio and the other from the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. We consolidated the two data sets, which include when plants open and when carmakers announced their plans. In terms of openings, the numbers in this table show a gap between 2010 and 2018.  ""The absence of new assembly plants during most of the 2010s is attributable to two factors: Recovery from the severe 2008-09 recession and a focus on expanding production in Mexico,"" Rubenstein said. Between 2013 and 2016, automakers opened six new assembly plants in Mexico. During that time, the focus in the United States was on existing plants. New plants are dramatic investments, but carmakers invested billions after the recession to retool and reopen closed production lines. In 2015, Ford announced it was putting $1.3 billion into its Kentucky Truck Plant. Between 2013 and 2015, General Motors earmarked nearly $2 billion for its assembly plants in Flint and Hamtramck, Mich.  Looking at the more recent period, as the table shows, one new plant was announced two years before Trump took office. The two announced on his watch, by Toyota-Mazda and Fiat Chrysler, are expected to open a couple of years from now.  Trump had a point when he said it had been awhile since a new plant opened, but he went too far when he said it had been ""decades."" It had been since 2010. Trump might like to take credit for any new activity, but Bernard Swiecki with the Center for Automotive Research told us that broad global factors guide the carmakers. ""With the huge capital outlay required for each plant, automakers time their investments carefully to have capacity available during the high volume points of the market,"" Swiecki said. Or, as Rubenstein put it, ""Carmakers operate in a longer time horizon than do politicians."" But plant openings tell only half the story. Closures are important, too. General Motors stopped production at its Lordstown, Ohio, plant in 2019, and announced that its plant in Hamtramck, Mich., is slated to stay open only until January 2020. The net gain on Trump’s watch could be one new assembly plant.  Trump said the United States hadn’t seen a new car ""plant built in years — in decades, actually. And now we have many plants being built all throughout the United States."" It’s unclear if Trump included plants that make engines and other components, but that type of investment has been fairly steady over the years, which runs counter to his point about new plants coming after decades of no activity. In terms of assembly plants, his comment is a stretch. Nine years ago a new assembly plant opened in Tennessee. In 2015, Volvo announced it would build a plant in South Carolina and opened it in 2019. So it hasn’t been ""decades."" Two other plants are underway. On the flip side, however, one GM plant closed during Trump’s presidency, and another is slated for closure.  Overall, Trump painted a picture of a turnaround that the facts don’t support. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE31BC0>],/factchecks/2019/jul/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-touts-new-car-plants-america-overlook/

Joe Biden says he will champion a ban on assault weapons, not all guns
","As Democrats consider who to nominate as their presidential candidate, the National Rifle Association is sounding the alarm about former Vice President Joe Biden.  ""Biden calls for gun ban,"" reads the text over a photo of Biden.  ""If elected, Joe Biden promises he will BAN your guns,"" additional text says.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The gun-rights organization commented on its post, telling users to ""read more"" and sharing a link to a Fox News story.  The story is about an education plan Biden released on May 28. The story notes that the plan says: ""As president, he will secure passage of gun legislation to make our students safer, and he knows he can do it because he’s defeated the National Rifle Association twice before. He’ll begin by again championing to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — bans he authored in 1994. In the months ahead, he will release additional proposals to address the gun violence epidemic in our country.""  The 1994 law focused on 18 specific firearms and banned certain models of AR-15s and AK-47s. It was illegal to make such weapons for use by private citizens during the 10 years the ban was in effect. But, as this Washington Post primer on the ban notes, it was legal to own or resell any assault weapon manufactured before the law went into effect, meaning if you owned a banned gun before the ban, you could keep it or sell it.  When we asked the NRA about the post, Amy Hunter, a spokesperson for the organization’s Institute for Legislative Action, said: ""When we say Joe Biden promises to ban guns, we mean exactly what we say: He plans to ban guns. We did not say ‘all guns,’ and we didn’t characterize it as a ‘total gun ban.’""  If he wants to ban ""so-called assault weapons,"" she said, he is calling for a gun ban on ""millions and millions of guns,"" including the popular AR-15. But saying Biden calls for a gun ban could lead readers to believe he’s seeking to outlaw all firearms. Consider that in the United Kingdom, for example, four dog breeds are banned — it’s against the law to own pit bull terriers among other dogs. But to say that England has banned dogs is misleading; someone could understandably believe no dogs are allowed there.  Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden’s campaign, said the education plan is the only policy plan the campaign has released about guns.  Biden talked about a ""smart gun"" policy when he was asked about gun violence during the Democratic debate June 27. ""We should have smart guns,"" he said. ""No gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger. It’s within our right to do that. We can do that. Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA. The gun manufacturers."" Biden has been advocating for regulations that would require manufacturers to include a biometric system that would prohibit people from firing weapons unless their fingerprints are registered to that specific weapon, The Verge reported on June 27. On June 29, Axios published a story summing up where the 2020 Democrats stand on gun control. Biden, it says, believes only ""smart guns"" — ones that require a ""biometric measure"" to pull the trigger — should be sold. He has also supported the government buying back guns from owners. Hunter, of the NRA, said Biden has a long history of votes and statements that make his views clear.  Hunter cited seven votes by Biden on gun issues since 1990, including amendments to ban certain rifles, guns considered assault weapons, and semi-automatic weapons. Our ruling The NRA said Biden called for a ""gun ban."" Biden has advocated banning assault weapons, and he has a history of trying to ban certain guns. But as he vies for the Democratic presidential nomination, he isn’t promising to prohibit Americans from owning any gun. He said he’d again champion a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like the bans he supported in 1994. Those bans prevented the manufacture and sale of certain weapons for private citizens to use; they did not confiscate or prevent the sale of weapons that were purchased before the restrictions went into effect. The Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD48CC0>],/factchecks/2019/jul/09/national-rifle-association/joe-biden-says-he-will-champion-ban-assault-weapon/

Posts saying Trump's July 4 event drew small crowd are wrong
","The subject of crowd sizes at political events has spiked ever since the Trump administration claimed that the president’s inauguration ceremony featured the biggest inaugural crowd ever. (That turned out to be Pants on Fire-level inaccurate.) Now, a social media post roaming around the internet claims that a photo of the National Mall during Trump’s Fourth of July ""Salute to America"" ceremony shows how few people attended, and asserts the webcam filming the celebration was purposely turned off because of it.  The post, shared by the Other 98% Facebook page on July 4, features a picture of what appears to be a rainy, empty National Mall, with text below that reads:  ""The webcam of the National Mall was abruptly shut down without notice and has been removed from the whitehouse.gov site. Presumably to stop viewers from seeing the lack of attendees at the #TrumpParade. We are about to relive Trump’s inauguration all over again."" The page also added this caption alongside the photo: ""Trump's parade was an unmitigated, absolute, outrageously expensive disaster. First of all, barely anyone showed up. The webcams on the National Mall have all been turned off without notice so no one will talk about Trump's 'crowd size'. DO NOT spread this photo around, we don't want to make our Great Leader angry."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We have no reason to disbelieve that the photo used in the Facebook post was taken during the ""Salute to America"" event; it appears that it was first tweeted by an account called @SpinDr. However, the image captures only a small section of sidewalk that is not representative of the actual crowd during the event. A wide-shot photo by Getty photographer Susan Welsh shows hundreds, if not thousands, of spectators lined up with the following caption: ""US President Donald Trump speaks during the ‘Salute to America’ Fourth of July event at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, July 4, 2019."" Several images captured by Associated Press photographers also support a large number of attendees, as does a C-SPAN live stream of the event (particularly around the 29:00 minute mark). Although an official estimate of the event’s crowd size has not been released, images and videos from numerous reputable sources paint a very different picture than the Facebook post’s claim. While some Twitter users shared similar photos of empty sections of lawn, several news organizations and media outlets shared videos and photos of a congested event: BREAKING: Massive crowd waiting for President Trump to speak at the #SaluteToAmerica in Washington D.C.#4thOfJuly - @BreakingNLive pic.twitter.com/xbPlTE7jvm The view looking out into the crowd from the Lincoln Memorial.

Flanagan criticizes Senate Democrats on taxes
","Democrats’ complete control of statewide elected offices and both houses of the New York State legislature have provoked criticism from Republicans, who contend the Democrats’ progressive agenda has gone too far.  In an interview on The Capitol Pressroom, Senate Minority Leader John Flanagan told host Susan Arbetter, ""The Senate Democrats have not provided one tax cut.""  Is that true? We approached Senate Democrats for information on their tax actions, and Press Secretary Jonathan Heppner provided us with a spreadsheet of 26 items, including tax exemptions, credits, and two ""reductions."" Of the 26 items, 11 have been signed into law, five passed both the Senate and Assembly, and 10 have been passed only by the Senate.  The two items classified as ""reductions"" are the property tax cap, which was made permanent in the budget that began April 1, and a budget measure concerning local assessments and equalization rates.   The list from Senate Democrats contained exemptions such as property tax exemptions for certain energy systems, and an exemption from sales tax for vending machine items, both of which were included in the enacted budget. Other exemptions, such as one for breast pump supplies, had only passed the Senate. Another, passed by both houses but not yet signed into law, would allow localities to provide property tax exemptions on accessibility improvements to the homes of severely injured service members.  Tax credits that were enacted include one for green roofs, though this happened after Flanagan made his statement, a three-year extension of a tax credit program for employers of people with disabilities, an incentive for employers to provide child care, a three-year extension for a credit for using clean heating fuel, and expansion of a credit for historic property rehabilitation.  We also asked a spokesman for the Senate minority, Scott Reif, for evidence of Flanagan’s claim. Reif told us that Senate Democrats approved ""more than a billion dollars in new taxes and fees"" this year and $4.5 billion next year.  Reif’s claim regarding new taxes is accurate, according to David Friedfel, director of state studies at Citizens Budget Commission and a former Assembly majority staff member who worked on budget issues.    Heppner, the Senate Democrats’ spokesman, noted that Republicans voted against the budget, which made permanent the 2 percent cap on property taxes. The Rockefeller Institute estimates the cap has saved property owners $25 billion since it was enacted in 2012.  Senate Democrats did not include a middle-class income tax cut in their list, which was included in the budget. It is implemented thanks to a previously enacted statute, so they did not claim credit.  Experts we talked to had differing views on whether Senate Democrats had enacted any tax cuts.  Friedfel, who once worked for the Assembly’s Democratic majority, said that the budget ""definitely"" contained some cuts, such as extension of a film tax credit and the clean heating fuel credit. The property tax cap doesn’t provide a tax cut automatically, Friedfel said, but in looking at an upward trend in property taxes over time, politicians could argue that the cap will result in a cut.  Ron Deutsch, executive director at the Fiscal Policy Institute, which leans left, said it is ""debatable"" whether the tax cap can be considered a tax cut. The cap allows for 2 percent growth in local property tax levies, though the cap could be keeping taxes lower than they would have been without the cap.  E.J. McMahon, of the right-leaning Empire Center for Public Policy, said the tax cap is a ""wonderful thing"" but it is not a tax cut. He looked over the list the Senate Democrats provided of credits, exemptions and reductions, and said they aren’t what most people would consider a tax cut.  ""When most people hear the phrase ‘tax cut,’ they think of a general reduction in some category of taxes, not a refund you might get if you do something the state wants to encourage,"" McMahon said.    Flanagan made it tough on himself by making such a hyperbolic statement -- not one tax cut. Senate Democrats have proposed and enacted some forms of tax relief for New Yorkers, though it may not be what most residents would consider a ""tax cut."" Many of these exemptions or credits are for narrow segments of the population. The property tax cap, now permanent, has kept property taxes $25 billion lower than they would have been othewise.   We rate Flanagan’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB00B80>],/factchecks/2019/jul/08/john-flanagan/flanagan-criticizes-senate-democrats-taxes/

Austin homeless policy doesn't allow camping on private property
","An Austin City Council decision to rescind local prohibitions on sitting or sleeping in most public areas has kicked off a dispute between state and city leaders about the best way to handle homelessness in urban areas in Texas.  In the weeks since the policy was adopted, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has made multiple threats to pursue actions at the state level to overturn Austin’s decision. The Travis County Republican Party expressed support for state intervention in a news release on Wednesday, titled: ""Homeless given more rights than property owners under new camping policy.""  ""A recent change to city ordinance allowing homeless camps on private property, business frontage, and even public sidewalks has ignited a firestorm from both sides of the political spectrum,"" the release reads. ""It has now become legal in the City of Austin for homeless persons to camp on the front of one's private property or on public rights-of-way in the Capital of Texas."" This is an inaccurate characterization of Austin’s policy, which does not regulate private property. It does allow people to sleep or camp in public areas bordering private property, as long as they do not pose a hazard or aggressively confront others. Austin Mayor Steve Adler said the Travis County GOP’s description of the policy is ""clearly not true."" ""You can’t camp on someone else’s property unless they invite you,"" he said. What does Austin’s ordinance actually say? The Austin City Council voted to ease local regulations affecting the city’s homeless population at the end of June, as the city experienced an influx of people staying in public places. The new policy makes public camping — except on parkland — legal, as long as a person does not endanger ""the health or safety of another person or of themselves"" or make ""usage of such area unreasonably inconvenient or hazardous."" It also makes it legal for people to sit, sleep or panhandle on public sidewalks as long as they don’t engage in hazardous behavior or actions deemed aggressive.  Police Chief Brian Manley said the new policy will shift the focus of law enforcement from activities to conduct, according to the Austin American-Statesman. ""I think the impact will be more on persons’ perceptions of their own safety and our inability now to act in cases where someone may have erected a structure in front of a business or is sitting or lying in front of someone’s business, but not necessarily being dangerous,"" Manley said. Austin Police Association post was source Matt Mackowiak, chairman of the Travis County Republican Party, said the language in the press release should have been more clear. ""We should have said on public property and adjacent to private property,"" he said in an email.  Andy Hogue, spokesman for the party, said the release was based on a Facebook post from the Austin Police Association explaining the new ordinance.  ""If the Austin Police are not clear on the wording (the ones who really need to know), then what about the average Austinite?"" Hogue said in an email. But the information included in the police association’s Facebook post is accurate, since it says that people are allowed to camp or sit on public sidewalks as long as they do not pose a hazard. In a post dated July 1, the association said police officers are not able to respond to calls from residents about people sleeping on the sidewalk in front of their homes. ""The new obstruction/camping ordinances allow camping on sidewalks, alleyways, and other public places (except parks and City Hall), which includes in front of your house, provided the people camping are not making the sidewalk unreasonably inconvenient or hazardous,"" the post reads. Our ruling A press release from the Travis County Republican Party said that Austin’s new ordinances regulating public camping allow for ""homeless camps on private property, business frontage, and even public sidewalks"" and that they give more rights to people experiencing homelessness than to property owners. This is an inaccurate characterization of Austin’s new policies, which only regulate public property. It’s true that individuals are allowed to camp or sleep nearby private property or businesses (as long as they don’t pose a hazard), but they are only allowed to do so on public property. At the time this piece was published, the party had not corrected the release on its website. We rate this claim False.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., found last Thursday night that his toughest opponent may have been himself – in 2013. During the debate, MSNBC moderator Rachel Maddow asked the Vermont senator about something he had said to Seven Days — a weekly alternative newspaper in Burlington — six years ago, but that was only just published last week in an analysis of Sanders’ views about gun-control throughout his political career. ""Sen. Sanders, a Vermont newspaper recently released portions of an interview you gave in 2013 in which you said, ‘my own view on guns is, everything being equal, states should make those decisions,’"" Maddow said. ""No,"" Sanders interjected before Maddow continued.  ""Has your thinking changed since then?"" she asked. ""Do you now think there’s a federal role to play?""  ""No, that’s a mischaracterization of my thinking,"" Sanders replied. ""It’s a quote of you,"" Maddow responded to laughter from the audience. Did Maddow misrepresent what Sanders thought about gun-control in 2013?  A spokesperson for the Sanders camp said the MSNBC moderator’s question falsely asserts that Sanders does not believe the federal government should regulate firearms. ""The question characterized the 2013 interview as Bernie asserting he believed there to be no federal role to play in gun legislation,"" the campaign said.  ""Both in that exact interview, and for years prior, Bernie has long articulated a strong federal role to play, including the ban of assault weapons and the mandate of background checks and the banning of straw man purchases."" Based on Sanders interjection of ""no"" and his interruption of Maddow before she was able to finish her question, one could assume Sanders was objecting to his own quote read in isolation. This is apparently how Maddow also interpreted Sanders, as she retorts, ""it’s a quote of you."" But it’s impossible to know what Sanders was thinking, so we’re giving the senator the benefit of the doubt.  What is clear, however, is that Sanders’ history on guns confounding at best — and the Vermont senator has admitted that it has not been one of his core issues.  In the late 1980s and 1990s, he is quoted saying that he believes gun-control measures should be, for the most part, left to state government to decide on — a position he reiterated in his 2013 interview with Seven Days. ""It's a local control issue,"" Sanders said in 1988. ""In Vermont, it is not my view that the present law needs any changing,"" he added on the issue of a waiting period for handguns. But it’s also true that in some cases, stretching back to the 1990s, he has supported a federal role, which is where Maddow’s question seems somewhat misinformed.  This dissonance in Sanders’ gun stance is illustrated when he voted against the Brady bill — which required background checks and imposed a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases — in 1993 and then six months later, in May of 1995, he voted in favor of a ban on assault weapons. During last week’s debate, Sanders responded to Maddow by pointing to his support for banning assault weapons and prohibiting straw purchases as examples of his belief the federal government should make decisions on firearm regulation.  Politifact compiled his federal voting record on gun issues up to 2013 and in most cases he has voted for more gun control.  Since 2013 his gun control credentials have been even stronger. He voted in favor of limiting magazine ammunition capacity, background checks for online sales, and was a co-sponsor of legislation that would make states work with the U.S. Attorney General to implement a plan for a firearm purchases registry.  To determine whether the quote used by Maddow took on a different meaning within the full interview from 2013, we listened to audio Seven Days posted as part of its recent story on Sanders’ views on gun-control. In the recording, Paul Heintz, the reporter who sat down with Sanders months after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, asked Sanders if he had noticed a change in how Vermonters feel about firearms and gun rights. Sanders responded that he was not an expert on gun-control policy, but that he would ""suspect there has been a gradual shift, probably to more support for gun-control."" Sanders then began to speak about the lack of will in the Vermont Legislature to take up gun-control measures and how there is ""virtually no gun-control at all"" in Vermont. In 2018 Gov. Phil Scott signed sweeping firearm regulations that mandate background checks prior to all firearm sales, raise the minimum age to buy a gun from 16 to 21, and ban bump stocks and high-capacity ammunition magazines.  In the interview six years ago, Sanders said there has ""not been much effort"" to pass gun-control measures in Vermont because it is a ""rural state"" with ""tens of thousands of families who hunt"" and, he added, ""thank God our crime rate is much lower than many other states."" Then Sanders pivoted away from Vermont policy to national politics.  Sanders explained that he voted for a ban on assault weapons in 1994 because he thought ""nationally it made sense."" Sanders won election to Congress in 1990 in part when his opponent, incumbent Republican Peter Smith, changed his mind and said he supported an assault weapons ban, drawing the ire of the National Rifle Association. In the interview, Sanders went on to say he opposed and voted against the Brady bill because the Vermont Legislature had ""no inclination"" to approve similar handgun registration and waiting period laws at the state level. ""I voted against the Brady bill, I thought that was a decision for the states to make. So my own view on guns is, everything being equal, the states should make those decisions,"" he said in 2013. However, directly after saying the quote Maddow used during the debate, Sanders goes on to say that Congress is looking at mandating increased background checks and banning straw purchases — both federal firearm policies he said ""made sense."" ""On the other hand, there are some federal issues that go beyond what states do,"" the Vermont senator added about the federal role in regulating firearms. We reached out to Heintz to get his take on whether Maddow was mischaracterizing the 2013 interview with Sanders. ""I think our 2013 interview with Sen. Sanders stands on its own and I think last night’s debate stands on its own,"" Heintz said. ""Both are available online and I encourage people to watch and listen and draw their own conclusions.""",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB39B80>],/factchecks/2019/jul/03/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-has-confounding-record-gun-control-/

Did taxation really cause the American Revolution?
","North Carolina prides itself on its role in the American Revolution, even claiming to be ""first in freedom."" And ahead of Independence Day, Republican state Rep. Kelly Hastings hearkened back to the country’s beginnings as he promised to protect taxpayers. ""The Seven Years’ War led to near bankruptcy for many countries; Britain’s need to raise taxes fueled the American desire for independence,"" Hastings said in a tweet Sunday. ""I pray that I maintain the wisdom to spend money wisely, prevent budget deficits, and efficiently manage debt. In turn, we can continue to cut taxes and protect the taxpayers."" The background to Hastings’ promise: Gov. Roy Cooper had announced Friday that he would veto state House and Senate Republicans’ proposed budget. Among other things, the budget did not include a plan for Medicaid expansion, which Cooper said was a must months before the budget was proposed. Many Republicans are wary of Medicaid expansion because they fear its reliance on federal tax dollars could backfire. Hastings, a five-term House member from Cherryville, said in an email interview Tuesday that he based his tweet on knowledge from history classes and the Declaration of Independence. ""I appreciate the role that North Carolina played in our independence,"" Hastings added. ""According to William S. Powell, the author of ‘North Carolina: A History,’ the Halifax Resolves document was the first official state action for independence."" The adoption of the Halifax Resolves by North Carolina was the first official action calling for independence from Great Britain. The date of the resolution, April 12, 1776, appears on the North Carolina flag. It’s part of the reason some North Carolina license plates say ""First in Freedom."" The famous phrase ""no taxation without representation"" has been remembered as the inspiration for the American Revolution, but were taxes the main cause for revolution? We decided to investigate further. The Seven Years’ War In Hastings’ tweet, he referenced the Seven Years’ War, a conflict started in 1756 between Great Britain and France, among other countries. In North America, the skirmish began as the French and Indian War with a border dispute with the French over the upper Ohio River Valley. The British forces, led by a young George Washington, were defeated by the French at Fort Necessity. Soon after, Great Britain retaliated. The scuffle escalated into a worldwide conflict because of the immense imperial power Great Britain, France and their European allies held around the world. At the time, Great Britain controlled the 13 colonies from the coast to the Appalachian Mountains, and France controlled the surrounding land west of the Appalachians from Louisiana stretching up to Canada. The Seven Years’ War was a long and expensive affair for all parties involved. In the 1762 Treaty of Paris, France and Spain also lost a considerable amount of territory. However, even though Great Britain won the war because of its strong navy, it spent a great deal of money on the conflict — which it then tried to get from the colonies. ‘Taxation without representation’ Following the end of the French and Indian War, a series of taxes and policies, including the Stamp Act, the Townshend Tariffs and the Tea Act, were implemented in the Americas in order to help Great Britain cover the cost of winning a war in the colonies. Kathleen DuVal, professor of history at UNC Chapel Hill, said that colonists were equally as upset about being taxed as they were angry that they were not represented in the British government. ""Colonists did pay local taxes, which they viewed as legitimate because local governments, including colonial legislatures like North Carolina’s, were locally elected,"" DuVal said. The colonists believed that, as British citizens, they should only be taxed with their consent and being taxed without representation was therefore tyranny. Hence the slogan, ""no taxation without representation."" ""The new taxes that Parliament passed to pay down the Seven Years’ War debt were an important cause of the Revolution, but the fact that colonists weren’t represented in Parliament was central to their cause,"" DuVal said. ""The ‘representation’ in the phrase ‘taxation without representation’ was at least as important as the ‘taxation.’"" While taxation was a main cause for revolution, the reason why it was so abhorrent was not that the taxes were high and needed to be cut. It was a problem because the colonies had no say in how they wanted to be taxed. ""Among other things, the Revolution was not about a desire to CUT taxes,"" said Wayne E. Lee, a professor of Peace, War and Defense at UNC Chapel Hilll. Furthermore, if Britain had offered the colonists representation in Parliament before the war gained more momentum, the movement for independence probably would have fizzled out, DuVal said. Our ruling Hastings is correct that the Seven Years’ War caused multiple countries, including Great Britain, to plunge into debt. In order to pay it off, Great Britain taxed the American colonies. Hastings said revolution was ""fueled"" by this taxation. This is true, but it does miss some key context because the colonies’ lack of representation was just as important as the excess of taxation. Because they were not represented in Parliament and thus taxed without any input, the colonists felt like second-class citizens and started their battle for equality that ultimately resulted in independence.

No, migrants aren’t being quarantined with an unknown disease at the U.S.-Mexico border

In the June 26 article, Big League Politics wrote that there are ""three individuals now quarantined at a privately-owned hospital in El Paso with an unknown disease."" The outlet also said, without evidence, that a 10-year-old girl was ""found with 20 types of semen in her."" ""The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not even been able to identify the disease the three migrants have, as the military guards the quarantine area,"" author Patrick Howley wrote. Those claims were attributed to a ""medical professional on the border.""

The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because they’re not substantiated with facts.

Did Eisenhower say a military parade would make U.S. look weak? Not in so many words
","As President Donald Trump was preparing a July 4 celebration in Washington, with tanks and other armaments on display, some social media users were pushing back by sharing an image of one of Trump’s predecessors as president, former general Dwight D. Eisenhower. A post circulating on the internet showed a photograph of Eisenhower with the following caption: ""When asked if the United States should have a military parade to show off its might, this was then-President Eisenhower’s response: ‘Absolutely not. We are the pre-eminent power on Earth. For us to try and imitate what the Soviets are doing in Red Square would make us look weak.’""  A reader who saw the post asked us to fact-check it. The meme has been circulating since at least early 2018, when news of Trump’s idea for a military-themed parade in the nation’s capital was circulating, Snopes.com reported at the time. The fact-checking site noted that it was actually a quote from historian Michael Beschloss, author of the book ""Presidents of War"", in an interview with NPR’s ""All Things Considered"" on Feb. 7, 2018.  Beschloss was paraphrasing Eisenhower’s feelings about military parades, but was not directly quoting him. Beschloss told NPR that while Eisenhower had no quarrel with parades following major military victories and while some military hardware was present at his 1953 inauguration, ""to have a military parade without the end of a war or an inaugural or some big reason in Washington, D.C., that is out of our tradition."" The NPR report continued: Beschloss points to the 1950s, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev presided over large military parades showing off the latest in Soviet military might. Beschloss says some in the White House approached Eisenhower, himself a decorated military general, suggesting the U.S. do the same, to show off American might. ""Eisenhower said absolutely not, we are the pre-eminent power on Earth,"" Beschloss says, recalling Eisenhower's response. ""For us to try to imitate what the Soviets are doing in Red Square would make us look weak."" Samantha Kenner, communications director of the Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum, and Boyhood Home in Abilene, Kan., said that their reference archivist recently researched this question and did not find instances of him using those exact words. But Wiliam I. Hitchcock, a University of Virginia historian and author of ""The Age of Eisenhower: America and the World in the 1950s,"" told PolitiFact that the views do mesh with Eisenhower’s. Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, agreed. ""The sentiment certainly aligns with everything we know about him,"" Janda said. ""He was, after all, the president who famously cut defense spending, warned of a military industrial complex, and preferred low profile covert operations to overt use of military force. He was also steadfastly not bombastic or grandiose."" Janda pointed to a passage in Eisenhower’s April 16, 1953 speech ""The Chance for Peace."" ""The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people."" And Chester Pach, an Ohio University historian and co-author of ""The Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower,"" told Snopes that he agreed Eisenhower would have had a dim view of the idea of a parade along the lines of what Trump has sought.  A viral image said that when asked if the United States should have a military parade to ""show off its might,"" Eisenhower said, ""Absolutely not. We are the pre-eminent power on Earth. For us to try and imitate what the Soviets are doing in Red Square would make us look weak."" Eisenhower’s presidential library, among other experts, failed to find any occasion on which Eisenhower spoke these words. However, the passage stems from historian Michael Beschloss’ paraphrase of Eisenhower’s views. Several historians told us that Beschloss’ summary aligns with their own understanding of Eisenhower’s views.

Tulsi Gabbard exaggerates in saying a kid hacked into a replica of Florida's election system
","After President Donald Trump joked with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Russia meddling in U.S. elections, a talk show host asked Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard to respond. Appearing on HBO’s ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" Gabbard, a U.S. representative from Hawaii, told Maher: ""We have to take seriously the security of our elections because of the vulnerabilities that exist — still, now — that really have the ability to undermine our democracy. There’s a hacking conference that’s held every year in Las Vegas, where I think a 14- or 15-year old-girl from Florida hacked into a replica of Florida’s election system in less than 15 minutes."" What we found is some indication of vulnerability — even if it’s not a direct threat to the voting system itself. At least one kid did do some quick hacking.  But two points are problematic for Gabbard’s claim. First, there wasn’t hacking into a replica of the election system — but rather a website made to look like Florida’s Secretary of State website that reports preliminary election results. In other words, not the system that receives and counts actual votes. And second, what was hacked into was not even a replica — as in an exact copy of the website — because it did not contain the proprietary security features that the Secretary of State website has. As the National Association of Secretaries of State said at the time: ""While it is undeniable websites are vulnerable to hackers, election-night reporting websites are only used to publish preliminary, unofficial results for the public and the media. The sites are not connected to vote counting equipment and could never change actual election results."" Besides being a large swing state, Florida is important because Russian hackers gained access to at least one Florida county’s election computer network during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in that campaign. The county was not named. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said two local election offices were hacked ahead of the 2016 election, but that he is not allowed to name the counties.  The Republican governor has emphasized that while the counties had experienced ""intrusion into the supervisor of election networks,"" no information was manipulated or changed, and that it’s possible they obtained voter information that was public record anyway. To support Gabbard’s statement, her campaign sent us two news articles about DEFCON 26, a hacking and cybersecurity event held in Las Vegas in August 2018. As part of the annual event, kids ages 8 to 16 could try to hack into what DEFCON described as replicas of election websites of 13 battleground states, including Florida.  One article said an 11-year-old boy hacked into the website that was made to look like the Florida Secretary of State’s website; and the other article said an 11-year-old girl hacked into one of the sites, but didn’t indicate which state. Both were done in under 15 minutes. (The home states of the kids were not named.) As DEFCON said, the purpose was not nefarious: ""By exposing the cyber vulnerabilities of these websites, young contestants will compete for prizes in a number of categories, including proposing the best plan to defend the Secretary of State websites from cyber attacks."" But to be clear: While the websites might report election results and have other voting information, they are not used to receive or count actual votes. One of the articles, from PBS Newshour, said an 11-year-old boy hacked into a version of the Florida state election website and changed voting results in under 10 minutes. And an 11-year-old girl tripled the number of votes on the same site in about 15 minutes. In other words, hacking into a state’s election website could cause confusion if results were manipulated. But that is not the same as hacking into an election system and actually changing votes. And with regard to how closely the hacked websites matched the actual websites, ProPublica published an article shortly after the DEFCON convention emphasizing that the websites hacked by the kids were not actual replicas of the state election websites.  ""Instead, students were working with look-alikes created for the event that had vulnerabilities they were coached to find,"" ProPublica said. ""Organizers provided them with cheat sheets, and adults walked the students through the challenges they would encounter."" Josh Franklin, an elections expert formerly at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and a speaker at DEFCON, was quoted as saying the websites were ""fake."" ""When I learned that they were not using exact copies and pains hadn’t been taken to more properly replicate the underlying infrastructure, I was definitely saddened,"" he said. Similarly, Vice.com reported after Gabbard’s interview that DEFCON organizers had given the participants ""clones"" of state election websites ""with vulnerabilities inserted by the organizers. In particular, the sites were designed to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, one of the most ancient—and yet still very common—hacks ever."" Gabbard said, ""There’s a hacking conference that’s held every year in Las Vegas, where I think a 14- or 15-year old-girl from Florida hacked into a replica of Florida’s election system in less than 15 minutes."" In less than 15 minutes, two 11-year-olds attending a 2018 hacking convention were able to hack into a website that was made to look similar to the website of the Florida Secretary of State’s Office that reports election results. Despite news reports that used terms such as replica and facsimile, the hacked site was not a copy of the Florida site and did not contain the same security features. Moreover, the site that the hackers meant to target does not include the system that is used for receiving and tabulating actual votes. Gabbard’s loose recollection could leave readers with the wrong impression about the vulnerability of Florida’s election system.

U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says 80 percent of Egyptians oppose receiving foreign aid from the United States
","
In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya and protests throughout the Middle East over the YouTube video that disparaged Mohammad, some critics of U.S. foreign policy have questioned the aid we give to such countries. One was Barry Hinckley, a Republican running against U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse.

A Sept. 14 story posted on 630WPRO.com reports: ""Hinckley said a poll conducted in Egypt revealed that 80% of Egyptians oppose receiving foreign aid from the United States.""

The story headlined ""Hinckley calls for elimination of U.S. aid to Libya, Pakistan, and Egypt,"" which Hinckley references on his Facebook page, quotes the candidate as saying, ""It makes absolutely zero sense to further burden our own economy to give billions of dollars to a country that doesn't even want it."" said Hinckley.

He said Whitehouse characterized the idea of cutting foreign aid to Egypt as a ""blunder."" ""I believe that it is a far greater blunder to continue sending billions of dollars to nations that violently attack American lives and property,"" Hinckley says in the story.

We gave Hinckley a False ruling in April when he asserted that President Obama gave $1.5 billion to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood (that's the amount of aid going to Egypt, most of it to the military), so we were interested in whether 80 percent of Egyptians really do want U.S. aid to stop.

We e-mailed Hinckley's campaign manager and spokesman, but didn't get a response.

So we went looking ourselves, and found a Gallup poll conducted in Egypt between Jan. 31 and Feb. 7. The key question: Do you favor or oppose the U.S. sending economic aid to Egypt?

The survey of 1,000 Egyptians, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points, found that 82 percent opposed U.S. aid, a rate that has been growing since Gallup began asking the question in April 2011, when 52 percent were opposed.

The survey also found that the results don't just apply to aid from the United States.

Opposition to aid from international organizations such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund went from a low of 32 percent in September 2011 up to 57 percent during the February 2012 survey. Opposition to aid from other Arab governments has been increasing as well, but not to the point where more Egyptians oppose it or support it. The rate of opposition went from 22 percent in September 2011 to 39 percent in the February poll.

Why the growing opposition?

Gallup said in its March 29, 2012, analysis that public antagonism toward the aid rose after non-government, pro-democracy groups from the United States and Europe, working in Egypt, were accused of illegally accepting foreign funds and trying to foster unrest.

As the Gallup report says, ""The murky circumstances and arrangements that resulted in the prosecution, travel limitations, and then sudden departure of U.S. citizens facing trial in Egypt has only inflamed Egyptians' sense of distrust and suspicion regarding such organizations and what U.S. funds mean for Egyptian sovereignty.""

Forty-three people from those groups, including some Egyptians, were accused of such things as paying activists to incite protests in Egypt to destabilize the country. The latest survey was done shortly after they sought refuge in the U.S. embassy and before many were allowed to leave the country after posting bail.

We also found a second study that asked the question in a different way but produced a similar response. That poll of 1,000 Eyptians, conducted March 19 to April 10 by the Pew Research Center, found that 61 percent said both U.S. military and economic aid have a harmful effect on Egypt. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.

Our ruling

Barry Hinckley, in raising questions about whether the United States should be giving foreign aid to countries such as Egypt, said that 80 percent of Egyptians oppose receiving foreign aid from the United States.

A Gallup poll taken in February shows that he's right in the ballpark.

We rate his statement as True.

"['Oregon', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Taxes', 'Yes on 79 ']","
Did the City of Portland make charging a real estate transfer tax a top priority this year?
","
The chief backers of Ballot Measure 79 submitted a voters’ pamphlet statement this summer brimming with reasons to enshrine a ban on real estate transfer taxes in the Oregon Constitution. The tax is already prohibited in Oregon, with the exception of Washington County, but advocates want to make sure the state doesn’t implement a tax or allow local governments to impose one.

The reasons put forth by the Oregon Association of Realtors basically boil down to this: Home prices are down, property taxes are high enough, and you don’t want another tax that would make it harder to buy or sell a home.   

The group also plants a bug of fear in tax haters with this: ""Politicians have considered the idea of charging or allowing multiple layers of transfer taxes each and every legislative session for the last decade, and in fact one of the state’s largest governments made charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year."" (our emphasis)

Obviously, we wanted to know which large government made charging this tax a priority. Who was it and what happened? (Was it the tax-happy city of Portland?) We contacted the Realtors’ association and received a response from Jon Coney, spokesman for the Yes on 79 campaign, previously known as Protect Oregon Homes.

It turns out the campaign was indeed talking about the city of Portland. As evidence that this large government body had ""made charging this tax"" a top priority this year, Coney shared a draft of the 2012 Legislative Agenda for the city of Portland. An agenda!

We got a copy of the final agenda. One of seven items on it was to ""strongly oppose any legislation that would preempt the City’s authority and support legislation that proposes to lift preemptions.""

Preemption, for those who don’t know, is when a superior government body regulates in a given area and pretty much trumps a lesser government’s ability to do the same. The state trumps cities, and the feds trump states.

Cities and counties generally dislike preemption, because it usually ties their ability to raise revenue, also known as taxes and fees. Two particularly vexing subject areas -- taxing cigarettes and alcohol, and levying real estate transfer fees -- are indeed specified as examples in the city’s 2012 legislative agenda. That’s all accurate.

But we asked Coney how supporting flexibility to be able to maybe one day pass a real estate transfer tax -- along with higher alcohol and cigarette taxes, if you follow the group’s reasoning -- is the same as making the imposition of such a tax a top priority this year? He said he didn’t want to get into a fight over semantics, but one leads to the other.

""It’s pretty clear for us, in 2012, putting this on their legislative agenda clearly is a strong signal that they want to pursue this taxing mechanism,"" Coney said.

Are the two acts one and the same? He said, ""It is our position that asking that the (prohibition) be lifted is essentially leading to the institution of the real estate tax.""

So this is the evidence the campaign provides for making the claim that the city of Portland made charging this tax a top priority this year: A legislative agenda in which the tax is given as an example among several examples on one issue out of seven. And by the way, legislation wasn’t even drafted. And the Realtors know this.

Maybe we missed talk of a real estate transfer tax somewhere? At a city council meeting at some point? Nope, the campaign can provide no other evidence. They can, however, point to previous legislative attempts, which got nowhere.

""I don’t remember it being raised,"" said Nick Fish, the city commissioner in charge of housing. ""It’s been on a laundry list of preemptions we object to on principle. Other than this campaign brought by Realtors, I don’t even remember a conversation about the real property tax in the last year or two.""

We asked Martha Pellegrino, lead lobbyist for the city of Portland, if the city would go ahead with a transfer tax if the prohibition were lifted. The answer is no, she said: ""Just because the state repeals a preemption of local authority does not mean that the City, or any other local government, would automatically act.""

We’re certain some of you don’t care what Pellegrino or Fish -- or any other government official says -- they will or won’t do. And it’s absolutely accurate to say that Portland officials could levy a tax on every transfer of property as soon as the pesky state prohibition is gone.

But the only evidence the campaign provides is a legislative agenda for a short legislative session in which no legislation was drafted. How does that translate into making ""charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year?"" It doesn’t. And that makes the statement both inaccurate and ridiculous.

We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCB3EC0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/25/Yes-on-79/did-city-portland-make-charging-real-estate-transf/

Mitt Romney surrogate Adam Hasner bashes Obama for not meeting with Netanyahu
","
With world leaders meeting at the United Nations in New York, the Mitt Romney campaign went after President Barack Obama, repeating the charge that he hasn’t supported Israel enough and isn’t taking threats from Iran seriously.

The specific talking point this time is that Obama refused to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The Romney campaign released this statement from Adam Hasner, a Florida Republican who’s running for the U.S. House of Representatives seat representing Congressional District 22 in Broward and Palm Beach counties. Hasner, a former state House majority leader, is a Jewish surrogate for Romney.

""Now we know why President Obama decided not to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York next week: because the president has decided to ‘block out any noise that’s out there’ about the threat a nuclear Iran would pose to Israel,"" Hasner said, adding that the snub was ""an absolute insult"" and ""no way to treat our friends around the world."" (The statement says ""next week,"" but the meetings are actually happening this week.)

We have heard conflicting reports about whether Obama jilted Netanyahu, so we decided to look into the matter. 
A meeting in New York?

We found several news stories -- based on anonymous sources -- that said Netanyahu’s team asked for a meeting between the two leaders and was rejected. The White House responded on the record that the leaders couldn’t meet due to scheduling conflicts.  

The back-and forth started Sept. 11, 2012, when the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the White House declined Israel’s request for a meeting during the U.N. conference.

""An official in Jerusalem said that the Prime Minister's Office sent the White House a message stating that although Netanyahu will spend only two and a half days on U.S. soil, he is interested in meeting Obama and is willing to travel to the U.S. capital specifically for that purpose. The official added that the White House rejected the request and said that at this time Obama's schedule does not allow for a meeting.""

Haaretz contrasted those comments with statements from White House National Security Council Spokesman Tommy Vietor saying the leaders were not scheduled to be in New York the same day.

Reuters also reported that the White House rejected a request by Netanyahu to meet: ""An Israeli official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Netanyahu's aides had asked for a meeting when he visits United Nations this month, and ‘the White House has got back to us and said it appears a meeting is not possible. It said that the president's schedule will not permit that.’"" (The Romney campaign referred us to the Reuters story when we asked for evidence; Hasner’s campaign pointed us to a longer version of the Reuters article as well as others.)

Reuters also reported that Vietor ""denied that Netanyahu's request had been spurned, insisting instead that the two leaders were attending the General Assembly on different days and would not be in New York at the same time.""

The brouhaha over the alleged snub led Obama and Netanyahu to speak for an hour by telephone on Sept. 11. The White House issued a statement that night that the two leaders ""reaffirmed that they are united in their determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and agreed to continue their close consultations going forward."" The statement also said: ""Contrary to reports in the press, there was never a request for Prime Minister Netanyahu to meet with President Obama in Washington, nor was a request for a meeting ever denied."" We’ll note that statement didn’t specifically address whether there was a request for a meeting in New York.

The next day, White House spokesman Jay Carney said this of an alleged snub: ""The president will be in New York at the United Nations General Assembly early in that week; the prime minister does not arrive until later in that week. There was not logistically an opportunity for the two leaders to meet in New York. A meeting was never requested in Washington, therefore it could not have been denied.""

We found many similar news reports from other news outlets. The New York Times, for example, reported that Netanyahu’s office had requested a meeting sometime during the United Nations General Assembly, but that it wasn’t possible due to scheduling. According to the article, the White House said that after ""a possible New York encounter was ruled out, Mr. Netanyahu did not request a meeting in Washington"" and that the scheduling conflict ""had been conveyed to Israel long ago.""

In response to questions from PolitiFact, Vietor emailed us: ""Bottom line is that Obama is in New York Monday and Tuesday of this week. Netanyahu is here Thursday (and) Friday because of the holidays,"" he wrote, referring to Yom Kippur, which starts Tuesday night and continues Wednesday. ""In other words, they're not in the city at the same time, which makes having a meeting a logistical challenge.""

On Thursday, Obama will be campaigning in Virginia Beach, Va. His schedule for Friday has not yet been made public.

We emailed Vietor several questions, asking which Israeli officials requested a meeting with Obama and when Israel has made additional attempts at a face-to-face get together. We did not get a response. 
'Blocking out noise'?

Much has been written about the scheduling of a meeting that didn’t happen. This occurred during a close presidential election in which both parties are fighting for Jewish voters.

Although about three of every four Jewish voters supported Obama in 2008, Republicans hope to cut into that edge in swing states such as Florida. And that’s why we see the ongoing war about semantics and symbolic issues as both sides profess their love for Israel. (Read some of our previous fact-checks about Israel during this campaign here and here and here and here.)

Hasner noted in his statement the president has decided to ‘block out any noise that’s out there’ about the threat a nuclear Iran would pose to Israel."" That was a reference to Obama’s 60 Minutes interview. Host Steve Kroft asked Obama if he was getting pressure from Netanyahu ""to make up your mind to use military force in Iran.""

Obama replied, in part, ""When it comes to our national security decisions, any pressure that I feel is simply to do what’s right for the American people. And I am going to block out any noise that’s out there. Now I feel an obligation, not pressure but obligation, to make sure that we’re in close consultation with the Israelis on these issues because it affects them deeply. They’re one of our closest allies in the region. And we’ve got an Iranian regime that has said horrible things that directly threaten Israel’s existence.""

We asked Aaron David Miller, a former State Department adviser on Arab-Israeli affairs for Democrat and Republican Secretaries of State, about the non-meeting. (He wrote an article, ""When Bibi Didn’t Meet Barack."")

""This in my view wasn’t smart politics on Obama’s part,"" Miller said in an email. ""He’s running for re-election and it could be close. Meeting with Netanyahu is a no-brainer. Why hand the Republicans a hammer?""

But Miller said that if the two leaders had met in New York, he doesn’t believe that it would have led to any policy change by the United States or Israel about Iran. It simply would have avoided it becoming an issue that Obama didn’t meet with Netanyahu.

""Nothing would have come of it,"" he said.

Our ruling

Hasner said, ""President Obama decided not to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York.""

Obama was in New York on Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday is the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, and Netanyahu will be in New York on Thursday and Friday. Obama is campaigning in Virginia on Thursday, and his schedule for Friday has not yet been released.

So a meeting with Netanyahu didn’t fit Obama’s schedule. However, he is the president of the United States, and at the end of the day he determines his schedule. The White House has confirmed that a scheduling conflict prevented a meeting. That's not quite refusal, but he is not meeting with Netanyahu in New York, so on some level he made the decision.

We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC7C9C0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/25/adam-hasner/mitt-romney-surrogate-adam-hasner-obama-meeting/

Anti-tax group says Obama sent $450 million to China to build Texas wind farm
","
In the battleground state of Florida, critics of President Obama have accused him not simply of spending billions in stimulus money to no good effect but actually using that money to give a leg up to America’s economic rivals. Americans for Tax Reform has revived an old charge that Obama sent $450 million to create jobs in China.

Americans for Tax Reform -- an anti-tax group whose founder, Grover Norquist, is famous for arguing for a government so small it could be drowned in a bathtub -- mailed a flyer to Florida voters that showed a stack of hundred dollar bills being blown in a graceful arc across the globe to land in a very red China. On the reverse side, it said ""Obama's massive spending includes giving millions to a Chinese company to build a wind farm in Texas. The Chinese company is expected to receive $450 million in U.S. taxpayer money. More jobs in China .. fewer jobs here.""

We’ve looked at this sort of claim before and in this fact check, we examine whether Obama sent $450 million to China to build a wind farm in Texas.

 Promoting alternative energy under the stimulus

Americans for Tax Reform told us it based this claim on an ABC News report from 2010. In that story, ABC pointed out that the bulk of the stimulus dollars spent on wind and solar projects went to foreign companies.

With the twin goals of diversifying the country’s energy supply and boosting a domestic alternative energy industry, the Obama administration used the stimulus to expand a program that awarded tax credits for wind and solar projects once they came online and produced power.

The tax credits were handed out as grants that could cover up to 30 percent of the construction costs. We checked on the latest numbers and found that as of 2011, some $9.8 billion went to fund over 300 wind farms around the country.

The ABC report relied heavily on the work of Russ Choma, who at the time was a journalist with the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a project at American University. Choma noted that foreign companies received over 60 percent of the alternative energy grants. As we’ll explain in a moment, that does not tell us how much of that money went overseas.

Right now, our main focus is that wind farm in Texas built with Chinese towers and turbines. The ABC report spoke of it this way, ""Perhaps the most controversial wind project is one that has yet to receive stimulus money."" It then goes on to say that a reporter visited the vacant offices of the Chinese firm that allegedly was providing the turbines.

So Americans for Tax Reform relied on an article that said the project had not been funded and gave some evidence that hinted strongly that the project was not very active.

In fact, by late 2010, it was clear that this particular Texas wind farm had never gone beyond the idea stage. In 2012, Liz Salerno, director of industry data and analysis for the trade group American Wind Energy Association, confirmed that. Salerno tracks wind projects across the country.

""The companies held a press conference at the National Press Club in 2010,"" Salerno said. ""They have made no progress since that announcement.""

PolitiFact Ohio wrote a piece making the same point in 2012.

Let’s return briefly to the question of whether stimulus dollars have benefited foreign companies. The short answer is, yes but how much is unclear. Choma, the investigative reporter, noted that the larger overseas firms have American plants that make the blades and other components that were used in U.S. wind farms. Choma wrote that tracking the dollars would be a massive undertaking.

""I can't say how many of the turbines built by American manufacturers were overseas, and how many of the turbines built by foreign manufacturers were built here,"" Choma said.

To choose just one example, a wind farm in Alaska has a distinct multi-national flavor. The turbines come from GE, the blades from Brazil, the generators come from Southern California, the central hubs from the Florida Panhandle and the towers from China.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory reported that the grant program added between 44,000 to 66,000 jobs  in the wind energy sector each year from 2009 to 2011. Employment peaked in 2009 when new construction was at its height. It has since fallen and the wind power industry is poised for further declines if government tax credits are not renewed beyond 2013.

 Our ruling

The Americans for Tax Reform flyer said that Obama sent $450 million to China to build a wind farm in Texas.

The wind farm was never built, the project sponsors never applied for government funds and never received any.

These facts have been well known for at least two years and were publicly reported several times. The source cited by Americans for Tax Reform noted that the project had not been funded.

The flyer spreads a discredited claim. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA5E280>],/factchecks/2012/sep/25/americans-tax-reform/anti-tax-group-says-obama-sent-450-million-china-b/
"['Corrections and Updates', 'Debt', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
UPDATED: Rick Perry says Obama has added $16 trillion to federal debt
","
Clarification, 5:34 p.m., Oct. 2, 2012: A reader alerted us to an error in the original version of this article, which incorrectly presented the figure for public debt as the level of intragovernmental debt and vice-versa. The article has been amended. The rating of the statement is unaffected. 
Gov. Rick Perry posted a photo the other day showing ""$16 trillion"" inked across the back of his hands. In a Sept. 20, 2012, Twitter post linking to the photo, Perry said: ""Since @BarackObama has forgotten how much he's added to national debt #ForAll our kids to pay off.""

That day, the federal debt exceeded $16 trillion, according to the Treasury’s Debt to the Penny calculator. That total counted $4.8 trillion in intragovernmental debt and $11.3 trillion in public debt, money borrowed from outside the government.

By email, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us Perry’s tweet was reminding the president of the debt total ""since he couldn’t seem to remember it a few days ago."" She was referring to Obama’s Sept. 18, 2012, appearance on CBS-TV’s ""Late Show with David Letterman.""

In the relevant segment, Letterman mentioned the live-action national debt clock featured at the Republican National Convention and asked Obama what it was about. Obama said factors feeding the debt included two wars not funded up front, renewed federal tax cuts and expenditures reacting to the financial crisis of 2008-09.

Letterman, returning to the debt clock, then asked: ""Now, do you remember what that number was? Was it $10 trillion?""

""No,"" Obama replied, ""I don’t remember what the number was, precisely.’""

Asked if ""we"" should be scared by the rising debt, Obama said: ""We don’t have to worry about it (the debt) short-term"" due to low U.S. interest rates, though he called the debt a medium-to-long-term problem.

Frazier’s email also said Obama has added about $5 trillion to the debt in less than four years. The increase since Obama became president in January 2009 is about $5.4 trillion, compared to the $10.6 trillion in debt on his inauguration day, Jan. 20, 2009.

While rating Mostly True a June 2012 claim by Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Paul Sadler that the national debt doubled while George W. Bush was president, we obtained a spreadsheet from Oregon State University political scientist Robert Sahr showing changes in the debt since 1940. Sahr later provided a chart showing changes in the public debt under each president since Harry Truman.

We asked Frazier if Perry’s tweet was intended to saddle Obama with responsibility for all the debt.

If ""you want to split hairs, go right ahead,"" Frazier replied. ""I've explained to you the intent behind the governor’s tweet... It is widely known that the national debt is"" $16 trillion ""and climbing and that is what the governor was referring to. At least he recognizes the real figure, while President Obama is either oblivious or chooses to ignore it.""

Our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin recently rated as False a claim by U.S. Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., that Obama had built ""this $16 trillion debt."" After that, PolitiFact Ohio rated as False a statement by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, that the president ""went on a stimulus-fueled spending binge that stuck every American man, woman, and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion national debt."" Both entities said the debt had grown to $16 trillion not just because of Obama's actions, but also due to actions taken by present and past presidents and Congresses.
   
Our rating
   
We read Perry’s two-handed tweet as saying Obama has added $16 trillion to the national debt.

But nearly two thirds of that unprecedented total accumulated before Obama became president. To be fair, too, changes in the debt cannot be laid on any president alone. Actions by members of both parties, over years, helped build the debt.

We rate Perry’s statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA56EC0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/25/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-has-added-16-trillion-federa/
"['National', 'Education', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney, in Spanish-language ad, says college costs are up 25 percent under Barack Obama
","
In a recent Spanish-language television ad, Mitt Romney criticizes President Barack Obama’s record on higher education.

A translation provided by the campaign has the narrator saying, ""Four years ago, Hispanics hoped Democrats would get an ‘A’ in improving our education. The reality is that more than 75 percent of the population thinks that college is not affordable. Tuition costs have increased 25 percent under Obama and the Democrats, and total student debt has reached a trillion dollars."" After a clip of Obama saying he wants to be held accountable on education, the narrator continues in Spanish, ""When it comes to education, Obama and the Democrats have failed our kids.""

We first checked with the Romney campaign, which said the figure came from the College Board, which produces an annual study of college costs.

The College Board found that for the school-year 2008-2009, the average published tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year colleges and universities was $6,585. By the 2011-2012 school year, it stood at $8,244. That’s an increase of slightly over 25 percent. So the claim has a grain of statistical truth.

But there are several other issues to consider.

The first one has to do with the translation. The exact words the narrator says are, ""Los costos han subido 25 por ciento por los Demócratas,"" while the screen says, ""25% costos de universidad,"" with a large arrow pointing upward. While it’s clear that the ad is saying that ""costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats,"" it’s less clear whether the ""costs"" in question are tuition alone or tuition plus room and board.

The distinction makes a difference. Tuition and fees plus room and board rose from $14,333 to $17,131 over the same period. That’s just under a 20 percent increase, short of the 25 percent claimed in the ad.

Because of the uncertainty over the translation, we won’t count this as a strike against the ad’s accuracy. But other issues are more problematic:

• The tuition figure is only for in-state students at public universities. The College Board also offered data for other types of schools, and each was smaller than 25 percent.

Here's how much tuition and fees increased for other situations:

* Public, four-year institutions -- up 19 percent.
* Public, two-year colleges -- up 23 percent
* Private, four-year institutions -- up 13 percent;
* For-profit institutions -- up 11 percent.

So, the Romney campaign was cherry-picking by using the 25 percent figure.

• The 25 percent figure doesn’t adjust for inflation. The College Board data cited in the ad does not adjust for inflation. But Department of Education statistics do.

According to the Education Department, inflation-adjusted costs (tuition, room and board) for all institutions were $17,257 in 2008-2009 and $18,133 in 2010-2011. That’s a 5 percent increase over two years or, extrapolating out to 2011-2012, an increase of between 7 percent and 8 percent over the same time period that the ad is talking about. Certain sectors rose faster than others -- public, four-year institutions rose by 12 percent once you extrapolate out to the full period. But even this increase is well below 25 percent.

• The ad uses ""published"" rates, not ""net costs."" Universities’ published rates are like the sticker prices on cars. They are the prices before they are offset by financial aid. To students and parents, it’s actually the net cost that matters most.

Due in part to financial aid programs and tax credits in Obama’s economic stimulus package, the net cost for the average student at a private, four-year institution has actually declined since 2008-2009, from $13,620 to $12,970 -- a drop of 5 percent. At public, four-year institutions, in-state students saw the net price rise from $2,310 to $2,490, an increase of 8 percent -- less than the 25 percent jump cited in the ad.

• Who gets the blame for rising college costs? The escalating cost of college is nothing new -- it’s been going on for years. In fact, if you look at the trends in the inflation-adjusted Education Department data for all institutions, the rates of growth under Obama -- 2.2 percent and 2.7 percent in the years where data is available -- are lower than the rates of increase in six of the preceding eight years under President George W. Bush.

Of course, the president of the United States doesn’t set college prices. Who does? A combination of the marketplace, private universities and the state-government officials such as governors and legislatures who set state subsidies for public institutions. And with the Republicans controlling a significant majority of governorships and state legislatures since 2010, as well as a sizable minority of governorships and legislatures prior to 2010, the GOP bears some responsibility as well.

And as we’ve noted, the one area in which Obama had a degree of control over -- federal aid to students -- his actions have helped bring down the net cost of college.

Our ruling

The ad claims that ""costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats."" It’s true that the published costs for one type of college and one type of student have risen by 25 percent since Obama took office, but other data shows a smaller rise for tuition and fees, particularly when inflation is taken into account.

Even for the college costs that have risen, the Romney campaign does not provide sufficient proof to link that rise to Obama. Governors and legislatures bear far more responsibility for rising prices at public universities, and to the extent Obama has had any effect, it has been to help slow or even decrease the cost burden through federal assistance to students. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB25400>],/factchecks/2012/sep/25/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-spanish-language-ad-says-college-costs/

John Sharp says scientists agree a future ‘event’ will kill 80 million to 90 million worldwide
","
On June 18, 2012, the United States announced a $285 million grant to the Texas A&M University System to create one of three U.S. biosecurity centers.

In a speech in Austin that day, system Chancellor John Sharp said the A&M center will be able to quickly make vaccines to respond to a looming threat: ""There is going to be, sometime in the future, an event that will kill, according to scientists and with today’s population, somewhere between 80 and 90 million people on this earth.""

That’s an ominous death toll, and we wondered how sure scientists are that such a devastating outbreak is approaching.

When we contacted the A&M System and asked for Sharp’s backup information, spokesman Thomas Graham set up a conference call for us with Scott Lillibridge, the deputy principal investigator for A&M’s Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, who is a professor of epidemiology at the Texas A&M Health Science Center and former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s bioterrorism program.

Lillibridge defined pandemic for us: an event in which multiple epidemics break out around the globe at the same time.

""It’s certain that we’ll have another pandemic sometime,"" he said. ""And we just don’t know when or how serious it will be.""

Others agree. We reviewed news stories and spoke by phone and email with Kumanan Wilson of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, author of a February 2012 article on estimating flu pandemic deaths in the European Journal of Public Health, and University of Texas professor of biology and statistics Lauren Meyers.

Meyers told us, ""I would say it’s a certainty we will get new strains of virus flu that emerge in human populations and cause widespread illness."" Wilson said, ""The consensus is yes, there will be regular pandemics.""

In a Sept. 19, 2011, news story on a conference of the European Scientific Working Group on Influenza, Scientific American quoted University of Virginia School of Medicine professor Frederick Hayden: ""What is clear is that (the next flu pandemic) is when, not if."" The story described his statement as ""one of many proclamations of coming plague during the meeting that was tinged with just enough urgency to generate attention (and research funding) but not ignite an all-out panic.""

The World Health Organization’s most recent Global Vaccine Action Plan referred to preparing for ""the next pandemic,"" though noting that it’s ""impossible to predict the exact timing or nature of a future pandemic.""

""In an influenza pandemic, most of the world’s population will be highly susceptible to the virus infection and it is conceivable that the virus will spread rapidly,"" the 2006 plan said.

""At the present time, if an influenza pandemic were to occur, the potential vaccine supply would fall several billion doses short of the amount needed to provide protection to the global population.""

The plan’s executive summary concludes, ""Action must start now – this fact cannot be emphasized strongly enough – action must start now if the world is to prepare itself in the shortest possible time for a potential influenza pandemic."" WHO is working on an updated plan, according to its web site.

That degree of preparation, experts told us, is one of the largest elements in determining how many people will die. Other factors include how the contagion spreads, how quickly it kills, how early it’s detected and how coordinated the medical response is.

But preparation is essential because once a major outbreak begins, there’s no time to manufacture enough of the right vaccine.

Each flu season, Lillibridge said, the CDC and counterparts around the world track fast-changing viruses to predict which vaccines will be most needed.

CDC spokesman Tom Skinner told us by phone that once the prediction is made, the CDC sends a ""seed"" virus to vaccine manufacturers. It takes five months to produce and ship the vaccines, he said.

Technology, communication and distribution give today’s medics a huge advantage over those who faced the 1918-19  ""Spanish flu"" pandemic, the event both Sharp and Lillibridge used to frame the current threat. That global outbreak was ""the mother of them all,"" said a Nov. 26, 2007, Guardian (UK) news story that listed the death tolls for the 20th century’s three flu pandemics: ""The 1968-69 Hong Kong flu killed up to a million people globally, the 1957-58 Asian flu killed up to 1.5 million"" and the Spanish flu killed ""around 40 million"" -- more than World War I, the story said.

All were caused, according to a June 22, 2012, Bloomberg news story, by flu viruses that started with animals, mixed with human flu and then mutated into new strains that humans weren’t immune to.

So was 2009’s pandemic of H1N1 ""swine flu,"" which according to the World Health Organization proved less deadly than had been feared, killing about 16,000 people worldwide. Through ""pure good luck,"" said an Aug. 10, 2010, WHO report, the mutating virus didn’t develop resistance to the vaccine or change into a more deadly form. 
As to the estimated death toll of a future pandemic, Lillibridge told us, ""The chancellor is right in the ballpark."" 
Later, through an A&M center spokeswoman, Lillibridge said that if a virus as deadly as the 1918 strain broke out, ""assuming the same mortality rate today, and a world population of 6.9 billion, that is about 193 million deaths.""

Meyer agreed that the range Sharp gave, 80 million to 90 million deaths, is plausible, noting that the Spanish flu might have killed that many even with the world’s much smaller population at the time. ""But if and when we get one as deadly as 1918, I think there’s quite a bit of uncertainty,"" she said. 
However, Wilson expressed skepticism as to the 80 million to 90 million range: ""Officials said the same this time around (the 2009 pandemic) with the most conservative estimates being grossly higher than the actual death toll.""

Wilson’s article in the February 2012 issue of the European Journal of Public Health rounded up several of those estimates: 


Our ruling

Sharp said scientists predict ""sometime in the future, an event that will kill … somewhere between 80 and 90 million people.""

Scientists agree another pandemic is coming. However, they say the number of deaths will depend on many variables -- early detection, coordinated response and luck, to name a few -- and there is not uniform agreement among scientists that 80 million to 90 million people would die. We rate Sharp’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDE2B40>],/factchecks/2012/sep/25/john-sharp/john-sharp-says-scientists-agree-future-event-will/

Super PAC claims Obama adviser took money from company with Iran ties
","
There’s the guilt-by-association attack ad -- and then there’s the recent TV ad from Secure America Now, a super PAC that ties President Barack Obama to his adviser David Plouffe’s association with a company with ties to Iran.

Got that?

Over darkened photographs of Obama and Plouffe, a narrator intones:
  

We’ll leave the question of trust to you. But we figured we would get to the bottom of the ad’s central claim, whether Plouffe took money from a ""joint venture partner"" of an Iranian cellular company.

 ‘Large piles of cash’ 
Plouffe, who famously managed Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, gave paid speeches around the world before he joined the White House as a senior adviser after the 2010 midterm elections. 
Secure America Now is the political arm of a similarly named nonprofit that says it supports ""policies that will protect our nation against terrorist infiltration, attack, and capitulation to our enemies."" 
It has previously accused Obama of softness on Iran, a nation  under U.S. sanctions for supporting terrorism and attempting to develop nuclear weapons.

We reached out to the group, but didn’t hear back. But the ad itself cites sources.

The text relies heavily on the words of Glenn Greenwald, a Guardian columnist who used to write for progressive news site Salon. Greenwald wrote in reaction to an Aug. 5, 2012, Washington Post story.

The Post piece detailed how Plouffe’s 2011 financial disclosure showed he had been paid $100,000 by MTN Nigeria. The White House explained to the Post that Plouffe traveled to Lagos, Nigeria, for two speeches in December 2010, just before he joined the Obama administration as a senior adviser.

The Nigerian cell phone service provider is part of South African conglomerate MTN Group, which also owns 49 percent of an Iranian subsidiary, MTN Irancell. The South African company offers cell service through subsidiaries in Africa and the Middle East.

Greenwald argued the scandal of the speaking fees wasn’t that they were ""tainted by virtue of a connection to the Evil Persian Regime,"" something that he found ""frivolous and cynical, just part of the ongoing Washington fear-mongering orgy over Iran.""

Rather, he saw them as an example of utterly typical — though deplorable — Washington influence-peddling.

""David Plouffe — who has spent his entire career working in Washington as a political operative — has become a very rich man by converting into large piles of cash the only real asset he has: his influence in and access to the Obama White House and the Democratic Party,"" he wrote.

Sound familiar?

We asked Greenwald whether he thought the ad accurately characterized his work.

""I think the parts about Plouffe are completely accurate,"" he said. ""I think $100,000 for a couple of short speeches is a ‘large pile of cash’ in anyone's eyes.""

But he told us he’s not an expert on the MTN Group ""or what it and its subsidiaries are doing with Iran."" (And, in fact, for that claim the ad relied on a different source.) Greenwald said he relied on the government sources quoted in the Post article.

The Post reported that a Treasury undersecretary had told Turkish officials in 2006 that Irancell was ""fully owned"" by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. That wasn’t public knowledge until an infamous release of State Department cables by WikiLeaks in 2010-11.

 White House response

White House spokesman Eric Schultz called the ad ""a complete distortion of the facts.""

He argued, among other things:

• Plouffe didn’t directly profit from a ""joint venture partner"" of an Iranian company, as the ad said, but from its Nigerian subsidiary.

• It was misleading to say that the U.S. government described Irancell as ""fully owned"" by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps., because that detail was in an as-yet unreleased State Department cable. Meanwhile, prominent advocacy groups hadn’t directly taken up the issue of MTN Group’s involvement in Iran when Plouffe spoke. That started in 2012.

It’s fair to note that the ad makes it sound as though Plouffe was paid by MTN Group, when he in fact spoke for MTN Nigeria.

But about the Revolutionary Guard relationship, we wondered: What could Plouffe (or the lawyer  he’s said to have consulted) have learned about MTN Nigeria and its parent company in 2010?

Plenty, as it turns out.

We spent a few minutes with subscription news database Nexis. Searching just for ""MTN Group"" for articles published before December 2010, we quickly found a description of the company that mentioned Iran in a November 2010 news release: 
With the same search, we turned up a Business Process Management Journal article describing MTN Irancell’s ownership as ""comprised of two shareholders who are the Iran Electronic Development Company (IEDC) and MTN International (Mauritius) Limited. IEDC currently has two key shareholders: Iran Electronic Industries, known as SAIRAN and Mostazafan Foundation, known as Bonyad.""

If Plouffe or his lawyer had run those names through a publicly searchable Treasury database, they would have found that Iran Electronic Industries was under U.S. sanctions for being a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction, known for its role in Iran’s missile program. A Treasury news release in 2008 said it offered ""a diversified range of military products including electro-optics and lasers, communication equipment, telecommunication security equipment, electronic warfare equipment, new and refurbished radar tubes, and missile launchers.""

So, an MTN Irancell investor had already been labeled — that’s right — a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction.

The Iran connection in hand, a Google search turned up more, such as this 2008 New York Times article about MTN Group’s challenges with U.S. sanctions as it rapidly expanded its Iranian business.

In other words, quick searches turned up red flags aplenty, well in advance of WikiLeaks’ release or advocacy groups’ publicity.

We should note these are political, more than legal, red flags — transactions are prohibited between Americans and blocked companies, but Plouffe wouldn’t run afoul of the law taking money from a separate subsidiary of a company with an Iranian connection.

But a political issue is precisely what this ad suggests.

And even White House press briefings from the summer before Plouffe’s speeches would have tipped him off to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s use of front companies and expanding reach into Iran’s economy.

As the administration announced new Iran sanctions in June 2010, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence Stuart Levey noted the Iranian Revolutionary Guard had ""taken over broad portions of the Iranian economy."" Meanwhile, he expected Iran would ""scramble to identify workarounds, hiding behind front companies, doctoring wire transfers, falsifying shipping documents.""

 Our ruling

Secure America Now’s ad claims that Plouffe took ""large piles of cash"" from a joint venture partner of a company owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. In reality, he took $100,000 for two speeches from a Nigerian subsidiary of that ""joint venture partner,"" and the Iranian company’s ownership wasn’t yet crystal clear. But there were plenty of red flags, if Plouffe had looked for them, that his speaking trip in retrospect might not look so politically savvy. For example, a key Irancell shareholder was already labeled a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB5EC00>],/factchecks/2012/sep/25/secure-america-now/super-pac-claims-obama-adviser-took-money-company-/

NRA attacks Bill Nelson's vote on a gun ban
","
A National Rifle Association website fires several shots at U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson’s voting record. The NRA has given an ""F"" to Nelson and an ""A"" to his opponent U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers.

One of the attacks on the website says: ""Bill Nelson voted for a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms, which included many popular hunting and target rifles.""

In this fact-check, we wanted to explore if the NRA accurately described Nelson’s vote on a gun ban. The attack relates to a 2004 vote Nelson took in favor of extending the assault weapons ban of 1994. The vote to extend it came in the form of an amendment that passed the Senate 52-47 on March 2, 2004. 
The amendment was to a bill to prohibit civil lawsuits from being brought against gun manufacturers and distributors for damages from misuse of firearms. The overall bill overwhelmingly was defeated 8-90 with Nelson voting ""no"" in the majority -- so that meant the effort to extend the ban also failed.

But did the assault weapons ban that Nelson wanted extend to millions of commonly owned firearms, including those used by hunters?

Clinton signed assault weapons ban in 1994

The original assault weapons ban of 1994 prohibited the manufacture or possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and banned guns that had two listed military-style features. The law only applied to newly manufactured weapons, grandfathering in millions of guns.

The bill also contained a list of more than 600 hunting or sporting shotguns or rifles that remained legal.

The law expired in 2004 after attempts in Congress to renew it failed. The Violence Policy Center warned that simply renewing the ban wouldn’t be enough, because manufacturers found ways around the law by making some cosmetic changes to create ""after-ban"" models.

The NRA declined our request to provide documentation to support their claim that the law resulted in a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms including popular hunting firearms.

But the NRA did provide some documentation to PolitiFact Wisconsin that fact-checked an NRA radio ad attacking Democrat Tom Barrett, who ultimately lost his recall challenge against Republican Gov. Scott Walker. The NRA said when Barrett was in Congress, he ""voted to ban 15 different kinds of guns, even a lot of common deer rifles."" PolitiFact Wisconsin ruled that claim Mostly False.

The NRA cited newspaper and magazine articles from the late 1980s and early 1990s. The articles showed that some deer hunters used weapons targeted by the ban, but the articles were largely anecdotal and deer hunting experts said the banned weapons were not commonly used for deer hunting when the ban became law in 1994.

ATF data and experts on the ban

Data from the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms about the number of guns manufactured in the U.S showed a drop during the lifetime of the ban from about 5.1 million in 1994 to 3.1 million in 2004. (Years after the ban expired, it soared to about 5.5 million in 2010.)

But the ATF doesn’t have categories for guns by their intended use (for hunting versus crime, for example) but instead shows it by pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns and a smaller category for miscellaneous. During the ban the number of manufactured pistols, revolvers and shotguns dropped considerably while the number of rifles increased slightly.

The other research we found focused on the impact on crime or the availability of assault weapons -- not about the impact for hunters.

We interviewed experts about the assault weapons ban including Daniel Vice, an attorney at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and Kristen Rand, Legislative Director for the Violence Policy Center -- two groups that fight gun violence and are often on the opposite side of the NRA. (When the assault ban came up for renewal, the Brady Center supported continuing it, while the VPC argued that the ban was flawed and didn’t go far enough.)

We also interviewed Christopher S. Koper, an associate professor at George Mason University. All three of our experts disagreed with the NRA’s claim.

Since Nelson’s 2004 vote was simply to extend the ban, it couldn’t have banned ""millions of commonly owned firearms"" as the NRA claimed, Vice said in an email. The 1994 ban ""only banned the sale or possession of newly manufactured guns,"" not guns already owned by people.

Also, the ban specifically exempted hundreds of hunting weapons by name, Vice said.

Koper, the professor who wrote a report about the ban for the DOJ, said that the NRA’s claim is misleading. The purpose of the ban was to restrict weapons with multiple military-style features which were less appropriate for hunting purposes. And the list of hundreds of firearms that were exempted, ""were deemed to be more appropriate for hunting."" Also, gun manufacturers continued to make weapons very similar to the banned weapons by removing some or all of the military-style features, allowing sport shooters to get similar substitutes in many cases.

Nelson’s response

Nelson has long supported a ban on assault weapons, including while in Congress in the 1980s. In 1990, when he was running for governor, Nelson made his call for a state assault weapons ban a focus of his campaign even as he said he still supported gun rights.

""I'm for the constitutional right to bear arms,"" Nelson said then. ""I'm a hunter and so is my son.""

But Nelson said youngsters were taking submachine guns to school, and Colombian drug lords were buying their weapons in Florida.

At campaign stops in 1990, Nelson waved an AK-47 over his head and said that a campaign aide was able to buy buy an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle in less than 10 minutes at a Miami gun store.

A spokesman for Nelson’s Senate office, Bryan Gulley, cited some more recent examples of Nelson’s pro-gun votes: He voted for an amendment to permit Amtrak passengers to transport guns in checked baggage and for an amendment to allow individuals to possess firearms in the national parks in 2009.

Our ruling 
The NRA said that ""Bill Nelson voted for a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms, which included many popular hunting and target rifles.""

In 2004, Nelson voted to extend the 1994 assault weapons ban.

Yes, some hunters used the types of firearms that were then banned. But the ban applied to newly manufactured weapons, and gun makers quickly found ways to tweak banned guns to create ""after ban"" guns. Hunters or sportsmen still had plenty of choices -- literally hundreds since the ban explicitly listed more than 600 weapons used for hunting that remained legal.

Karen Handel seeks to set the record straight on Komen, Planned Parenthood in new book
","
Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel came out firing on all cylinders in her book, ""Planned Bullyhood.""

Handel, who most recently served as the former vice president of public policy at Susan G. Komen for the Cure, included criticisms of Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, state politics and decisions at Komen.

Included in the book is a detailed account of this year’s much-publicized controversy at the breast cancer nonprofit organization. In early February, Komen announced it would no longer make grants to organizations that were under local, state or federal investigation. Planned Parenthood, which received more than $600,000 annually from Komen to perform breast examinations and conduct breast health education at 19 of its centers, was facing an investigation by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., into whether the organization had violated a prohibition against using federal funds for abortion services. After a firestorm of criticism, Komen reversed its decision, and Handel resigned less than a week later.

Some critics suggested Handel was behind Komen’s policy decision. But in her book, Handel says Komen had considered ending the relationship with Planned Parenthood ""for at least a decade,"" as Komen restructured its grant model to focus on measurable outcomes to fighting breast cancer. That focus, she said, excluded much of what Planned Parenthood did.

In her book, Handel makes pointed statements regarding Planned Parenthood’s services, noting that the organization promoted itself as a provider of mammograms to poor women.  

""The truth is, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms,"" she wrote. ""Planned Parenthood refers women to mammography providers, serving as the middlewoman, if you will.""

We wondered whether this was true of the organization known for being a key player in women’s health issues. Does Planned Parenthood really not provide mammograms? And, if not, how does the organization handle the services? And does it receive or provide funding for the work?

The argument over mammography and other services at Planned Parenthood has been ongoing for several years. Much of the debate centers on a congressional push last year to cut funding to Planned Parenthood, which has been cited as the country’s leading abortion provider. The federal government pays Planned Parenthood about $75 million a year to offer cancer screenings, breast exams and other care to lower-income women. That money cannot be spent on abortion services. The funding cut, which passed the House, was shot down in the Senate. 

Organization President Cecile Richards denounced the cuts in February 2011 on HLN’s ""The Joy Behar Show."" During that interview, Richards said that if the bill to cut funding ever became law, millions of women in the country would lose access to health care, not to abortion services but to basic family planning services, such as mammograms and cancer screenings. 

Richards was immediately challenged on her statement by the California-based anti-abortion group Live Action, which secretly recorded phone conversations between an actress and employees at various Planned Parenthood clinics. The actress, supposedly seeking a mammogram, was told the service was not available and in some cases was referred elsewhere. Richards said her comments on Behar’s show were taken out of context.

So are mammograms on Planned Parenthood’s service menu? 

We asked, and in an email response, a spokeswoman for the organization said doctors and nurses at Planned Parenthood health centers provide clinical breast exams and refer patients to facilities with technicians for mammograms based on breast exams, age or family history. Planned Parenthood also refers women to breast specialists when a potential abnormality is found and follow-up tests are needed. And with the organization’s expanded breast health initiative, Planned Parenthood will be able to cover the cost of this specialized care for more women, the email said.

Handel’s statement that Planned Parenthood doesn’t provide mammograms and only refers clients for those services at other facilities is supported by the organization itself.

We rate the claim True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA45AC0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/25/karen-handel/karen-handel-seeks-set-record-straight-komen-plann/

Barack Obama said 'Fast and Furious' began under the Bush administration
","
President Barack Obama is far ahead with Hispanic voters, but he faced tough questions during a Univision interview at the University of Miami on Sept. 20, 2012.

Interviewer Jorge Ramos asked Obama about the controversial ""Fast and Furious"" program, in which federal agents allowed guns to be sold and brought into Mexico so they could trace the weapons. But the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) ended up losing track of some of the guns. Two were found at the crime scene where U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed on Dec. 14, 2010.

""I think it’s important for us to understand that the Fast and Furious program was a field-initiated program begun under the previous administration,"" Obama responded. ""When (Attorney General) Eric Holder found out about it, he discontinued it. We assigned an inspector general to do a thorough report that was just issued, confirming that in fact Eric Holder did not know about this, that he took prompt action and the people who did initiate this were held accountable.""

Several readers wrote to us that Fast and Furious did not start under President George W. Bush, so we decided to check it out.

A day before Obama’s Univision interview, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Inspector General released a 512-page report about Fast and Furious.

""Our review of Operation Fast and Furious and related matters revealed a series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment and management failures,"" the report noted.

The report also clearly shows that Fast and Furious began under the Obama administration, dating its inception to October 2009. (Obama took office in January 2009.) This directly contradicts Obama’s claim.

There is one mitigating factor, however: A program similar to Fast and Furious did go forward under the Bush administration in 2006 and 2007. That program, called Operation Wide Receiver, also attempted to track suspicious weapons. Allowing gun sales to go forward even when the ATF had probable cause to believe the sales were unlawful has come to be known as ""gun walking.""

The two operations -- Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver -- had some similarities, and both were run out of the ATF’s Phoenix Field Division. The inspector general explored both programs in depth and found similar problems.

""The risk to public safety was immediately evident in both investigations,"" the inspector general’s report states.

The White House told us that Obama was referring to the general practice of gun walking, which happened in both administrations. ""The President was referring to the flawed tactic of gun-walking, which despite Republicans efforts to politicize this issue, began under the previous administration and it was our attorney general who ended it,"" said White House spokesman Eric Schultz.

U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee, and Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued their own 211-page investigative report this summer. The investigations led House Republicans to hold Attorney General Holder in contempt for failing to satisfy their requests for documents. House Democrats walked out on the criminal contempt vote, which passed 255-67.

Our ruling

Obama said that the Fast and Furious program began ""under the previous administration."" That is not the case; Fast and Furious did begin during the time Obama held office.

Another similar program, called Operation Wide Receiver, did happen during the Bush administration, and a recent inspector general’s report criticized both operations as ineffective and seriously flawed.

But Operation Wide Receiver is not the same thing as the Fast and Furious program. We rate Obama’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC92AE40>],/factchecks/2012/sep/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-fast-and-furious-began-under-bus/

Obama says Romney could take away middle class tax deductions
","
President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are in a battle for the trust of the middle class. The group might be hard to define, but most Americans say they are part of it, and many swing voters fall into it. Accordingly, both camps roll out the term frequently in their campaign ads.

The Obama campaign has a new ad called ""Pay the bills."" It features a woman named Christie who describes a very ordinary life: 
Christie: ""I do the laundry. I pay the bills. I make sure my kids are fed and rested and healthy."" 
Announcer: ""Moms like Christie would be stretched even more under Mitt Romney. To fund his tax cuts for millionaires, Romney could take away middle-class deductions for child care, mortgages and college tuition."" 
Christie: ""Mitt Romney? He’s so focused on big business, and tax cuts for the wealthy. It seems like his answers to middle-class America is just ‘tough luck.’"" 
  
Democrats have been attacking Romney’s tax plan since the summer. It was a favored target during the Democratic convention.

The claim in this new ad is more specific than some others we’ve looked at. Here, we’ll examine the premise that Romney’s plan could take away middle-class deductions for child care, mortgages and college tuition.

To begin with, we’ll note that ""could"" is a very open-ended word. Many things ""could"" happen but that doesn’t mean they are likely to. The ad’s focus on some theoretical possibility should be contrasted against Romney’s promise that he will not raise taxes on the middle class or touch their tax deductions. This came up when Romney was asked about a study that challenged his proposals.

""They made an assumption that I would reduce the home mortgage-interest deduction,"" Romney said in an interview with Fortune. ""I will not do that for middle-income taxpayers.""

Romney specifically said he would ""preserve tax preferences for middle-income taxpayers such as homeownership, charitable giving and health care.""

Romney’s problem is that he has set many goals for his plan, and they tend to conflict with each other. It is difficult, for example, to cut rates, keep tax collections the same, and keep the tax burden the same across all income groups.

Briefly put, Romney would lower tax rates across the board and make up the difference by taxing income that isn’t taxed today. This is called broadening the tax base, and the biggest pots of money there are found in the deductions for home mortgages, charitable donations, state and local taxes and employer-paid health insurance benefits.

Romney has said he would change the rules on tax deductions on higher income households, but he hasn’t provided enough details for any analyst to specifically predict the consequences of his ideas.

 The challenge of tinkering with deductions

The Obama campaign backs up its claim by citing the work of the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. The collaboration includes analysts with past ties to both political parties. The Tax Policy Center reported that in order for Romney to keep some of his main revenue and tax rate goals, he would need to eat into the tax deductions enjoyed by some middle-class households.

Does it follow that Romney’s plan would ""take away"" those deductions? William Gale, one of the report’s authors, said one should interpret the study more carefully.

""It is accurate to say that it is not inconsistent with our study to say that those items could be on the block for at least some middle-income earners,"" Gale said. ""But that’s a lot of wiggle room.""

In other words, the ad speaks with more certainty and in more sweeping terms than did the underlying study the campaign cites. Gale’s study did not say that all middle-class households would be affected; it found that those making more money would be. In addition, it did not say the outcome was inevitable. Rather, it found that middle-class taxes would go up if Romney stuck to every other goal in his plan. However, if he was flexible on one of the goals, then the middle class could go untouched.

On the other hand, a study cited by Romney in support of his plan found that the numbers worked when deductions were reduced for households making $100,000 and up. Romney himself has said that would include people who he would characterize as middle class.

Another Tax Policy Center report cited by the campaign cast doubt on a core premise of Romney’s plan. The report did not assess Romney's plan directly but noted that reducing the most widely used deductions might not produce the revenues needed to offset the ones lost through rate cuts.

It also cautioned that many scenarios would raise effective rates on middle-income earners, while giving a tax break to people making more. However, it said the numbers could work if lawmakers in both parties were willing to make enough compromises on what they will and will not tax.

""It is possible to maintain revenues in the face of large marginal tax rate cuts by paring back tax expenditures, but it would be very difficult,"" the report said. ""And the task becomes much harder if another objective is to maintain the progressivity of the federal income tax.""

The report authors acknowledge that there is a huge gap between playing with the theoretical possibilities and dealing with political realities.

Tax code politics

The home mortgage deduction ""is a very popular provision,"" said Stephen Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group focused on government waste and subsidies to the private sector. Ellis said deductions for child care and college tuition enjoy similar broad support.

""President Obama’s campaign ad ignores the context in which those tax breaks would be ‘taken away’,"" Ellis said. ""They are only going to be significantly reduced or eliminated in the context of fundamental tax reform that reduces the tax rates for the same filers.""

Matt Jensen, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, has written in defense of the feasibility of Romney’s plan. He said the Obama ad gets ahead of the process that would take place on Capitol Hill.

""I do not believe Romney would do things that he has explicitly said he would not do,"" Jensen said. ""More likely, he (or Congress, really) would tinker with other aspects of the tax reform plan.""

Romney, Jensen said, would bring certain principles to the tax plan he brings to Congress. The details of how those principles play out cannot be judged today.

We should note that through his running mate, Paul Ryan, Romney has associated himself with a budget plan that would eliminate the American Opportunity tax credit for college tuition. This is not specifically part of the Romney tax plan but it would hit the pocketbooks of some 3 million households, some of whom would be in the middle class. The credit is worth as much as $2,500 for each college student. 
Tuition tax deductions, in contrast to the more valuable tax credits, are also in the tax code. Parents can reduce their taxable income by up to $4,000.

Our ruling

The Obama campaign ad says Romney’s tax plan ""could take away middle-class deductions for child care, mortgages and college tuition.""

Romney has said he would not reduce the mortgage deduction and has promised not to increase taxes on the middle class. However, he has failed to provide enough details for analysts to model what his plan would actually do.

There are reasonable concerns that the numbers in Romney’s plan don’t add up. The ad assumes that to get the numbers right, the worst possible outcomes for the middle class are likely. It says some major deductions could be taken away. 
At PolitiFact, we put the burden of proof on the person speaking to back up his or her claim with evidence. The Obama ad is very specific about which deductions might be at risk. The Romney plan might be unrealistic and intentionally vague, but the Obama campaign is filling in the blanks with specific deductions that would appeal to middle-class moms. Romney hasn't said he intends to take away those deductions. And he's specifically said he won't touch the largest of those deductions, the mortgage deduction for the middle class.

U.S. has more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil, Senate candidate Tommy Thompson says
","
After speaking to the Milwaukee Rotary Club on Sept. 11, 2012, Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson took questions from the audience.

Asked about achieving energy independence, the former Republican governor called for several initiatives, including converting semitrailer trucks and buses so that they can burn compressed natural gas rather than diesel fuel.

After all, Thompson reasoned:

""We have more natural gas, ladies and gentlemen, than Saudi Arabia has oil.""

We do?

It turns out another GOP politician recently preceded Thompson down this road. Let’s see where it’s led them.

Jon Huntsman, the former presidential candidate and Utah governor, also referred to new sources of energy when making the same claim Thompson did during a GOP presidential debate in December 2011. PolitiFact National rated his statement Mostly False, given that it is off based on two of three ways to measure the question.

1. In terms of proved resources -- those likely to be developed under current economic and operating conditions -- Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves are far larger than U.S. natural gas reserves.

2. Saudi Arabia also comes out ahead when considering technically recoverable resources -- those that could be developed using current exploration and production technology, without regard to cost.

3. The U.S. leads Saudi Arabia only when comparing current production levels -- the U.S. produces more natural gas every year than Saudi Arabia produces oil.

Even at that, reserves are more relevant than current production in terms of moving America toward energy independence.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration provided the statistics used by PolitiFact National. We checked back with the agency, which confirmed that each of the three statistics remains true.

Back to Thompson.

Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe said Thompson ""clearly meant to say was that we produce more natural gas in this country every year than Saudi Arabia produces oil.""

We don’t think it is so clear, given that Thompson made no mention of production.

Thompson stated: ""We have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil.""

The U.S. produces more natural gas than Saudi Arabia produces oil. But in terms of reserves -- those that are proved and those that are technically recoverable -- Saudi Arabia leads.

John Burzichelli says Chris Christie is promoting a tax cut plan that only benefits the wealthy
","
Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) is a member of the budget committee, which was left without a witness last week when the state treasurer did not show up to explain some numbers. 
  
Gov. Chris Christie said the Democrats were trying to put on a ""political show"" by calling the treasurer. 
  
Burzichelli said the hearing was not theater. Rather, he said, the governor’s projections for state revenue collections, which are lagging, matter. 
  
""Remember the governor is going around the state talking about [how] we should fund an income tax cut that will affect the higher earners in New Jersey in a higher way than it will the low earners, which will have no benefit for that,"" Burzichelli said in a Sept. 19 interview on NJToday. 
  
Burzichelli then said the Legislature indicated that if Christie’s revenue projections were met, the Democrats would support some sort of tax cut. 
  
""So as the numbers tell us they’re not materializing as he anticipated they would,"" Burzichelli said, ""the ability to do a tax cut for the higher earners become[s] less and less likely and that’s why I think that we have to have these kind of hearings now."" 
  
Is Christie traveling the state touting a tax cut plan that only benefits wealthy residents? 
  
The governor started a tour this summer to push for a tax cut, but Burzichelli unfairly characterizes Christie’s current plan. 
  
In January, Christie proposed a tax cut that would have largely benefited wealthy individuals, but the governor has since embraced a new plan. 
  
Christie’s original plan called for cutting income tax rates 10 percent across-the-board over three years. Under that proposal, residents who earn more -- and pay more in income taxes -- would have saved more, though lower income individuals would still have benefited. 
  
But that plan is off the table. This summer Christie introduced a new proposal that excludes some of the state’s wealthiest residents. 
  
The new plan, based on a proposal from the Senate Democrats, gives homeowners an income tax credit based on the first $10,000 of their property tax bill. 
  
Only homeowners with $400,000 or less in taxable income could qualify for the 10 percent credit, which would be phased in over four years and reach a maximum of $1,000. 
  
This summer, Christie, through his conditional veto power, took a bill that would have raised the top tax rate on millionaires and amended the language to turn it into his new tax cut plan. 
  
Christie then urged the state Legislature to pass that amended legislation in a special session on July 2. They refused, saying it was prudent to wait to see whether the governor’s optimistic revenue projections were met before they committed to any tax cut. 
  
Burzichelli acknowledged that Christie backed off the across-the-board income tax cut plan in his conditional veto, ""if you take that snapshot,"" but he said, ""I think he’s drifted back and forth a couple times."" 
  
We found no evidence to support that. 
  
Both of Christie’s plans also would restore a cut he made in 2010 to the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program that benefits lower income individuals. The plans would have increased the state credit to 25 percent of the federal credit amount, up from 20 percent. 
  
Our ruling 
  
Burzichelli said, ""the governor is going around the state talking about [how] we should fund an income tax cut"" that benefits higher income earners and not lower income earners. 
  
Christie originally proposed an across-the-board income tax cut that would have benefited wealthy individuals more than those with lower-incomes, but he has since backed off that plan. 
  
His new proposal is based on the property tax burden of homeowners and excludes residents with incomes more than $400,000. 
We rate Burzichelli’s statement False.

"['Taxes', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
George Allen says Tim Kaine ""announced he wants to raise taxes on everyone""
","
Republican George Allen’s senate campaign was not mincing words after Thursday’s debate with Democrat Tim Kaine.

""Today, Tim Kaine announced he wants to raise taxes on everyone,"" Allen’s camp said in a statement released an hour after the candidates left the podium.

We looked into the claim. Allen’s campaign backed its statement by pointing to an exchange between Kaine and David Gregory, the moderator of the debate and host of NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""

Gregory asked Kaine to respond to remarks by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, that were secretly recorded at a private fundraiser and released this month by Mother Jones magazine. Romney noted that 47 percent of Americans don’t pay taxes and called them ""victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.""

Kaine called Romney’s comments ""condescending and divisive."" Then, this exchange occurred:

Gregory: ""But let me pin you down on one point. Do you believe that everyone in Virginia should pay something in federal income tax?""

Kaine: ""Well, everyone pays taxes. I mean, the statistics--""

Gregory: ""I’m asking about the federal income tax--""

Kaine: ""I would be open to a proposal that would have some minimum tax level for everyone, but I do insist many of the 47 percent that Gov. Romney was going after pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than he does.""

So Kaine’s comment came in response to a question from Gregory, who was trying to pin him down on taxes. Kaine did not endorse or promote the idea of all Americans paying a minimum federal income tax, he said he would consider it. Almost 75 percent of those who pay no federal income taxes are elderly, have low earnings, or have children at home, according to a 2011 study by the Tax Policy Center.

At other points in the debate, Kaine talked about tax policies he supports. He called for ending the Bush-era tax cuts for individuals and families with adjusted gross incomes of $500,000 or more. Such a move would raise income taxes for 1.2 percent of taxpayers, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics from 2009 filings.    

He also backed ""tax reform that broadens the base and includes more taxpayers, along the lines of the question that David asked earlier, that fills in deductions and exclusions and then reduces tax rates.""

Kaine declined to specify tax loopholes he would be willing to eliminate. He said, ""I think the charitable and mortgage interest deductions are incredibly important policies and, frankly, what I would favor is not battling about each individual deduction, but instead looking at a proposal where there would be an aggregate amount of deductions that you could claim. I think the battling about each individual deduction could take Congress decades.""

Kaine has not provided details on how he would set the limit in total deductions and, in exchange, how low he would be willing to drop tax rates.

Our ruling

Allen claimed that Kaine ""announced he wants to raise taxes on everyone.""

Kaine, in response to a question, said he would be ""open to a proposal that would have some minimum tax level on everyone,"" but did not endorse the concept. If such a policy was enacted, it would not mean that everyone would pay higher income taxes. It would mean that the 47 percent of filers who had no income tax liability would pay something.

Even if you go beyond the debate statement the Allen camp points to and look at Kaine’s other major tax positions -- ending the Bush era cuts for those earning more than $500,000 and eliminating some tax deductions in exchange for lowering rates -- that does not equate to a plan that would raise taxes on everyone.

"['Abortion', 'Georgia', 'Karen Handel']","
Karen Handel lays out case against Obama, others in new book
","
In her new book, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel said she was the target of a left-wing conspiracy that cost Handel her job last year at Susan G. Komen for the Cure, one of the nation’s leading breast cancer prevention organizations.

The main conspirators, Handel wrote, were top officials at Planned Parenthood, who blamed her for Komen’s plans to end funding to their organization. She also claimed the White House was a co-conspirator for a few reasons, such as Handel’s claim that Planned Parenthood’s political arm is a major fundraising source for the Democratic Party. 

The book, ""Planned Bullyhood,"" lays out Handel’s case, including a claim PolitiFact Georgia found interesting. Handel wrote that Planned Parenthood will receive millions of dollars in grants under the federal government’s health care law, which conservatives derisively call ""Obamacare.""

""[M]ost disturbing, is the fact that Obamacare will provide coverage for abortions, despite the president’s commitment that it would not,"" Handel, a Republican, wrote on page 161 of the book.

""Under a rule issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, insurance plans within the state health exchanges are required to cover abortions,"" wrote Handel, the former chairwoman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, who narrowly lost the GOP gubernatorial runoff in 2010.

Handel resigned her position as vice president of policy at Komen earlier this year.

Handel’s statement contained two claims we wanted to fact-check: Does the health care law provide a means for coverage for abortions, and does the law provide such coverage despite President Barack Obama’s commitment that it would not?

Handel surrogates sent us several documents to support her claim. A National Right to Life official also sent us materials on her behalf to argue her statement is accurate.

""I think the gist of what she’s saying is correct,"" said Douglas Johnson, the Washington-based organization’s legislative director.

A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services weblink, though, contradicts Handel’s claim that the law provides coverage for abortions. It says the health care law does not pay for abortions, citing a decades-old federal policy called the Hyde Amendment. Obama signed an executive order in the health care law including language from the amendment stating ""federal funds are not used for abortion services [except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered].""

If a state chooses to, it can use its own funds to cover abortions in certain other circumstances, and states will continue to have this option under the health care law.

The health care law creates exchanges: new organizations designed to create a more organized and competitive market for buying health insurance. Starting in 2014, exchanges will serve primarily individuals buying insurance on their own and small businesses with up to 100 employees, though states can choose to include larger employers in the future.

So, can women get abortions through the exchanges? It depends.

State governments can restrict insurance coverage for abortion in the health care exchanges. Some states have already made plans to do so.

""That’s about the only positive thing that came out of [the health care law],"" Johnson said.

If the state does not bar coverage of abortions, private insurers can offer a plan that covers abortions beyond the federal limitations within an exchange. No private insurer will be forced to cover abortion, our partners at PolitiFact have noted.

The health care law outlines a methodology for states to follow to ensure that no federal funds are used toward coverage for abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment. Any plan that covers abortions beyond Hyde limitations must estimate the actuarial value of such coverage by taking into account the cost of the abortion benefit (valued at $1 or more per enrollee per month).
    
""Before choosing a health plan, consumers will know whether the plan covers these services,"" Erin Shields, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, was quoted as saying in The Huffington Post. ""And if it does, payments will be made into a separate account to ensure no federal dollars fund these services.""

Handel has a different description of how this works.

""The new rule requires that an individual enrolled in one of these plans pay a separate fee of at least one dollar — an abortion surcharge. The abortion surcharge is paid directly to the abortion
fund, going to an account that is separate from the monthly insurance premium. Why two separate accounts? It’s the Obama administration’s cunning and deceptive way to circumvent the prohibition of federal funds going to abortion — and no doubt, Planned Parenthood,"" she wrote.

Johnson said he and other organizations agree with Handel’s interpretation of this funding provision.

As for whether the president had committed to prohibiting abortion coverage in the health care law, that part is clearer. PolitiFact reported that Obama told some conservative Democrats in Congress uneasy about voting for the health care law ""there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation."" He also signed an executive order on March 24, 2010, that ""federal funds are not used for abortion services [except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered].""

Several leading abortion rights organizations were disappointed with the plan to include the Hyde Amendment into the health care law.

Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, put out a statement opposing the deal.

""Planned Parenthood strongly opposes the new abortion language offered by Senator Ben Nelson in the manager's amendment,"" she said. ""[I]t is a sad day when women’s health is traded away for one vote.""

Obama did say and signed an executive order that committed to no federal funding for abortion in the health care law. Handel’s claim that the law will provide coverage for abortions could have been made more precisely. States can bar all plans participating in the state exchanges from covering abortions. That’s not mentioned in Handel’s book.

Basically, abortions can be performed under the health care law, depending on which state you reside in. Because that bit of detail was not mentioned, we rate Handel’s entire claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7BD140>],/factchecks/2012/sep/24/karen-handel/karen-handel-lays-out-case-against-obama-others-ne/

Republican Jewish Coalition says Obama refuses to acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel's capital
","
Editor's note: This item was originally rated Half True. After a panel of editors reconsidered the rating, it was upgraded to Mostly True. 
The Republican Jewish Coalition -- a group backed by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and a few other wealthy GOP donors -- has opened a campaign in battleground states to persuade Jewish voters to turn away from President Obama and support Mitt Romney.

The group said its effort, called ""My Buyer’s Remorse,"" includes a $5 million television ad buy in Ohio (specifically Cleveland), South Florida, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) and Nevada (Las Vegas) that will continue through Nov. 5.

It also includes a direct-mail brochure to voters saying Obama is ""wrong on Israel, wrong on our economy.""

First among the statements answering its question ""Why is Barack Obama wrong for us?"" is that he ""refuses to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.""

Given that the flier is showing up mailboxes in the battleground Buckeye State, PolitiFact Ohio thought it was worth looking into the coalition’s claim.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made a similar claim in a 30-second TV ad that aired in early August 2012. PolitiFact national looked at his claim then. We’ve incorporated some of that research here.

The United States does not formally recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. In the decades-long conflict between Jews and Palestinians, both sides stake a claim on Jerusalem and consider it their capital and a holy site. So even though Jerusalem is the Israeli seat of government and its capital city in every traditional sense, the official position often involves some tip-toeing.

The CIA, on its World Factbook website, lists Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, with a footnote stating ""Israel proclaimed Jerusalem as its capital in 1950, but the U.S., like all other countries, maintains its Embassy in Tel Aviv."" The U.S. Department of State posts similar language.

During the 2008 campaign, candidate Obama declared that ""Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided.""

The remark pleased the pro-Israel lobby, which had been somewhat skeptical of him. But it also served as an early lesson in the delicacy of diplomacy, particularly when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Arab groups took offense, and the campaign had to do some damage control. ""It's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations,"" Obama said in the wake.

For his part, Republican rival John McCain weighed in, agreeing ""Jerusalem is undivided. Jerusalem is the capital.""

""And,"" he added, according to the New York Times, ""we should move our embassy to Jerusalem,"" from Tel Aviv, ""before anything else happens. The subject of Jerusalem itself will be addressed in negotiations by the Israeli government and people.""

Therein lies a long-running point of contention: the location of the U.S. embassy.

As our peers at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker column noted, the Republican Party platform has long included a pledge to move the embassy to Jerusalem. But that’s never happened, even when a Republican was in the White House.

How wide is the gap between campaign rhetoric and official policy? During a press briefing on July 26, 2012, White House spokesman Jay Carney twice dodged the question when asked directly to name the capital of Israel.

He replied only that ""our position hasn’t changed"" and ""you know the answer.""

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland parried similarly at a briefing on March 29, 2012.

""Jerusalem is a permanent-status issue,"" she said. ""It’s got to be resolved through negotiations.""

Those briefings are the evidence the Republican Jewish Coalition pointed to when PolitiFact Ohio asked for backup to its brochure. Romney’s campaign cited the Carney briefing.

The claim in the RJC brochure is accurate. Obama has not formally acknowledged Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
But the claim needs additional information for clarification. 

As a candidate, Obama identified Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But as president since then, he has shied away from making statements that could be perceived as taking sides in the ongoing peace process.

The RJC's brochure portrays that position as a betrayal of an ally. But it's a continuation of the position that previous presidents, both Democrat and Republican, have taken.

Formally, the United States does not recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. Both the state department and CIA note that Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, with a footnote attached, on their websites.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB5E5C0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/24/republican-jewish-coalition/republican-jewish-coalition-says-obama-refuses-ack/
